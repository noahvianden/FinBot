{"title": "Looking for Advice on Safer Strategies?", "selftext": "Hello r/options !\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a relatively new options trader (about 2.5 years of experience) and I'm looking for some advice on what strategies to use once I get some fresh funds in my account next week.\n\nSome background: I started trading options on RH back in 2020. I started just doing CC on stocks like AMC, then expanded to simply buying calls/puts (mostly on SPY) and learned other strategies such as call/put debit/credit spreads. I had some early success in my first year but 2022 was a pretty tough year for me and I net lost money. I've always traded within the range of $5,000 to $15,000 and while I'm currently in the red (my account is under 5k now), I've always only traded with as much money that I can afford to lose. Despite this, I've enjoyed options trading a lot and always want to learn more (I even started reading the book \"Trading Option Greeks\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to present day, and I'm about to have much more capital I can put towards options trading. I just sold a plot of land I bought years ago and I'm going to put some of the money I gained from the sale towards my trading account: $25,000 to be exact.\n\nWhile I  am excited to have $25k to put towards trading...I'm also a little nervous. My past year of options trading was pretty bad with a lot of losses. I did a lot of risky trades with short dated calls or puts (mostly in SPY) and most of them ended in a loss. I'm afraid I'll keep losing my trades if I don't dramatically change my strategy this time around.\n\nSo needless to say, I'm going to try to approach with safer strategies this time. For now, I plan to:\n\n1) go back to selling CC (probably with AMD or a similar stock) and \n\n2) buy SPY LEAPS dated at least 2 years out (2025 or later)\n\nThese are the only two ideas I have so far, and I'm open to more ideas. Are there any other safe(-ish) strategies you would recommend? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*NOTE: I understand no strategy is \"fool proof\" and all of them carry some form of risk (such as CC are risky if the stock prices drops way below what you paid) but in general, I'm just looking for \"safer\" strategies to work with moving forward.", "id": "1155z63", "created_utc": 1676691827.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Stop.

We test various strategies to see whether we can get one working. To \"work\" means to make more money than it loses, and preferably to make a great deal more percentage gain in the course of a year than does SPY or QQQ.\n\nRight now, it sounds like your strategy is to guess wildly and hope for a miracle. What you really need is a way of:\n\n* Defining a concrete financial goal for a trade. This consists of: capital to deploy, a target ($ or % gain), a deadline, and risk (how much $ or % you're willing to lose).\n* Assessing market conditions to determine whether it's safe to trade in your desired time frame.\n* Selecting the best strategy for the given market conditions and time frame. This includes a trade structure, such as a *Short Put Spread* or a *Long Strangle*, or just buying or shorting shares.\n* Finding the right underlying to apply the strategy to, whether an index or an individual company, or perhaps a fund based on $VIX, such as UVXY.\n* Developing a trading plan that includes entry and exit (including scaling in or out) triggering conditions. \n* Methodically recording the results.\n* Methodically analyzing all completed trades to identify patterns and improve future trades. \n\nMost people who trade do so based on hope and hunches. Essentially, they gamble. Others play a statistical game, such as shorting puts at an extremely low Δ, so that their win rate is above 90.00%. The problem with the latter is that while such a strategy will work, it would almost certainly underperform simply buying and holding SPY for one year.\n\nAll of this is to say that most people don't know what to do. They've read parts of books and are familiar with some trade structures, but they have no idea how to find the right underlying to run them on, or whether market conditions justify trading at all or waiting in cash. Figuring these things out is what separates amateurs from professionals.\n\nWhat do the professionals do?\n\nThey work in teams. These teams include statisticians, who often work in R or python, using various well-known financial libraries to analyze quantitative stock and options data to try to develop a strategy with an edge. They also include macroeconomists, to interpret how the macroeconomy is likely to affect the stock market, and financiers, who understand the time value of money and can build quantitative models to show, for instance, how much a company is theoretically worth, e.g. using a DCF or other model. The teams also have financial accountants who understand how to interpret financial statements and detect fraud, and can compare companies against one another, to choose the financially healthiest. Then, there are the database schema designers, software engineers, and testers. Then, there are the traders, who know some combination of all of the above and are very successful at discretionary trading. They understand a wide variety of correlations that aren't written about in books and are closely guarded trade secrets. \n\nIf you truly want to succeed at trading, those teams are your competition. It's not impossible, but it helps to know what you're up against. If you want to play the game successfully, you need to take the time to learn about macroeconomics, finance, financial accounting, risk management, statistics, how the international markets interrelate, which macroeconomic indicators are important to pay attention to, how the bond market can forecast stock market moves, how forex works and what that can tell us, how well futures correlate with market moves the next day, etc. Then, you need to learn the very few aspects of technical analysis that are actually useful. \n\nAll of this comes down to playing an esoteric quantitative game very, very well, where your competition has access to far more data, and has far more knowledge, than you do. This means that you either need to be better, or absolutely cunning. One way of pursuing the latter is to become a master of a niche, such as biotech trading. \n\nFirst, I want to point you to a book that will show you what you need to do: [Trader Consruction Kit](https://www.traderconstructionkit.com/).
