I’m now showing a 200% or so paper loss. I would normally now roll up the 1500 put up to capture more premium but I’m not really comfortable selling a 1700+ put since what goes up must come down —- and I don’t want to be assigned 100 shares at 1700. To be clear the profits from the puts outweigh the paper loss on the call, but I really don’t want to take on any loss I don’t have to. \n\nI feel like all I can do now is hold my positions and wait for theta decay to kick in, but this only works if Tesla doesn’t keep adding 60-100$ per day. Other option is to buy enough shares so if I get assigned I don’t lose my shirt. What do you think?\n\n\nLesson is do NOT sell calls on Tesla. Strangles don’t work - just sell puts and ride it up.

I just realized that I couldn’t sleep knowing TSLA could keep mooning with any positive news. Glad I waited though. The loss was minuscule compared to the worse case scenario or the loss as of Friday. Thanks for all the tips. Will not be selling naked calls on TSLA anymore.
