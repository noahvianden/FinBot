Currently, the main reason Tesla makes a profit isn't because they're killing it with car sales, or anything, its because they're selling EV credits to traditional car makers.  In other words, car makers don't make enough EV cars to appease regulators, so they sell them the EV credits and thats the only reason they made a profit and are growing like they are.  \n\nWhen they sell EV credits, its 100% profit.  In 2020, they sold a billion dollars of straight up free money.  Currently, their profit for 2020 is quite a bit less than 1 billion.  Its also the only reason their profit, between that and stock offerings its basically their entire company.  Once traditional auto makers start producing their own EV's, if they can't offset these profits with car sales, Tesla will have a disastrous time.   Seeing most traditional car makers primed to have someone produced in 2021, I think 2021 could be that year.  \n\nTesla's valuation is insane.  Its mind blowing.  Im not a bear or anything, but this is something everyone needs to consider when holding tesla.

Honestly, right now, a Tesla car has the same feel that an iPhone had back when Apple started making them. A bunch of companies followed with their version of the smartphone, but Apple was the phone to have. Years later they still have a major market share. Apple also gets you stuck to their products with subscriptions/purchases. If the car world goes that way, Tesla will end up doing the same. \n\nTesla also has a lot of infrastructure and are way ahead of the other companies with it. Let’s pretend the government, or industry, makes a rule that all cars require the same port, or need adapters readily available. That means, Ford will likely be paying to use Tesla’s infrastructure, or proprietary ports, anyway. \n\nLastly, they have their energy department that seems like it’s still in its infancy. Maybe wishful thinking, but that’s probably really promising for their future. \n\nI think the only thing that will really hurt Tesla would be another car company figuring out a way to get a lot more mileage out of a charge. However, even then you can use the argument that the typical person doesn’t need 2000 miles per charge anyway, so why spend extra for a car that can go that far. \n\nWith all of that said... do I think they’re a bubble ready to pop at any minute?
