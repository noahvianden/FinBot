{"title": "Bull case for INTC", "selftext": "So as most of you AMD fanbois know Intel don‚Äôt got 7nm. Yes they‚Äôre behind a generation but CPU performance improved by 15-20%. But honestly I could give a shit less. \n\nNormies don‚Äôt look at that. Normies see the ‚Äúintel core‚Äù sticker and they‚Äôre sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren‚Äôt something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is ‚Äúbeating‚Äù Intel. Intel‚Äôs core customers know that and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they‚Äôll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don‚Äôt think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn‚Äôt give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. \n\nDon‚Äôt believe me? \n\nAsk anyone that doesn‚Äôt trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I‚Äôm certain they‚Äôll only recognize one. \n\nAMD just doesn‚Äôt have the same level of brand recognition. \n\nThe recent Tech ‚Äúcrash‚Äù dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. \n\nOn top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don‚Äôt blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don‚Äôt know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it‚Äôs because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they were Tesla‚Äôs first choice and for good reason. \n\nMusk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that ‚Äúanyone relying on Lidar is doomed‚Äù, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1\n\nThe gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we‚Äôre going to have fully self driving cars they‚Äôre going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. \n\nMobileye‚Äôs customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. \n\n\nAccording to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIntel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they‚Äôre currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. \n\nDon‚Äôt trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside\n\nIntel isn‚Äôt a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.\nIf it dips lower I‚Äôm going I‚Äôm going to add leaps on top of my existing position. \n\nDo your own DD-this isn‚Äôt advice-but remember, I‚Äôm right you‚Äôre wrong; say hi to the wife for me.\n\nPositions: INTC 47.5 11/20C", "id": "ipx2lm", "created_utc": 1599714726.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "counterpoint:  regular consumers don't choose what processor they buy.  apple or dell or whoever does.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Intel has way more business than processors.

Go watch Intel's most recent launch of tiger lake. Gamer's Nexus has a great video on it. The marketing team says AMD's \"4700\" >10 times, without mentioning a specific tiger lake part the entire time.\n 1a. Intel has started to discourage using standard benchmarks by leaving out some from their own product launch and by writing blogs discrediting it.\n 1b. They just recently redesigned their classic intel logo. (1/2 brand recognition)\nAll of this smells like fear from their marketing team, fear of AMD. Tiger Lake is good, but AMD's 4000 series APUs are monsters about to take over the laptop market.\n\n 2. They are behind much more than just on manufacturing node. I believe tiger lake is their first 10 nm chip - which has been delayed for years. There are reports that their yields are bad, and if they only just got it over the line of 'profitable' they are much farther behind TSMC which is already working on 5 nm. (INTC 7 nm also delayed)\n2a. Intel needs to move towards more advanced architectures with heterogeneous compute units, die stacking, and better graphics to compete with AMD.\n 2b. AMD's chiplet die design is about improving silicon yields but more importantly paves the way for adding heterogenous (eg graphics in APUs) to accelerate different tasks and for 2.5 or 3d die stacking as energy efficiency continues to improve and core count continues to increase.\n 2c. AMD has a very good relationship with TSMC who is leading in manufacturing node shrinks and even exploring alternative materials beyond silicon. (NVDA got rekt and stuck with Samsung 8 nm for their 3000 series graphics cards).\n3. AMD has much better multithreading and has great graphics for their APUS (intel has crap integrated graphics) which sets them up for the nearest term change in computing we will see:\n 3a.
