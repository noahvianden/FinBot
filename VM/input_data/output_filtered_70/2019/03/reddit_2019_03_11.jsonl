I still meet quite a few people who have never heard of Tesla, and also many who ask \"didn't they go bankrupt?\"  \n  \nNews outlets generally focus on negative news, and for years this is the type of article people read. Forget niche outlets like Elektrek or even Wired, or financial news networks like CNBC. This is the BBC, a normal news outlet like CNN or Sky News that normal people read and watch worldwide.  \n  \nI see the base 3 generating the market awareness they need, but they need to tread more carefully than in the past and not build an overall negative reputation.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I mean...

I think the Street will welcome the actual details here (I think that the overwhelming consensus was that the previous move was a foolish one), and any unease will come from concerns about how poorly this whole thing has been handled.\n\nI don't think that will move the share price at all.   That concern is already priced in IMO.  I think we see a slight bullish trend barring any shocks with Musk's SEC adventures, continuing until earnings.  \n\nThere's a ton of uncertainty with this stock right now.  I think that will prevent any serious spikes in value until the situation is clarified in the Q1 reporting.  At the same time we've been bouncing off of ~275, which is proving to be an incredibly firm support line that's unlikely to fail.  \n\ntldr: no major market reaction either way, stock will be slightly up, everyone's generally treading water and waiting to see what the latest flurry of changes actually means for the company.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Agree 100% and as someone who is typically bullish on TSLA that is exactly how this move makes me feel.

Having employees keen to clear inventory is also good. To be clear, wages cut are also still present, and many staff will still leave.\n\nIt is essentially the same policy, Tesla has just made some sensible and pragmatic concessions.\n\nThe only upside from the original chaotic process is that, a slightly more sensible compromise is now readily accepted by most as a good decision.\n\nTo be clear this was never planned, and this revised more nuanced decision, is way better than the original rash decision to close the stores.\n\nSo Tesla makes quick decisions, makes mistakes, then quickly walks back from the mistakes, they are good at  this as they have had lots of practice.

He had to subsequently correct the tweet.\n\n\nHis first tweet had been “evidently inaccurate”, according to the SEC’s motion, which said that Tesla’s designated Twitter reviewer had later seen the initial tweet “along with the general public” and then “immediately arranged to meet with Musk and draft the correction that Musk tweeted out over four hours later.”\n\nMr Musk, according to a Tesla letter included in the SEC’s motion, said he was drawing on information released in corporate filings and therefore believed it had already been pre-approved. “Mr Musk believed that the substance had already been appropriately vetted, pre-approved, and publicly disseminated,” said an attorney for Tesla in the letter.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr Musk has attacked the civil contempt motion as a sign that “something is broken with SEC oversight”.\n\nAll five SEC commissioners broadly backed last year’s settlements with Mr Musk and Tesla, which required Mr Musk to give up the chairmanship of the company, forced Tesla to draw up rules about his communications, and imposed a $20m fine on the entrepreneur.\n\nWhile Ms Peirce and Mr Roisman supported requiring Tesla to properly oversee Mr Musk’s tweets, they objected to telling the company to hire a lawyer to do so, according to records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nMs Peirce, who has been critical of imposing corporate fines for executive wrongdoing, also objected to the $20m fine the SEC imposed on Tesla.\n\nAn adviser to Ms Peirce declined to comment.
