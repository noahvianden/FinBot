I agree kids shouldn’t worry about their sexuality, which is why explaining that gay people exist and that’s ok makes them NOT worry when they feel differently than the heteronormative culture they’re surrounded with daily.

It’s not fair for you to pigeonhole kids into being straight or gay based on their *non-sexual *behavior as kids since they should be free to figure that out as teenagers when they actually experience sexual urges.\n\nIt’s also unfair to claim that I’m supporting denying the existence of LGBT people. I show my kid books with LGBT families and have explained this to them since they were 3 so to equate not agreeing on children having a sexual identity with denying the existence of LGBT people is not intellectually honest or fair. I definitely didn’t **know** I was *mostly* straight as a kid-I had to go through puberty to figure it all out when I finally found other people sexually attractive. I’m probably a little more bi than most people but I’m mostly straight. So I’m absolutely not against gay people or trans people or bisexual people existing and living the way that makes them happy. Frankly I think it’s absolutely shitty and disgusting for Republicans to be passing bathroom laws somehow linking being trans with being a bathroom pervert.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that I think we should insist that children know they’re straight or gay or trans or bisexual before puberty.

No different than if Mary wants to play with the dump truck and crane all the time. People just wants to make everything cut into some gender norm and it’s honestly ridiculous.

The cornerstone of my position is something more like: There are plenty of people who are okay with trans people, but don’t want to support large corporations pushing a trans lifestyle onto their kids.\n\nNow, this “fact-check,” is the perfect example of what I was talking about when I said people on the left are watching equally biased news. And it might even be more insidious because so much effort goes into dishonest “fact checking.” I can see that you found many articles “debunking” the idea that target is selling tuck friendly swimsuits for kids. It looks like you have many sources there.\n\nI find it curious that all of those sources treat the issue as though target is only selling these products for adults. If you know any children, unlike perhaps the Associated Press, or Snopes, you might know that an child’s XL is an adult XS. Most kids around 13-14 wear “adult sizes.” A lot of kids wear clothes in those sizes in middle school. There are elementary school kids that are large enough to wear “adult” sizes. \n\nI will be happy to admit that Target isn’t filling their children’s section with tuck friendly swimwear. But what is the motivation to carry it at all? According to the ultra MAGA news source Reuters, 1.6 million us adults identify as trans or non binary. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-study-estimates-16-million-us-identify-transgender-2022-06-10/  \n\nThat is roughly 0.5% of the population. I’m going to guess that maybe half of that population actually fits the demographic for any particular style of tuck friendly swimwear?\n\nSo why would that be commercially viable? That can’t be a material problem Target is having in sales, that they are missing out of the 0.25% of the population that wants this kind of swimsuit. Maybe the reasoning isn’t that they need to meet the high demand of adults that want this product. Maybe it’s because… https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/science/transgender-teenagers-national-survey.html according to the New York Times, another super far right Russian misinformation rag, children are identifying as trans at a rate of about three times that of the adult population, a number that has doubled in the past five years, and still rising.\n\nSo when you confidently posted all of these fact checks, did you find that any of these purveyors or truth mentioned that the people Target would be targeting with “adult sized” tuck friendly swimwear would include children? That actually children would be the vast majority of the target demographic. Did they give you a fair and balanced view of what is happening there? Did they really just “fact check” this for you here, so you would know “the truth?” Unlike us crazy right wingers and our Russian misinformation stupid people news?\n\nI will bet in that same swimsuit section of target, you probably can’t find a size large enough to fit the largest 0.5% of the population. They wouldn’t stock those sizes typically because that wouldn’t be commercially viable. You would probably go to a speciality store to find that kind of thing. That’s probably how Target would view tuck friendly swimsuits if… they weren’t trying to signal that they support the exponential rise of…. encouraging your kids to be trans. And if that sounds crazy, let me take the divisive rhetoric out of it. The only reason Target would do this is not to capture an important demographic for sales, it’s pretty obviously a political statement of being on a side of the issue. “We are selling these things, because we are on this side.”\n\nAnd then it’s really simple. Some people just don’t want to shop there if that’s what they are going to do. Personally, I don’t care enough to boycott Target. I don’t care who makes what beer. But since I appreciate a wide variety of news sources, and have a family, and live in the real world, I don’t think that people that do boycott these products, or make up the roughly 50% of our country that votes a certain way are just “crazy” or “stupid” or “deplorable.” I also don’t think that a diet of strictly left wing news and left wing “fact checkers,” is any better than a strict diet of right wing news. Some of this stuff is as bad as Alex Jones. \n\nDidn’t all of these news sources tell us for two years that Trump colluded with Russia to sway the election? Remember the two to four years when the left wing attacked our democracy? Just kidding, they wouldn’t frame it that way. It’s only an attack on our democracy if the right wing does it.
