The sale of a large value community property asset requires written consent by both parties. The name on the title makes no difference. The predominant test is the intent of the lender, but attorneys would trace the source of the funds in order to determine the property's character nonetheless. If it's community property, both parties have control of that property. Small value items don't matter as much. That's not really a huge breach of the fiduciary duty. I can sell a TV without much issue. She might be mad but the court won't necessarily admonish me for it. A car or house on the other hand requires consent. \n\nSource: I'm a divorce attorney in a community property state.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I've never been married so might be a dumb question, but does that mean if someone get's married, half of their net worth automatically belongs to the wife as well? Is there a way to own a house or stock and have total control over it without any of it going to the wife?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Any income derived from before the marriage is still separate property (such as a savings account you funded before getting married), any income received during marriage from investments made prior to marriage remain separate property (e.g., you bought stock before marriage and receive dividends from those stocks even after the date of marriage), and any gifts and bequests remain separate property even if they're received during marriage.\n\nThe money earned from wages and the parties' efforts becomes community property after marriage. So half your salary during marriage is hers, and half her salary is yours. Even if you have a separate bank account to which the funds are not commingled, she retains half an interest in that bank account and vice versa.\n\nThis is just the default rule. Think of it like a prenuptial agreement afforded to you by the state. You can contract to sign a prenuptial agreement that declares otherwise (i.e., all income remains separate property), though if that money is commingled into one account it may become difficult to trace back to its roots. You can also buy a house with a separate property savings account from before marriage and that house will be your sole separate property, but any community funds used to pay for the down-payment, principal or improvements will mean they are to be reimbursed for their community share at divorce. Say you spend $100k on a house with separate property funds but pay $100k during marriage towards the mortgage payments, she's entitled to half of the $100k that went towards the mortgage at separation.\n\nThe rules can be modified. These are just the default rules. It also gets more complicated than this but I'm just explaining the basics. This obviously isn't meant to be construed as legal advice.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "So if I'm understanding it correctly, does that mean the net worth you have pre-marriage in your solo bank account you can keep for yourself. After marriage, any amount of money you gain, even those that go into your solo account, half of that now belongs to your wife? How would it work for those marriages where say the husband ends up extraordinarily rich and then the wife still makes a very humble salary, thinking of like celebrities or successful entrepreneurs pre-fame or late bloomers? Does that mean if both of them have say a $50k net worth, then the husband becomes a multimillionaire, the wife automatically gets to own $1 million?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes. I suggest that clients do not commingle separate funds from before marriage with their post-marital earnings to prevent an issue requiring forensic accounting. It just gets unduly burdensome and costly for parties. But those premarital earnings remain your premarital separate property until marriage, and then any earnings subsequent to the date of marriage are community property. \n\nIf the spouses get married and one becomes rich, half of the successful spouse's earnings are the community property of the other spouse. The policy reasoning behind this is that both parties participated in the marriage. Just because one spouse earned $50k and the other became a millionaire doesn't mean the low earning spouse did nothing to contribute to that million dollars. Maybe they helped to tend to the children, dedicated time to ensure the other party could focus on their business, mended the house, or even helped to grow the business as is the case here. You're looking at it strictly from a \"who earned the money\" perspective. I doubt Ms. Bezos sat on her ass and twiddled her thumbs while Jeff made a fortune. She contributed significant community effort and time to help build Amazon. Sure, there may be exceptions where that is not the case, but if it seems like there is a case of a lazy spouse benefiting from the other spouse's hard work, then the parties can sign onto a postnuptial in order to prevent the unjust enrichment of the lazy spouse.\n\nThere are ways around it. In the Bezos' case, I think the reward was justified. They both built Amazon together. Alternatively, if she was a freeloader he could have protected himself by signing a postnup.\n\nAgain, this is not to be construed as legal advice.
