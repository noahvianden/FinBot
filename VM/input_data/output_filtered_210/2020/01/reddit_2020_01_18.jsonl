One thing to consider is that the Federal reserve and its' Quantitative Easing policy is the reason for the Bull Market.

IMO the housing bubble was not allowed to burst, because the fed jumped in. So there will be a bubble burst.  The amount of corporate debt is very scary and my concern is that No Fed chairman will want to turn off the low interest because when they do imagine the companies that will not be able to refinance their debt?
