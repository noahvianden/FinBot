{"title": "UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me", "selftext": "I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.\n\nEDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 \n\n\" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. \"\n\nPrice action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.\n\nWith ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.\n\n[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \\(high short float\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)\n\nDO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.\n\nTHE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.\n\nExecute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions\n\nTLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar\n\nPositions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls.
