{"title": "Advice for NEW SERIOUS TRADERS", "selftext": "Hey ya'll. First and foremost I'm hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. \n\nWelcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. \n\n1. DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.\n     You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it's just $100.00, it's a great amount to get a feel for the market. \n  \n\n\n2. DD - Due Dilligence \n      This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn't mean, \"Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I'm going to dump my money there.\"\nOr another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so \"get in right now!!! 🚀.\"\nNO. Just no.\nI am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research \"Pumping and Dumping\". (Quick Answer.\nPlease, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  \n\n\n\n3. Set a target price and limit for a stock and don't be GREEDY.\n     As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. \nI know we want more and more, but especially if you're trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:\n\nBAD:\nLet us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it's at $0.30, okay let's sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn't go lower.\n\nSet a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don't look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  \n\n\n\n4. Educate yourself\n     Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF's, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.\n\"Any fool can know. The point is to understand.\" ~ Albert Einstein.\n\n5. Handling losses. \n     If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can't escape, then you shouldn't be trading anymore. You have to learn to handle losses. Every trader goes through a loss or failure as so does every human being excluding trading.  It was your idea to get into trading, so you should be aware of risk consequences.\nLearn to enjoy the whole journey man regardless of what happens. Have fun every step of the way and don't let certain things get to you. I've had my losses in the market and I am glad to say it hasn't bothered me one bit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not to be lived with sadness. \n\nBest of luck to all of us traders and I wish you nothing but success for this brand new year and the years to come. Please feel free to post other pieces of advice as I am fairly new to the stock market as well (been roughly a year).

You don’t need to maintain GTC stop losses on your holdings, just have in your mind (or even better, a spreadsheet) what your targets and stop losses are.\n\nNo matter what the trading timeframe is, those levels should be a function of company valuation, your bankroll size, risk and expected/desired return. \n\nEssentially you want to set stop losses for individual positions such that your total risk for your portfolio never exceeds your total stop loss (I.e. I’m pulling all my money out of the market at 40% losses). \n\nThere are great online resources that say this much better than I can, but I do think risk and position management is important even for buy and hold investing.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TLDR: set some rules and let the market decide. \n\nI usually set stop losses at 10-15% (depending on volatility, sometimes even more) below the current trend line. That gives the stock enough room to breathe should there be a correction, but gets me out of the market goes into free fall or there’s some devastatingly bad news for the company. I then update these periodically to make sure I’m within that 10-15% window. Doesn’t really tell you when to sell, but at least takes the emotional weight out of it if the price starts tanking. The risk here is automatically selling at the bottom, but if you’re careful about your cutoffs that rarely happens, and if that bottom is in the green, who cares, you’re still cashing out with a profit. \n\nAnother approach is to trim a bit off the top whenever your gains exceed a certain percentage. For example, every 20% gain you sell enough to convert 10% of those gains into cash. This approach only works well if you have a lot of shares, unfortunately. If you only have two shares you can’t sell 10% unless you’re dealing with fractional shares.\n\nOne final method, similar to the last but slightly different, is to recoup your principle investment once you’ve made a certain amount of gains. If you have two shares and you make 100% gains, just sell one of them. Then you’re back at your original buy in, but basically playing with free money, so you can’t lose anything. I did this with TSLA and literally don’t care where the price goes from here. Tie in the stop loss approach I mentioned at the top and I basically exit whenever the price tanks, securing those profits.\n\nYou should be able to set up all of these to trigger automatically once those percentages have been crossed. \n\n*Not financial advice, just some shit strategy I was told by some rando on Reddit who’s been in the game a while and likes expensive watches.

This is how to call a TV host out on their hypocrisy. Ever since this interview I've never listened to Cramer. The Daily Show exposed a lot of hypocrisy and terrible media, and I wish it had more impact than it did.
