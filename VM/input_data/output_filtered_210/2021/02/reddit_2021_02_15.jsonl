{"title": "AMC Blockbuster DD: The Sequel", "selftext": "**Disclaimer: None of the below is investment advice. Do not make any investment decisions based on the whatever I post online or say.**\n\nEDIT: ***There's a tl;dr at the beginning of Fundamentals and Mementals sections.***\n\n## EDIT: YOU DEGENERATES CAN'T READ SO I'LL SAY IT HERE. POSITIONS = 15,000 SHARES AT $2.4\n\n[my positions](https://preview.redd.it/lbvq40i68qh61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed321d66832747606d1e081ef2e897ec20248283)\n\n*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.\n\nThis sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \\- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.\n\nI'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.\n\nFinally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\n**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**\n\nOnto the details:\n\nLet's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome share prices for your pleasure and education:\n\n[chart from IBKR](https://preview.redd.it/1x6u00gl0qh61.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d6a517d3b01e3f2a85380e6d2b058d160fb5335)\n\n*again, the chart I uploaded to reddit doesn't show up on my end, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/VwK58BR \n\n**Highlights:**\n\nMar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end\n\nJan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end\n\nDec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end\n\nMarch 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end\n\nAug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)\n\nSept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)\n\nJuly 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShares dilution from 2020 onwards:\n\n* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B\n* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B\n* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares\n* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)\n\nNote: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the following sites:\n\n* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)\n* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)\n* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)\n* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)\n* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)\n\nFloat is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.\n\nBtw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort interest:\n\nAccording to these sites the short interest ranges from:\n\n* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)\n* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)\n* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)\n* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)\n\n37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.\n\nIf anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.\n\n**Tickets, sales, customers:**\n\n2019 = 356m consumers\n\n2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)\n\n*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh \n\nIt appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.\n\n**Competition:**\n\n2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.\n\nNon-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.\n\nCurrent (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.\n\n**Ops:**\n\n2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.\n\n26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.\n\nA lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e](https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e)\n\n*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 \n\nIt seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.\n\n*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*\n\nNow, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nBetween 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.\n\nCapital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.\n\nIt appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.\n\n**Debt:**\n\n2019 = $4.8bn\n\n2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.\n\n**Comparables:**\n\nPrice to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:\n\nAMC -0.26 / 1.16\n\nMSGE 0.85 / 0.63\n\nCNK 2.41 / 3.12\n\nIMAX 3.34 / 3.54\n\nAMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Mementals:\n\n**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**\n\nIf we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.\n\nWhat I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:\n\n\\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.\n\n\\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.\n\n\\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.\n\n\\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.\n\n\\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.\n\n\\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.\n\n\\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.\n\n\\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.\n\n\\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.\n\nI believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally, let me address some common comments:**\n\n\\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?\n\nYou've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.\n\nAbsolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?\n\nIf streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?\n\nAnother reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going\n\nNoone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.\n\nYou are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)\n\nLook at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?\n\nWe are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.\n\n\\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit\n\n\\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer: None of the above is investment advice.
