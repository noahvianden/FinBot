{"title": "Questions on Short Float, Short Ladder Attacks and Short Squeeze.", "selftext": "Here are the main questions many have. Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!\n\n#**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares\n- From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9.\n- From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.\n\n- From u/ whateverathrowaway00: \nhttp://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and \nhttps://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf\nThe documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur.\nThe SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. That’s why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didn’t need a phone call. They’re not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. They’re doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.\n\n\n#**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't.\n- From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create.\n- From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs\n\n\n#**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.\n\n- From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n#**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**\n\n\n#**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n\n#**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GME’s float. Why haven’t we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is “at what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover?” The answer is that we don’t know, but it’s only a matter of time.\n\n#**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.\n\n#**Q8) Isn’t it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY.\nPlus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?\n\n#**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**\n\n#**Q10) (from others) I’m trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed.\n- From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.\n\n#**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- An insane amount of deception has been in the works for a long time: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n- Shit's about to get crazy: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/\n\n- Why the squeeze hasn't happened:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ladv7v/gme_will_squeeze_and_heres_the_10_reasons_why_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n- Shorts covering:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lae73m/psa_remember_shorts_have_two_days_to_deliver_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n\n#**Q12) I've read a couple of posts that casually mention the possibility that GameStop could issue more shares, pulling in a bunch of money and essentially letting the shorts off the hook. Can GameStop do that? If so, why the hell wouldn’t they?**\n\n\n#**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us 🦍 and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**\n\n\n#**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldn’t be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**\n\n----\n\n\nI really want this to be helpful for everyone.
