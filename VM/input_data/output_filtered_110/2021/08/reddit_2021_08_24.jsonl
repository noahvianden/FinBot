{"title": "Why BABA is going much higher.", "selftext": "Between BlackRock, StateStreet, and PriceT, 120M shares of BABA was sold last quarter. \n\nBlackRock in an article stated that this cycle of regulation will last a couple years and they are staying away from China Tech “for a little while longer” \n\n“In tech, Liu said the big companies' earnings are affected not just by regulation but also competition. She noted new trends in e-commerce have prompted companies to invest more in infrastructure, which has a lower initial return on investment.\n\nAs a result, BlackRock plans to \"stay a little bit away from the large, dominant platforms for a little bit longer,\" Liu said.”\n\nWell this article was written in June and Baba has come down a lot more since. We know that huge institutions like BlackRock will not give you a heads up as they start accumulating. But you will know when there are huge volume spikes. \n\nFast forward to today. BABA on Monday made a fresh 52 week low then proceeded to end up green on MASSIVE volume. The volume continues in the Hong Kong markets and the volume is continuing today. I believe the quarterly reports from JD and PDD have shown the institutions the regulations are not affecting results as bad as they thought and are now in the process of reacquiring those 120M shares.\n\nThis is an opportunity of a lifetime.", "id": "pasf1n", "created_utc": 1629827474.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|71|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwzmjz/sens_32_shorted_can_be_a_10x_candidate_from_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw0hif/huya_possibly_70_short_and_half_value_in_cash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqphot/bet_on_life_bet_on_surface_oncology/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pasf1n/why_baba_is_going_much_higher/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2klao/invest_in_a_company_that_will_help_cure_all/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5n5vx/surface_oncology_the_cheapest_biotech_around/) \n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/HaveADrinkOnMeCosby, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://ibb.co/Dpz3mt1", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Idk about opportunity of a lifetime but it’s certainly a decent entry point if you can stomach potential losses.
