(Vets typically don’t have a wide variety of stocks on hand, and understandably, many owners prefer things to be shipped to their home rather than having to come back for them in a few days time) This is apparently taking a lot of sales away from local vets, so Chewy is getting a piece of the pie from vets across the country, and aren’t just competing amongst other brick and mortar pet stores. They also recently started free online vet consultations for their autoship subscribers, so I imagine they’ll be taking even more businesses away from vets in the future.

{"title": "$SNDL 1$ Floor Established", "selftext": "Hey Peeps,\n\nMany of you are probably looking at today's price action as a WTF. I get it. I've been watching it periodically in ThinkorSwim. If you've been watching the level 2 you see the obnoxious bids / asks sitting between 1 and 1.02. Over150M (near 50% volume) shares traded hands at these prices.If you are checking the borrow rates [here](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/sndl), then you know the cost to borrow has gotten a bit more expensive as the day went on.\n\nPersonally I think this looks a lot like we have a solid $1 floor as the price line was tried 3 solid times, each time we broke the $1 line we saw a massive bid back up to $1. The shorts on SNDL don't have a lot of days to cover as shown [here](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=sndl&submit=Short+Quote). Short interest still looks around 15%. Nothing crazy, but has potential given any hype news.\n\nThe fact that the $1 floor seems to have held solidly is fantastic. Honestly I'm surprised. It has held the up channel very very well. Because of the lack of volatility (IV) you may have saw your options slightly decrease in value today. To me it was a good day to roll out my options. I took gains from the Jan 11 1.5s and rolled them into the Jan 18 1.5s on the drops near $1. I still don't meet the minimum for the side bar but I'm now the proud owner of 225 Jan 18 1.5 calls (just over 2k at my .09125 cost basis).\n\nThe rocket fuel here is the push towards Federal Legalization. Keep that in mind. I noticed a number of calls being written for $2 and $3 strikes today at the 18th expiration. That's a big move to hit that. I saw the $9 calls being written for Jul 16th. Again these are big moves, I'd stay modest in the 1$ - $2 range to be realistic.\n\nEdit: Amazon is onboard https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amazon-backs-federal-bill-to-legalize-marijuana-.html", "id": "nq36v4", "created_utc": 1622577906.0, "score": 334, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Yay!\n\nPS: *remembers his 895 shares at $1.87*", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "man im stuck with 1800@$1.83", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "2200 @ 2.07 🙃", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh God I'm glad no one can one up you on this on\n\nPS: We will come back to get you in about an eon", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Federal legalization is inevitable.
