{"title": "8-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly market Analysis", "selftext": " Well today a lot of people realize they had a plan for “what if JPOW rallies us 3% to 430” but not many of us had a “what if JPOW tanks us 3% and we see 405 today?”\n\nToday will probably go down as one of the wildest trading days ive seen in a while. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5db8q2ul4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e1df8a25dda33f5c1b30aa2d06e57b3248072d\n\nThat 10am candle opened dropped nearly $4… recovered $4 almost and then started the sell off with a bigger sell off after it. That candle was even more dramatic then most FOMC moves are. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d8stolul4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc4b7f14c17542e6977d483c4a7170495f4818f9\n\nToday we closed out at almost 102 mil volume which is about 160% of the 30day average. This is a massive volume day and is the highest volume since June 30th which was 112mil. Usually we consider large volume days to be bearish days. So this type of volume really could be signaling something much bigger is coming downside wise. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw9j9l3vl4k91.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=90f229817d1a67bd2c881d86c78b7831dba2798b\n\nOkay so where are we at? \n\nAs of this morning I was working under the assumption of us trading within that blue downward channel, however, as you can see we broke through that end of day today. \n\nThe big things that happen is we broke back through the daily 8, 200, 20, 100 and 50ema… so we now have closed below all of those levels. Being back below all the EMAs hasn’t happened since the lows of July. \n\nWe broke through key level support of 417.5 and from there we bounced and closed right on the next level support of 405.2. I mentioned we should start playing level to level. So breaking 417.5 we should have expected 405.2 (of course not in the same day… ) but if and when we break and close below 405.2 I will look for 391 as our next major support for a bounce. However, if we double bottom at 405.2 we could start back toward 417.5.\n\nThe daily candle is a massive bearish engulfing candle that not only engulfed the previous days candle but the whole week and 62% of this whole months trading range.\n\nWe did not completely fill the 421.22 gap this morning as we only reached 419.96 before we saw the major downturn at 10am. The next gap below is down to 378.57.\n\nSo something interesting that I mentioned earlier this week is that…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zduc1apvl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=861bc3d5a9f26ff6bd12ef218d7149f4197c4166\n\nIf we are assuming August 16th and 431.73 is the ultimate top of the bear market rally we should look for 374.3 and September 16th as the next possible bottom. However we could see a range anywhere from 388.5 to 362.6. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o29oqibwl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0375e1d20d2c0aa7246d10bb19fbb24a0fccb47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvlq9nvwl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3067f40164283c9858da918d847b749754a4e4f\n\nFun fact… Cpi is on September 13th too and the next FOMC meeting is September 20th. There is a potential that we could see the next big bear market sell off and it could lead us right into CPI/ FOMC or those could be what takes us to the bottom. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xhpn0exl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=548310d293b9559d62432aa15cc20740e99d65b0\n\nInterestingly enough on SPY weekly we did not break through the 11 week long bull channel. We actually bounce just short of support which woulda been right at the weekly 100ema of 404.2. However, unless SPY plans to open over 409.91 (1.1% green) and never lose that support all week we will see that level broken on Monday. That would be the confirmation we need to suspect the next level down. \n\nMajor supports to watch next week-\n\n405.2 (daily level) -> 404.2 (weekly 100ema) -> 390 (weekly and daily support level) \n\nMajor resistance to watch next week-\n\n407.5 (daily 50ema) -> 412.7 (weekly resistance level) -> 417.5 (daily resistance level)\n\nMy overall thoughts are if we close below 405 on Monday that its safe to assume we see 390 before 417.5 again. If we hold 405 then we might try and retake 417.5 first. The most likely scenario for Monday is an “inside day” where we trade within the previous days range and then Tuesday make a big move. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vej1lzxl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb7be6a5ca875e672678251a16358203a3acc31\n\nFutures daily is the same story we broken through all the levels and closed back below all the EMAs for first time since the lows of July. \n\nKey support- 4020 -> 3922 -> 3865\n\nKey resistance- 4075 -> 4100 -> 4130 -> 4157\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i47vemmyl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68bceb205336886e032e90027b2340d50922101e\n\nFutures weekly actually did hit the 11 week long bull support line and did as of right now break the weekly 100ema of 4050. Again unless futures opens big green Monday and hold 4092 all day long and week long we will be through support which should signify a confirmed downward move towards 3906.\n\nKey weekly support- 3906\n\nKey weekly resistance- 4112\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cj9bdv9zl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=943e85f54a32d328d7bb51b199bea09b3d2bc9ee\n\nA lot going on here with Apple so they closed with about 79mil volume which is the largest volume day since August 17th (the peak). Apple also had the reddest close since June 16th (the bottom). \n\nI was watching a potential black bull channel within the bigger red bull channel but we fell through that support. I was also watching a blue bear channel that we also fell through that support. \n\nSo lets clean up this chart. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgxi83xzl4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f402fb3dcb39f51a1be46f7601ea7d27382e43a\n\nAs of right now the “potential” bull channel resistance using the June 8th and August 17th high with the Low of June 16th and June 30th for support we have a potential down side for Friday at 158 for Apple. \n\nApple also closed back below its Daily 8 and 20ema. Apple almost filled its upped gap leaving about 25 cents there (that could be considered filled tho) and it also filled its lower gap today. The next gap on apple is at 157.64 and should be a potential target for next week. \n\nIf we start to breakout upward we will look to that blue resistance line now established for rejection. \n\nKey daily support- 163.2 -> 160.8 -> 158.1 -> 155.5\n\nKey daily resistance- 164.9 -> 167.5 -> 168.7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xgej7o0m4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe08854cf31bf1ee1e3a52f9e145067225e04cc\n\nThe apple weekly actually gives a pretty good breakdown of where things are headed. \n\nThe weekly gap is almost filled and would be okay to go unfilled the rest of the way. From here we should test the red bull channel support at 154 next week. Once we would lose 154 it should a clear down side to 120s/ 130s. \n\nKey weekly support- 161 -> 157.5 -> 154.1\n\nKey weekly resistance- 166.5 -> 172.2 -> 176.2\n\nI actually really like Apple for a level to level play also here using these weekly levels. So once 161 breaks look for 157.4. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6vluda1m4k91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b498a54e2ca44011a7dbf44361e4ade187439b8a\n\nThe VIX is the true winner today with a crazy 17.26% day. The VIX broke through all the major resistance levels and closed back in the 25.5 to 34.7 zone. If this can hold this level on Monday I would look for VIX to take us to 34.7 and eventually take SPY back to 360s/370s. \n\nHowever, if VIX were to lose 25.5 on Monday or any day next week then we will look for it to end up back in the green zone form 18.7 to 25.5.\n\nSo you guys are probably asking whats the play? What would I do? Am I long or short on anything? \n\nWell honestly I wouldn’t open or hold anything after a massive -3.4% day like this. You have to think about it like this… I know many of you were in 30 and 60dte puts and I know many of those were up 200-500% depending on when you opened it. \n\nWould you rather close out a 200% gainer and open a new position (of the same size) for pretty much free (since your win paid for it) or would you rather hold till Monday and take the chance the markets slap the bear and we get a 3% green day and erase everything that happened today? You HAVE to secure profits. You can not let profits like that slip away. \n\nWe are meeting the criteria that makes me think we are going to see the next major sell off. The one thing that will continue to hold me up is “what is the catalyst for the sell off to continue?” Markets have known all of this info for months now and now all of a sudden they wanna act shocked? Is this just a massive over reaction and now we rally till CPI actually gives us a selling point followed by FOMC or is this actually the start of the next sell off? \n\nI am not someone who enjoys swings because I feel like my timing is never quite there (yes I know I can predict things pretty well but seems like whenever I take a long swing im early or way late…). The better play here is to wait for bottom and then play the rise back up with calls. Market will naturally and way more aggressively rise. Markets need a reason to sell off though. \n\nBut the play I would consider is VIX >$25, SPY < $405 and Apple < $163 on Monday at market close and we should expect to see VIX 30, SPY $390 and Apple $155-158 within the next week or two. \n\n10% Challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3aucqxy1m4k91.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb5cc962ba2d74bd8d8152b9ebccdd55505a863f\n\nThis week for me felt like one of those weeks where you just beat yourself. I had two trades this week that I let go red. I also had two trades that TOS screwed me on (one was a 15% stop limit that didn’t fill and the other was a 8% winner then filled at -1%). Thats four winners I should have had this week (not excuses but that’s how I look at it). Had I gotten those 4 winners (2 definitely my fault) I would have ended up with 88% win rate and at least $1000 this week. I beat myself this week is how I see it. \n\nBut next week is a new week and Monday is a new day to do better. \n\nThis market is chewing up and spitting people out left and right. This market is all about capital preservation. We have to think long term. 2022 is probably the hardest market any of us will trade in and probably the hardest day trading we will do for the rest of our careers. If you can survive 2022 profitable or not… but just don’t capitulate out… you will someday be hella prosperous. This is a marathon not a sprint! \n\nYoutube will be up late tonight.. having a movie night with the kiddos! Hope you guys have a great weekend.", "id": "wyku40", "created_utc": 1661549451.0, "score": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| |

Yet, it took a whole year for the market to finally wake up and react. The market didn't immediately drop, it was not forward looking, it just started to drill gradually based on nothing new until Powell pivoted.\n\nAnd all the reasons exist for the market to sell off right now. The recession has not been priced in, EPS and bad earnings/forward guidance have not been priced in, effects of QT and interest rate hikes still yet to be felt. Housing market is in shambles.
