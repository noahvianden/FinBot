It's not a good metric. Sales growth and cash flow are much better. P/E is better for stable, mature businesses without huge runways ahead of them.\n\nWhy? Because it's artificial. The company is deliberately plowing every dollar into growing the company. If Tesla wasn't building 3 factories at the same time and expanding the other ones they'd show a much larger profit. I think the only reason they even bothered to show a profit at all was because they were trying to qualify for S&P 500 inclusion.\n\nI always use Amazon as an example of the same thing.

How many people missed out on one of the great investments because they were valuing it incorrectly? Jeff Bezos had better places for that cash flow than sending it to the bottom line as profit.

They want to change the world by transitioning it to a sustainable future. The Alien Dreadnought is coming online in China. GigaBerlin and Austin are making major progress. Tesla Semis and Cybertrucks aren't online yet.\n\nThey've had huge success with energy storage in Australia and have contracts for South Australia, UK, Dubai, and California. Their Autobidder software is printing them money. Their battery day is likely to either achieve ~400W/hr or come close to it. Supposedly, they're close to L5 autonomy and may be away from achieving it by at most another year.\n\nThey're production constricted for their power packs, because demand is greater than supply. They are selling every single car they're making and they made a profit in the middle of a black swan event despite having one of their core American plants shut down and then reduced to 30% capacity.\n\nAnd with the Chinese market just unlocked, their sales number in Q3 and Q4 will be quite enlightening via China.\n\nFinally, and *most* importantly. TSLA opened at 442.64 at 9:30a today, and closed at 514.75 by the end of extended hours. The stock went up 72 dollars in a day. A solid 16% gain, and people are going to be buying it in droves to get in on the next run up to 2-4k range per share.\n\nI suspect with all of the above, the stock will break 7-800 by battery day and reach or cross 1k by end of September. Ark investment thinks that their analysis of 7k/share (pre-split) is still valid and are holding on that. If TSLA achieves L5 by end of the year to mid year next, they'll go all in on RoboTaxis. Which is going to eat into Uber and Lyft's market considerably. If L5 autonomy is achieved, you won't need drivers for grubhub or Uber eats style businesses. Customers would be able to directly interact with food services with everything becoming seamless through the car.\n\nAs all these items come online, their stock is going to skyrocket higher and higher. 7k might end up becoming an *average* marker with beyond 7k becoming the next peak.\n\nBut fundamentally, once the stock crosses the ~3k boundary, it becomes out of reach but the biggest hedge funds and banks, which tend to want to short stock than hold them. Equally, 3k and beyond means individual investors can't get in. This means that TSLA will *have* to split their stock again and again and again.\n\nNormally, a company splitting their stock could be viewed negatively because of share dilution, but there's enough evidence to the contrary that with TSLA, it won't matter. The technology, science, software, and vertical integration advantage backed by a philosophy of reinvesting most of the money made back into company and r&d means that they'll become like Nvidia, where they are competing with themselves and not their competition in the market. Ark thinks TSLA's around 3-4 years ahead with their software stack from rest of the automakers, and their battery tech is around the same time scale too.\n\nAnd with the insane demand to be part of the company which is basically uprooting every market it enters via evolutionary changes, there's little that can stop their momentum.\n\nAnd in closing, Elon has said on Twitter that he's got ideas for an eVTOL already, that he *really* wants to do that, but his brain will melt if he tries. Between Tesla, SpaceX, Boring, OpenAI, and Neuralink he's pretty capped. He also said that they'll achieve 500W/kg in 3-4 years. Electric jets are only possible once battery tech crosses ~450W/kg. Tesla will very much likely enter that market 2025-2027, and their energy business will likely overtake their auto business.\n\nSo, they'll have to keep splitting their stock over time. 10 shares becomes 50, then 250, then 1250, then 6250. ***I AM ASSUMING A 5:1 SPLIT EACH TIME, I COULD BE WRONG BUT I'M ROLLING WITH IT.***\n\nPoint is, after just 3 more 5:1 splits, IF the stock still goes up to 5k a share because of all their staggering levels of disruption, you'd be sitting on a multi-million dollar investment. It becomes a long term golden egg. So don't sell your pre-split holdings. It's a 10 year lock and key stock. Only dip into it if you need money for life alerting events. Sell around it or expand it.\n\n*One other point. For *many* Tesla has become an idea of the future promised in the 90s that 2000 and 2010 would be. For *many*, they're now betting on that. You look at other ICE car makers and they're starting to put out EVs, but they're still token EVs. They're business decisions being made for them in a way that doesn't cannibalize their ICE supply chain. People don't want to perpetuate and oil and ICE future. They want an EV future with cars that drive themselves and to live in an era where in the next 10-25 years flying cars are a normality. The fact that Tesla can keep raising money despite burning **so much** of it constantly should tell you exactly how the market and people feel about the company.
