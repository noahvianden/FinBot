That can be repackaged to say, “the time is right when the price is right”, for long term holders. Even for intermediate holders, fundamentals inform direction in the event of mean reversion. \n\nRegarding TA… I can’t say this enough: TA is a report of demand *based on best available information at the time*. This is why it can be useful, but can also be garbage. New information moves demand. Absent new information, patterns can have value. Relying on TA alone is dangerous, because it ignores what is likely to happen if new information is introduced.

Another one in 2008. Then we had 2020 and you have smaller ones along the way like 1990 and 2016. There's one thing that sabotages so many of you. The need to feel like you're fitting in. The need to feel like you're right. The need to feel like you're in a group. These are all absolutely terrible traits if you're going to be a trader. Most of the successful traders I have met look at people like Cannon fodder. They are things to be used. What they think or believe is irrelevant. Sometimes they don't mind going with the trend other times they don't but at all times they don't care in the slightest what's popular unless there is potential to make money. \n\nI'll give you a current example. The mouth breathers are all about shorting bonds. They don't tell you what other trades they have on the flip side of that. Lot of media attention on short bonds. That's one of the dumbest trade someone with a retail account could make. Look at the monthly chart on the ZT and ZB futures. Look at TLT even. You're bumping into financial crisis numbers like the peak before the 2008 drop so you're talking decade lows. You really want to short that? 😂\n\nBuying bonds Hand over fist is unpopular, but it's one of the things that people should be doing. The United States economy cannot function in the long-term with rates this high. That means if you load up on bonds, even if you have the timing off which you probably will. The odds of outperformance over the next 60 months from this price level are very high.. The best risk to reward is in the 3-month and the 6 month if you buy direct bills but the only ETF product worth trading is TLT and it's not on the end of the curve you really want but it should still work because normally when the Fed begins to cut rates it's extremely aggressive. In fact the best risk to reward way I can think of to play that is shorting the January 2025 $100 puts. Great money in those. It goes on margin what you're not even really doing much with. Run one of those contracts for every 50,000 of capital you have or so. It's free money. If things go sideways and you get assigned which is always a risk. Your assignment cost would be down about $91 a share.
