{"title": "Tesla on Pace for a Blowout Q2", "selftext": "https://twitter.com/vincent13031925/status/1392001012131524611?s=19\n\n\nTesla delivered a record number of cars out of it's Shanghai Factory in April.\n\nThey delivered over 40,000 cars in April and are continuing to increase their production ramp.\n\nFremont delivered over 100,000 cars in Q1 and they did not produce any Model S or Model X vehicles due to parts shortages. They are set to begin deliveries for the Model S in Q2 so their production out of Fremont should be higher than Q1 and with Tesla now producing over 40k a month in Shanghai they could conservatively at this pace reach north of 225k in Q2. They might be significantly higher than 225 with them already at 40k out of Shanghai the first month of the quarter.\n\nEstimates seem to be in the 195-205k range.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Seems the information was misinterpreted and the actual numbers were about 25k out of Shanghai in April. The factory had shutdowns for 2 weeks. I still think this is bullish that they were able to pump out 25k in the month of April with factory shut downs for 2 weeks. They should clear 100k easily in the quarter out of Shanghai and 100k easily out of Fremont. Estimate for the quarter now 210k and potentially more depending on how much they can ramp Shanghai in May and June.\n\n\nEdit a second time:\n\nIt's actually unclear which version is accurate at this point as crazy as that sounds.

As in, \"you either go out and do something to support yourself, or you starve\" harsh and cruel.  It all starts with allowing people/institutions to fail instead of propping them up indefinitely.  I would eliminate almost all corporate subsidies/bailouts; if you aren't profitable get fucked, you deserve to go bankrupt.  Then I'd reduce unemployment benefits to below minimum wage (if they aren't there's no motivation to work), and then start agressively slashing government budgets.  There's no reason for half of the government jobs to even exist, and the government is just a bloated, slow, money sucking monstrosity (just look at their budgets relative to GDP over the last 100 years, it's disgusting how large we've let the government get) that is WAY too involved in every aspect of our life.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "We have inflation, not high inflation, or hyper inflation.
