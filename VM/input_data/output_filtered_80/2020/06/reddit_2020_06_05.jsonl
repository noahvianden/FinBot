He’s a stoner, so he’d _always_ be driving down to the store for a soda. So, 7 times a week he’d buy, on average, a $5 or $10 ticket. Let’s say $7 on tickets, on average. This is quite conservative as I’ve seen him blow $30+ on tickets on Fridays after he got paid. \n\n7x7 = $49. Let’s call it $50. \n\nThere’s 52 weeks in a year, and before he hit his “big win”, he’d been doing it for around 2 years. \n\n2 x 52 x 50 = $5200 \n\nOne day when he went to the store, he bought a ticket and waddaya know, he won $5000. It was like he saw Jesus Christ with his own eyes. He could have called it quits right? Nope. Again, for another year, he started going harder because he finally “figured out the process”. Let’s say he spent $10 on average. \n\n7 x 10 x 52 = $3640\n\nSo, a conservative representation of his YTD spending on tickets is around $5900 + $3640 - $5000 = $4540. This is a guy who works construction and makes just enough to cover rent, gas, food, and pot expenses. We’ll round it down to $4000 to include some of the $5 and $10 winners.
