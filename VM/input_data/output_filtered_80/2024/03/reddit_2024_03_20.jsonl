{"title": "Intel awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act grants, with billions more in loans available", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html\n\nThe White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil.\n\nIntel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday.\n\nThe money will help ‚Äúleading-edge semiconductors made in the United States‚Äù keep ‚ÄúAmerica in the driver‚Äôs seat of innovation,‚Äù U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change.\n\nIntel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world‚Äôs PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm.\n\nEven with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan‚Äôs TSMC for the manufacturing of the device.\n\nTSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world‚Äôs fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan.\n\nThat‚Äôs a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan.\n\nIntel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026.\n\nIntel‚Äôs Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing.\n\nThe Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters.\n\n‚ÄúGo drive by the Ohio site,‚Äù Gelsinger said. ‚ÄúThere are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.‚Äù\n\nGlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. TSMC is expected to receive CHIPS Act funds for a fab in Arizona that will be used for Apple and AMD chips.", "id": "1bjd2an", "created_utc": 1710940226.0, "score": 471, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "Is this pretty much already priced in?", "score": 120, "replies": [{"body": "Probably get a little transient bump but yeah, I'd say so.¬†", "score": 40, "replies": []}, {"body": "seems like it", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "99.9% of the time the answer is yes\n\nIts a big club and we ain't in it", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Always...", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "No. Intel janked down on Jan 26 and trended downward/sidways since then.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Intel is about to announce exec bonuses of $8 billion.", "score": 257, "replies": [{"body": "ü§´", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "I‚Äôm sure the government implemented some spending obligations", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thats cute.", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "It is not a freaking bailout.

It went on my watchlist when Nancy Pelosi bought it before the last correction and shortly before the CHIPS act was approved. She was down for awhile, but she is ahead if she is still holding. I think MU will be beneficiaries of CHIPS, and will get a bump when that happens.\n\nBut, I've been trying to figure out who the AI memory winners for the last year, and I think SK Hynix will be producing memory for [NVDA's Blackwell beast of a platform.](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96971/sk-hynix-begins-volume-production-of-hbm3e-ready-for-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-b200-ai-gpu/index.html) I can't buy them, but can get exposure from the EWY Korean ETF. But, I don't own that ETF now. \n\nIf Blackwell ships at scale and at spec without major problems or delays by next year, Blackwell should be a major threat to everyone in the AI ecosystem that isn't a part of the NVDA/Blackwell supply chain. Everyone is looking for stocks that are undervalued with secular growth upside, but right now, I'm at a loss about which of those companies are undervalued relative to NVDA, and which of those companies will outperform NVDA over a 5-year horizon.\n\nThis is a tall order, as you can make five speculative bets, correctly guess one that outperforms NVDA, and still be behind buying-and-holding NVDA. Also, in previous technological transformation cycles, hardware stocks boom first, then software heavy stocks make the real money (IBM vs. Microsoft, Cisco vs. Google, arguably Samsung (made hardware for iPhones and still does) vs. Apple). Jensen Huang knows this and he has apparently been putting NVDA's piles of cash into their own software-as-a-service stack. That means that even if a company is squarely within the Blackwell supply chain, they may not get the margins or added software value of NVDA. OpenAI, anthropic, and perplexity may be future-IPO software winners, but they will likely still be paying NVDA and probably using NVDA software for that right. \n\nThe caveat is that rollouts never go as planned, and there is a small chance that this year's GTC will be like Elon announcing a 40k uber-range cybertruck, along with fleets of semis using Tesla's supposedly imminent industry-shattering battery efficiencies, all going from point A to B using FSD. Fast forward to today, and Tesla is buying batteries from BYDDY when their cars aren't destined for US markets, and the government has forced a recall that makes autopilot nag you three times as frequently to apply force to the wheel. \n\nJensen Huang has a better track record than Elon Musk at delivering on his promises, but the rollout of new tech (Blackwell) is always bumpy. I don't know that buying MU for \"diversification\" away from NVDA makes sense when it correlates with NVDA, with dramatically less upside, and smaller but comparable pullbacks. Sometimes the market-leading obvious choice, even if expensive on paper, is the best choice. That was certainly the case for previous tech transformation boom, when all of the calls to buy less-obvious stocks were bad calls, and the boring and obvious calls were right as long as you held on tight through some very big crashes.\n\nEven I have diversification, but it's with a small tranche of treasuries and much more profitable dividend-yielding bond proxies that will still give dividends when indices collapse, and still give dry powder to buy clear winners when indices do inevitably pull back.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can you share you plans on the stock?
