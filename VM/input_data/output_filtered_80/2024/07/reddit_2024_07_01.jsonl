The storm around nvidia seems a little unique from other growth stocks in the past, because they’re effectively the only game in town that can sell metaphorical shovels to people training AI models. Calling it just hype misses a lot of the reason it’s been exploding so heavily. \n\nIt’s not really as simple as giving AMD or Intel or Google (even though they have the closest competitor in the TPUs - other large companies view them as a competitor and won’t touch them) time to catch up, they need to be able to have models run efficiently on their stuff as well, which is why cuda is such a moat. It takes time for the FOSS community behind tools like PyTorch to adapt another framework, even if it were available today. \n\nCouple that with there not being a ton of reasons to think AI spending will stop growing, unless we hit a data wall, means nvidia likely continues strong for some time. We’re not forecasted to hit a data wall, even on the most optimistic (in terms of best case AI progress) models until ‘27 though. Until then the business worlds can continue to rapidly accelerate spending which gives gpu makers more than enough business to grow. \n\nWith that said though - there’s a couple reasonable risks to weigh. The biggest being that hyper scale data centers absolutely hate being tied into a single supplier and are actively looking to develop their own hardware. Nvidia (and even AMD to some extent) are miles ahead of them, but they have so much unused space in their centers due to cooling issues that a product at like half the performance but less than half the energy draw could still do amazingly. Additionally, some of the foundries and power plants tech companies are buying for their >1GW power plans could fall through, or we could hit a wall much earlier than we think that makes AI spending much less important - to name a few. \n\nThere’s a lot of inherent risk here, but the potential market for GPU manufacturers isn’t even close to being realized.

The reason empty space matters though is because in a hypothetical world where intel releases an Arc TPU - it doesn't have to match nvidias performance, just their performance/watt to a reasonable level because there's a lot of room to make the distributed stuff work out from having to install more of them to get the same output in FLOPS.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ah so intel or whoever could hypothetically crate a less powerful, however better performance/watt, so space can be used more efficiently which effectively could make that chip better in some circumstances?
