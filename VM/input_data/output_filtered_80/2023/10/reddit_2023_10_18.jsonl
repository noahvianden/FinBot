Cheers.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Legacy manufacturers are in serious trouble.\n\nThe problems they have to overcome are:\n\n1. Most of them are carrying extremely high levels of debt.  While some will try to spin this as \"good debt\", looking at it carefully shows they are in deep financial stress.  If ICE falters, even the \"good debt\" can suddenly go pear shaped as people choose to abandon cars that are underwater.\n2. They all have high levels of technical debt.  You cannot simply take a factory that produces ICE cars and turn it into an EV factory.  All that machinery, the processes, and networks are simply wrong for them.  It's like buying an old run down mansion.  It was clearly worth a lot of money at one point, but now it just represents lots of costs so you can clear everything out and start over.\n3. Tesla has swept the board clean of EV engineers.  Stragglers were picked up by the Chinese brands.  Legacy has to now see what they can pick up, probably at exorbitant costs.  Additionally, Legacy has to figure out what they are going to do with all their existing engineers.  Someone who has spent decades perfecting their knowledge of combustion engines is going to need \\*extensive\\* retraining to be useful at all for EVs, and their entire knowledge they have gathered over a career becomes worse than useless.\n4. Legacy is saddled with an outdated dealership model.  That is going to be very expensive to unwind, even assuming they can manage to do it at all.\n5. Their designs are anywhere from 5 to 10 years out-of-date.  They are having to play catch-up to where Tesla and the Chinese were 5 years ago.  Meanwhile the EV-only brands are just going ham on improving their own cars.\n6. The legacy manufacturers have mostly become final assembly experts.  They no longer have the knowledge or the capability of making the individual parts themselves.  That was fine when a new model meant just minor improvements over many years.  However, EVs are developing so fast that they cannot keep up.  By the time they even figure out what they need, figure out how to communicate it to their suppliers, figure out how to integrate with the other 100 suppliers, and get everything running, the market has moved on.\n7. Legacy has yet to figure out how to make EVs for profit.  This means that every EV they sell at a loss is probably stealing a sale from their profitable ICE cars.  And these are not small losses either.  We are talking $30k per car in some of the \\*best\\* cases.\n8. The \"Big Three\" in the U.S. are in particular trouble, because the union is being led by a moron that does not understand the state of the market.  He is demanding gold plates and silver goblets on the Titanic.\n9. The leadership at most of the legacy manufacturers do not understand what is going on.  They are making decisions that would have been perfectly reasonable in the fairly static markets of ten years ago, but are braindead in the current environment.  VW ditched Diess, even though he probably was the one legacy leader who actually understood what was going on.  When the leadership is feckless, the company is in trouble.\n10. And while all this is going on, where legacy desperately needs capital and time, the macro environment is giving them neither.  They need to invest hundreds of billions (at least) to make the switch.  They do not have the money.  They cannot afford to borrow the money at current interest rates.  And they do not have the time to wait.\n\nSo yes: legacy is screwed.  People have trouble seeing where this is going for the same reason that they could not understand how huge Covid was going to be in February of 2020: people just suck at understanding exponential growth and exponential decline.\n\nTherefore, they look at the current situation where EVs are \\*only\\* 20% of the market now and that ICEs have \\*only\\* dropped 12% or so, and think that they still have plenty of time to make the switch.\n\n2027.  That's the drop dead date.  That is the year when the market will be divvied up.  ICE will still be over 40% of the market, but it will be too late for anyone to make any meaningful moves to capture the new reality.  That is 3 1/2 years for legacy to solve \\*all\\* of these problems, and it is simply not going to happen.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "yes yes yes.!!\n\nadded\n\n- ICE investors only understand profit now… more than ever b/c EVs are eating into the auto market YoY\n\nso - ICE is half-assing…. nay - quarter-assing the effort to place the correct funds into R&D and infrastructure\n\nif ICE wants a remote chance - they need to put out BILLIONs on the stamping machine alone…. something they (whole industry) derided TSLA on\n\nthe proof that everyone is behind is the FACT they all scrambled to sign EV charge contracts with TSLA…. and now must convert to TSLA charge AND allow TSLA software to run in their cars…. people forget that the industry also thought putting up charge infrastructure would be easy… HELL - even Biden throws BIlLLIONS to anyone promising to deliver \n\nfunny thing - is that throwing money doesn’t equal quality… that’s why CHPT + EVGo stocks keep going down\n\n- ICE making EVs is going against their bread and butter… making ICE… the more EVs they make - the more they damage existing infrastructure to support ICE…. and that transition is not ideal at all for them\n\nICE is totally f*cked", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Agree with everything except I don’t believe they have to run Tesla software in their vehicles.

Kid is off to school, coffee is kicking in, Adderall is mixing in, and I'm about to light up a fatty.\n\nLet me first say this, I'm not trying to debate you. You've made a lot of points, some of which I agree with, some I don't, and some I feel you're missing some perspective. All of this is perfectly fine, so please don't take my opinion of your opinion as an attack.\n\nMy perspective: I'm a mid-career Program Manager in manufacturing, with 6 years in aftermarket automotive repair/performance parts. My job is to fully understand all the factors that go into producing a profitable product.  Which is convenient, since I personally only care about Money and Cars.  All other hobbies/interests are boring to me.  This is only to add to the relevance of my perspective.\n\nI'm not trying to pick apart everything you said, but I will offer a different takes:\n\n1. Debt Levels - Debt is real, but some management is better than others in capital allocation. Ford and Toyota have so much financial power, with debt restructured at all-time lows.  For a company to raise money without debt, they have to issue shares. Which Elon has done extensively while the company was far too overvalued. Shareholders were diluted, and he cashed in on hype. Elon wins, and shareholders lose.\n2. Factories are not homes. They're already mostly gutted. You establish a lifetime of expected return on a factory Cap-X investment, and you build from there.  The properties have long ago been amortized, and any new investments will be depreciated from income.\n3. Tesla has swept the board clear of engineers? That's no longer true. A lot of OG Tesla head engineers were gobbled up by Lucid. Tesla might be willing to pay top dollar for engineers, but they haven't produced anything notably different since the Model S's launch in 2012. Ten years without much change/advancement/design.  Even the other models are long in the tooth.\n4. The dealership model is outdated in the current world of New Car buying, I agree. Service Centers are not though. Tesla's network of services is limited by its ability to expand. I have 3 Ford, Honda, and Toyota dealers within 15 miles of me.  I can also have any mechanic work on any of these vehicles.\n5. Designs? Telsa's Model S debuted in 2012 and has looked the same ever since. They are very long in the tooth, and not as S3XY anymore.  Design changes are really hard to do, it takes decades of knowledge of how to properly plan for effective design changes without fully changing production/costs.\n6. Speed of the tech. Yes, I agree that the big automakers are not chasing the tech as fast as Tesla. But why? Earlier adopters of tech often pay the premium for all the R&D that is needed. Toyota (the biggest car manufacturer in the world) barely has introduced an EV. They are sitting back, letting Tesla make mistakes and pay the price to learn the EV market. Then, they take that knowledge and implement a better process that is scalable. Toyota will seldom be the first tech to market, that's not how their business model works. They want to repeat the same process 1,000,000 times without a single error. The efficiency comes from a lack of mistakes.\n7. Major Automakers are mostly testing the waters of EV. I personally, don't see a full EV switch. I think the adoption is going to be PHEV. Until we see exactly what Toyota and Honda are going to lean into, my jury is still out. Japan is who I look to for the long term, they are less focused on quarterly profits, and make moves that impact decades.\n8. The big 3 are not in trouble. That's just the current back-and-forth of labor disputes.  Why are they not in trouble? Because the big three are essential manufacturers for the Department of Defense. The US government knows that the skill sets of making cars align with the skill sets of making tanks. The Government doesn't trust Tesla (they've been excluded from EV meetings at the Whitehouse), because of all the direct financial ties to China. We can't trust Elon with DoD money/secrets.\n9. Leadership at the Big 3 is far wiser than you give them credit. Most of us people think in terms of single years, at best voting cycles. Large corporations have goals for the next 50-100 years of business. Our only real measure for this will be time.\n10. They are not strapped for cash. Yes, the \"macro headwinds\" (quoting every stupid earnings call), will create chop. I don't think they're going to chase Tesla into the full EV world. The lithium is too rare, the tech moves too fast, and most humans don't need more than 40 miles worth of range on a daily basis. PHEV is the logical solution to using a rare metal and abundant oil.\n\nPart of my previous role was to analyze all the vehicle registrations in the US and build forecasts for failure rates based on the expected aged population of vehicles in the next 10 years.\n\nHere are some baseline facts I that I gathered and that build my perspective:\n\n\\- US Population is growing- US New Car units sold is flat YoY  \n\n\n\\- This means the % of the population buying a new car is getting smaller (see shrinking middle class)\n\n\\- This has led to makers, like Ford, to exit low-dollar new cars/sedans, because new buyers aren't even looking at them. $46k is the average new car price now.\n\n\\- If the big builders are focusing on higher-dollar cars, there's a higher margin to offset future CapX expansions into EV/PHEV (side note: F-150 is produced in such volumes, that it was relatively cheap to make the Lightning)\n\n\\- Automakers can not experience growth from unit sales (as they did for decades). It is now going to come via cost-cutting in production and focusing on a more affluent buyer. To Tesla's credit, that is what they did out of the gate. However, they are no longer the only boat in the pond. Some of these boats are massive in comparison.\n\nedits: for grammar/words only", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla has the biggest selling car (or close) with the Y, about at a 2 million a year run rate world wide across all their vehicles.

The general pattern is:\n\n1. Toyota says that EVs are not so great, and maybe (X) would be better.\n2. Everyone notes the exponential growth of EVs and starts to wonder if Toyota is going to be around in 10 years.\n3. Toyota panics and overcompensates with huge promises.\n4. Long silence.\n\nThe big promises are sometimes some grand breakthrough tech.  Sometimes it's a gazillion models.  Sometimes just a big promise of how fast they will convert everything.  Sometimes a combo.\n\nOver time (1) has gotten quieter and (3) has gotten louder, but the general pattern still holds so far.\n\nOne final note: consider the 4680 batteries.  Tesla had a full-fledged pilot production up and running back in...what was it...2018?  This means it was long out of the lab stage, they had a pretty good idea of how to produce them, and \\*still\\* it look like it will take until 2024 before they are really in full production.  That's 6 years from pilot to production, and Tesla is \\*fast\\* when it comes to things like this\n\nSo let's say Toyota comes out in 2025 with a solid state battery that works great in the lab.  They even built some cars with it.  Toyota still needs to create a pilot plant to figure out production and then actually get a full-fledged production plant built and running.  In the best case, that will be ready to go in 2031 or 2032.\n\nIn the meantime, many of the grand benefits of a solid state batteries are being encroached on by \"normal\" batteries.  It remains to be seen whether there is much benefit by then.  Or whether Toyota even exists.\n\nAbout the only counter is that Toyota is very secretive and despite all their public posturing is much further along than we know.  To that I can only say: \\*shrug\\*.  Maybe.  And maybe hydrogen is suddenly going to fix all of its outstanding challenges, or maybe that carbon neutral gas is going to become the big thing...
