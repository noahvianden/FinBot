Add in the rising popularity of Apple products, so that even your PCs aren't performing as well as you'd hoped.\n\nNetflix gives them a foothold in streaming that would be exclusive to them, giving people a reason to come back to their product.  Combining it with gamepass allows you to raise your subscription price in a way that upsets far fewer people, because it isn't just a gaming service or a streaming service, it's both now.  Many of their users will only use one or the other, but that's fine, they understand the reason for the price hike.\n\nAdd in compatability with Steam's publishing setup, and all of a sudden you have an Amazon-esque indie publishing platform for streaming media instead of authors.\n\nThere is a lot of potential.

Also why would Netflix give them a foothold in streaming that would bring people back to their product? Netflix has about 220 million users.  Xbox live currently has around 100 million and you have 18 million users on gamepass. Any sort of exclusive features would just drive people away from Netflix. Personally I'm a loyal Netflix customer but if they started putting content out a week or two weeks early for Xbox owners then I would cancel my subscription.
