{"title": "Inverse WallStreetBets; Meta/FB as a long term growth investment", "selftext": "**My initial disclaimer:** \n\nMeta is not a traditional/standard WSB quick play. I'm not suggesting anyone buy any at this time; and I don't currently hold any myself. This is a 5-10 year play; and if you're looking for somewhere to park some money over that time period I am predicting 500-1000% gains in that time period. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Bear's Thesis:** \n\n* A. They are a dying company used exclusively by boomers\n* B. Changes to data collection policies by Apple and Google handicaps revenue\n* C. The Metaverse is a poorly thought out attempt to pivot business strategies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disputing these thoughts; and why I'm Bullish**\n\n1. **Available user data does not reflect that Facebook is dying; or that it's user base is primarily boomers.** As of October of 2021, Facebook had **2.9 billion monthly active users** (\\~36% of the world's population) -- over the 13 quarters prior; Facebook has ALWAYS posted growth. \n\n* Analyzing that user base; \n   * 66% of those users login every day, \n   * **Median age of users is 31** \n   * **\\~60% of users are between the age of 13-34.**\n* Analyzing traffic\n   * Facebook is the 3rd most visited Website on the internet (behind Google and Youtube)\n   * 11.2B visits per day by 1.5B unique visitors\n      * The next most visited Social Media site is Instagram (which is FB) at 2.9B and Twitter at 2.4B visits. **Facebook gets \\~5x the visits by about \\~2x the unique visitors.**\n   * \\~22 minutes average time per visit\n   * \\~6 pages per visit \n   * **THIS TRAFFIC DATA DOES NOT REFLECT MOBILE APP VISITS, JUST BROWSER VISITS**\n\n2. The fact that Facebook gets 11.2B visits a day by 1.5B unique visitors means that while Apple/Google cutting off mobile data collection may have some impact on FB's revenue; **they still can obtain an enormous amount of data from browser access**. \n\n3. In 2022 the Metaverse is an outlandish concept that most of us (myself included) can see absolutely no value or utility in. Up to now VR has been a novelty with little application outside of video games and porn. It isn't wrong to be skeptical of this. **BUT** as of now Meta is way out in front on building an all encompassing virtual reality platform; and has cemented themselves as **THE** leader/gateway for anyone looking to develop a virtual reality product. If you need any confirmation bias that there is potential for value; Google which companies are investing in/working on/becoming a part of the Metaverse. **Facebook's Metaverse has a high probability to be for VR what iOS and Android have been for smartphones.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for why I believe Meta will see 500-1000% gains over the next 5-10 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe iPhone began development in 2004, was released in 2007, and reached most popular status in \\~2011. In that time Apple's stock price (adjusted for splits and approximated for an annual value) was \\~$.48, $5.40, and $12.10 respectively. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow comparing that to the intended timeline of Zuck's Metaverse: Development began in 2021/22. The development timeline that I typically see for release of a product resembling a genuine VR worldscape is \\~5 years. We'll call it 2027. Zuck is predicting 1 billion MAU on the Metaverse by 2031. If we apply the same price movement that Apple achieved with the iPhone; Facebook's current price \\~$210 rises to \\~$2,400 in 2027, and reaches \\~$5,300 by 2031. I appreciate that comparing those price movements is an extremely non-scientific method for prediction and that there was a lot of other shit going on with Apple in that timeframe; so I've applied a 50% reduction to those increases for the sake of conservativeness and we're still left with a share price of **\\~$2,150 in 2031.**   \n\n\nTLDR:   \nFB is still growing and primarily used by young people\n\nFB has more than enough browser based traffic to keep its data supply without Apple/Google's cooperation\n\nVR is a realistic/legitimate growth industry ; and FB has positioned themselves to create the iOS/Android that the rest of VR is run on. \n\nPrice target is $2000 by the end of 2031. If it doesn't hit mods can ban me.", "id": "sy4ya7", "created_utc": 1645478779.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|201|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sy4ya7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sy4ya7)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">If we apply the same price movement that Apple achieved with the iPhone  \nFacebook's current price \\~$210 rises to \\~$2,400 in 2027, and reaches \\~$5,300 by 2031.\n\nComparison is dumb for couple of reasons \n\nFirst, Apple market cap in 2007-2008 was around $70B\n\nSecond, current FB cap is $600B .. calling for 1000% return is quite ridiculous ($6T market cap)", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, this is hilarious.", "score": 19, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Exclusively by boomers? holy fuck am i old now?", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4257)", "score": 18, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Something about Zuck losing so much money in one day makes me laugh out loud ðŸ˜‚ \n\nPS I started investing into FB after earnings, opened my first position at $220", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Itâ€™s not the first time they posted his loss.
