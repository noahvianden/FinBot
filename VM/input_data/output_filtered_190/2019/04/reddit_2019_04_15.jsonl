So Raven is scratching the top, this indicates that more new features are coming to the S and X. I think new battery technology makes the most sense. Two more things would be new motors and new batteries. With the same chemistry as the 3 and more efficient motors, Tesla could push the range of the S and X to 400 miles maybe. That would be a nice \"one more thing to add to the event\".\n\nThe actual event, the \"Tesla Autonomy Investor Day\" is the biggest puzzle for me. Elon said that they will be feature complete with their self driving software later this year. This means that right now, they cannot launch anything yet. Not even a geofenced implementation of the Tesla Network. \n\n> On April 22, Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car \n\n [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117096350301085697](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117096350301085697) \n\nThe event is clearly aimed at investors, he mentions them instead of customers.

Musk is been holding the FSD stick and carrot in front of our faces since 2015, people will not be impressed by a demo, everyone can do demos these days. If this will just be a tripling down on FSD promises, I don't think the markets will react much.\n\nWill this include a creative way of raising cash without diluting the stock? If so, why didn't they raise when it was at $380?\n\nThe other thing that is concerning to me is all the talk about appreciating assets. They seems to be pushing the narrative that the cars will go up in value. Perhaps they are selling the SR+ cars at low/negative margin and will use this as an excuse that future FSD profitability will be priced in. This would effectively be betting the company on FSD, which would not sit well with many.\n\nIs there anything that I missed?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "400 miles is 643.74 km", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "> The event is clearly aimed at investors, he mentions them instead of customers.
