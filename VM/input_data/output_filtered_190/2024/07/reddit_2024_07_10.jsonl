They will absolutely lose customers who will opt for AST‚Äôs cheap service that penetrates buildings rather than use Starlinks shite expensive receiver that can‚Äôt penetrate buildings.   \n\nAll DoD contracts go through Fairwinds technology. Fairwinds technology have tweeted about AST‚Äôs tech.  First Net have 8 billion allocated to improve connectivity. First Net work with AT&T (who work with AST). First Net have also tweeted about AST. Contracts with the military and first responders are inevitable imo. \n\nIt‚Äôs clear who everyone with interest in this technology are backing - AST. You are wrong about your assumption. AST are likely years ahead and are set to dominate the market. They already have over 2/3s of the US market locked up with commercial agreements with Verizon and AT&T. There is speculation that T-Mobile will jump ship to AST as Starlink have no service to provide them and AST‚Äôs tech is compatible with T-Mobile‚Äôs spectrum. \n\nAlso - Google, Vodafone, AT&T and Verizon are all strategic investors in AST. \n\nBtw Deutsche Bank have slapped a 2027 650 PT on ASTS. Transhumanica a PT of 500. Check my page for an ASTS write up where I showed how these PT‚Äôs and revenue projections can actually easily be reached.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=DKfIV51XACqh-glU&v=b25Prku8T54&feature=youtu.be \n\nHere‚Äôs a short video of ASTS discussed just yesterday on Schwabb network by a professional money manager.
