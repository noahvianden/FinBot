Yet, the company is still here. So what are we missing?  \n\n\nLets first look at financials.  \nNet Income and Revenue is actually improving for them, despite a shitty economic climate and shitty sales performance.  \nOverall its garbage, but somehow improving.   \n\n\n[Here you can see revenue increasing, with a slight dip in net income.](https://preview.redd.it/m6me1v93tclc1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=83cb9816d579d8a86c6c9cff8c0816d09aa3d5f5)\n\nDespite not doing well, they have been able to decrease the deficit of their cash flow.

What happened in June with the seriously bullish skew.](https://preview.redd.it/gxoplwjdvclc1.png?width=1657&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c23c7215723f8520b20513bcc034dcab504b5aa)\n\nLets look at the chart around the time everyone became a bull in June.  \n\n\n[From June to July stock price rose roughly 100&#37;, how the hell.?](https://preview.redd.it/crr8r7dovclc1.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c2da65832e2fa9d5f8f3c46b565ac632ef8a28)\n\n  \nLets revisit our financials page to see if anything significant happened in June 2023.  \n\n\n[Would you look at that, the company \\(still losing money\\) improved its overall Revenue and Income.](https://preview.redd.it/hav2i0vyvclc1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac1a2ca0d9338b9df468b8f1934b7120dd52232)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"Hormozi, wtf is this, sounds like garbage, too long didn't read, what am I supposed to buy?\"   \n\n\nThe answer is, I have no fucking clue. But my take is any improvement this company can see in the near future and long term will absolutely skyrocket the price. And if it doesn't, well it was shit anyway.  \nI've seen the vehicles they produce, and they intend to market and produce a more moderately priced version for regards like you.  \n\n\nTLDR\n\n* Company financials bad, but improving.\n* Entering a more retail friendly market soon.\n* Can't really get much worse than it is and if this company can get its shit together, in my mind we see Tesla 2.0.
