I‚Äôm not looking to get rich. I am looking to get an extra 800-1000 a month though. Maybe I spend it.

A lot of what I‚Äôm about to say, depends on factors, such as how comfortable you are with risk, how much cash you have to play with, how much margin your brokerage let‚Äôs you use, those sorts of things‚Ä¶ But to make decent money on the premiums, you need a stock that‚Äôs more volatile than Apple. People smarter than me know how to look at ‚Äúimplied volatility‚Äú but what I do (to compare one stock to another, with regard to options) is take the sell price for an option 30 days out, at the money (meaning the strike price is the same as today‚Äôs price), then I divide that ‚Äúsell‚Äú price by the strike price and come up with a number (like 0.02 for AAPL.  0.02 is too low to justify putting shares at risk in my opinion. And the fact that I rely on a calculation like that, rather than figuring out what implied volatility numbers are all about, should tell you I am not all that sophisticated, a trader lol.  I look for a ratio that is higher than 0.035 before even considering options (not a magic number, just the number I use). For the past couple of years, I have made my income on  TSLA and NVDA calls, and have ignored the rest of the market.  I have gotten out of Tesla now so I am 100% NVDA (and its ratio, that I mentioned earlier, is 0.0634).  With 100 shares, one covered call generates about $1500 premium on a 30 day call, at the money (but you absolutely will have to sell the shares, or roll forward, because NVDA will keep going up - they are untouchable when it comes to AI chips).  It‚Äôs generally a bad idea to buy 100 shares in a single buy if you don‚Äôt have deep pockets, and when Nvidia does their earnings announcement in a couple of weeks, it would not be surprising to see it dip anywhere from $20-$100 (but it also would not be surprising to see it hit $900 in two weeks lol).  I have been buying another 5 to 10 shares every time it crosses a $5 mark, up or down but others would probably say it is smarter to sell a cash secured put and just keep collecting premium until it hits your price. My pockets are not deep enough to comfortably obligate myself to a $70,000 purchase, but it‚Äôs just psychological because I can always roll the option down and out (just like I‚Äôm having to do with my calls right now).  I need to get through the psychological barrier of thinking it‚Äôs OK to lose 100 shares where my cost basis is $330, but not OK to go risk buying 100 shares when I COULD always sell my other shares to cover, if I HAD to.  TSLA has good premiums, but I would not on Tesla right now, with sentiment, running against electric cars, and Musk looking increasingly unhinged.  I am slowly collecting ARM holdings and SOFI bc Last time I looked they had pretty good option premiums, but SOFI cleaned up being a meme stock a year from now and ARM is trading pet some absolutely ridiculous price to earnings ratio (ARM is 1,340 times earnings, compared to Nvidia, which is 94. AAPL is 29.)\n\nTLDR: AAPL premiums are too low to justify putting all those shares at risk. Take a look at doing it with a stock that has higher volatility.

Still do once in a while.\n\nLet me first say that I'm doing all my trading in a traditional IRA account. So it's not a taxable event when my calls are assigned. My strategy is this...sell weekly calls because they will yield larger premiums. I don't look at deltas or IV. I only look at the ratio of contract price to underlying stock price. I see this as the ROI for my money tied up in the stock. The way I see it, the contract price is derived off the delta and IV. It's just another data point to key off of.\n\nLet's take our beloved NVDA as an example. Say I bought 100 shares for the current price of 721. If I want to sell a call at the strike of 725 expiring on 3/8 (4 weeks out). I will make 4400 from the premium. That is a return of 6.1% (4400 / 72100). That's very good! But if I sold a weekly that expired on 2/16, the premium would be 1400. That's a 1.9% ROI. If I can do that every week, 1.9 x 4 weeks is 7.6%. Granted I might not be able to get 1.9% every week.\n\nLet me first say that I'm doing all my trading in a traditional IRA account. So it's not a taxable event when my calls are assigned.

I see this as the ROI for my money tied up in the stock. The way I see it, the contract price is derived from the delta and IV.

Then I don't touch it for the week. I check in every other day to see how it's doing, but that's just out of curiosity. I have a spreadsheet to keep track of how I'm doing. I also wrote a program that lists stocks with the highest ROI. So that makes it quicker to pick the stock.\n\nBut like I said, NVDA is too rich for my blood. I prefer to diversify with other high-ROI stocks. My goal is to consistently hit singles, even if it means giving up the occasional homerun. Just this week, I lost a lot of upside on ARM. The stock went bananas after earnings came out. I had 100 shares that appreciated 3700. Instead, I made only 219 from the premium. But as I see it, if I make 1% ROI every week, that's a 52% return at the end of the year.\n\nThis whole thing is sort of an experiment for me. I want to see if this strategy will beat the S&P 500 in 2024. So I use half my money in the IRA selling calls and the other half tucked away in VFIAX. So far VFIAX is winning lol, but the year's still young. I plan to follow through for the entire year and then reassess. My dogs so far have been TSLA and RIVN :( Down 24% and 20% respectively.\n\nLet me know if you see any holes in this strategy. I have no one else to bounce it off with in the real world.
