You have to remember, development engineers at Ford and other automakers end up being pencil pushers rather than innovators.

This frustrates bright engineers with great ideas. A lot of them are at Tesla now and the job is like heaven to them. \n\nIf Investors vote away from the next (admittedly uncomfortable) step of progress for Tesla, then the investors would be voting to reduce Tesla to an automaker like the Big 3, voting to maintain a status quo rather than to make the next big leap in innovation. Which means Elon and the innovators would leave to places that still want to innovate.\n\nElon and Tesla have had to exert so much energy on the 9 share stockholder and other inane lawsuits that could have been used toward innovation and accelerating production.
