Also with that, less risk = less reward. The higher the probability of success, the lower max profit you will have.   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nGood luck everyone!\n\nEdit: TY for the hugs award! Also, I have ZERO problem helping you all out with replying to messages and comments. It's the whole reason I started my YT channel (in my profile)and created this account. So by all means, keep the questions and stock talk coming!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the silver! I truly appreciate it!", "id": "jvub23", "created_utc": 1605624843.0, "score": 365, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 190, "comments": [{"body": "For anyone that's lost on what I just said, since I had a few people message me and I typed this up for them. \n\nSo, the MMM is the Market Maker Move. It's the dollar move that the market makers are expecting the stock price to move in either the up or down direction.\n\nNow why does that matter? The MMM is what is already \"priced in\" to the options that are expiring during the week of the earnings report. So if for a example, the stock price of NIO is $40, and the MMM is +/- $5, then all of the options with a strike price that fall within the $35-45 range will lose money after earnings is reported because the price of the options have that move \"priced in\".  So essentially, in order for you to make money on options held through earnings, you either need to be deep ITM or the stock price needs to move more than the MMM.\n\nThe IV is the implied volatility of the stock. Or how high or low the movement of the stock price is expected to move. So in this case NIO. This is because there's a highly anticipated event this week (earnings). So why does this matter? Another factor that influences the price of options is the IV. For every 1% that IV increases or decreases, the price of the option increases or decreases by the amount that's listed as the Greek known as Vega. So if we know the IV of options expiring this week (the week of NIO's earnings) as opposed to next week's options then we can get a good idea of how much IV is \"priced in\" or how much money we can expect to lose due to \"IV crush\", which is where the option loses value because the IV decreases, which brings down the value of options even if the stock price is moving in our desired direction.\n\nThe next thing is the standard deviations. They're basically a probability equation that I really don't know off the top of my head or enough to explain without looking up, BUT all you need to know in terms of the stock price is that for every one standard deviation increase, the range at which the stock price can increase or decrease from its current price increases in size. So essentially, there's a higher probability that it'll stay between that given range. Now why does this matter? Playing spreads with options, especially for earnings is much, much safer, cheaper, and in some cases gets you paid as opposed to you having to pay for the options. If we know the price range and the probability at which the stock price may stay inside that range, then we can plan appropriately and increase our odds of making money while decreasing our odds of losing money.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, about 80% of options expire worthless. So if we know the information I gave then we can gauge what those options that fall under that 80% are and we can use spreads to increase our chances of success as opposed to buying straight up calls and puts.\n\nCan you make money with straight up calls and puts? Definitely! However, that brings with it lots of risk. With the market in general, especially with options, the higher the risk the higher the reward. But, many would rather risk $100 to make $50 68-96% of the time than risk $100 to make $1,000 at a much much lower success rate. \n\nHopefully that helped.
