{"title": "Autist convention in Denver to decide our new home", "selftext": "Since most of you retards don't have full autism, I've decided that my Adderall fueled dreams qualify me to organize the first ever r/wallstreetbets convention. This get together will help us plan our corporation, our location, our portfolio, and plans on how to make our new home not a piece of shit wasteland but a well designed, futuristic place where Tesla and AMD will set up shop and pay our citizens well.\n\nWe will all be required to take our medication at the door, shower before entry, and leave all ninja katanas at coat check.\n\nWe'll be doing it in Denver to use as a model of what we don't want to become. Denver is so fucking gay.\n\nI will organize the website, and sell tickets for fractional shares of FB.\n\nThe convention will be called the Denver Inquiry on the Creation of our Kingdom, or DICK.\n\nI'm not joking. Y'all seem to be playing but I'm going to make this happen.\n\nEdit: dickmeet.com will be completed soon.\n\nEdit 2: okay site is up (default WP template, whatever it shows a chart with Stonks going up) and contact form is too. Use it or guh@dickmeet.com if you want to be involved. This all sounds gay but it's true.\n\nEdit 3: newsletter up and like 80 of you idiots have signed up already. I'm getting a tingle in my wee wee - we can truly do this.\n\nEdit 4: final edit. Future edits will be made as a new post. Basically there are hundreds of signups. Most people seem interested in a WSB convention. So we're going to do it.
