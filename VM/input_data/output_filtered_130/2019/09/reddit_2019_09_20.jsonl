You can google it. \n\nWith all the info, EV is the way to go. When it comes to EV, in China, the only EV they want is Tesla, new or used, that's what they want. So when a   bashing article says Tesla will face demand cliff in China, you should know that's BS. In the past there were demand problem in China because of high cost. Now Tesla's cost goes a lot lower without tariff, other EV's cost goes higher (no more $10k handout per car from government). The equation has changed. From demand point of view, Tesla should get quarter million to half million Model 3 demand from China in 2020. I'm not optimistic about their production in China.

Chinese demand for the Model 3 has been weak and 2020 China losses should be -$490m.\n\nI don't think we can say anything about the demand for the lower cost Model 3 yet.  I am expecting a very small loss for the factory next year, $490mm seems very high to me.\n\n> The terms of Tesla's contract with China are draconian. If Tesla can't generate a 15% pre-tax margin by 2023, the government takes back the factory.\n\nNot sure this is entirely accurate, but at any rate not a near term concern at all.\n\n> Handing back the factory could lead to a $2bn write-off or 38% of June-end equity. Tesla put shareholders' capital at risk by agreeing to China's lofty terms.\n\nNot a real concern - seems like a situation where Tesla could make some additional payments to the Chinese government if there was an actual risk.  Tesla also has nothing approaching $2 billion invested, and never will unless the factory is doing amazing and they expand.\n\n> There are over 27 new EVs scheduled to launch by 2020 end, the majority of which will head to China. Tesla could see its undoing in a market with such fierce competition.\n\nThis is a concern.  Government subsidies have led to a glut of competition in China.  A lot of it is terrible, but there are real competitors there that, in my view, have a better idea of what the local market wants.\n\n> With Model 3 sales falling in the US, the additional losses booked in China should lead to a 2020 net loss of -$3.3bn. Financing should be inevitable by Q1 2020 end.\n\nAgain, I'm expecting a loss next year, but not $3.3 billion.  Ramping for the Y, revamping the S/X, hopefully doing some work on the roadster and semi, etc. is going to be expensive and I am not seeing a big catalyst to increase sales next year (other than in China, but I think losses in the first half of the year as they ramp up will offset most if not all gains).

They are proven right (at least on paper) they make a lot of money.\n2. They are proven right Elon and Tesla look like bumbling fools who can't execute...\n\nAs they were already pre-deposed to believing they are right, any evidence that appears to confirm that  is potent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe flip side is there are areas where us Bulls think we are right and evidence that appears to  confirm that:-\n\n1. Tesla and Elon seem to be getting smarter (most of the time).\n2. Tesla revenues are growing fast...\n3. Tesla will achieve a scale that dilutes some of their fixed costs.\n4. EVs and Renewable Energy are the future.\n5. Tesla products are better that the competition.\n6. Tesla has a 3-5 year technological lead on the competition.\n7. Tesla is continuing to innovate at a rapid rate.\n8. Vertical integration is an advantage.\n9. Tesla has a comprehensive and coherent long term strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think what we need to realise is things don't always go smoothly, and there are challenges from time to time  and as other car makers switch to making EVs there will be more competition.. The macro environment is always a risk and we can't 100% rule out the occasional stumble from Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo for longs the risk is occasional choppy water. Long term I think 1-9 above are mostly a fairly safe bet, short term anything can happen.\n\nShorts will largely sort themselves out,  they may or may not make money, but if Tesla is successful one way or another short interest will reduce.\n\nI don't think longs need to get into conspiracy theories about the motivation of shorts, it is their money at the casino, play long enough, the house always wins...", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's human nature to resist any changes. Musk isn't subtle and he will let you know things are about to be disrupted. I don't even think they know why they hate Tesla so much. Even if they showcase all the flaws the company and Musk have, that is not a direct reason to hate something, especially if the underlying mission is to do good for all humanity.
