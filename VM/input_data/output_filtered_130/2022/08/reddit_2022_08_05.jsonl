{"title": "Tesla Shareholders Approved a 3:1 Stock Split", "selftext": " Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world’s most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.\n\nIn a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company’s proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.\n\nTesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today’s closing price the new share price would be around $308.\n\nThough the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don’t impact a company’s market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.\n\nTesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla’s 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.\n\nSeveral other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet’s split 20:1 in February and Amazon’s stock split 20:1 split one month later.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2)\n\nTesla TSLA shareholders approved a 3-for1 stock split. This means that for every TSLA share you own, you will receive 2 additional shares. Elon Musk added that buybacks are on the table depending on future cash flow.\n\nDo you think $TSLA will rally leading up to the stock split?", "id": "wgxjoc", "created_utc": 1659711305.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Lol he's just going to keep splitting", "score": 184, "replies": [{"body": "Yup it’ll split again by 2025", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Spring 2023 bet?", "score": 14, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "What everybody in a splitting mood", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "2023 depression", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Push every share price to 5¢.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "what would that really do ? honest question", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "/s (many, many splits + recession = 5¢ share price)", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Delist Tesla?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Everything will be penny stocks after the dip", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Split via dividend.\n\nLike stick a wrench in the short bicycle.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "To get in on the meme bullshit.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Yea, with the correction it is still up 25% this month.

There are other benefits to EV's... as I've already explained, you receive priority lanes, free parking, etc., Again, I charge my M3 for $8 for 280 miles. That same rate would be $40 with my Civic that I had just last year.\n\nCountries currently offer them, but for how long? In Europe electricity prices are so high, so EV charging to gasoline prices are very close. Priority lanes, free parking or other things do not apply in most countries. \n\nAu contraire in many you still have very little infrastructure. Even more, in most cities, parking spaces are not built for EVs yet. That takes a lot of time and will deter many people that live in the city from an EV. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Their Model Y and Model 3 are the two best selling EV's in Europe.... They just only started their factory in Europe. Because of their Shanghai lockdown, they normally send some of their production from that manufacturing plant to Europe. Define 'terrible'. Show me the numbers. You're just spewing gibberish.\n\nOther car companies have several models. Tesla was outsold by VW and Stellantis in Europe. \n\nAlso Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swizerland and the UK publish their registered vehicles either daily or monthly.

Given that they are losing market share already it is unlikely they will succeed. Additionally scaling factories is hard. From 1m-2m you might only need two new factories, but to double that you also need double the factories - it is not like software. \n\nWe are seeing the struggles of Berlin and Austin to scale up. \n\nSupercharging network is a non factor in Europe as chargers are standardised and similar to gasoline stations margins are very low. \n\nIn other sectors Tesla has shown 0 indication that they are the leader.\n\nTesla is very overvalued even if you assume the best of cases.
