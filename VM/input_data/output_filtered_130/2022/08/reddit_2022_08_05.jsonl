{"title": "Tesla Shareholders Approved a 3:1 Stock Split", "selftext": " Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world‚Äôs most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.\n\nIn a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company‚Äôs proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.\n\nTesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today‚Äôs closing price the new share price would be around $308.\n\nThough the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don‚Äôt impact a company‚Äôs market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.\n\nTesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla‚Äôs 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.\n\nSeveral other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet‚Äôs split 20:1 in February and Amazon‚Äôs stock split 20:1 split one month later.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2)\n\nTesla TSLA shareholders approved a 3-for1 stock split. This means that for every TSLA share you own, you will receive 2 additional shares.

Plus, the conversion to EURO to USD was about 17% higher on average than America in 2020 so those prices are higher or price comparative when converted for the majority of those higher income countries. USA is the second largest car market in the world and gas prices in Europe + them being ahead of America in terms of the environment means there will be more demand in Europe for EV's than in America. China is undoubtedly going to be the largest car market in the world. \n\nLosing market share was always going to happen but you need to be comparing market sales on total car sales. \"EV's are the future.\" Yes, so compare Tesla's EV growth as a % of total car sales as a better metric since EV adoption is the point here.\n\nToo expensive, sure.

In Europe electricity prices are so high, so EV charging to gasoline prices are very close. Priority lanes, free parking or other things do not apply in most countries. \n\nAu contraire in many you still have very little infrastructure. Even more, in most cities, parking spaces are not built for EVs yet.

Given that they are losing market share already it is unlikely they will succeed. Additionally scaling factories is hard. From 1m-2m you might only need two new factories, but to double that you also need double the factories - it is not like software. \n\nWe are seeing the struggles of Berlin and Austin to scale up. \n\nSupercharging network is a non factor in Europe as chargers are standardised and similar to gasoline stations margins are very low. \n\nIn other sectors Tesla has shown 0 indication that they are the leader.\n\nTesla is very overvalued even if you assume the best of cases.
