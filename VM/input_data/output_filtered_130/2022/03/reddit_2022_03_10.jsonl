It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.\n\nAs of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Amy Caren Daniel and Matthew Lewis)\n\n[Source](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/news/basicNewsStory.jhtml?symbols=RIVN&storyid=202203101651RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KCN2L72KI-OUSBS_1&provider=RTRSNEWS&product=COMBINED&sb=1)", "id": "tbb6rk", "created_utc": 1646952339.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "Amazon's Q1 earnings aren't going to look so rosy with rivian taking a steaming dump this year so far", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "My conspiracy theory is that this is exactly why Amazon announced the stock split and buy back after more than 20 years of explicitly staying they would not split.\n\nTheir CFO saw the forecasted numbers from his team, slammed the alarm bell and told the board that they needed to pump the price up before the rivian impact hit. \n\nI'm being half glib, but as a person working in Corp finance this isnt a large exaggeration of what happens behind board/exco meetings.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Smoke and mirrors...

Yes, Ford has a lot of legacy *baggage*. They have a hugely monumental task of ramping up their EV production fast enough to displace ICE sales in the hopes that demand for ICEs doesn't decline faster than they can keep up with.\n\nEven catching up to Tesla's 1M EVs per year isn't going to be good enough. They need to hit that 4M/year EVs produced ASAP. No law of economics says that the downward trend in ICE demand will be slow, gentle and easy for Ford and an equal-opposite mirror to EV ramp up. Those two things operate at very different time scales. They can hope for a slow decline in ICE demand but need to plan for a dramatic and fast collapse or just not bother trying.\n\nAnd what kind of tech do they plan to use to get there? LG pouch cells.

They're up there with Tesla and Lucid with over a decade of experience and know-how. It's no mistake that these three companies have the longest-range EVs on the market and they're all using cylindrical cells. The only exception are base-model, non-performance Tesla Ys and 3s that use CATL prismatic cells. But if you want high-performance or high-load batteries it's becoming obvious that you need cylindrical.\n\nRivian will struggle but get a big boost when Ford, GM and Stellantis EV pickups are either bursting into flames or stranded on the side of the road at the start of a mountain pass.
