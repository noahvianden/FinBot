The larger story is the failure of the JIT manufacturing and stock system (there's an argument that there are good and bad implementation of Just In Time systems for stock, and that's true, but they all have weaknesses like what I'm about to describe, but the difference is in how vulnerable the chain is in a change in interest).\n\nBasically, keeping a bunch of stock undermines business interests by driving up costs and keeping prices down, so pretty much every major supplier (not just in cars) uses a JIT (Just In Time) stock system that seeks to keep active stock as low as possible while still maintaining sales volume.\n\nThis works out great until something like a pandemic rolls along and cuts buying for 6-12 months and then you see a massive spike once the condition which caused the buying slowdown to turn around, which is exactly what happened in 2020. So the JIT market ses a downturn, cuts orders, cuts production, etc... then tries to scale up once demand comes back. In Capitalist Economics this is called \"market efficiency.\" \n\nNow if you're a profiteer, this is great because cutting supply and then seeing a huge demand increase gives you buying power. If you're a consumer or care about the health of the market or the country or the people, this sucks. But Capitalism doesn't exist to solve those other problems... just to make profit, so this is basically a great example of how Capitalism solves problems:\n\nIt doesn't. Problems are something other people solve. \n\nAnyway, since all the buying and ordering is happening in the midst of a gap-up in demand, in the JIT system the fact that demand gapped down is taken into account variably. If a car dealership, for instance, is convinced that it won't slow down, then orders remain up and car prices will remain up with it.\n\nBut the market for cars is finite, and right now the differential in used car prices (up 40+% year over year) is much greater than the price differential for new cars (up 12%). This has given people a pretty good opportunity to change out used cars at a premium for an upgrade if what they want is in stock. In May of 2021 I sold a 10 year old used car with over $5,000 in work that needed to get done for basically $8,000 in direct cash and incentives. In a normal market I'd be lucky to get $2,000 for that car, but they threw money at me just to get access to the used car because they could make another 50% off of it easy. The car I bought new is actually worth more now than it was when I bought it LOL.\n\nEventually that'll turn around and when it does, the JIT system will likely fail to reverse course quickly enough just like it failed during the pandemic, meaning that there's a period of time when orders will be up and inventories will likely be up in \\*some\\* sectors of the market relative to where they would have been in a normal market... so yes, expect that when the situation reverses, it'll probably be a disinflationary event.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
