Only difference with me is...I went through this when I first started trading and it was with penny stocks.

That OBVIOUSLY bit me in the ass. I lost that $1900 through October (I did take out $1,100 too though) and from that point I started playing it much easier...usually looking for highly ranked Zacks stocks and then doing some company research and then, applying technicals to decide on an entry and exit point. Then, 2 weeks ago, I FINALLY made my first purchases. I Bout 4 puts of ACRX (by accident actually) and then 5 calls. I still lost, but the pits helped me. My, 5th purchase, I believe was 50 $5.50 calls at .11 of GoPro. I can‚Äôt believe I couldn‚Äôt get that out of it....but it happened and my options expired...well, minus 4 that I exercise because I was finally ITM on the day of expiration. \n\nJust curious, have any good stocks you own and/looking to jump in on Monday?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Currently in a call trade on TTWO just trying to catch the bounce from the huge decline it had but I probably won't be in it for more than a day or two more unless the overall markets are rising then too.\n\nI mostly use technical analysis myself, tried trading the news and recommended stocks but I think TA is way more consistent once you get good at it.
