AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.\n\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.\n\nAMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.\n\nIn October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.\n\nBut historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.\n\nData center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.\n\nHowever, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.\n\nAMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.\n\nSales in AMD’s gaming segment, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter.\n\nAMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/amd-earnings-report-q4-2024.html", "id": "1af0cc0", "created_utc": 1706651147.0, "score": 387, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty solid report but lower margins than NVDA.

The window pop out incident will have real material effects on next year's guidance:\n\n1. FAA is limiting production output. This is #1 downside pressure. Boeing is currently in massive debt and losing money and will continue to lose money unless they can get their rate up. FAA has said the rate is now capped. When will they un-cap? No one knows\n2. 737-7 and 737-10 are delayed again, which will lead to cancellations and/or customer concessions\n3. Alaska and United are demanding concessions for the 737-9 grounding\n\nAnd here's the real kicker.\n\nCalhoun and the other Boeing boys are first and foremost politicians. This isn't a knock on them, this is them understanding their dependence on the US government, both for military contracts and for FAA approvals.\n\n\\#1 thing Boeing needs to get production rate growth going again is to get the FAA off their back, which means get the angry public and Senators off their back.\n\nImagine the stock goes up tomorrow. What message does that send? That Boeing can cut corners and investors will still be rewarded. That will fuel the anger and empower the FAA to keep crushing them.\n\nImagine the other side. Stock dumps on poor years guidance, Boeing takes the black eye, FAA asserts dominance. Public and Senators are satisfied and move on, giving Boeing more maneuvering room with FAA to get rate going again.\n\nAnd then one or two quarters from now, Boeing can raise guidance and price goes back up. Stock dumping tomorrow is the best long-term option for Boeing, and Calhoun is too smart not to take it.\n\nThere is no good news coming for Boeing, at least not this month\n\nedit: forgot to mention - one thing you have to realize about a production rate cap is that its not simply a reduction of revenue. Boeing is in long-term contracts with their suppliers (since suppliers need assurance that $ will come in before they tool the production). This means that Boeing will be paying for parts they cannot use\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usveukm6amfc1.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=de7d649d14c3007fa12a52af118a1acfa1e6be22\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzvlt7t2amfc1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4924217a4074c408f6aeceef16d9a5dace0f8e\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1aeut1v", "created_utc": 1706637781.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/180rzxf/im_yoloing_into_msft_heres_my_dd_that_convinced_me/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1950692/boeing_safety_crisis_what_happened_week_1/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxc6jf/missed_wayfair_jump_get_ostk/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194er83/boeing_safety_crisis_part_2_why_i_give_a_damn_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeut1v/boeing_will_tank_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|13 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "How are your PUTS going you regards?
