That figure far surpassed its competitors, although it seems like that won’t happen for quite some time with nearly 50% of respondents saying they have no plans to cut the cord this year during COVID-19.", "id": "jm2wmk", "created_utc": 1604240147.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "I am not worried about a price hike.
