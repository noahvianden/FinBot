It's super profitable.**\n\n* This play creates about a 0.70% (+/- 0.30%) per week premium.  Currently about $100 per call.  \n   * I set aside about \\~30% of the premium in case I need to roll.\n   * I reinvest about 50% on more TQQQ.  In a taxable account, you should set aside \\~20% or so for taxes.   In a tax-protected account, you can increase the overall growth by reinvesting more.\n\n**FAQs about TQQQ:** \n\nI've heard that [TQQQ is widely held to be an unsuitable instrument for long term investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lg063f/some_tqqq_tips/)  (Credit to [u/madmax\\_br5](https://www.reddit.com/user/madmax_br5/) for this part)  \n\nVolatility drag does not decay leveraged instruments enough to bleed significant value.   \n\n* It is true that leverage will cause some drag in certain market conditions, but the examples often cited show unrealistic market behavior of daily 5% up/downswings in the underlying index for long periods of time. This does not match the trending realities of indexes, which tend to operate in periods of uptrend and periods of consolidation. Highly volatile sideways markets are not an example case that is replicated in real market data.\n\nTQQQ as a 3X fund could ***not*** be wiped out in a single day.\n\n* Daily leverage reset means that declines experience negative compounding and are thus asymptotic in nature.\n* The only way TQQQ could go completely bankrupt is if the market had a 33.3% or greater crash ***in a single day***.  Not only has this never happened in history (the worst single-day drop ever was a [22.6% drop in 1987)](https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/19/investing/romans-numeral-black-monday/index.html), but it is now impossible thanks to a 20% market-wide circuit breaker.\n\nHigh fees ***do not*** offset the advantage of leverage.\n\n* This is nonsense. The annual fee rate of 0.95% is actually incredibly reasonable considering you get 3X leverage for this price of entry. \n\nLet's do some backtesting courtesy of [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/). \n\n**Here is a \"BUY AND HOLD\" backtest on TQQQ**\n\n[$10,000 grows to $588,657 for a CAGR of 49.8&#37; over a decade](https://preview.redd.it/qbvz8oa6pbh61.png?width=2661&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe58fc7181c1ff97ccc2e5832070c886f04c6a4)\n\n**Here is a backtest of buying $10,000 of TQQQ in 2011 and letting it ride.**  \n\n[$10,000 investment grew to $588,657 in a decade with a \\\\\"buy-and-hold\\\\\" strategy.](https://preview.redd.it/bmy9pnirmbh61.png?width=2649&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a123e076745d0ed667f0bb12b4bbef4aef6d90)\n\n**Here is a backtest of buying $10,000 of TQQQ in 2011 and selling 0.25 - 0.34 delta weekly covered calls at \\~7 DTE, reinvesting 50% of the premium, and rolling to avoid assignment.**\n\n[$10,000 grew to $1,033,016 by selling weekly 0.25 - 0.34 delta TQQQ covered calls at \\~7 DTE, reinvesting 50&#37; of the premium, and rolling to avoid assignment.
