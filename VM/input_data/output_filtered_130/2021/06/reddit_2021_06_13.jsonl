FAA Approval due in 6-12 months after 45\\/45 succesful test flights](https://preview.redd.it/wqhoa8zkn3571.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea18cec433c1e6df28354cf013052b6ee5141811)\n\nI have been long and extremly bullish on Workhorse Group since late last March. I have come to know the company well and stayed long (I did lose some shares playing margin like an idiot) even after its dramatic fall post USPS crash. This company is one of those the where the technlogy and holdings they have is worth far more than the paltry market cap of $2 Billion. Rivian, for example, is coming to market at an IPO of $70 Billion and when you compare the two companies head to head there really isn't that much difference besides a valuation of 35x more.\n\nWith Workhorse getting so much attention from retail investors now, I believe a merger may be in play before retail investors \"run up the score\" on a company that was wrongly targeted for bankruptcy by Wall Street hedge funds.General Motors in recent months announced a new commercial targeted EV company called Brightdrop. They are starting with a 600 cubic feet van and their first customer to sign on is Fed Ex. Workhorse Group has a 450 cf van, 650 cf van, and a 1000 cf van in their lineup. Adding to that is their patent for truck launched drone which is said to be possibily worth billions once cleared by the FAA which is roughly 6-12 months away according to company guidance. Both companies also own a stake in Lordstown Motors. Lordstown Motors (RIDE) is a spinoff of Workhorse Group and they kept a 10% stake along with commisions on the first 200,000 Endurances that sell. GM owns roughly 5% of the company after being a PIPE investor and basically giving them a fully equiped plant for pennies on the dollar. GM co-owns a new battery plant - along with LG - that will feed their EV supply line located right across the street from the old GM Plant (the third largest auto plant in the United States). You don't invest billions of dollars in the same area as an old plant if you don't have plans to make money on that property down the line going forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GM's Brightdrop Division FedEx EV Truck](https://preview.redd.it/1gv14kzrn3571.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a23fb669d6477fcf709cc03cf4d75fc4db22ad9)\n\nIf Elon Musk is as much of a maverick as I think he is though he could put a monkey wrench in the entire thing. If he were to buy out Workhorse (I believe they would be willing to part with the company for about $10 Billion which is about $65 a share) he would then have direct competitor to Brightdrop right out of the gate and a larger stake in Lordstown Motors than GM had going forward. They could also give LMC a lifeline in cash infusion (as GM may possibily do as well) to ramp up as they are currently cash stressed.\n\nNow that Workhorse is again the center of the markets attention, and the cost of business will likely go up because of it, don't be suprised to start hearing some merger chatter like we did a few months back. It makes sense for both GM and Tesla to get them while they are cheap. Merger Monday is just a couple days away but buy your ticket regardless because if I am thinking it there is a good chance auto execs are as well.", "id": "nz6aon", "created_utc": 1623619197.0, "score": 327, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "Most likely never happens, but f it I trust you.
