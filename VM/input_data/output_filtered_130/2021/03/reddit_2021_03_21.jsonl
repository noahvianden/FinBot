If it does not need to be cooled then great.\n\nBasically, you are taking an approach to building a vehicle, that supposedly saves you some money due to eliminating the axle, differential (although if you have two motors in the back then you don't need that anyways), and reduction gears (well if RIDE can have a 1:1 ratio, not sure why you need those either). In other words, you are eliminating minimal parts from the vehicle (how about just a single motor in the rear and the front, with a a few extra drive parts... the cost savings don't make sense) and going with a method of building a vehicle that does not seem to make sense.\n\nMy bet is they never get to mass production.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "You really ought to look into the motor technology more. Unsprung weight from the motors isn't that big a deal; it's a truck, not a race car. Sealed bearings have no difficulty withstanding mud and grit, thats standard engineering stuff. Cooling the motors is a nonstarter, if you can keep brake rotors cool with air you can keep in-wheel motors cool the same way, even if you have to go with fans like on some high-performance racing vehicles when needed at low speed. Liquid cooling could definitely be in the future for high-powered applications; Elaphe does make some seriously powerful motors. That said, I do expect the Endurance to utilize some form of active cooling in the future, at least for work-truck models.\n\nAptera is using the same type of motors and have undergone fairly extensive road testing, and are nearly ready to roll out the first batch of cars. Lordstown trucks are even easier to make since they aren't optimizing for range and efficiency; it's just a truck frame, batteries, and motors. That's it. No motor/transmission engineering, no drivetrain; all cost savings. Roll that into the RV deal with Camping World and you've got another sellable product before the first even rolls off the line, and you can kit the hell out of the camper with solar panels for virtually unlimited range. \n\nHonestly, I'm really more bullish on Elaphe than either of the two. The motor tests are extremely impressive! Like I mentioned, you likely won't find the motors in a racing vehicle, but they are more than adequate for your typical passenger vehicle and you should expect to find them on more cars in the future.\n\nAs for mass production, I don't see them competing in the short term to beat out Big 3 sales, but it's a massive foothold and a genuine success story. When they do start rolling off the line they will have the single best vantage point to dominate the off-road EV space, being years ahead of any large competitors. I fully expect GM or Ford to straight-up buy them out in the future, and at that point whoever does throws their engineering and manufacturing know-how full force into making them at existing factories. I'm more bullish with GM on that end, what with saving face over the Nikola acquisition debacle, but also because the Endurance even looks like a Silverado replacement. I wouldn't count Ford out on gobbling it up though.\n\nMind you I don't have a RIDE position, but I do like the stock and think it's got amazing potential. The price point is also very reasonable, although it may be sold at a loss at that price to get market penetration. Kind like what GM did with the first Corvette-8 model because people weren't quite sure about it with a mid-engine layout.\n\nRegardless, in-wheel motors simplify the entire design of EVs and you should expect to see them in more cars in the future, perhaps even in a more consumer-friendly Tesla model.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Aptera - A lightweight car should not be compared to the endurance. The forces you are dealing with are much less which likely makes a huge difference.\n\nUnsprung weight... I don't know. When every person who has designed autos says unsprung weight is bad and then someone comes along and says, well if that unsprung weight is a motor in each wheel it is not a big deal without proving that (I don't care about their claims of miles driven... probably something like their claims of pre-sales) is simply ridiculous to buy that claim. I am looking for vehicles out there that use Elaphe motors and can't find anything. They made a test mule. Nice. Again, not a mass produced vehicle and frankly the demos of it they show are of minimal value.\n\nFurther, in wheel motors seems to really limit how you can build the motors. I don't know, but something about EV's tells me that efficiency is critical. The Endurance just does not seem will be very efficient.\n\nOh, also is really a centrally located motor (especially if your motor is the size of the one Lucid claims to have) with a diff and axle really more expensive and less convenient than two in wheel motors (with in wheel motors you need two minimally for front or rear wheel drive, whereas you can have one regular motor instead).\n\nFYI, there is no need for a transmission with an EV in any case. The only time you would need a transmission is if you want a gear for high speed and one for low speed, which RIDE anyways is not designed for. Bottom line, I am not sure the cost saving claims make sense in the first place.\n\nMy point about mass production is not whether they have a factory (well if a factory is all it took, then where is all the big automakers EV pickup trucks?), but rather they can actually figure out how to build these trucks and motors properly. I just don't see it happening. I mean the moron in the hard hat and his shiny yellow jacket straight-up lied about pre-orders in order to jack up the stock price (if the company is on such solid ground no idea why he would have felt a need to do that), but I guess you should believe him about some hard to achieve claims.\n\nBottom line, you are not simplifying the  design, rather you are creating many more complications to how you build it. A motor in the center with an open diff (a small device) connected to two metal shafts that turn the wheels, is pretty simple already. Needing two motors is already a complication. Adding unsprung weight is not good. The performance attributes of a design limited by the wheel, with no  ability to use reduction gears, is questionable. The overengineering of the wheel to get this motor in also makes no sense. Finally, the greater forces that will act on the wheel when you hit a bump or pothole also don't make things  better.\n\nWhen I first saw the design, I thought it was brilliant as it seemed to simplify things, but the more I dig, the less it makes sense. Whatever, soon enough we find out who is right here.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Aptera - A lightweight car should not be compared to the endurance. The forces you are dealing with are much less which likely makes a huge difference.\n\nGo to Elaphe's website, if you wanted to convert your boat-hauler SUV to an all electric stump-puller they got motors that'll fit your steering knuckle and put out 1100 ft-lbs apiece.\n\n>I don't know, but something about EV's tells me that efficiency is critical.\n\nYes, electrical motor efficiency is quite important, but ultimately people buy vehicles to do things with them. If they left them in the driveway the lifelong efficiency approaches 100%, but they aren't very useful.\n\n>but rather they can actually figure out how to build these trucks and motors properly\n\nThey aren't building the motors, and truck frames are about as simple as you can get. People literally make them by hand in custom shops. As for making them crash-safe, everyone uses FEA programs, it's nothing secret that only the Big 3 have access to.\n\n>Needing two motors is already a complication.\n\nAnd a powertrain isn't? You've got electric motors either way, adding more and heavier powertrain components makes the design more complicated, not less. Can't get much more simple than the wheel being literally the only moving part.\n\n>Finally, the greater forces that will act on the wheel when you hit a bump or pothole also don't make things better.\n\nHigher unsprung weight means there is less wear-and-tear on the vehicle, not more. Your tires take the brunt of the impulse forces because it's harder to move the entire assembly. Matching springs and struts to the extra weight is a trivial matter of course.\n\nAnd since you can't find an Elaphe use case I'll just leave this here: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/10/03/elaphe-in-wheel-drive-audi-r8-0-60-cleantechnicaexclusive/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I am aware of the Audi R8 they built and the 5 second video they showed. It means next to nothing.\n\nRegarding unsprung mass, the heavier your wheel, the greater the force of every impact your tire has with an uneven surface on the road. It will destroy your suspension sooner. It will destroy your rims sooner. It will cause the tire to have excess wear. The forces of those impact are going to make it harder to engineer your motor as it has to stand up to stronger forces. You have more wear and tear, not less.\n\nUnsprung mass means your brakes wear out faster as well, so it makes your vehicle less safe.\n\nAnd your comment about efficiency makes no sense. No one is talking about leaving it in the driveway as that has nothing to do with efficiency. Efficiency is being able to do more with less, not sitting around doing nothing.\n\nThe rest is just getting ridiculous. If EV's were so easy to build everyone would be doing it and no one would care about RIDE's ridiculous claims. You are talking about two motors on a Endurance for one motor by a competitor. You can't simply wave your hand and ignore the cost difference of two versus one motors and say well, that two motors makes more sense then some drivetrain components. The cost of a second motor is most likely going to be more expensive then a piece of metal to connect the motor to the wheel. This line of thinking just makes no sense. \n\nTell me, since you think what they are doing makes sense, what is the cost of two of their motors versus the cost of a single motor and a few pieces of metal to connect that to both wheels. With an open diff, and computer controlled braking (Tesla does this on the Model S) you can direct torque to the wheel that needs it easily enough.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know what to tell you other than a Tesla rear drive unit can be had for 3 grand on ebay, and that Elaphe has regenerative braking and torque vectoring. Elaphe is the CLEAR winner in terms of torque vectoring because of direct drive and not having a differential. If you thought that was some sort of Tesla exclusive you'd be just as remissed being told you don't understand impulse response in a dynamic system and why unsprung weight in a big ass truck literally does not matter with critically damped suspension.\n\nAs for cost, electric motors are dirt cheap because they are extremely simple. It's why we use them for pretty much everything instead of any other alternative. Endurance needs 4 of the same hub motors. Does Tesla even use the same motors for front and rear applications? Tesla also needs the power transfer units, so that's another two different parts made in two different plants. And the axles, can't forget those, also probably different parts for front and back. Cradle casters, pretty important. Several factories all involved in just the powertrain, and you still have to assemble those parts, and then assemble the cradle assemblies before they can even think about taking them to the assembly line to put in a car.\n\nMeanwhile at Lordstown: hub motors come in, hub motors get bolted into the knuckle at the end of the line and the tires go on. Boom, done. Take it off the lift and drive it home.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are throwing  out things that make no sense. Torque vectoring is pretty much only relevant if you are driving fast, which the in-wheel motor design does not make sense for. Critical damping maybe affects ride comfort but it does not change the force of the unsprung mass hitting bumps. There is one single thing separate motors gives you that you can't achieve with a single motor easily and that is you can have the wheels spin opposite directions. Would allow a tighter turning radius.\n\nAlso, power transfer units? Tesla's are either rear wheel drive (single motor) or four wheel drive (dual or tri motor... tri motor allows for torque vectoring). You are just making stuff up.\n\nOf course you are likely correct that Tesla's design requires a few more steps to assemble the drive train. The amount of work and cost though associated with that may very well cost less then having to put in extra motors. In any case, the in wheel design is an unproven design that inherently makes less sense. There is a reason why everyone for as long back as you can look has done whatever they can to reduce unsprung mass. The issues with it don't magically go away because you have electric motors there.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’m the one making stuff up? Like how you can magically crabwalk an open differential? I’m pretty sure I mentioned earlier that Aptera uses torque vectoring for aerodynamics. Vectoring comes into play all the time, especially in off-road settings! And you get that by default because of the simplicity of the hub motor design, no need to keep adding motors and transfer boxes onto an existing design. \n\nAs for an unproven design, the first electric hub motor was patented in 1880. Porsche made a car with them over a century ago. \n\nAnd unsprung weight? Nobody fucking cares about it. You move the weight of the engine and transmission out to the motors, and still have a net loss of weight. Spring rates and shock resistance takes care of the rest. You don’t minimize it just to minimize it, otherwise we’d all be running drum brakes and unvented rotors as a premium feature!\n\nY’all are getting hung up on dumb shit that doesn’t matter.
