{"title": "Taking profits - how?", "selftext": "Hello, I am up about 50% on AAPL and 20% on MSFT. Would be more but I do not live in US so FX plays a big part in reducing my profits. \n\nI would like to take out the gains. \n\nQuestions is: \n- Do I sell all of my stocks, then take out the profit ( for instance MSFT sell all, take 20% off the table) , and reinvest? Is that the normal way? \n- how do you only take out the profit, leaving the rest in? Is that possible? \n\nI am long on these, but profit taking this week.\n\nEDIT: I literally got a response within a minute. No bad words, no this and that- straight to the points and Also advice. Great sub. Thank you.\n\nEDIT 2: the profits are going into a apartment to rent out. I have times where I regret not selling and re-entry. That is why I would lock profit, reinvest in property and still keep the initial investment.\n\nEDIT 3; I live in Norway. Tax is 31,68% on gains + FX USD/NOk screwed me a bit.

For example, if you bought Microsoft in 3 orders over 3 months, each at different prices, you can choose to sell stocks out of the shares that you bought at the highest price, minimizing your realized gains and storing the unrealized gains in your unsold shares. Liquidating the shares that have the highest cost basis first is a good way to minimize your taxable gains, if you have held the stocks for less than a year, making them short-term gains, and you can pay less tax by holding onto more unrealized gains for a longer period of time.\n\nIt‚Äôs also not unusual to have gains in some shares you bought be in the red for shares you bought when the stock price was high. By selling the shares with the highest cost basis first, in those situations, you can even claim capital losses while holding onto the shares with potentially taxable gains. Because all the stocks shares have the same today-price, you are getting the same amount of money for the same number of shares, no matter which tax lot of shares you sell", "score": 317, "replies": [{"body": "This has puzzled me for a while - how can you choose which shares you sell?\n\nDon‚Äôt all brokers just start with your most recently bought shares and then work their way backwards when selling?", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "it might depend on your broker.

So basically, each share you sell at $110 is going to cost you $25+ in capital gains taxes to the IRS, and capital gains are taxed as ordinary income at the margin in California so maybe another $13-$14 to the tax franchise board.\n\nOr you can sell the ones that are only up a few hundred percent and maybe pay only $15 in federal cap gains and $10 in state ordinary gains.\n\nSo your choice is, sell for $110 and pay about $40 per share to the various governments? Or sell for $110 and pay about $25 per share? Remember, average home prices shot up last year, and California Bay Area single family houses averaged just under a million. So call it a round $200000 for an average down payment, plus extra to pay off the taxes. How much extra? Well, divide that by $110 per share and you‚Äôll have to sell about 1820 shares for the down payment alone. Would you rather be paying $75000 extra in taxes, or $45000 in taxes?

One way to check this is to look at the P/E.  I own Apple and it's p/e is 31 right now. That's fine for me so I'm holding.  The only change I would make for my apple stock is buying more if it drops.  \n\nAnother stock to look at is SQ.  It has a p/e of 324.  I think that is crazy and is too high.  If I had some I would sell.  I think SQ is a great company, but its overpriced right now.  Same for TSLA.  It has a p/e of 659.  That means the company is making $1 per year for each share of stock.
