{"title": "Some Basic but very useful Options help from a full-time trader", "selftext": "I posted this as a reply to a thread in WallStreetBets.  I thought someone might find it useful.\n\nThe stocks you pick to trade options also matter a great deal.  For example; I prefer NVDA & TSLA lately because they often recover very well from selloffs and will give you clearer direction.  Both obviously are popular and their profitability will continue to bring in more buyers.  Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  \n\nIf you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.  For example XLE - Energy, XLF - Financials, etc.  These ETFs can still make you good money and won't move dramatically in either position.  They can help you learn the mechanics and make money at the same time without exhausting your mental energy.\n\nMy personal basic strategy is to find the ITM call or put that has the highest open interest and volume.  These usually have the tightest spreads and make it easy for me to move in and out.\n\nTry not to focus on the P/L, as you will get shaken out easily, but rather trade the chart. Sell half of your position at predetermined resistance levels that lose momentum without hesitation.  This will ensure profitable trades. \n\nAlso, if you are newer to options trading then I recommend only trading 1 contract at a time as this will keep your stress level down and allow you understand how the particular stock/option you are in behaves.  (Yes, they have their own behavior lol). \n\nIf you are more of an intermediate trader then slowly add to your position.  If i intend to buy 10 contracts I will add 1-2 at the point when I get to my target entry.  Often times what we believe is a great entry will temporarily break down and offer us a better entry.  This is when I will add more.  If I don't get the small capitulation move down then i add on the way up.  All of this is fine and never beat yourself up for not getting it \"perfect\".\n\nThese are the lessons I've learned and allow me to consistently make money and trade for a living.", "id": "r2rp22", "created_utc": 1637945844.0, "score": 610, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "If you’re new to options, trading Tesla is an absolutely horrendous idea", "score": 235, "replies": [{"body": "I can't stop trading Tesla options, picking otm calls four weeks away and usually selling the same day or at least the same week.\nIts like a drug, spend 5-6 thousand to make 5-6 hundred a day.....I guess it works until it doesn't.\nI bought an 1150 call right before close today after selling my call from the morning, I'll let everyone know how it goes because I still can't understand why slight moves are more profitable for OTM calls than ATM, seems like it should be opposite.\n\n\n\nEdit:.

The 2 minute helps me see what's happening now while the 5 & 15 help me understand the trend.  In my right monitor I have the 1 hour and the daily chart split.  These give me the satellite view.  I tend to focus much more on those time frames only if the stock is getting close to a major moving average.\n\nFor example: Say I'm trading NVDA and it has sold off heavily in the morning but the NASDAQ (I watch the Qs QQQ) is still green and trending long.  I then need to understand why NVDA sold off.  (I follow these stocks everyday so I typically know) but if there isn't any news then it could be because we are at an ATH, profit taking ect.  I then expect a recovery but that means absolutely nothing until the chart gives me confirmation.\n\nFrom here I will look for a strong bottom wick on the 15 minute or a hammer.  The 5min & 2min will show me if this is developing.  If I get the potential 15 minute reversal candle then I want to see a confirmation candle.
