{"title": "Tesla valuation is really crazy", "selftext": "Not shitting on Tesla. I am not a bear as well. Just making a statement. I like Tesla. I recently did some research(average joe research) regarding electric cars and Tesla is really ahead of the curve in one aspect. Their quality might not be great but as long as the car works and does what’s it supposed to do for 10 years I guess it’s acceptable. But the one aspect where they are ahead is their solid charging network. \n\nBut the reason I say it’s got a over bloated valuation is because of the below excerpt from a CNN article. \n\n“As recently as 2005, Toyota was No. 4 in US sales, with GM, Ford and what was then known as DaimlerChrysler all in front, with a combined 57% of US sales between them. But in 2021, GM, Ford and Stellantis — the European automaker that owns Chrysler — had only 38% of the US market between them in the first nine months of the year. Even adding in Tesla only gets the US automakers to just over 40% of sales.” \n\nThe last line shows that Tesla staggering sales only adds up to 2 percent of US sales but it’s valuation is 2% of the total US stock market valuation( 48 trillion).", "id": "rw0em3", "created_utc": 1641319045.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla is a margin and growth story. All valuation comparisons generally don't factor these two things in. Most ICE manufactures have little to no growth with declining margins while Tesla is one of the fastest mega cap companies in the US with expanding margins. You also need to consider the fact ICE manufactures are now facing an existential crisis and will need to invest large amounts of money into EVs for years before they're likely to make any profit on them. You just can't compare the two.\n\nPeople also rarely appreciate investor sentiment. An investment in Tesla is more than just an investment in another vehicle manufacture to most people. It's a bet on the future, on Elon, on the transition to green energy, on AI, etc. Whether it's a good idea to bet on these things or not, people will pay a premium for companies they believe in beyond their financials. A lot investing isn't rational. Investors buy into narratives. You can choose to ignore this if you wish, but it is what it is.\n\nI don't own TSLA because I think the best days are behind them in terms of stock growth. I think it's still got upside potential, but competition is coming and TSLA likely can't continue growing at the pace they have been. I wouldn't bet against them though.

Not accounting for energy business at all\n\n2. Shanghai production numbers is conservative given the current run rate is ~800,000 with the factory still ramping up and planned expansion with 30% more employees this year.\n\n3. Average selling price is conservative given Model Y is going to be the higher selling car which has a higher average selling price, as well as ramping up refreshed model S and X. Plus Tesla have been increasing prices in all of 2021 which will show in 2022.\n\n4. Operating margin is already at 15% and it will go a lot higher in 2021 q4 earnings, but I just kept it at 15% as Austin and Berlin factories could have poor margins as they start to ramp production.\n\n5.  I think 125 pe is a fair value given 1.7mil production would be ~83% increase on last year (930,000) , which gives a PEG ratio of 1.5 (fairly cheap) assuming earnings are proportional to deliveries.

Ramping problems at Austin and Berlin factories\n\n4. 4680 battery cell ramp difficulties\n\n5. Car prices drop globally, forcing tesla to lower prices and hence margins\n\nA common mistake that people make is comparing Tesla's valuation to legacy automakers. There are 3 key differences that cause such contrasting valuations:\n\n1. Tesla's cars are 3x more profitable at scale than legacy manufacturers\n\n2. Legacy automakers are hundreds of billions of dollars in debt.. each, pushing down their market cap. Their Enterprise Value figures are much higher.\n\n3. Legacy automakers are priced to have declining sales in the future. If they were growing revenues at 70% a year like Tesla they would get multiples an order of magnitude higher.\n\nHope this helps!
