Since the market is driven by sentiment and not rationality, this is a huge overlooked piece of the game. More people preparing for a recession means: more saving money, hiring freezes, better uses of disposable incomes, tightening of budgets, which affect the economy significantly. Specifically, they affect money velocity, which is a huge component of the stock market crash of 1929.\n\nThis time is different, and we don’t know how bad it’s going to be. Especially when one considers the real estate market and crypto currency. Those are entirely different landscapes than what existed in the original stagflation even of the 70s and 80s - (crypto wasn’t even born yet)\n\nThe silver lining is that we have experienced similar events to what’s happening now in the past, which means we have a better understanding of how to best hedge ourselves, which is what the fed is attempting to do. \n\nThe harsh reality is: we already used up the tricks we learned from the GND in the 1930s to prevent a massive economic crash in 2020 due to COVID.

Let's call these people \"bubble investors\" and they include a range of pros as well as a lot of retail investors/401K investors. Let's call the overpriced large- and mega-cap tech/growth stocks they persistently plow money into in the belief that 25 years from now they will be worth 10x what they are today, \"bubble stocks\".\n\nThe fact is, more and more non-bubble-mentality investors are no longer interested in being invested in these inflated, played out, and in some cases, bloated companies. And since these bubble stocks make up so much of the market cap weighting, that means the broad market indexes are unappealing as well (although slightly less so). So long as bubble investors keep these overplayed, overpriced stocks bloated, the market is unappealing. Not only that because these investors with their side plays (like options plays) keep draining market cap from the hundreds of more worthy investments, keeping the market cap of non-bubble stocks from holding onto any long term growth, the part of the stock market that doesn't include bloated/overplayed tech/growth/mega caps is also unappealing. \n\nWhen a bear market sets in, it's for large macroeconomic & market reasons. The old investments just don't work anymore but they continue to dominate the market trading, which is the case here with the overpriced large- and mega-cap tech/growth plays. Because we're still seeing large cycles of trading where people are sucking market cap from stock that are solid investments, to put into their overplayed pandemic-bloated tech/growth stocks, it seems that the bubble investors still have to lose more money before they will allow the new market leaders to take over. The bear market won't bottom until the old market leaders lose their power to dominate trades and new market leaders take over. I think it's fair to say that those people who continue to cling to their overpriced, played out mega caps & tech/growth stocks are the ones who are preventing the market from bottoming. \n\nAnd that's what it really boils down to when people say that \"capitulation\" has to occur before the market can bottom. The bubble investors have to let go of their bloated stocks and allow other sectors to rise before the market bottoms. Because by continuing to take cap from other more investment-worthy sectors and plowing it back into their bubble stocks, the market continues to be a sketchy place for the more strategic investors to want to put their money into. \n\nAt this point, I'm waiting for the bubble stock investors to capitulate.

I think part of it is that people are invested in the market and think anything negative posted on the subreddit will hurt their positions in the market.\n\nI will say it is really hard to be neutral.  Speaking for myself.  In 2008 I thought the drop would be worse and longer.  We pulled out way, way, way faster than I ever expected.\n\nSo it makes me thing that maybe I am too negative?   I tend to be someone that worries about things more than the average person.  Something I have been working on.\n\nWhat people also sometimes do not realize is that the market does not like uncertainty more than any other thing.   Plus it is focused on the future.   So not layoff today but what do things look like will happen down the road.\n\nSo even if things are bad today but there seems to be some data that we are pulling out the market will run.\n\nIf I had to guess.  I think we are still early in things and we will get more pain.  That this recently rally will not last and we will test new lows.\n\nI personally have taken some preparation for that situation.  I for example recently paid off all our debt.   Our house was already paid off but we had a home equity loan.\n\nI am retired but have 8 kids and so we do have considerble expense.    I have also looked at cutting back some stuff.  So for example we had pretty much every streaming service and I canceled Showtime.  I canceled my Audible account that had 23 credits because I never use them.   My kids carry a credit card and is suppose to be more for emergencies but some of my kids, and mostly one, take advantage of that too much.   The biggest issue for us is my kids do the grocery shopping instead of me and my wife.
