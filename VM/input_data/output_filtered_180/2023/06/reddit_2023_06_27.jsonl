The December $65 calls should be trading at or very near to the [parity price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parityprice.asp) of $70.70 - $65 = $5.70. However, you see that it is being quoted at $5.20 if you sell the calls.

How else can you close an in-the-money option that is trading below [parity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parityprice.asp)?

Then, when the sell order is executed, immediately exercise the [call option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp). \n\nIn the example, the stock is currently trading at $70.70.
