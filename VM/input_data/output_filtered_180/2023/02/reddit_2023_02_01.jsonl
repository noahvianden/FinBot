I had to go through the earnings report again to just to find this and I found it. Here is a copy and paste straight from their investor relations page from their Q4 earnings.\n\n“Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, Intel expects total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion, including an approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses and a $1.2 billion decrease in 2023 ending inventory values. Intel’s Q1 2023 outlook includes an estimated $350 million to $500 million benefit to operating margin or $0.07 to $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to operating expenses. The change in depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in cost savings in 2023 or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3 2022 earnings.”  \n \nKeep in mind this is perfectly legal but omg does this not look complete sus or what. Their revenue and income is getting torn to shreds so they jack up the value of their machinery and equipment by saying it has a longer life span to make it look like their assets are worth more then they really are.

Intel should be examined by one measure: are their products good and competitive in the market? \n\nOn one front we have their foundries. They have been performing absolutely terribly over the last 8 years. But there is some hope here. Their latest node, Intel 7 while delayed by roughly 8 years has successfully ramped to large volume so at least that went somewhat well at the end. Their next node, Intel 4 is extremely close to being ready for ramping and there doesn't seem to be anything in the way of them being able to ramp this year. Intel 3 should ramp next year and again, no indication of any delays. If they manage to get just these two nodes right then they will close essentially the entire gap with TSMC. Intel 20 should be ramping in 2025 or 2026 which is exactly in line with TSMC 2 nanometer. TSMC 3nm is ramping right now. \n\nOn another front we have their architectures. Their last few products were bad not because of architecture but because of their nodes. Raptor lake gets BETTER performance than zen 4 while being a node behind. That is very impressive. So as long as their architecture continues to progress at the same pace as before, it should at least remain somewhat competitive. \n\nIntel is also getting into the GPU space and their first product, arc while having terrible drivers has actually performed relatively decently ish. Their next generation should be fully competitive by all metrics with amd and Nvidia. \n\nTldr: if Intel can get their next 2 nodes right which as of right now there is no indication that they won't, then they will be competitive with amd and tsmc.
