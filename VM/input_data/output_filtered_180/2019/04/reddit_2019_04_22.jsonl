This is almost 700% the power consumption of the Tesla HW3's 72 Watts. \n\n>Why should we be concerned... There is a huge battery to power the computer.\n\n1. There is an impact to range.  A Model 3 RWD can be expected to consume about 270 wh/mile in mixed driving (will vary depending on weather, road grade, etc.).  Over a 2 hour drive, that's a 3.7 mile reduction in range. \n2. 500 Watts needs a lot of cooling.  Think about how hot an old 60 Watt incandescent lightbulb gets, and then imagine the heat output of a bit more than 8 of these bulbs in a concentrated space.  That means bigger, more expensive cooling systems.  The increased size of the system means less space for other things.\n\n>  Safety is the primary design requirement here and that requires speed.\n\nThis statement does not reflect good engineering practice.  The relevant question to ask is: **\"how much performance does the system need to be able to perform the specified task\"**.  It never makes sense to put something outrageously more powerful than necessary into a system.  For example, a MacBook Air used for office work doesn't need a 64-core server-grade CPU.  *More speed won't necessarily lead to more safety*.  The software is just as important.  System computational capacity has to be balanced against cost and physical constraints.  \n\nTesla's team thinks they have made the right tradeoffs and struck the right balance between performance, power consumption, and physical size.
