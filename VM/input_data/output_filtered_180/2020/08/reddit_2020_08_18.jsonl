{"title": "RKT: $30 PT Free Money", "selftext": "TLDR: Feeling content and generous. Will send $200 to random comments on this post WHEN RKT hits $30. Will use random generator to choose 1 persons. Payment will be via Paypal/Venmo. \n\nDisclaimer: This is not an attempt to pump the stock. Don’t pump it cause I’d like a gradual run up. Also, I have 25k in shares and 2k in calls, so $30 would be a big payday for me (just being as transparent as possible). \n\nI’m just feeling pretty content with the past couple weeks of trading. By no means am I one of those gain porn 2000% profit dudes, but I’ve been doing pretty good. I just want to show some appreciation for you comedians out there (the purple dudes, the nikola dudes, the Kodak dudes). Seeing your guys’ post prior to their earnings has saved me from buying in those sinking ships, so inverse was good.\n\nBtw, another one of these posts on r/TeamRKT because the people there are all going ham on this stock! I am selecting one for that thread, and another for wsb, so don’t worry fam!\n\nGood luck all! Spread the good karma.\n\nWINNER!!!:\n\nu/tarkshank123", "id": "ibvpvx", "created_utc": 1597731606.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "go suck a bassoon through your tulip nose", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "A lot of us on the same boat. r/TeamRKT if you haven’t heard of it yet haha", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Go slow or go big.
