They hold a premium value on top of their normal worth the longer they are out from the final day. Specifically, the Theta decay is at its highest the closer you are to the end day. What this means is if you are nowhere near your strike price by that last day, you are Out Of the Money (OTM) and your options are next to worthless. \n\nThat being said, if you have a highly volatile stock like NVDA that is known for swinging +4% up or down in a given day, you can have a strike price pretty far off that still holds value if you have days or more to go on the option.  This is why some options can be worth a pile of money OTM simply because the momentum on the stock shows it potentially moving in one direction or another. \n\nMy puts right now are... only at a $62 loss right now before market. If the stock drops by 0.63% by open it will be back at breakeven. Lmao  so if we see a 2 or 3% drop today I'll be sitting good.

I'm no expert by any means, just stuff I've learned this year playing around. Long options make you less money on the big spikes, but they have bonus premium from being so far out. And are generally safer because they have time to recover when things go the wrong direction. \n\nShort term options can make you loads of cash if they swing the right direction, but inherently are riskier because they don't have any time to recover. These are the \"all in\" options.
