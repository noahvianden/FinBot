{"title": "Tesla more like Deadsla", "selftext": "Hello fellow regards and thank you for coming to my Tesla talk. Today I am going to explain the bear case for TSLA in the short term\n\n1. I’m not a super technical trader/indicator freak, but TSLA is currently near or above overbought territory on every RSI timeframe, including 1mo, 3mo, 1y, and 5y. This can be explained by the hype surrounding delivery numbers, upcoming robotaxi event, and earnings. RSI is not the end all be all for a stock’s price but it’s good to note\n\n2. TSLA has been on a tear recently as investors are pricing in good delivery numbers, a successful robotaxi announcement, and good earnings. All it takes is ONE of these events to go poorly and investors will panic\n\n3. ROBOTAXI EVENT - this will probably be the biggest influence in the stock price for the short term, and I don’t think it will go well. Apart from Tesla’s history of screwing up announcements (see 6% drop after cybertruck fail), I simply don’t think Tesla has the technology to compete with Waymo, the main competitor for this type of product. Waymo is backed by google, a HUGE cloud storage provider. This means they’re able to train their models with more data, more TPU infrastructure, and a better AI team. Tesla, on the other hand, uses a vision-only model that requires a MASSIVE amount of data to be stored in places they don’t have. This is shown in their latest FSD versions, which experience about 180 miles per critical error. For reference, human drivers experience about 100,000 miles per critical error and Waymo is at 17,000. Unless Tesla is prepared to unleash some magical new tech stack that they’ve been hiding for some reason, I don’t think they have the tech to release a safe robotaxi to compete with Google. Safety is huge in the driverless car space, because most consumers are already on the fence about being a passenger in one. One misstep in the rollout and TSLA bears would have a field day. I also think that Elon is too full of himself to admit some of these things, so he would happily march out a product that isn’t ready for the public to use rather than acknowledge Tesla’s FSD shortcomings\n\n4. Future events - the nice thing about delivery numbers, robotaxi event, and earnings being in a span of a few weeks is that IV shouldn’t be a huge factor until after everything is all said and done, and you could probably make money buying puts OR calls before the robotaxi event and simply selling the volatility. \n\nObviously nobody can predict how earnings will go, but I think one of the main reasons investors give for Tesla’s ridiculous PE is its market share, advanced technology, and production ability in the EV space. While I still think it has some upside for those reasons, I think other EV companies are chipping away at all 3. You can go on google right now and find open source code that performs nearly as well as Tesla’s FSD and vision models.\n\nTL;DR - I think there is more downside opportunity than upside with Tesla, and I think bad performance in upcoming numbers and events will tank the stock that has risen 25% in the last month\n\nPositions: \n10x $230p 10/11\n5x $240p 10/11\n5x $240p 10/18\n2x $250p 10/18", "id": "1fqy99e", "created_utc": 1727471483.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 week ago\n**Total Comments** | 8 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "260 and breaking 🤣", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "You were saying?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I'm thinking it will move back up near 225-230 then I'm going to grab puts for earnings.

Your entire point is completely invalidated by the fact that you don't understand that they continue to be the leader in a huge growth field.  Q3 will be Tesla's highest selling quarter ever.  2024 will be Tesla's highest selling year ever.  \n\nAnd all of that has happened in a high interest rate environment with recession concerns.  Watch what happens in 2025 as interest rates come down and economic concerns vanish.  Auto will resume 50% growth.\n\nAnd on top of all of that energy and software will be meaningfully contributing to revenue.\n\nAs for self-driving, we'll see.  Tesla has by far the most autonomous miles driven by any company in the world.  Their business model will scale and generate revenue far in excess of any of the competitors.  And it's the only software that's actually AI and not just line after line of \"if-then\" coding, remote drivers and geo-fenced locations.  Regulatory approval isn't the end goal.  True autonomy is and Tesla is leading that race by a mile.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla auto sales will be flat this year. Zero growth. They are growing unit sales in China with incentives like 0 interest rate loans but these are low margin sales that will continue to drive down automotive gross margin. High margin sales growth is negative in the US and Europe.\n\nIt’s clear you have zero understanding on what Waymo is doing. They use AI/ML at every level of the self driving stack from perception, to tracking, to behavior prediction, to mapping, to planning and control. There are no if then statements. It’s geofenced because that’s a requirement for L4 systems and a natural stepping stone in development, gaining both regulator and public trust on the long road to full autonomy. \n\nThey also have zero remote drivers. They have remote assistance monitoring the fleet as will be required with any robotaxi service. The remote assistance operators cannot drive the vehicles remotely as the latency is too large and it is dangerous. They can simply provide suggestions like potential paths to the autonomous driving system to get unstuck if they come to a stop and cannot determine best path forward. There is no remote driving going on the autonomous driving system is in control at all times.\n\nAlso Tesla’s approach is deeply flawed because imitating real world drivers and taking the average behavior is just dumb. You should be determining the best potential actions using reinforcement learning and physics based simulators. You can simulate every possible action and outcome for a potential situation instead of only having what was recorded. You can also simulate exceedingly rare situations that will never be captured with real data. Waymo has already studied Tesla’s approach in depth years ago (plenty of papers out there) and determined it will never be reliable enough for L4/L5.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "😂😂😂😂", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Bought more today.
