Friday morning I woke up to a message saying I was assigned and my cash value had changed. So what happened? I was forced to buy 1,000 shares of RVN at $19 instead of market value $14.50. In doing so, my cost was the difference after my premium for entering the trade was completely eaten away. Then I was left with the choice of holding the shares or exercising the long leg of the spread which was selling those same shares for $16.50 now. I did this, and pretty much zeroed the trade out.
