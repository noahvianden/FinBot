{"title": "Upping My Stake in INTC--is this a bad move? [my analysis]", "selftext": "**Below is some of the \"research\" and thoughts I've put together regarding INTC.  Would love to get a sanity check.**\n\nI've been long INTC for a few months now.  The recent drop has given me pause, but ultimately, I'm thinking about upping my stake from a little less than 1% of my actively managed portfolio to closer to somewhere between 3% and 5%.\n\n**Edit - After some additional reading and responses, I don't think I'll move it from 1% to 3%.  I think maybe moving to 2% of my actively managed portfolio seems more prudent given some of the additional risks and competitive landscape that many of you have brought up.**\n\nThis isn't to say that INTC is a slam dunk.  The company is priced at value-level multiples because there is an incredible amount of risk and near-term pressure.  I don't think the risks are so bad that it is a clear \"value trap\" scenario but the risks are real:\n\n1. Gross margins contracted in 2021--in the middle of a chip shortage and a stay-at-home pandemic where consumer electronics are in demand, INTC was unable to exert pricing power\n2. I remember shopping for a laptop in 2018-19 and remember limiting my search to INTC processors because they were the premium brand...they're now the bargain (my sample size of one is completely valid--I'm a data scientist and approve this message)\n3. INTC is bringing in outside talent because they know that they are/were poorly managed--the debacle around their 10nm and 7nm chips speaks for itself\n4. INTC will be making large CAPEX over the next few years which will likely put additional pressure on margins, in particular, free cash flow which I'm addicted to like the fucking meth\n5. Near-term (at the very least), they are likely to yield market share--I don't think this is really a controversial statement\n\nFrom this, I have a few key takeaways:\n\n* Based on 1, 2, and 5, I think that INTC's brand and pricing power is diluted\n* Based on 1 and 3, I think it safe to say that Intel is/was poorly managed--while INTC has presented an impressive roadmap and recovery, its past performance suggests that it's middle management layer may be prone to fucking things up\n\nThe simple truth is that INTC carries with it massive risks.  It's a turnaround play that has to execute its roadmap with a high degree of competence--the type of competence its past management has shown that it lacks.  The big question for me is if this incompetence has seeped its way into the very cultural fabric of INTC.\n\nThat being said, INTC has recognized the problems and has been bringing in new leadership and managers.  Additionally, it has an impressive financial history that even management as incompetent as INTC's couldn't destroy.\n\n**EPS Growth:**  Using the average 10Y Inflation-Adjusted EPS\\* in 2014, INTC has been able to grow from $2.02 in EPS to $3.29 in 2021; this is a CAGR of 7.4%.  Again, this is an average EPS across the business and investment cycle, not point A to point B.  This is relatively impressive IMO as many mature companies have an earnings growth far less (as reference, DIS was at 2.4%; PFE was 4.5%).\n\n**Financial Strength:**  In the near-term, INTC is in a good position with massive Free Cash Flow ($11B in 2021), a low dividend payout ratio (<30%), and relatively low debt-to-equity (around 0.4).  Despite a series of missteps, INTC is still in strong financial position from which it can support a turn around without running the risk of dividend cuts.\n\n**Valuation:**  Using the metric above, INTC trades at about 15x it's 10Y Avg EPS.  Current Price-to-FCF stands at about 9x with a \\~2.8% dividend yield.  The PEG is worrying as its earnings are not forecasted to grow significantly relative to the current PE Ratio (I think it's about a 3x).  The valuation metrics are fairly sound--especially against a broader market that trades at 2.5x CAPE, but again, there is risk.\n\n**Future:**  INTC's i9 has been getting solid reviews and compares well to AMD's Ryzen 9 and may help provide a roadmap back into the premier space (I'm not going to clumsily recite details--Google the reviews and decide for yourself).\n\nOverall, I think there are a lot of risks with INTC.  In a different market where there were less risky plays trading at better multiples, I would probably pass on INTC.  But, the market is what it is and INTC does seem to be righting the ship.  I do think it will be successful in turning the corner and think that it could literally double over the next 2-3 years (via multiple expansion).\n\n\\**What this means is I take the average annual EPS for the last 10 years and adjust for inflation--I used 2.5% as an average here; this is similar to the Schiller PE*", "id": "shv4xk", "created_utc": 1643722690.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "You might want to take their ownership of Mobileye into account.

Everyone cites the CHIPs act etc etc, but look at the CAPEX of the other peers in the industry and they absolutely dwarf what INTC is planning to spend. If I recall correctly, TSMC is about to spend nearly 2x what intel is planning. Sure Intel is standing up new foundries, but so is TSMC. Hell, they even have to use use TSMC to make some of their chips for them because that's how far behind generationally they are. I think there is a engrained national bias when people talk about INTC when in reality, TSMC is more aligned and suited to provide for the needs of American industry despite being located in Taiwan (for now as Stateside foundry is being set up). F-35 fighters have TSMC chips, and they are the industry leading nm company by far. This is not a game for cheap spenders as the technical challenges of creating smaller and smaller nm chips get exponentially difficult.\n\nPerceptions can change fast, you are correct, but nothing Intel has done or is planning to do is changing perceptions, as TSMC and other companies accelerate their moat and make more progress on future generations of nm chips with more capex. \n\nThat being said, there is a market for Intel, and that's low powered basic chips for cheap laptops (but again, others are starting to do it better as AMD is starting to eat away at that pie now).

TSMC invests in fabs for many different customers in different markets. The fact that they need to invest more is not a surprise. Intel builds and sells their own chips. This is classic vertical integration. Intel does not need to spend the same amount as TSMC since they are currently not servicing all those chip markets. However, Intel will be a new entrant in the foundry business and it will be interesting how they can take some of that pie. \n\n> Hell, they even have to use use TSMC to make some of their chips for them because that's how far behind generationally they are.\n\nThis is a pretty dumb take. Intel using TSMC means they can remove AMD's main advantage of process node advantage, it can increase their market share even further while they are rebuilding their fabs. Intel's chip designs are more advanced than those of AMD. It is the only reason why they are still in the game performance wise. Alder lake is faster in many areas. While it consumes more power this can be remedied with leveraging TSMC and later Intel 4. \n\n>TSMC is more aligned and suited to provide for the needs of American industry despite being located in Taiwan\n\nNo they are not.
