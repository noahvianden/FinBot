It‚Äôll be good for American families. It‚Äôll be good for the environment, and frankly, General Motors is well poised.‚Äù\n\nNear-term profitability plans for EVs as well as its outlooks for the economy and business during a period of rising interest rates, surging inflation and recessionary fears were expected to be focus points for investors and analysts during the event in New York.\n\nGM is bullish on its profits and plans regarding EVs largely thanks to its investments in recent years on a new vehicle platform called Ultium as well as ongoing construction of domestic plants through a joint venture called Ultium Cells LLC with LG Energy Solution.\n\nThe joint venture is expected to be operating plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan by the end of 2024, which would make the company a leader in domestic cell production; a fourth U.S. cell plant is planned.\n\nWells Fargo Colin M. Langan is ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù that GM‚Äôs electric vehicles can be sustainably profitable by 2025, even with incentives in the Biden administration‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act. He said pricing and raw material assumptions will be key.\n\n‚ÄúAt the last Investor Day, GM promised ICE-like EV margins by 2030. Since then, battery raw material costs have dramatically spiked; therefore, it would be surprising if GM can still see EV profitability by 2025,‚Äù Langan wrote Tuesday.\n\nGM previously said it secured binding commitments for all the battery raw material it needs to deliver its 2025 electric vehicle capacity target of 1 million vehicles. The company also has plans for capacity of 1 million EVs in China by then as well.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/gm-investor-day-ev-guidance-updates.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/gm-investor-day-ev-guidance-updates.html)", "id": "yxxqo8", "created_utc": 1668710094.0, "score": 285, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Accountants at GM:\n\nOkay so right now we‚Äôre making 12 hummers per day and they‚Äôre selling at a $100,000 mark up.
