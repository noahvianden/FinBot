How many more things can the feds ignore to make it a clean 2% lol?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You're confusing high inflation with hyper inflation", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Hyper inflation always starts off as high inflation.

Burry did.. if you‚Äôd stop being such a fucking idiot, you‚Äôd understand it‚Äôs significant doing in one year, in terms of rate of savings, what has traditionally taken 6... but yeah, simplify it because you don‚Äôt understand what the Fuck I‚Äôm talking about dipshit.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "The only argument against it is that \"tHe UsD iS thE rEsERve CurRenCy of ThE WoRlD\" but if you look at the timeline for other currencies who were in similar positions (UK, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, etc) as global reserve currencies, the USD is at the end of its lifespan.  China is rapidly poising the Yuen to replace the USD, and I don't think the US has the economic or military power to fight this, especially not with the entire country turning into a welfare state within the last decade or so.\n\nIt's my opinion that were watching an empire crumble in real time, and literally EVERY hyperinflation event starts out remarkably similar to this.  Like, if you googled \"how to destroy an economy with inflation\", the starting steps would be exactly what we're seeing now.\n\nEdit; obviously it isn't just from people saving money lol, it's the myriad of absolutely horrible fiscal decisions over the last 15-20 years that are just being doubled down on and multiplied as of late.

Government benefits tend not to rise or become updated very accurately. Entitlement programs we've had for 30+ years are just becoming a piggy bank to borrow from which desensitizes Congress from improving year after year to keep up with USD devaluation.

As in, \"you either go out and do something to support yourself, or you starve\" harsh and cruel.  It all starts with allowing people/institutions to fail instead of propping them up indefinitely.  I would eliminate almost all corporate subsidies/bailouts; if you aren't profitable get fucked, you deserve to go bankrupt.  Then I'd reduce unemployment benefits to below minimum wage (if they aren't there's no motivation to work), and then start agressively slashing government budgets.  There's no reason for half of the government jobs to even exist, and the government is just a bloated, slow, money sucking monstrosity (just look at their budgets relative to GDP over the last 100 years, it's disgusting how large we've let the government get) that is WAY too involved in every aspect of our life.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "We have inflation, not high inflation, or hyper inflation.
