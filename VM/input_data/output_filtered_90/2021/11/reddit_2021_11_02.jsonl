I have three kids, aged 14, 12, & 10. About 7 years ago they were each given 10k from their grandpa to open an investment account. I opened an account for each them here in Australia trading on the ASX. I‚Äôve only purchased blue chip shares that pay 4-10% returns year in year out, and all those dividends are reinvested back in to those stocks when issued. Each birthday I give them $1000 to add to their portfolios, and $1000 each at Xmas. The eldest two are sitting on almost 75k each, and the youngest is just under 70k. \n\nBy the time they‚Äôre 21 and have access to their accounts, they should have around 150k perhaps more if the bank of mum and dad don‚Äôt raid itü§£. It gives them a leg up to start their lives. They‚Äôre not allow to blow it on cars etc, they can use a bit for travel, but I‚Äôm hoping it can get them in to the property market and or keep the portfolio going until they‚Äôre much older. They‚Äôve had one really lucky break with one share which has doubled and makes up good slice of their portfolio and pays big dividends each year. That aside it‚Äôs been pretty basic investments. If it was the US market it would stocks like MSFT, CRM, TSLA, AAPL that I‚Äôve tipped money in to. So relatively low risk and just playing the long game and I‚Äôve not sold a single share in that time. \n\nChrist I wished my parents had done a similar thing for me and my sisters when I was young.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Did someone say $RKLB?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Super Dad", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs a good bargaining tool as well, they behave poorly, I threaten them with zero portfolio!
