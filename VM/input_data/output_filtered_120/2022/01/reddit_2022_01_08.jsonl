{"title": "The Bullish case for the big US banks.", "selftext": "Look I’m not some huge nerd who’s going to do financial and technical analysis, but none of you retards even understand that shit anyways.\n\nMy point is short and sweet. Interest rate hikes are coming, whether your bags want to hear that or not, it’s the truth. 60% chance of a rate hike coming as early as March. This couldn’t be more bullish for banks and here’s why. Banks offer like .1% interest on savings accounts and maybe like .3% on CDs, so they are essentially paying nothing to loan out consumer money. However, the interest rate hike now mean that while they’re still paying you shit for your money, now you have to pay a shit loan more interest on any loan you want to take out. Their profit margins almost double.\n\nMy two favorites atm are WFC and BAC, however JPM is the clear leader but they’re a bit expensive atm. All major banks are near ATHs but when has that stopped you fucks before. With these major catalysts I don’t think they’re done running up and I think they will easily blow past ATHs. \n\nOf course this isn’t financial advice as I have Aspergers, just my thoughts. \n\nPositions for anyone who cares. 7 WFC 1/28 52c and 10 BAC 1/28 48c", "id": "rz2p1s", "created_utc": 1641656755.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Buy the banks.
