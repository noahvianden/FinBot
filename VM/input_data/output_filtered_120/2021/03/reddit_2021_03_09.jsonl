Almost all of them have serious structural problems so they don't have much potential for price growth above where they are. They may have made sense in October 2020 (when the smart money bought them) but at current prices they are overvalued compared to fundamentals. Don't invest in something when it's hyped on the news; by then it is too late to get in.\n\nYou are better off looking for good companies that do not receive attention while everyone else is busy investing in hyped-up stocks. This is the only way to find good value and to position yourself for future growth. When things become hyped in the media then it is time to prepare to sell.\n\nFor example, the best time to buy oil companies was when everyone and his pet were waxing romantic about EVs and green energy plays, all the while underestimating how long it will take to go from our oil-dependent economy to the green energy economy of the future.\n\nRight now people are moving en masse to reopening and value plays (and into commodities) which are already overvalued, so  in a few more months this will gradually create an opportunity in good tech companies.\n\nIt generally pays to look at things that most people do not consider.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So every \"value stock\" has structural problems? That seems like a major generalization. \n\nAnd I agree on looking for non hyped stocks, but those are more the value stocks than the growth stocks, no? Particularly in the tech sector. Personally Im looking more towards retail, food, industrial, manufacturing sectors as tech transitions out.\n\nBut even looking at reddit, tech still seems like the main attraction. Look at bitcoin stocks, Tesla, apple, etc.. \n\nI agree with your ideas, but reopening stocks such as transportation seem like a good investment. The more boring the better as Buffett says.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think that a lot of people use the description \"value company\" without much rational basis.\n\nSome companies that have relatively high P/E or P/B ratio are undervalued or good value while some companies with low P/E or P/B ratio are poor value. These simplistic ratios don't tell you a lot. Whether a company is \"boring\" or not does not matter, all that matters is the quality of the business, the prospects of the sector and whether the stock is undervalued when compared to fundamentals.\n\nThus many companies being touted in the media as \"value\" are nothing of the kind (though some might be) and other companies that the media would not describe as such are actually undervalued. This could be one reason why many people claim that value investing has under-performed in recent decades (namely what they describe as undervalued companies based on such simplistic measures is incorrect). A high growth company with excellent fundamentals and management and high ROIC can become undervalued due to market swings. Good value doesn't mean slow growth, it can be present in both slow and high growth companies.\n\nOne needs to go into much deeper analysis of a company's business, market, management and finances to ascertain business value than most people seem to assume nowadays.\n\nMoreover, quite a bit of what companies report as headline numbers under GAAP accounting rules is misleading, because there are so many ways to manage reported earnings etc. depending on how you report various items (and management is often incentivized to do just that). Non-GAAP numbers are even worse.\n\nI could bet that in a few months all that we'll hear about the high tech and EV darlings of past  year is how much money a lot of people lost on them and how it was all a bubble. Various ambulance chasers will investigate or even sue some of these companies for \"misleading\" investors etc. while everyone in the media will hype the \"next big thing\". That will be the right moment to buy such out of favor growth companies, some of which are good businesses even though they were over-hyped. For some of these companies, the thesis about the long term future is roughly correct, but people under-estimated how much time it will take to get there in practice. This is typically the case with new technology, as you can see from the Gartner hype cycle. It can be a good moment to buy during the \"trough of disillusionment\".\n\nImo Wall Street types usually don't have much understanding of a business, which is why they tend to rely too much on financial analysis. While the latter is indeed important, it makes little sense to divorce it from the inner logic of the business of a company and its market. Many Wall Street analysts don't really understand those well enough to make a competent judgment of value. This is one reason why the advice and price targets of sell-side analysts should be viewed with lots of suspicion (the other being their vested conflict of interest). This is true especially when it comes to complex subjects such as high tech or biotech, which tend to be far removed from the actual area of expertise of those analysts (who generally have a finance background). The same applies to things such as mining (which requires good understanding of geology) etc. It is very difficult to properly value a company whose business and technology you don't really understand, which is why Wall Street tends to do a rather lousy job when it comes to that.\n\nThis is one reason why the traditional financial models used by Wall Street types only work reasonably well for mature companies. For such companies the details of the business and technology involved matter less and the generic mechanisms of finance and market forces tend to dominate valuation and business outcome. Which is why they can make a reasonable guess of value based on generic finance models without really understanding much of the detail, technology and specific nature of a mature company's business. In that sense those people tend to be rather incompetent outside of their narrow subject, but they certainly managed to claim for themselves considerably more importance and authority than they really deserve.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "The time to get into reopening and commodity plays was last October.

Also leisure of course sinks due to people not spending as much money on vacations. It’s also a business that is *very* sensitive to oil prices, and margins absolutely tank when the fuel becomes too expensive.\n\n2: The entire business model relies on cartel-like behavior.\n\nFor example, if you are investing in airlines, you are almost certainly investing in more than one (see Buffet’s buy a few years ago and the popularity of JETS, this concept is called Common Ownership). Because of this, when one major airline tries to compete with another, inevitably the stock prices of *both* of the majors sink. \n\nThis behavior encourages things like Airline Alliances which are supercharged non-compete contracts that even involve merging aspects of their businesses like loyalty programs, sales teams, and even selling tickets on your “partner’s” plane.\n\nFinally you have the practice of Fortress Hubs, where a single airline will muscle all of their competitors out of a given airport, and jack up prices in the area.\n\n3: The margins are razor thin.\n\nThe reason the airlines need to have all of this anti competitive behavior is because **Passenger Airlines barely make cash**.\n\nThey are always in enormous debt because of the sheer cost of buying and maintaining tons of jumbo jets, and these expenses are only somewhat covered during a good economy with low oil prices. Either of those things change? The airlines go to shit.\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nIf you bought JETS at its inception in 2015, you would have about a total 5% return.

And once again, the key metric that will guide us through this process is that of:\n\nPAIN MINIMIZATION\n\nYou may have read a recent post about what's called a Keynesian Beauty Contest, in which participants are rewarded for selecting what they believe would be the most popular choice overall, rather than their own personal preference. But I believe this fails to capture the whole picture, because it doesn't consider the penalty for being the most harmful, only the reward for being the most accommodating.\n\nWhat we need to consider are both sides of this coin, from the perspective of all players involved. How can both sides of this trade, the market, the regulators, the government, and the unwitting public all benefit, or at the very least, not be hurt too badly by the eventual outcome when the dust settles? I took the wrong approach last time I tried to dig into this, and tried to list every possible scenario. This time, I'll give a rundown of what I believe to be the single least damaging and, by extension, most beneficial scenario.\n\nRETAIL INVESTORS\n\nOkay guys, you'll have to bear with me here, because I know a lot of you don't want to hear this, but most of this post will be sunshine and rainbows, so allow me to temper expectations just a bit. I think retail holds. I think they will be allowed to exit at or around the peak, somewhere within 80-85% if they're paying attention. And that SHOULD be somewhere upwards of 500k/share. But by the same token, maybe it shouldn't be. I cannot predict the effect that the price spiking to something absurd like a million per share would have. That said, I am quite certain that 100k/share would have a negligible effect, and is a good place to establish a floor with which to work off of. How long you hold past that will be up to you and your risk tolerance, but I do think you should be careful. 500k is not a meme based on the DD. Nowhere close, actually, but keep in mind that there are other players involved.\n\nLONG INSTITUTIONS / WHALES\n\nThis one is fairly simple. There are a few ways these guys could play this, but with the exception of individual whales who are completely unpredictable (but always greedy), these bigger players will want to maximize profits for their investors while simultaneously bolstering their own image and garnering retail support. If acting in a vacuum, they would hold until whatever they calculate the ceiling to be, then be the first ones out the door. \n\nBut this scenario is as unique psychologically as it is economically. The global retail market is watching them closely. At the moment, they are being praised for their responsible actions and holding with us while pissant hedge funds are taking all the heat. But those little hedges have caused a disproportionate amount of uncertainty compared to the assets they control. Retail is looking for any reason to maintain any faith in our market, and if a behemoth like Blackrock were to end a rightful squeeze and leave millions of bagholders out to dry, they would only deepen the hatred retail has for the market, even though that action would be entirely legal.\n\nAs another popular thread from yesterday pointed out, you will indeed be able to sell on the way down. As will they. The smartest play here is to establish a price target for themselves that would maximize profit while also allowing the market to survive largely unscathed, then slowly unwind their positions, allowing attentive retail to close their positions at attractive price points. They'd have helped facilitate the squeeze, kept their sterling reputations and even bolstered them, lined their clients' pockets, and millions of new grateful tendie-holders would be flocking to them, begging to pay them management fees. \n\nThis would crush the small, corrupt hedges, whom they assuredly hate, restore faith in the market, consolidate market share, please their clients, earn them new ones, and grow their recurring revenue streams tremendously. \n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nThey're either shills, or fucking morons, but even then, the course of action here should be obvious. All eyes are on them. Plenty of regs that make them look tough on Wall St but really fuck retail can come later. But right now, the whole world is watching. As much as Melvin or Citadel might pay you, you reaaaally don't want to piss off Blackrock or Vanguard. And as much as you DGAF about your constituents, you probably don't want to piss them off either if you can help it. Plus, if you just let this happen, you actually look like you're a friend of the little guy, instead of just paying lip service to it. And you get to collect a tidy 37% tax to do what you will with. Hell, you can even use it to bail out the DTCC if you actually believe they need it. \n\nThe alternative? Well, that's up in the air. You could try to step in. Who knows if the market would ever recover? Who knows if you've got any shot at re-election? You did just fuck your base in real-time, after all. Maybe a few million bucks from the hedge funds would sway you into action. Just gotta hope there's still an America, let alone a market, for you to spend it in.\n\nSEC/FINRA\n\nI get it, they want jobs at the hedge funds. Can't argue with that. Just one problem. The ones still left won't have a lot to manage if all faith in the market disappears. Maybe you talk to Blackrock and the other big longs. Maybe you let them know you can only manage up to a few hundred g's a share before you have to shut it down. They can exit slowly at that price point, and most people end up happy. DTCC will get bailed out if they really need it. You can even say you were instrumental in obtaining this bailout for them. Yeah, you gotta get tough on a few nobody hedge funds. But now you've got a seat at the table with clients at the BANK level. I'm sure you could make do with a cushy IBanking gig. \n\nThe alternative? Again, who fucking knows. The world already hates you. Despises you to a degree rarely seen. Maybe you should be on the right side of this one for once? And again, a job in Finance isn't all that great if faith in our markets ceases to exist.\n\nDTCC\n\nThis seems to be the one people are most concerned about. I'd argue the SEC is a bigger threat, given how patently incompetent they are. Especially with the new proposed rules, the DTCC can basically play this however they'd like. Look at the players involved: https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories. You probably recognize more than a few names. The amount of capital they have at their disposal is staggering, and there are any number of things they could do that we can't even fathom until they happen. But I posit that, at this point, allowing this to squeeze to a reasonable level is by far the most prudent option. Whether they want to try to keep it around 100k, or let it go further intentionally and angle for a bailout isn't particularly important. The only thing that would be truly unconscionable would be to make the SEC/gov step in to break one of the cardinal rules: All shorts must cover. People will fight me on this, but 2008 is fresh, and January even fresher. This would be a colossal third strike, and the implications are unimaginable.\n\nGENERAL PUBLIC\n\nThe one no one's talking about, and the one that inevitably gets fucked the worst in most scenarios. You might think that a deep correction or mini-crash would be terrible for them. It certainly wouldn't feel great. But with retail reinvesting a large percentage of profits, their portfolios will recover, and the tale of GME will stimulate investment. They wouldn't wanna miss out on the next one (that's never coming). But if the government or SEC steps in, and the fallout is as bad as I predict it would be, those portfolios may never recover, and they'll see firsthand that normal people simply ARE NOT ALLOWED to succeed in this country.\n\n​\n\nTLDR: Sorry for the long-winded thread, yall. This is my opinion on how this should play out, and how it would cause minimum pain and maximum gain to the most amount of players involved. The only real loser is the shorts, and not even their own colleagues like them. Government/SEC intervention could very well be a death sentence for our market, while allowing the squeeze would result in rapid recovery and profound social good.\n\nTLDRotTLDR: Live Free(tarded) or Die\n\n💎🙌🚀❤", "id": "m1ip16", "created_utc": 1615330405.0, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "I made it to $500k a share before I realized it was all going to be retarded", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "Read the sentence right after 😂😂", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same.

{"title": "The Systematic Risk in the Financial System GME revealed", "selftext": "This is a continuation of a DDDD I wrote a few weeks ago about [how GME could cause a stock market crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/) through mass de-grossing from short/long Hedge Funds. However, that was just one side of the story, and there was an even more troubling 2008-style flaw in the system the GME has revealed in our financial system; something that first interested me when Thomas Peterffy, the founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers mentioned it on CNBC.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\nFirst, let’s go on a history lesson about the 2008 Financial Crisis and one of the main factors in it - Counterparty Risk.\n\n# What is Counterparty Risk?\n\nCounterparty Risk is the likelihood that the counterparty (i.e. entity on the other side) of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some 🦍🦍🦍 in an obscure subreddit sent GME 🚀🌝 so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob’s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it.\n\n# Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the “Solution”\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail.\n\nTitle 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it.\n\n# Why this doesn’t really work\n\nWhat this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their [2019 annual report](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance/), they processed $2.15 quadrillion worth of securities in 2019, or 24 times the global GDP of $24T and 6 times the total net worth of the world of $360T. Basically, they’re way too big to fail. So to make sure this never happens, they have pretty broad authority to unilaterally decide how much collateral each participant based on their outstanding trades using an unknown and obscure formula.\n\nThis is how Robinhood got fucked over by them - their collateral requirements for the DTCC suddenly increased ten-fold on them, and they had a liquidity crisis (which they tried really hard not to admit, because this is the brokerage equivalent of your bank saying they're running out of cash and you might not get your deposits back) because they didn’t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can’t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can’t meet their margin call (aka your average [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) 🦍), their entire portfolio gets liquidated.\n\nSee, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that’s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary / service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation.\n\nSo what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven’t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says\n\n* The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses\n* There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone.\n* These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write.\n* If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook\n\n# Tin Foil Hat Time\n\nNow here’s where I’ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who’s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME 🚀🌝? Probably Citadel, which is involved in [over 99% of all options trading volume](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/products/equities-and-options/). Now in theory, Market Makers are not in the business of taking a position and should be delta-neutral in all positions they take.\n\nHowever, delta and gamma hedging is a tricky art and probably not possible to perfect, especially in situations where a ticker suddenly becomes irrationally volatile, has large gaps between sessions (i.e. the opening price is significantly above or below the previous closing) and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I’m too lazy to actually research this data, although I’m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it’s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do.\n\nThis is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don’t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there’s so much volatility that it’s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up.\n\nOkay, so let’s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if **Citadel’s financial soundness came into question?** In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they’re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel’s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met.\n\nObviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements.\n\n*TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.*", "id": "m1jksq", "created_utc": 1615332869.0, "score": 394, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "If we cause it do we get a bailout?", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.

Nice write up.", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "This person has a fundamental misunderstanding of DTCC.  \nThey are a user owned not for profit. That means they are owned by *all* of the brokerages and intermediaries they do business with, which encompasses well over 90% of the trades in the US.  \nA not for profit means they don’t operate to earn a profit, though, unlike a nonprofit they are not exclusively for charity. DTCC is owned by its users, yes, but that doesn’t mean they will prop up Citadel. Why would DTCC use “their” money (aka every other brokerages’ million/billions in collateral treasury bonds to balance their trades/risk) to bail out *one* brokerage? They wouldn’t dip into other peoples funds to bail out one idiot.  \nSo, some trailer parks are user owned. Each person owns their spot and they all pay into a fund for landscaping, taxes, whatever. They actually all pay way less, because there is no middle man taking rent and making a profit. So: user owned, not necessarily a bad thing. To continue with the trailer park analogy, let’s get creative. Let’s say  the biggest trailers pay more for their larger spots (bigger brokerages), and the trailer park charges extra per tree (risk) near the trailers. The trailer park charges different amounts based on risk and $$$/value of the trailer. Let’s also pretend that one of the people who owns a trailer just planted 50 palm trees before hurricane season and they haven’t watered them (Robinhood). The trailer park steps in and says, hey, your risk just increased a lot. The trees were one thing, but there’s a hurricane coming now. So, per our user agreement, you have to give us extra money as collateral for the risk you’ve decided to incur. So instead of admitting the trees are dangerous or that they can’t afford the extra collateral, the trailer owner cuts down half of the trees to minimize their risk and pays for the remaining trees. The trailer park didn’t *make* that owner cut down the trees. They did it bc they were confronted and asked if they could pay for the damages if they happened and they couldn’t, so they had to act to minimize their risk so the trailer park would lower their fees.  \nLet’s get back to the real world. Robinhood couldn’t afford to pay for the margin calls and user’s shares once the price skyrocketed. DTCC saw they didn’t have $$ on hand to cover the increased risk. Robinhood couldn’t pay, obviously, and they WOULD have gone tits up if DTCC didn’t tell them to become solvent and put up more capital ASAP or be declared insolvent aka bankrupt.  \nDTCC is the *only* player in the market that saved Robinhood users tendies. Robinhood was greedy and reckless, DTCC was simply doing their job to ensure market stability.  \nNow moving on to OP’s ridiculous post.   \nDTCC does not need to “cover their ass”. They are literally balancing the stock markets risk daily and have been since 1970s, this is one of their main jobs to tell brokerages to put up collateral. No one has heard of DTCC because they *do not* interfere with trading unless the SEC or governing body *explicitly tells them to*. They also only interact with brokerages, never a retail buyer.  \nYes, Robinhood and citadels financial solvency came into question- that’s why DTCC stepped in!! Again, this was good, as expected, and totally normal. DTCC doesn’t give a shiny shit if citadel falls. They care of citadel put up enough capital for their trades/risk and they can back up their trades. A brokerage failing is bad for the market. This is why DTCC calls for collateral- to try to ensure they don’t collapse. But DTCC will not prop up citadel for their own crap.  \nTo loop back to the trailer park analogy. DTCC bailing out citadel would be like the trailer park bailing out tree guy with every other trailer owners $$ because ... reasons? Because they want tree guy to keep living there? No. Trailer park doesn’t care about tree guy. Trailer park cares about risk and if tree guy can pay.
