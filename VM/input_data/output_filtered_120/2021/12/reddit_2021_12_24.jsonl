{"title": "NVAX - Lambo or Ramen (Part II)", "selftext": "Here's a link to my part I - [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qezyzx/nvax_the_vaccine_play_so_bad_it_might_just_work/)\n\nA few months ago, a Politico hit piece took this stock from roughly 260, down to as low as 120 almost over night. This created an excellent buying opportunity and I was able to load up on calls and cash in on these over the last couple of weeks.\n\nWithout a doubt, the article was used by a short fund (maybe multiple funds) to crash the price and cash in on their short position. The article cited \"anonymous\" sources within the FDA, stating that NVAX was incapable of producing their vaccine at scale. The company refuted the claims and shortly thereafter, they filed for EUA in multiple countries.\n\nI'm sure there was some truth to the article, but it was clearly overblown as the company has filed for EUA across the world and has already been approved in multiple countries, including the EU and by the WHO, which gives them access to several dozen countries. As their CEO stated, \"you don't filed for EUAs, unless you have solved all your manufacturing problems.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this week, we saw WHO and EU approvals roll in only to see the price peak up to 245 (pre-market) Monday, then fall the rest of the week, all the way down to a close of 177 yesterday. Again, this created another great buying opportunity, as the stock is currently trading as less than 2x 2022 earnings. I believe average in bio-tech is roughly 7-8x.\n\nIf it's so great, why did it crash this week? I think there are 3 reasons.\n\n1. Profit takers. I think a lot of people got in on this when it was trading around 130-150, knowing approval was almost guaranteed (in at 130, out at 230 for a nice $100/share profit in a couple of weeks).\n2. Vaccine sector beat down. A lot of vaccine stocks, and other stocks with high valuations have been getting beaten down in recent weeks. For example, MRNA is down 50% from it's peak in August.\n3. Short selling. It's obvious that NVAX is no fan of Wall Street. It's current short interest is reported at over 10%, according to Fintel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe short sellers took advantage of ideal market conditions, to drive this stock down on positive news. Look at these comparison graphs of MRNA and NVAX, to give you an idea of how manipulated these low float stocks can be. One of these stocks had great news with WHO/EU approval and positive immune results from the Omicron COVID stain:\n\n[NVAX Chart](https://preview.redd.it/078d9tcmtj781.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=515155ca4f9997fe99d99a018b183b7325818c76)\n\nThe other stock had poor results with the Omicron stain and is extremely overvalued.\n\n[MRNA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/0r1zo7jptj781.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09fa27be874cbd14aef349cc76d0c2abfd950c5b)\n\nBad news, if you bought in PM Monday morning. However, good news if you had no position in NVAX previously.\n\nI believe this is going to yo-yo back up well over 200 early next week, as they are set to file with the FDA for EUA before Friday (as stated multiple times by the company this week and previously).\n\nMy current position:\n\n* NVAX 1/7/21 200c (100)\n* NVAX 1/21/21 200c (25)\n* NVAX 1/7/21 250c (40)\n* NVAX 2/18/21 250c (20)\n* NVAX 4/14/21 300c (10)\n\nFair warning, these options are expensive and risky. Don't play unless you enjoy pain. A more conservative (ie smarter) route is to buy shares and sell covered calls around the 250-300 strike price. If the stock doesn't moon, you'll collect big time premiums. If it does, fuck it, you doubled your money in a couple of weeks.\n\n**TL;DR - I believe strongly that NVAX will rebound next week due to FDA EUA filing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo expand on the FDA filing a little. I believe we will see the filing Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. I think this gives them the most headlines. I believe they had their paperwork ready this week, but held out for their Omicron data to come out. That's why their CEO kept saying \"within a few days.\" They finally released their data Wednesday afternoon, which didn't give them enough time to file Thursday morning. For them to file Thursday afternoon or over the weekend would have totally wasted a golden PR opportunity.\n\nYou can see Stan's wry smile when the reporter asked if it was going to be this week (Thursday) or next week - [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html)\n\nI am also 95% sure they will include their US manufacturing (not just SII). I believe the FDA is requiring this, which caused the extra delay.\n\nThe reason this is important is because this proves that they are able to globally manufacture their vaccine at scale, and it also give them higher margins for the doses they sell. This is currently the last bear case for the stock - they have a great vaccine, but they can't manufacture at scale and the only doses that they will be able to sell are low margin ones via SII.\n\nIf they do include US manufacturing in their filing next week, I'm pretty confident this will add 25-50% to their SP within 2-3 days.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "rnobqt", "created_utc": 1640359110.0, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I had traded nvax in early 2017.

If they aren't coming in, the approvals don't mean anything, but I am sure there is still enough demand for vaccines. \n\nCOVID is also going to be endemic sooner or later which makes the stock less risky. Especially since Novavax's vaccine has a low production cost and the vaccine can be adapted just as fast as the mRNA vaccines. It's therefore going to be very competitive despite the rather late approvals.\n\nI am curious though on whether or not the Q4 report is going to include the announced orders already or if they will include them in Q1 2022.\n\nEither way, any order, like the order from the EU, will already represent a big chunk of its current market cap. \n\nMarket cap is currently at 13 billion\nEU ordered 100 million doses.\n\nWith a conservative $10 per dosis that one order (with an option of another 100 million doses) can make up 1/13 of the company's market cap which is nuts if you think about the potential there still is.\n\nWhether or not we see another ath is a different question though.

This is  a downward revision from previous estimates in October 2021 to take into account manufacturing delays.\r  \nConsidering that a P/S ratio of 4 is a conservative (low) value for vaccine and other Pharmaceutical stocks ( MRNA has a P/S ratio of 9.2, BNTX P/S=4, PFE P/S=4.3) then a price of 240 would be a fair value for NVAX in 2022.
