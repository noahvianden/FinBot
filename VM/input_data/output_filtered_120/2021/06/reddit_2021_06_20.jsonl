{"title": "Wall Street Bets Guide to Options: Insiders Only! Volume I", "selftext": "Options are the best way to make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk.\n\nThis guide will help you get started on your path to financial freedom.\n\nSome definitions:\n\n**Calls:** Calls let you ‚Äúcall‚Äù your broker and tell them how much you want to pay for a stock. Say Tesla is trading at $700. You can call your broker and tell them you want to buy it at $300. If it‚Äôs a new broker that just passed his series 7 he might say something like, ‚ÄúDo you mean 300 strike sir/mam?‚Äù Calmly tell this noob that you know about options from WSB and want to talk to his manager. If they still wont let you participate in call options to purchase Tesla at $300, you will need to report this to FINRA. Here is their help line: Phone: (240) 386-HELP.\n\n**Puts:** Puts, much like Calls are insider trading tools used by many Wall Street firms. How a put option works is that you call your brokerage and tell them your want to ‚Äúput‚Äù or give back your shares for their original purchase price. Puts are what you use to get a refund if things went a little awry. Lets say you smooth brain bought GME at $440 after looking at shitty memes all day, tell your broker you would like to use a put option to get a refund. You choose the price, however, one firm rule of puts is that you cannot put your shares back for more than you paid for them. So, in this case, you can put your shares back into the share pool for $440 apiece.\n\n**Covered Calls:** Covered calls are normally only for elite wall street veterans but I will help you trade just like they do. Selling calls should not be done over the phone with your brokerage. Don‚Äôt worry Robinhood traders this isn‚Äôt a problem for you. You are going to want to do this online after you sign your margin contract with your brokerage. Covered calls are a sale of the aforementioned call options where you essentially sell something you don‚Äôt own and make money for just knowing about this trick! Its like being able to sell your neighbors car without him knowing. Its really important when selling calls to not have the underlying stocks in your account. For example, if you want to sell covered calls on Tesla, do not purchase the security first. You dont want to get them called away do you!? Another quick tip: to maximize profit always look for the most volatile stocks possible, meme stocks are great for this. Remember, keep it online, just click the sell button, go a little bit out of the money (more on this below) and you will get the biggest bang for your buck!\n\n**In the money:** ITM is how wall street traders congratulate each other on a successful call or put option. Lets say you used a put to return your shares for a refund, when the money hits your account, you can post it on WSB to let others know you are ‚Äúin the money!‚Äù You will most likely be showered with awards from wall street bettors. Wall Street bettors are very nice folks who are there to support you. Its their way of saying welcome to the club! Here‚Äôs some gold. \n\n**Out of the money:** OTM refers to trading noobs who don‚Äôt know how to trade options. Us wall street insiders consider most of retail out of the money, but now that you have found this guide you will no longer be part of this lower class of human. Trading is easy when you have the power of insider knowledge on your side.\n\n**Strikes:** Your brokerage works on a 3 strike system. If you lose on three trades or try to buy boomer dividend stocks like JPM, you will be given one strike. Strikes fall off on a rolling 30 day basis. So, if you absolutely have to buy JP Morgan cause they were Epstein‚Äôs bank / brokerage, and you like that they got caught with a cocaine boat ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/) ) you can only do this three times a month. Only trade options and meme stocks and you will be fine.\n\n**Expiration:** If you don‚Äôt use your options after Ive given them to you here, they will rot. In order to keep your options fresh, its always wise to sell more covered calls described above or call your broker to buy new calls or puts.\n\n**Intrinsic Value:** refers to what you think your options are worth. If you have options that have gone to zero but you really, really like them, well then there is a lot of intrinsic value in them.\n\n**Extrinsic Value:** refers to the value of options that you used to own. You would say, ‚ÄúI am an extrinsic holder of Amazon options and they would be worth millions of dollars right now.‚Äù This is very useful information to share with others in the DD section. Extrinsic value can also refer to the value of your wife after she ran away with her latino pool boy boyfriend. For example, ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs extrinsic value at the moment is the price of a Costco hotdog while she is away on her extended vacation.‚Äù\n\nHope this helps get you started!\n\nWelcome to the wall street insiders club!", "id": "o46lu2", "created_utc": 1624198485.0, "score": 864, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "\"Options are the best way to make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk.\"\n\nWhat a way to instantly poison the well", "score": 167, "replies": [{"body": "You mean as a way to attract more gamblers", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Hehe suckers", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lmao.
