{"title": "Kroger -- Buy The Next Walmart At Steal Price", "selftext": "Market is confirmed a complete NUTCASE now. Best example is Kroger which just releaes earning $1.22/share on revenue that rose 11.5% to $41.55 billion -- beating Analysts $1.14/share on revenue of $40.92 billion. With same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 19%.\n\nGuess what? $KR tanked from $32.82 to $31+ now, lost some -5%+! \n\nReason? Kroger didn't provide full year comps and earnings guidance due to coronavirus uncertainties (even though they do expect overwhelmingly positive results).\n\nFact: Kroger today is Walmart in 2015 (their ecommerce shot up 90%+). After all, what business is better than essential grocery during the pandemic will may last another couple of years or couple of decades. No earning projection? Is this an issue? Hey, even China couldn't provide GDP estimate for the first time in history.\n\nKroger Rivals Walmart and Amazon With Record-Setting Digital Sales [https://retailleader.com/kroger-rivals-walmart-and-amazon-record-setting-digital-sales](https://retailleader.com/kroger-rivals-walmart-and-amazon-record-setting-digital-sales)\n\nKroger Stock Looks Poised to Be the Next Walmart, Kroger stock will grow as it invests a great deal in e-commerce [https://investorplace.com/2020/03/kroger-stock-poised-next-walmart/](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/kroger-stock-poised-next-walmart/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKroger Stock Price/Earning Forecast: $35.00 - $42\n\nThe 23 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Kroger Co have a median target of 35.00, with a high estimate of 42.00 and a low estimate of 26.00.
