They beat on revenue which means people are still buying toilet paper with their prime accounts. Amazon could hunker down, streamline operations, cut spending, and focus on making money. They'd probably be very successful and beat every quarter for a few years. Instead the idea is to be ahead of the curve in anticipation for what's next so as to not be caught off guard. This explains expanding their fulfillment infrastructure, their cloud based storage/computing, and creating original content for their streaming services. The weakest of these ideas is the original streaming content because I just don't see it ever being too profitable an enterprise for Amazon.   \n\nEdit: the streaming content makes a lot of sense. Bezos doesn't want you to just buy something on Amazon with your prime account, he wants you to spend all your time on the site.
