{"title": "I got it wrong and might default on my PayDay loans.", "selftext": "I just want y'all to know that I'm a dumbass autist who thinks he can beat the market. Basically, I've taken out two Payday loans worth $500 each to \"make money\" trading options on Robinhood. Well, in my previous thread I learned from y'all that it's compounded daily, I'm fucked.\n\nAt first I went from $1000 to $3000 by buying close to expiration calls and puts on AMD. It was extremely risky, but what the fuck did I know? It was easy money! So, last Friday with the market being down, I decided to spend my entire $2300 on spy calls expiring Monday and Wednesday (mostly Monday). \n\nChecking the premarkets last night I was extremely confident in my positions. Up 0.5%? Hell YEAH, I'm going to make them GAINZ. Wake up. WHAT THE FUCK? Markets don't give a fuck about Trump being quiet. Mango man didn't tweet the entire weekend. Somehow, old Huawei news turned the markets blood red.\n\nThe markets seem like a vagina to me. I'm gay and I have 0 clue how a vagina works. One day is blood the next day it's fine. Who the fuck knows. \n\nSo, I lost Half of my portfolio today but I still have half left because I sold close to the high today. Because I'm an autist, I went balls deep in out of the money AMD calls expiring next Friday. Lisa Su is going to make all the investors üí¶ at Computex. It's confirmed trust me. \n\nSee you boys next week after them GAINZ. üòò\n\nHere's my portfolio\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/SxjACC9\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI'll post my payday loans once I'm home.\n\nI'll update the actual payday interest rate when I'm home.
