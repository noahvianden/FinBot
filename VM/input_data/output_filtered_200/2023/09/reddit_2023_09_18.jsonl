Even standard EVs themselves are extremely heavy and will create more road infrastructure issues. The money for wear & tear will come in the form of specific taxes which will be passed down to consumers. Consumers being priced out due to regulation changes, etc. will hamper growth. A company like Tesla faces impressive barriers to reach it’s current valuation.\n\nI think to convince the people on the Tesla bull side, I would point them to a valuation that considers the following. Only five companies in the world have sales of over $400 billion. None of them are automakers. None of those companies reach an operating margin above 15%. In order for Tesla to reach it’s near 900 Billion dollar valuation, it would have to do both those things AND more. An EV car company simply won’t scale enough or effectively enough to surpass both. Car manufacturing itself isn’t terribly difficult, which is why competition is so fierce. \n\nTesla doesn’t make the best cars, but it does have the best margins. Is that enough? It has competitive advantages but not a wide moat. Competition over the long run seems like it’ll cannibalize it’s superior margins. At it’s current valuation, everything in the next five years has to happen perfectly.\n\nOn the subject of those who believe in Tesla’s energy prospects, I have no way of tangibly valuing that business. It’s a business that currently deals in speculation.
