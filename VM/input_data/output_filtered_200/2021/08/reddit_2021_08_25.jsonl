I wouldn't want to put money in his IRA if it counted against my contributions. \n\nI have heard \"don't mix friends and business\" all my life, but I don't know what to do here.\n\nShould I do this?\n\nAlso, if I did, could I manage a Roth IRA in his name?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the responses, some of them made me really laugh out loud. out of the 50ish responses I read only 2 people said there was a way to do it, just don't.
