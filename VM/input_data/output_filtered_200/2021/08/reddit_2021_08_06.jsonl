They're not legit, they're politically driven. This matters from a market perspective because it's not actually a force that would make JPOW do anything, and inflation right now is largely due to short term supply issues tied in large part to increased economic activity and reshuffling during the pandemic. A lot of the inflation actually happened in 2020 so is the definition of \"priced in.\" While actual inflation is elevated at 0.9% for the past month, that's in-line with inflation from the prior 4 months and the median is only about 0.3% above the baseline high watermark during the low inflationary period of the 2010s. While that's an increase of 50%, it's most specific sectors like auto and transportation and hospitality which are seeing situation increases due to high demand, and the actual impact to most people in most buying categories is currently low.  \n\n\nThis is important because \"inflation bad\" is an economically wrong statement as a blanket statement. Obviously, you want to restrain inflation, but the reason for inflation being bad is what really matters to the market over the term. In this case, it's not because of a collapse of the consumer market or a long-term insolvent commodities crunch, it's due to increasing demand for goods and services combined with short term supply issues, including lack of port space and other logistical problems relating to a massive increase in consumer and institutional purchasing combined with poor JIT production operations implementations... all of which will settle out once orders get back up and that's why you're seeing massive jobs growth.  \n\n\nIn other words. it's all growth, and inflation from growth is actually good because people have more money to spend. That's why we're getting sporadic freak-out red days and then green periods of massive growth... fear is outweighed by greed because people are still spending money. The fear is synthetic.

The market may have been over bought, but people pushing this story that the economy is fake are simply lying. Inflation is being caused by real demand more than money printing. Businesses are competing to get labor back by offering higher pay.\n\nThe bear case for next quarter / end of year is based on benefits falling off, the new surge in COVID cases, eviction moratorium ending and the fed tapering.\n\nIf we look at those one by one, there are massive job openings now, so there are jobs for people losing bonus unemployment benefits.\n\nThe people getting really sick from covid now, resisting vaccination, are the last people to request a lockdown. Even if there are lockdowns, businesses know how to operate in these conditions, with social distancing and PPE; the ones that don't all went under in 2020, so it's hard to imagine how there'd be a similar downturn even if cases surge again.\n\nEvictions could be a good thing. It would pressure people to take jobs and resume payments to banks and landlords, and push more properties on to the market and improve home affordability.\n\nTapering has been talked about for months. This could actually cause some selling off as bond yields return. The bond bubble needs to be deflated by tapering; it's kind of fucked that the yield on bonds are so non-existent that investors MUST buy stocks.

That way, even if you're wrong about a downturn, you still get some growth.\n\nAnother easy trick is just go look at stocks with really low P/E. Their valuations almost never depend on future earnings growth, so they don't grow as much, but they're less vulnerable to economic headwinds. Insurance companies that pay dividends are a good example of this. Their revenues are locked into annual policies so it's not like people can drop their car or homeowners insurance because the market is selling off. Conversely, they're not going to see big growth because how often does anybody ever go shopping for insurance?
