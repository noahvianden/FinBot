{"title": "The Commodity Super-cycle trade: A macro DD with special focus on industrial metals", "selftext": "“Commodities? What the hell is that?” asks the GME Ape, used to blockbusters stocks and phone companies from the 90s. We are talking oil, natural gas, industrial and precious metals, corn, GOURDS, etc. Got it? You don’t want to mess with commodity futures? No problem, there are more than enough stocks and ETFs proxies through which you can place your bets. But before tackling tickers, let’s talk fundamentals and let me lay out the bullish case for commodities, specifically industrial metals (steel😲, copper, aluminum, rare earth metals).\n\n# Commodity Super-cycle?\n\nCommodities go through cycles of booms and bust, following economic cycles of activity, and inflation. Growth and inflation make commodities go uppies, and recessions or periods of slower economic growth, coupled with deflationary pressures, make commodities go tits up. Specifically, commodities tend to rise rapidly when the economy goes into “overdrive” mode, so towards the second half of economic expansions. This is because as the economy accelerates, the supply for raw materials can’t keep up with the demand, leading to price escalations up to a point where demand has to correct abruptly, causing a recession. Then, commodity prices free fall as the economy goes through deflation, and investment typically shifts towards innovation and disruptive tech, preparing for the new cycle. Then, the economy eventually recovers and starts to slowly pick up speed, and the new cycle is in. You can see that post-2000 (coinciding more or less with the pop of the .com bubble), was the start of a rally in commodities (**Chart 1).**\n\n**Chart 1: US commodity price index 1795 to present** (as of August 2020)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmz5xuox7ph61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a262060bed4870cf4bc0834a46f71d5ccd5fa21\n\nWhy was that? We were coming out of a pretty long period of economic deflationary stability and then accelerated going into the 2000s. As inflation started to pick up, investment flew out of tech and into commodities, given the demand for them was massive. There was massive GDP growth coming from the BRICS, the .com tech creating more jobs and more income/household, and massive lending growth backed by the US housing market (the economy was leveraged to the tits); all this strong, *tangible* (this is crucial, more on that later) economic activity generated a lot of demand for raw materials as houses and factories were built, cars were manufactured, cities rose all around the world (particularly in Asia), and so commodity prices went uppies. Of course, the economy was overleveraged, and like most FDs you hold for too long, it went tits up real quick at the expiration date. The recession post-GFC sent commodities down, and when there was economic recovery, commodities stayed pretty low. Why was that? Deflationary pressures coming from a risk-averse banking system and an increasingly efficient, high tech-driven economy could be a place to start. But from a cycle perspective, this was still the first half of the economic expansion following the recession, and there was still too much deflation for commodities to pick up real momentum. Of course, when March 2020 hit and everything went tits up, what little momentum commodities had was instantly lost as the entire world economy went through a massive deflationary bust. Suddenly, nothing moved, and nothing was built, and so there was barely any demand for commodities. But now that we begin to recover from the pandemic, are things any different than they were prior to it? If before the dreadful 2020 commodities were cheap, why would they begin to rally in 2021?\n\nI’ll begin by analyzing what is going on right now with commodities from a technical perspective, and then I’ll give you what I think is the *why* behind it? Sounds good? Let’s dive into it then.\n\n# What’s the technical outlook?\n\nBeing guilty of serious crayon-eating to the point of literally shitting colors every weekend, I never build a thesis without some technical ANALysis, so let’s look at a few charts to see where we are in the cycle technically, and then I’ll make the fundamental argument for the industrial metals reversal. **Chart 1** showed that we are at exceptionally low price levels, and it also shows that commodities don’t tend to stay at those prices very long. However, is a reversal going on right now? For this, no need to go back to Napoleonic Wars, let’s just look at the last decade or so. There is in fact a technical reversal in commodities going on, and it would be confirmed if we get above 90-100 on the BCOM (**Chart 2**). The *Coom*berg Commodity Index tracks commodity prices.\n\n**Chart 2:** ***Coom*****berg Commodity Index (BCOM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjfw2vma8ph61.jpg?width=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ad8c833da4702d11cbb358c90ed909ac5c8c63d\n\nLet’s have a look now at some specifics, namely industrial metals. Commodities tend to move in unison, so it is expected from steel (and, in the case of an index, companies working along the steel supply chain) to have a similar price action to the BCOM. Indeed, you can see on **Chart 3** that it’s the same breakout of the multi-year trend.\n\n**Chart 3:** **ARCA Steel Index (STTL)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ub7trgae8ph61.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0ff90918a5ba4ee9235b843a8f814bf96fee621\n\nWhat about copper? Yeah, the same thing, but more extended than its industrial metal peers (**Chart 4**), due to the fact there has been quite a few strikes going on causing a supply shock, but I also believe people understood the vital role of copper in the EV industry and in de-carbonization (more on that later) a few months before they realized most industrial metals were going to go along the same path.\n\n**Chart 4:** **US Copper Index Fund (CPER)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2bwl1t5i8ph61.jpg?width=1820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899bc4e45465edda59e86dd73a987a4a364a93d9\n\nAs you would expect, other industrial metals, such as aluminum, follow similar patterns. While WSB was screeching GME (except Steel Bros, you guys nailed it), industrial metals were rallying, and are now at their inflection point, or past it (in the case of copper for example). So why is any of this happening? While we’re still on a crayon-eating binge, let’s have a look at the 5-yr forward inflation expectations chart (**Chart 5**). Ok, so consumers and businesses are expecting prices to increase at a higher rate 5 years from now, and believe inflation will be over 2% in 2025. Do you see a similarity with the BCOM? That’s because commodities and inflation go hand in hand, as I explained previously. While inflation is not sitting over 2% right now, it is expected to be in the future and commodity traders and hedge funds are already placing their bets, so the market is adjusting ahead of time, as it should.\n\n**Chart 5:** **5-yr Forward Inflation Expectation Rate**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pp39er5m8ph61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=543768ae6d5f09e89eb809ba7c4985707db69ab1\n\nBut isn’t inflation good for all equities? If we were to rely solely on inflation expectations, why would commodities be a better move than say, tech? My belief is that the huge rally that has been going on with Big Tech for years was fueled by deflation, not inflation. Our economy has only become more and more efficient given all of the technological innovation that has been going on (think of automation), leaving people out of work with less income and driving prices down. This is good for tech, but it is rather deflationary, so when I hear inflation expectations are up significantly, it makes me rather neutral to bearish on tech, and much more bullish on commodities. For now, let’s have a look at **Chart 6**, a ratio between the S&P500 and the PPI (the log of that actually). The way to interpret this is the following: when the ratio is going up, stocks, in general, are beating commodities, and when it is going down, commodities are beating stocks. Obviously, this excludes stocks which revenues rely on commodities since those stocks would typically be up when commodities are up (ex: metal processing stocks, mining stocks, etc.). Periods of inflation are better for commodities than for stocks, and vice-versa for deflationary phases. It doesn’t necessarily mean stocks will go down when inflation runs higher, but commodities will tend to outperform the market. One extreme case of this was the .com bubble pop, which immediately made commodities more attractive than stocks, and coincided with the start of an inflationary period that lasted until around the GFC.\n\n**Chart 6:** **S&P 500/PPI (log)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me3zn6sq8ph61.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73bf6327287e80202491966eb1d8da994337d40\n\nSo by looking at this chart, seeing that we have been in a prolonged period of relative deflation, recognizing that equities are pretty overextended as of right now compared to commodities, and noting that inflation expectations are up (meaning a new wave of inflation might be forming ahead), I would argue that solely based on this there exists an arbitrage opportunity: short tech, long commodities. But shorting tech is rather wild, and if you are a conflicted bull that knows the tech rally must be approaching its end but you won’t go full u/Variation-Separate, you might as well just long commodities while reducing your tech exposure, or at least add some of that sweet sweet *coom*modity to your folio as a hedge.\n\nThis concludes our technical analysis for now. Congrats if you’ve made it this far and managed to keep your rectum intact, you’ve survived. Now, why is this taking place now? In other words, why are inflation expectations up now, as opposed to a year or two from now? Why is the BCOM breaking out of its multi-year downtrend right now, while we’re still mostly on lockdown when it’s been falling for years under a “normal” economy? Calling a bottom is as hard as calling a top, but while sometimes bubbles pop out of sheer exhaustion, it is rarer for prices to rebound after years of downtrend without any catalyst. So what’s the catalyst then? Is it just Grandpa Buyden and his big, long, and beautiful stimulus, or is there something else?\n\n# What’s the fundamental outlook?\n\nNow comes the juicy part. This is the sauce, this is what you came looking for and this is what will hopefully give you the confirmation bias you need and deserve. The question we must ask ourselves is the following: are the conditions for a commodity rally, more precisely in industrial metals, met or be met in the near future?\n\nIn other words, is there right now or will there be in the near future a supply and demand imbalance in industrial metals? If we look at the charts, it appears there is one, given the rally we’ve had in the past weeks, but this could just be speculation, right? Or maybe there was one, but now it’s all priced in? I’ll try to give you reasons for the current imbalance, as well as reasons for further imbalances in the future that will likely end up causing a multi-year rally similar to ones before (think 1970s, 2000s). The reasons are the following: Buyden’s Stimulus Plan, “Going Green”, China’s Infrastructure Spending, China’s Accumulation of Metals, India increasing CapEx spending, Wealth Redistribution Policies and Years of Low CapEx in the Commodity Complex. I’ll split these into 2 groups, the demand side, and the supply side.\n\n# Demand\n\n**-Buyden’s Stimulus Plan and “Going Green”**\n\nNow, I know bears will say this is blasphemy. They will say fiscal policy won’t spur inflation; no matter how much spending, the government has never had any success creating inflation and it won’t this time either. I hear you and I agree, untargeted and irresponsible spending has never had any success in generating any kind of sustainable inflation. But are we going to ignore the fact that this is 1.9 trillion + another 2 trillion for infrastructure? Are we going to ignore the fact that Yellen believes this can achieve FULL EMPLOYMENT by 2022? Full employment people, in one year. This would be an economy on fucking steroids, and the price of going into full employment in such a short period of time is inflation. I just can’t see supply being able to adjust to such an increase in household income in such a short period of time, that is if full employment is really to be achieved. Now, full employment could be a pipe dream, it could be yet again another game Yellen is playing to get inflation expectations moving and banks lending, but the sheer possibility of it is enough for the economy to move in that direction. Full employment would be the “overdrive” mode I talked about previously, and that would set the stage for a big rally in commodities. Let me also add that some republicans who opposed Buyden’s plan did so on grounds that it would cause runaway inflation and that such a risk outweighed all of its benefits. It’s all politics, so it doesn’t mean anything on its own, but it can give some idea of the magnitude of how much spending is going on.\n\nRegarding industrial metals like steel, copper, aluminum, and even silver, Buyden’s infrastructure spending is of course bullish. 52% of all steel produced ends up being used for infrastructure projects, so the infrastructure plan aiming at “re-building” a “greener” US is very bullish for steel. New infrastructure, new housing, new buildings and facilities of all kinds is obviously very good for industrial metals. The fact it is meant to be a “green” plan is particularly bullish for copper (think of batteries, wiring, etc.), which has already strongly reacted to this. This in itself is good, but I think it has the potential to have much more growth because it might initiate a bigger modernization wave across all industries, as they strive to “go green”. Just like the US, I can see governments around the world taking the same path; not only because it is good politically as more and more people care about the planet, but because it is a matter of remaining competitive in the future world economy. The automobile industry is going through this change, and ALREADY there is a supply problem. Everybody speaks about the semiconductor shortage, but I think this is just a symptom of a much larger supply issue that is looming ahead. Think about all the factories semiconductor producers will have to build from the ground up to meet demand in the coming years. Some won’t be ready before 2025. What about the famous Elon’s battery gigafactories? Approximately 100 of them will be necessary to supply the entire world with clean energy according to his autist brain (love you Papa), and I assume it is only to meet the current world’s energy demand (wait until India, and eventually Latin America, finalize their industrialization). How many other ambitious projects similar to these will come in the future given all the investment that has been pouring into tech for nearly a decade? What I’m getting at here is that “going green” will cause a “structural change in demand” (quoting Goldman; I typically inverse them, but not this time lol) for industrial metals as there will be A LOT of changes in manufacturing infrastructure, and a good part of it will have to be built from scratch.\n\nThis isn’t related to going green, but what about all the innovation going on with 3D printing? Eventually, there will be large 3D printers that will print-out houses and buildings, but they will necessitate gigantic factories to build them so they can build other buildings. You find that funny don’t you? It’s going to fucking happen dude, someday. No, but seriously, all of the crazy innovation that has been going on during the last deflationary years, all of the ARK shit, all of that will eventually have to be built using unconventional and new manufacturing, meaning, you guessed it, more manufacturing infrastructure will have to be built from scratch, causing inflation in industrial metals since the demand will largely outpace the supply like it happens every fucking time. And that’s the super-cycle. It’s the supply of material resources of one economic phase not being able to keep up with the innovation-driven demand from the previous phase, causing prices to escalate during the growth phase. It happened in the 1970s, it happened in the 2000s, and it’ll happen again, sooner rather than later imo.\n\n\\-**Gyna: Doubling down on infrastructure spending and accumulating industrial metals**\n\nSay what you will about the china men, but they know what’s up. They understood before anyone that transitioning into a sustainable, greener economy was not nearly as much a moral duty as it was the premise for economic competitiveness. Only now is the US beginning to catch up to what China has been doing for years: invest in infrastructure to enable the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. When the rest of the world was caught up in the GFC mess, instead of having to prop up its financial system, China invested even more in infrastructure and construction jobs. Regarding metals’ accumulation, it is perfectly understandable. They must think they will need them in the future and that they will be much more valuable a few years from now, otherwise they wouldn’t be accumulating and producing them like crazy. In the case of crude steel production, China’s production accounted for 53.3% of the world’s production in 2019 versus 46.6% in 2009. They have been ramping up production (probably in anticipation of a surge in demand), and I don’t want to bet against them because, so far, they seem to know what they’re doing.\n\n**-India to increase CapEx spending**\n\nDid you forget about India, the second-largest country by population size? New roads, new power grids, new rails, new pipelines, new housing, and new healthcare infrastructure are part of the Indian government’s plan to augment the country’s infrastructure as part of the Union Budget for 2021-22. Most of the country is still rural, and therefore lacks infrastructure, a problem the government is attempting to fix by increasing capital expenditure spending. Do you see what is going on? World leaders are killing 2 birds with one stone here. They are using infrastructure spending as a springboard to achieve post-pandemic economic recovery, thereby not only putting their economies back on their feet, but also addressing an issue that had to be dealt with anyway: a lack of new, modern, and greener infrastructure. This is wildly bullish on industrial metals if you ask me because other countries are likely to follow the same path.\n\n**-Wealth Redistribution Policies**\n\nGive a wealthy man a mil and he’ll invest it boomer dividend stocks like the rest of his 10 million dollars, since he already has a dream house, a dream car, and, unluckily for him, he can’t buy a dream wife on the open market, so in the meantime, he’ll strive to get richer. Give a wagie a mil and he’ll spend it faster than it takes a WSB degen to YOLO his paycheck on some 0dte FDs. The marginal propensity to consume of lower-income households is much higher than that of higher-income households, so because wealth redistribution effectively shifts income from investment to consumption, it is typically inflationary. Wealth redistribution has been part of the Democrats’ agenda for a long time and is also a component of the Covid Relief bill. Furthermore, with the likes of AOC gaining more and more traction among younger generations (AOC simps in particular), I can see these types of policies gain much more momentum in the future, given the current wealth gap is pretty abysmal and has the potential to cause social unrest if it is undealt with. And what about rising wages? I don’t think the $15 national minimum wage is going to materialize itself anytime soon, but there is nevertheless a push for wage raises undergoing (again, courtesy of the dems). This is, again, mainly beneficial to lower-income families and leads to a much more commodity-intensive economy, as a larger part of the population is able to afford housing, home appliances, automobiles, etc. than previously. This is obviously inflationary as well.\n\n# Supply\n\n\\-**Low Capital Expenditure in the “Commodity Complex”**\n\nThis is a key component of the super-cycle thesis. What causes the rally in industrial metals is not only the sudden increase in demand but also the fact supply is unprepared. We know the industry that has been suffering from underinvestment for years and will unlikely be able to adjust to demand quickly enough. Since commodity prices started falling after the GFC, there’s been a dramatic decrease in capital expenditure for metal processing companies, miners, and industrials, as you would expect during a recession (add to that the manufacturing crisis). Furthermore, CapEx growth never came back to 2008 highs and has just been further dipping during the last decade, and even went negative following the pandemic adverse demand shock (in the case of steel for example). Producers had to outright cut back on investment just to keep their operating activities afloat. Although global capacity in industrial metals is still big enough to meet the demand today, given the state of the industry after the pandemic blow, I don’t think there will be overcapacity again like there was prior to 2019/2020, since the industry was momentarily weakened in the past months. This is precisely when prices tend to bottom, and then only does investment starts returning back into the industry, anticipating higher prices, and eventually margins improve when prices and the industry do recover, but with fewer players in it (**Chart 7** shows this cycle). I believe we are currently at the “Prices bottom” phase, and already we are seeing mining and metal processing stocks up. Investors are already expecting higher metal prices and profit margins, and investment is starting to flow back into the industry.\n\n**Chart 7:** **Metals’ investment cycle**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evjnfh7p9ph61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a43a4d8f65249601808992c4268d8899f2a2fa6\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n\"Listen, here's the deal\", we are about to have a manufacturing boom. There, I said it. Come at me bears! (except tech bears though). The US, China, and India are betting on huge infrastructure projects, and we're talking huge bets. Trillions. I believe the private sector is not gonna stand idle; they will follow and will also make massive manufacturing investments to turn around their businesses so they can be competitive in this new, high-tech, environmentally sustainable economy. This is big. As the demand for these types of massive investments goes up, interest rates will start increasing (this is not happening overnight, we're talking in a while), and then banks will be more than happy to lend at the right price (right now they just won't do it, they're not getting their risk's worth). Lending growth ✔️. As manufacturing starts rolling again, there will be more jobs and GDP growth ✔️. Full employment could very well happen, but realistically it will take more than a year; might still happen though. \"Overdrive mode\"✔️. More employment means more income and with redistribution policies in place, more of that income will be spent back into the economy, driving prices up. Inflation✔️ Meanwhile, you have a metals' industry that is lagging the economy, as it did not receive the kinds of capital flows tech has enjoyed for a decade. Lack of raw materials supply ✔️. This generates a continued, multi-year, upward pressure on industrial metals prices. That's the super-cycle trade, investing where there is underinvestment in anticipation of the demand that's coming ahead. And look at it as an asymmetric bet, since you don't stand that much to lose with commodity prices this low. How much lower can they really get? And you know they'll rebound eventually, so you can double down if they dip again, and that's what makes the trade so interesting. Ask yourself, when the tech bubble pops, where is that money going to go? We've gone over this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hmm that's cool and all... but where are my tickers??\n\nOk, this is a Macro DD, it's in the title. I have not had the chance to take a deep dive into specific companies in order to find the hidden gems that will benefit the most from this (pls, if someone has done it, comment it in the thread that would be awesome). But if you want some tickers, I'll give you some. They can be broken down into categories. There's the steel sector (Steel Gang I got you fam), there's the Copper sector, and there's Silver (hey, there's industrial applications, and apparently there's already a fkg shortage so yeah, I'm adding it). I won't go into the specifics of the company, I'll just give you a quick overview of financials + valuation, so you'll have to put up *some* work yourself.\n\nPS-I know there are other industrial metals such as Palladium, Platinum, Nickel, etc., but this DD is getting long af so I'll limit myself to just a few, but the super-cycle thesis is bullish on all industrial metals, so feel free to shoot other industrial metals tickers you are bullish on.\n\n# Steel Sector\n\nAs I said before, 52% of all steel demand comes from infrastructure projects, so the fact governments around the world are investing like crazy in infrastructure is a think a good start for a steel rally. Steel gang knows all about it, and there's been DD on it, so go check it out, macro-wise, they're probably right.\n\n**X**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/np1cfyy3lph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2271eee78f8fe217f4db722ab709ec741b795193\n\nBasically for the degens. Small-cap with low float, much weaker balance sheet than its peers, but with more room for growth. Trading currently 20% below \"fair value\" should you use a DCF model. I would say it's one of the most speculative plays in the steel sector, win big or lose big type of play.\n\n**STLD**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eq7p6cngmph61.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=302c250198eff734be70ce80684eb738713d715a\n\nNow, this is more reasonable. Rock-solid balance sheet, that pays a fkg dividend (Imagine caring about a dividend of 2.5% though lol) and is trading at an impressive 46% below \"fair value\", again using a simple DCF model (if anybody wants to add another way of valuing this shit please do, I suck at coming up with price targets, I'm just copying [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) estimates here). Won't probably move as fast as X though 😐.\n\n**MT**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8udchr6oqph61.jpg?width=370&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=831dd6798b54cb436aedb8bede5b74ccb4a799ed\n\nSteel Gang knows this one well, and there's already DD on it, so go check it out.\n\n**VALE**\n\nWell, I stand with the Knights of Vale, and that is all I have to say. There's enough DD out there to confirm all of your biases, so I'll just say it's a good long-term play. Go read the DD.\n\n**SLX**\n\nVanEck Vectors ETF Trust Steel ETF. Honestly, I have never used it, it doesn't look very option liquid, so I wouldn't dip in it, but if you absolutely love ETFs there is one.\n\n# Silver Sector\n\nLet's not overlook silver's worth just because there's a ton of shilling going on. There are the people that believe the dollar will be worthless and the financial system will collapse, and then there are the people that legit think silver is a good commodity play. I think it's not only a good commodity play but also a good industrial play. As opposed to Gold, which is purely an inflation hedge at best, silver has actual industrial applications. Anyway, you know the tickers for silver, there's been more than enough shilling on them.\n\n# Copper Sector\n\nCopper, being an excellent electrical conductor, will likely have the most intense rally amongst metals in the coming years. The EV industry especially, but all other industries that will strive to go fully electrical and clean will demand huge quantities of it. Think of all the electrical wiring, revolutionary battery tech (like the one Elon showed on battery day \\*PTSD sets in\\*), as well as other industrial applications. For what it's worth, Goldman Sachs is most bullish on copper. Fun fact: Copper surfaces kill most viruses, including the Rona, faster than other surfaces like plastic. Do with that info what you will.\n\n**TRQ**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84oic7e67qh61.jpg?width=393&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1653ff426005f81656c9c245508ffaf0b441a3a6\n\nNow, this one makes me rock hard. Earnings are forecasted to grow 30% per year. On top of the huge growth prospects, it's currently undervalued at around 67%. 67%! And that's using the boomer valuation model that is DCF. Big value right here imo.\n\n**LUN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfc1mziahqh61.jpg?width=403&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51489bc98a16de12bfa231559f5df45e0ff0c945\n\nThis one is a sexy beast. Excellent balance sheet, very good growth prospect, proven track record, and at a 55% discount using DCF model. But, of course, there's a but: it's only on the TSX, and while it has options, they don't look liquid at all. I'm a canuck so I can trade it, but yeah it's only on the Toronto Exchange...\n\n**COPX**\n\nIt's the Copper ETF, and it has no options. Meh\n\nOk, so that's it for the tickers. To be honest, there are probably better ones, but I spent most of my time working on the overall macro thesis and wasn't planning to add any tickers initially and then changed my mind. Again, if you have suggestions please comment. These tickers are just the most popular and highest momentum names, they are not the hidden gems.\n\nEDIT: Ok so I just had this idea by stumbling on somebody's comment just now. Somehow people think Biden is a warmonger. Well, the US hasn't had a good war in some time now. The Afghanistan war is still going on, not really going anywhere, and not being expensive enough to have any meaningful economic consequences. Meanwhile, tensions with Russia and China keep escalating. A war would be just about the last piece of the puzzle for the commodity super-cycle thesis. It would certainly cause massive inflation as demand for industrial metals and other commodities skyrockets, given the war effort resource reallocations. Historically, this is one of the conditions, so I think it's something to keep in mind going forward.\n\nEDIT 2: wtf is going on with silver? All metals are up today 16/02/2021, silver and gold down. Gold I get it, silver I don't fkg get it. It has industrial applications, there is a current SHORTAGE??? Are people just not paying attention, is this just algos smacking the price down? I get the manipulation for silver futures, it's not new, but what about miners? AG and others... this is whack af. I'm doubling down on silver, it will come back to its senses eventually, it has too.\n\nPositions:\n\nX 35c 21/1/2022\n\nSTLD 55c 21/1/2022\n\nVALE 27c 20/1/2023\n\nTRQ 25c 21/1/2022\n\nLUN shares lel\n\nAG 35c 21/12022\n\n**TL;DR** **Basically we've been innovating shit for a decade, we have now amazing tech to make our economy go green af.

The bottom was in Nov, but now is also a good time.\n\nI haven't written a DD but there are plenty out there. I encourage you to do some research. My biggest plays are Suncor and Exon Mobil.\n\nThe bull thesis goes something like this. We've had low prices for 5 years due to US shale (Remember drill baby drill, and how everyone laughed in 2008, well it worked) The US has been a net exporter of oil. We did it, we achieved energy independence, created millions of good jobs, and flooded the world with cheap oil. America, fuck yeah! Unfortunately, cheap oil means oil companies were all hurting.\n\nThen covid hit, global demand dropped from 100 million bbl a day to 92 and oil is so inelastic it destroyed prices. Oil companies were hit hard and posted a year of losses, many cut dividends, shares fell as much as 70%. This also happened under a backdrop of increasing political pressure to move away from oil and a speculative fervor in EVs and green energy.\n\nProduction was wiped out. Oil majors such as RDS and BP are no longer exploring for new finds. Shale? Shale needs 45-55 bbl oil and is unlikely to come back soon. The sentiment is that oil is a dying industry. Oil consumption will never return to precovid levels. We will all drive EVs and use solar and wind.\n\nExcept.. we need oil. We need lots of it. We can't live without it. We will be using oil for another 30 years. Demand is expected to return. Suddenly oil is back to $60 bbl and recovery hasn't started. China and India are growing faster than we can move away from oil.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Below is a link to the E.I.A. report released in Feb detailing our projected energy mix. Keep in mind this was produced by a bipartisan group high on green energy hopium. Also is a projection for crude from JP Morgan over the next year. I through in some DD floating around on reddit. Do a search for oil or XOM or SU on WSB. There is a DD on oil every other day. It just gets lost in a sea of junk stocks.\n\nWhere is all this oil going to come from, if demand will increase beyond 2019 levels and remain above past 2030? That's a great question. And remember that part about demand being inelastic...\n\nThis is what people mean by a new super cycle in commodities. Here we are. Prices are set to soar.\n\nPick an oil company. Look at where they were when oil was at $68 a bbl on average for the year. Look at the price they are at now, and invest.

IMO It's going to take a significant re-imagining of the US economy for US consumer demand to reach previous peaks, the short term change is going to be completely driven off of stimulus payments to normal people. Also in the near term we will definitely see a short peak in oil once interstate travel is normalized again because of pent up pandemic demand to get out of the house, but it will be short lived.\n\nPersonally I would only count your chickens on your predictions for countries who were hit less badly in the job market than the US or in countries that are more totalitarian (like China) who are going to smash spending on infrastructure and manufacturing through with government money whether it makes sense or not.\n\nThis is not a 🌈🐻 post, just that I don't believe American consumer demand will be high enough in the next 3 years to outstrip the production capacity the industry built up during the previous demand peak.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If an infrastructure bill is passed then America will definitely be a big player, there are other countries driving demand for commodities too besides US.
