Most of them have negative net income going back 5 years. Their cash flow from operations is also generally poor.\n\nI don’t know much about the mining business, and I assume uranium mining is very niche within that, so if I missed something, please let me know.\n\nAdditionally, how long of play do you think is going to be? Nuclear power plants take roughly 5 years to build. I did a search and saw several countries are attempting to increase their nuclear power usage, build new plants, etc., But again, it will take years for them to build the plants, and likely take years before the price of uranium experiences a major uptick (at least, from what I can see).\n\nAnd what kind of returns do you think you can attain? The mining operations are all operating in the red, so even with an up-swing in uranium prices, will the profits go to the shareholders or be used to sustain operations at the company? Because with them operating at a loss, how long can they do that before creditors come after them?\n\nAlso thanks for all that research you did! Very informative!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Looks at some of the charts from the last bull run to get an idea, itll def repeat with higher prices", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hi there! Yes, most of them are very unprofitable because the price of uranium needs to get to $50-60/lb to be profitable for alot of companies, that’s why the supply deficit has become so large, incentive to produce needs to come back to the market and it will. Pendulums tend to swing just as hard the other direction short term tho so likely will overshoot since mines take so long to build. U308 prices do need to come up for the shares to appreciate yes. \n\nI can’t really tell you how long this will take. I think we are sitting on 5 years or more of good prices but I’m guessing we see appreciation of prices quite quickly from seasonality and Japanese restarts which will need pounds right away. Not much uranium is bought in the spot market, most is done in long term contracting so new plants will be doing that ahead of time. The plants that are currently getting extended or re-started because of the energy crisis are not priced in along with the overfeeding in conversion from Russian sanctions. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust will be taking a lot of lbs out of the market (I think it was like 30% of mined U last year) so once we get going that will be a tailwind also. \n\nIf/when we see $75+ uranium shareholders WILL be very well compensated don’t worry about that, I doubt that a single company will be around that doesn’t minimum double. \n\nMy opinions obviously", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Expecting to see $80 spot price by year end. UF6 already at record ATH’s and it keeps rising which forces producers of UF6 to significantly increase Uranium (U308) purchases in their centrifuges. This is called over feeding it has to occur. That’s before 150 million lbs of utility contracts that have to be signed, before Sprot Physical Uranium Trust buys another $1 billion of Uranium and before Kazatomprom subsidiary also starts a $500 million Uranium reserve. Next week the Nuclear Energy Symposium meetings in London 7/9 Sept and it kicks off before and after utilities signing contracts. The NEA will also at Symposium update their annual report and demand outlook this will reveal the current deficit in the Uranium market with many countries reversing Nuclear power station closers the biggest being Japan last week announcing another 7 reactor restarts H1 2022. I expect the report will see report a significant increased deficit. \nChina has a massive build programme currently under way and will over take the USA as the highest number of Nuclear Power stations by 2030.  A day does not go by without there being further positive news, like a perfect storm, climate needs a clean base line 24/7 Nuclear power, energy security has to pivot away from Russia, Utilities have to buy 150 million lbs of contracts all coming together at the same time. So $80 per lb by year end and U stocks will being hitting ATH’s similar to 2006/7 plus inflation factor.
