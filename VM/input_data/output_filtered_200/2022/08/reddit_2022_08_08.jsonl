{"title": "Bed Bath & Beyond shares jump more than 50% as message board mentions soar on the troubled, heavily shorted stock", "selftext": " Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond jumped nearly 60% on Monday as meme traders seemed to be betting on the stock despite any apparent catalyst for the move.\n\nThe heavily shorted stock, which has tumbled more than 44% this year, was the most searched name on the WallStreetBets discussion board on Monday according to Quiver Quantitative, where users under a pinned thread titled “AMC and BBBY Memestock Megathread for Monday August 8th, 2022” appeared to be buying up shares of the retail stock.\n\nOne user said they “took out a 27k loan, went all in on BBY,” which a group moderator seemed to confirm. Another user (TheDude0007) alleged to have capitalized on the BBBY spike, turning $45,000 into almost $450,000 using common stock and call options.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has been a part of the meme stock craze that has hit Wall Street in recent years and driven names like GameStop and AMC Entertainment higher as investors bought up shares and forced short sellers to attempt to cover their losses, creating what’s known as a “short squeeze.” According to data from FactSet, a whopping 46% of the stock’s float is sold short.\n\nAs many retailers cope with inflation-wary consumers and excess inventory, Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled to reverse declining sales, fix its merchandising strategy and gain back customers who have fled to its competitors — all while searching for a new leader after the board announced in late June that its CEO Mark Tritton had left the company.\n\nAt the same time, the Union, N.J.-based home goods retailer has also been burning through cash as its net losses grow. While the company has not provided a forecast, it said it expects same-store sales trends to improve after plummeting 24% year-over-year in the quarter ended May 28.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/bed-bath-beyond-shares-jump-30percent-as-message-board-mentions-soar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/bed-bath-beyond-shares-jump-30percent-as-message-board-mentions-soar.html)\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NASDAQ, is currently up 37%.

Also GME is like 20% short right now so i'm not sure where you got 140% from.\n\nAlso doesn't the 107% SI on BBBY kind of tell you whats going on?

No single short position is that large by the way. A short interest above 100% doesn't actually mean anything - a share can be short sold by multiple subsequent trades. \n\n'Retail' can move the price because there are hundreds of thousands of them making small trades individually that add up to a whole lot - doesn't WSB have like 12 million people on it?\n\n\n\n>> At this point literally any amount of critical thinking leads to the conclusion that some serious money fucked up. \n\nI mean betting against BBBY seems pretty reasonable given how overvalued the stock is - they are not doing well as a business right now. \n\n\n\n>> now it's time to see who's holding the bag.\n\n\nProbably the people buying a very expensive stock that's going to be out of business by the end of the year (unless they can raise some capital through another stock offering).\n\nEveryone thinks they are smarter than everyone else and that they'll be able to find someone to buy it at a higher price than they did.\n\n\n>> Here is your \"narrative\", what is more likely?
