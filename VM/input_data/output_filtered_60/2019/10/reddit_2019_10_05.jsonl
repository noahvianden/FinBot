You are exhibiting the same exact behavior you are criticizing.  \n\nSo did you know that there are different types of stories in a news room? Yes there are reprints from services like reuters or AP wire. The idea is that somebody down the line verified this stuff, somehow.  Usually these stories are national ir international--its how your local paper gets serious to share about politics in DC, markets in NY, and the latest Brexit news without flying around the world's energy day.  Often the verification of the story ia centered on characters besides the local author--an employee tasked with observing the Supreme Court daily, eye witnesses, citizens with info, or indeed, inside sources.  If you care about accuracy, you have to do the digging, like reading  the original AP story, or reading more closely to account for where the info came from.  And it's critical you understand the difference between a reporter saying \"x happened\" vs \"person y claims that x happened.\"  There's a massive difference between the two statements. \n\nThere are also straight reports of events.  These feature headlines that are 100% verifiable, and they put only verifiable statements in the first 1/2 or 3/4 of the story,  adding any speculations at the very end (if included at all), and marking those speculations with words like may, might, could mean, etc. If you took journalism in high school, this is that classic format.  \n\nThere are investigative pieces that require time and resources. They are usually limited to a special team and are mostly found in larger operations.  The decline of mainstream media means waaay fewer of these teams.  Were you happy when you got to read the info provided by \"Deepthroat\"? Or to learn that catholic priests in various cities are a bunch reassigned pedos?
