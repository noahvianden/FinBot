I’ve looked up this info on videos and google but can’t get direct answers.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Exercising is buying the 100 shares at the strike price - that's what an option is, a contract to buy shares at a certain price.  What you want to do is sell the option contract itself for profit, which happens when the actual price exceeds your strike price (+ premium), because now to a buyer of your contract they could theoretically purchase the stock at a discount, which is why your option has value at all.\n\nIf you have a 28% gain now, yes you can sell the contract and you will earn that money immediately - you are not buying or selling any actual shares.  Waiting is risky - as you say, the price could go higher and you make more money.  But it also could go lower and the value of your option tanks.  Keep in mind that as an option gives you control over 100 shares, price movements in the stock price are effectively amplified 100 times in the value of your option.  This works in your favor, and also against you.  This is the whole gamble of buying options as a short term investment.  \n\nBut the bigger concern is you bought an option that expires in one week, and option premiums (what you paid, and what a buyer would pay you, for the contract) include a component called time decay, which means the value of the contract declines every day as it gets closer to expiration.  And worse, the *rate* of decay accelerates the closer it gets.  So if you look at the details of your contract in whatever platform you're using, you should see something called 'theta'.  That's how much value in dollar terms you are losing in dollar terms every day that passes.  So one of the things you need to consider is how much gain the stock price needs to achieve by Tuesday to outpace theta decay, and whether that is likely.  \n\nAlso one last note is that your option contract can net you a profit *before* it is truly in the money (actual price exceeding strike + premium), so you don't need to wait until that happens to sell it.  The value of an option increases on any price movement in excess of what it was when you purchased the option - which is why you have 28% gain even though it is not yet in the money.  And what you see in this sub a lot, is people buying options that are way out of the money because they are cheap, and also rise in value quicker than options that are closer in the money.  They never expect the stock price to actually hit the strike, they just want it to go up a little and sell for a 100% gain.

You may get lucky on your first one and get brave thereafter and get rekt. People are trying to warn you. Why go into something ignorant?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The problem I have is when I ask a question people say go google it. I already googled it, watched 3 hours of videos, I understand the key terms and the basics but I’m asking questions that I can’t find the answer to by googling unless I’m just asking the wrong question. I’m not trying to be ignorant, that’s why I only put 200$ down on this Disney stock. The stock price is at 140.30 cents. Meaning I only need 70 cents for the stock to break even for my strike price. Anything after 141 is a profit and now in the money, gaining me the ability to sell 100 stocks at 135, gaining me 7$ per share at 100 shares=700$. Or do I still have that wrong. Not trolling just honestly curious man. As long as it beats the strike price I get the option to trade for 135$ right? From another commenter it seems the expiration isn’t exactly a sell date but rather a choice to exercise the option to buy stock", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "A call is the option to buy at the strike price, not sell.

But from what I’ve learned it’s only the premium I stand to lose really. Is that right? Anyway going back to my example if the stock hits 142$ I can then turn around and buy 100 shares for 140 netting me 1$ profit after my premium of 1$. So 100$ profit off a 207$ investment. Now is that right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes but typically people sell the call before expiry because it is more profitable than excercisingvand buying the shares.  If your premium was $1×100=$100, if you sold now, the contract is worth $2.15×100= $215, netting you $115.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah ok that makes sense so as it gets closer to the strike it’s more profitable to sell that bet to someone else because they will see it as “possible” at a higher premium for them as well", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why do you keep saying a $207 dollar investment?

As the strike price is only within 70 cents, avengers just came out as well. Now would it be better to hold until it goes over the strike or is beneficial to just let it bump a bit and sell my options right before the expiration? That’s something I’ve been thinking about.

Read about the greeks, theta in particular,  your contract is a week from expiry and is going to lose value at an accelerated pace the closer you get to expiry. You can sell the option at any point prior to expiry, provided there is a buyer for your ask.
