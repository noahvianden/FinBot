I have a different view on the matter. I think that as a company committed to growth and still being evaluated by wall street as such, raising prices is a sign that their sub numbers are not up to par come earnings, especially since the competition for streaming content is heating up everywhere. With a huge debt and declining growth, the only way out of such a hole would be to raise sub prices and raise equity. If sub numbers are still growing explosively, why would they risk their market share now? What do you guys think?
