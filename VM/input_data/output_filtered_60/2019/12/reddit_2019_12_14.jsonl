If you are homeless in the United States I doubt your quality of life is significantly better than that of a homeless person in a third-world country. \n\nHaving access to the internet as being a way to get out of poverty is laughable. How exactly would a homeless, poor, or simply someone of low means use the internet to get themselves out of poverty? That's ridiculous. If the Internet alone could get you out of poverty then poverty rates would be much lower.\n\nThe fact is that wages remain low/stagnant and costs continue to increase. The median American salary is $56,000. A single person might be able to invest if they are frugal and fiscally intelligent (assuming they live in a low cost area) but it becomes increasingly difficult for families. Even with both adults working, the costs of rent, transportation, food, and childcare especially are significant. If those basic costs are so high it leaves people with little to invest. \n\nThen you have people who grow up in poverty. Typically, these people reside in low-income areas which are starved of institutional support. You have food deserts, you have rampant over-policing that causes community tensions. If a major corporate employer picks up and leaves in order to squeeze more EPS and up their share price, it can leave communities devastated (see: Detroit). Unemployment / underemployment breed crime, depression, drug abuse, etc. If you grow up in an area like this and still manage to get good grades and stay out of trouble, you are quite lucky. Then maybe you can go to a state school on scholarship and do well. But, if these community tensions spillover and you have poor grades as a result of issues at home, what do you do? Skip college and take a low paying job? Take on massive loans to get a degree, and then have those loans choke your financial freedom for the next 10-20+ years? \n\nI know you say it's not easy, but it's also not as simple as just use the Internet to learn to invest. A lot of people don't have money to invest. The stereotype that poor people go out and buy luxuries with what little they have left has disproven time and time again. \n\nIt's valid to question whether corporate greed and intense profit motive driven by the stock market are good for society writ large. I can promise you that the people whose lives were destroyed in 2008 are probably not doing as well as the banks and other major institutions that were bailed out after 2008. Corporations want to buy back shares in order to up the stock price rather than use that money to pay their workers. Or they up dividends. Either way, helping out the major shareholders while the workers who drive that value production suffer.
