{"title": "Get In Degenerates - We're Going to SPY 434", "selftext": "On March 9, 2009 SPY sat at 67.10 finding a bottom during the GFC.  This was the beginning of the greatest bull market of all time.  Then on September 20, 2018 the market would top out in a dramatic way, only to start recovery in early 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fibonacci fan drawn from 3\\/9\\/2009 - 9\\/20\\/2018. The big picture.](https://preview.redd.it/ld1uc5z27vj51.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=4839915afc5f713c68625f04c71c520d7f608c9e)\n\nBut lets zoom in to 2020 and take a look at why this fib fan is relevant.  In March, the 0.382 channel bottom was spiked through and rejected on an attempt to  climb above.  This level was gapped above the very next day marking the beginning of our bullish trend line.  The orange 0.25 fib channel bottom was broken in April.  SPY then retested this channel bottom and bounced off convincingly.\n\nWith multiple contacts on the main trend line upwards the trend became our friend.  Finally, in late August SPY would put in a hammer candle to break above all time highs, which just happens to also be the main fib channel mid line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY 2020 respecting the fib channel levels.](https://preview.redd.it/z62plb2j8vj51.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=03040932df5c535a1db6d64279674f422662feca)\n\nNow, looking ahead lets continue with the trend is our friend theme.  This is the way, until it's not.  Drawing a fib retrace from 2018 highs to 2009 lows, we establish a fib level of 434.13 (1.618).  This fib level intersects with our original fib fan 0.25 channel top on 10/7.  This marks the earliest potential date of reaching SPY 434.13 while continuing to respect the fib fan levels.  Our friend the trend, meets up with the 434.13 level on 1/14/21.  This gives us a potential time range for reaching a market cycle top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Continuation of the trend marking a potential Cycle top.](https://preview.redd.it/blrue0oh9vj51.png?width=1559&format=png&auto=webp&s=97bb12df065fe6fea761a62608abb01ce96be32f)\n\nSeems unlikely at first glance that this market so disconnected from reality would continue to push higher.  But lets take the past 60 days performance and apply that same performance to the next 60 days.  This puts a landing point at SPY 412.06 by 10/30.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[60 day performance replicated results in SPY 412.06 by 10\\/30](https://preview.redd.it/j591itz3avj51.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6980c9279a99ee6e10a7c30ea3bfd444d39153)\n\nLets find some more data to reinforce the thesis.  By looking at the past 6 hammer candles SPY put on the chart we can observe the gains made until the next correction candle.  By averaging these % gains and days it took to reach them we can forecast the 7th hammer candle.  This hammer was the one that put us over the all time highs.  With the average of 11.78% gains over 32 days we can forecast SPY reaching 379.39 by 9/25.  This chart was made the day we broke ATH.  Looks like we're still on track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY hammer candles forecast](https://preview.redd.it/d9sj3fc1bvj51.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=836c9fc7c0145f7b657eae667a93d45dce3dba29)\n\nFor those of you that don't believe in fib levels, I will leave you with this.  The top of the dotcom bubble  in March of 2000 forecasted the rejection level for SPY in February of 2020.  Breakthrough and a runner so far on the second attempt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fib retrace March 2000 to all time lows for SPY](https://preview.redd.it/hnk4q3pecvj51.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=0834b5f2e5b505199b4fdd59acf358aeb6b5d59c)\n\nBut a runner to where?  For you David Hunter fanboys out there, don't blow your load.  If this fib retrace continues to be respected, the extreme super-cycle high is 451.43.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Potential super-cycle high of 451.43](https://preview.redd.it/utc020d7dvj51.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=110a54680219c5784246fd2a70b9c6b729dceee7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My current SPY positions](https://preview.redd.it/32ieewdudvj51.png?width=179&format=png&auto=webp&s=04083edfef70843e49274e46c4e277036e191759)\n\nFinal thought - The increased volatility once  SPY 225.55 fib was broken noticeable on the final chart is the beginning of a topping formation that has been  years in the making.  The end and beginning of cycles will provide parabolic behavior.  Don't fight the trend.\n\nIf you like my work, you can [follow me](https://twitter.com/GnDoty) on twitter.\n\nPS - All your megaphone charts with 360 as a top... We're going to spike through to 363-366 sucking in more fomo longs, retest the megaphone to shake them out and suck in bears.  Then go parabolic to 391-394 which is a fib cluster to make all you SPY 400c holders shake in your boots as we pause.\n\nEdit: Thank you all very much for the awards!", "id": "iimh9p", "created_utc": 1598676087.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the Crayola Experience.\n\n*I am not a bot.
