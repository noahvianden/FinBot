{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 4, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 4, 2020**\n\nStocks hit record levels again today despite disappointing data on job creation in November. The DOW and S&P 500 each hit a record-high intraday, led by energy and financial stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 0.8% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.84%, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.41% up.\n\nYesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) is experiencing supply chain issues that could result in only half of the estimated vaccines entering distribution. Pfizer, along with partner BioNTech (BNTX) announced plans to ship 50 million vaccines by year-end, half of the 100 million doses previously expected. The company says it still anticipates delivering over 1 billion doses by the end of 2021.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April’s record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections this month and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. However, it is important to note that recent job data has surprised to the upside. The weekly unemployment reported released yesterday showed the first drop in new unemployment claims in three weeks.\n\nAs market participants and economist upgrade their estimates for 2021, many believe that cyclical and rotation stocks, like energy, financial, and reopening stocks,  that were hardest hit by the pandemic will extend gains into next year. Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual said, “As you move into 2021, there will be broader economic growth, it will be more inclusive, you will see continued fiscal stimulus – I do believe we will get a package. You’ll see the Fed continue. You have pent-up demand. Think about the rotation that we’ve been talking about … it’s underway right now and it will continue into 2021. Think value, think small-cap, think emerging markets.”\n\nUnfortunately, the United States once again set single-day records for new infections and deaths yesterday. According to Johns Hopkins University, there were more 211,762 new cases and 2,858 deaths reported yesterday, overtaking the previous record of 205,000 new infections and 2,760 deaths set yesterday. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he would impose extremely strict stay-at-home orders when intensive care units reach less than 15% availability, which he expects to happen soon. The stay-at-home restrictions will begin with 48 hours’ notice and remain in place for at least three weeks once they are ordered. Gov. Newsom said, “If we don’t act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed. If we don’t act now, we will continue to see the death rate climb,”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The House of Representatives passed a bill today that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level and set up a process to expunge past convictions. The chamber approved the measure in a 228-164 vote. Only five Republicans and one independent backed it. Six Democrats voted against the bill. It marks the first time the House has voted to remove cannabis from the Federal Controlled Substances Act but the act is expected to be shut down in the Senate. \n* The UN voted to remove cannabis from the Schedule 4 list, where it is listed alongside dangerous and highly addictive drugs like heroin.\n* According to the Wall Street Journal, Airbnb is schedules to IPO on December 10.

Yes it’s obvious that nvidia took advantage of high prices with Turing because they had no competition.  But they were still innovating.
