GME also sells consoles just like BB sold popcorn and candy and videogames too if I recall. \n\n3. Both were leaders in their dying industry with little competition. BB had hollywood video and independent stores, GME  has digital sales and walmart as competition. \n\n4. Both are/were run by complete fucking jokes of CEOs.\n\n5. Both had  heavenly intervention where things could have turned around . For BB it was when Reed Hastings tried to get them to buy or at least invest in Netflix, the  BB CEO threw him out, then after the meeting they tried to launch a copycat service.  GME has Ryan Cohen offering to transform the company and buying up shares only to be rebuffed by the CEO/board which are willing to devalue and take a poison pill rather then try to change.\n\n6. Both have  tried to branch out since Brick and mortar is expensive and dying. GME made a deal for a % of digital sells from MS, and is thinking of selling computer parts?? Like Best buy and Newegg don't exist. While Blockbuster started their Netflix clone I think it was called Blockbuster Direct or Connect or something like that, they also started selling videogames, music and old used stock, they would have sold you the movie promo displays if they could have made any money doing it.\n\n7. They both got hit with massive reduction in B&M  Sales for different reasons. With GME it was mostly COVID, Indoor malls during the Holiday season is just asking to get sued for anything that goes wrong. Blockbusters Covid was called the Internet/Bootlegs/torrents/redbox, none of which had late fees (remember those) you got charged for not returning stuff on time, sometimes multiple x  the amount of the rental for one day late.\n\n8. It's a slow decline but it is declining. Blockbuster held on for years, there is still even  one store in Bend OR. But paying mall rents and teenagers getting $15 an hour to work a cash register while other sellers don't have these expenses is just not sustainable in the long run, unless there is high traffic, which there is not, and your marquee product is in low supply and has low margins even if you can sell it.\n\n9.
