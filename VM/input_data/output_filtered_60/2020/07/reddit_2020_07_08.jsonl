{"title": "Defense stocks - what the heck is going on", "selftext": "I've had discussion with a couple people on why defense is doing so poorly right now, wanted to get a broader general opinion. I'm going to leave BA and RTX out because of their large commercial exposure but leave in GD, HII and LHX since it's much smaller. I'll focus on a core of LMT/NOC/GD/LHX/HII but this can be extended to others like KTOS, LDOS, CACI etc. Here are today's closing prices for reference:\n\nLMT - $354 / NOC - $304 / GD - $145 / LHX - $168 / HII - $168\n\nDefense stocks - what the heck is happening?\n\nTaking a look over the last month:\n\nLMT is down 15% / NOC is down 12% / GD is down 13% / LHX is down 19% / HII is down 18%\n\nAnd the question is why? Particularly in the case of NOC and LMT that are as close to pure plays as you can get - why are defense contractors hemorrhaging? Some of these are trading near their post-March crash lows\n\n1 - Revenue is nearly unaffected by COVID, and backlogs keep growing\n\nDefense contracts have long award processes and are usually multi-year and booked in advance. Here are some of the ridiculous backlog sizes from the first quarter\n\nLMT - backlog of $144 billion\n\nNOC - backlog of $64 billion\n\nGD -  backlog of $86 billion\n\nLHX - not sure? Didn't see it in the May earnings call - It's somewhere near $20 billion for the end of last year and the book to bill increased slightly, so somewhere around there\n\nHII - backlog of $42 billion\n\nLMT and NOC noted that COVID would have insignificant impacts to revenue and fronted payments to their suppliers in some cases to help them out. Most contractors had a positive book to bill with increased sales and increasing margins\n\n2 - Target prices are miles away and a ton of buy ratings\n\nI'm going to pull some average target prices from WSJ\n\nLMT - average $430, upside of 21%\n\nNOC - average $389, upside of 28%\n\nGD - average of $171, upside of 18%\n\nLHX - average of $240, upside of 42%\n\nHII - average of $222, upside of 32%\n\n3 - Defense spending is not shrinking any time soon, tensions are rising\n\nThe new National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been flying through approvals, and allocated $741B for spending. The current bill is allocated at $738B. This flew through the Senate Armed Services Committee with a 25-2 pass and will probably pass both Senate and House, as it seems defense spending is the one thing every one agrees on. And we are not the only nation increasing spending\n\nUS and China relations have deteriorated. Australia just announced a big beef up, raising their spending goal over the next decade from $135B to $187B. Japan's been increasing their spending for years, as has SK and everyone else in the region. Big wins for companies like RTX, LMT and others involved\n\nEurope has been flat but Middle East is buffing up. India over the winter announced the purchase of several billion in US helicopters and imports will probably grow if tensions with China continue\n\n4 - Not dependent on a China trade deal\n\nSticking this here due to futures crashing briefly overnight after Navarro made his late night comments a couple weeks ago. If things do go south with that deal, it will not effect revenue\n\n\nNot to mention pluses such as a nice dividend, industry preference towards established giants due to high entry costs, etc. Hilariously enough, I found an old article from the end of 2018 that had the same feeling I do now\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/defense-stocks-are-lagging-and-there-are-no-good-reasons-why-51544614201\n\nAfter this article was written, defense had a major major outperform year in 2019. LMT stock price grew 50% in 2019 for instance, similar to NOC\n\nSo - what gives? Is defense really just not sexy? Are these companies just thrown in with industrials and traded in step with the rest of the market? Am I crazy?\n\nEDIT: full disclosure I do have calls on NOC and LMT", "id": "hn9ydm", "created_utc": 1594180365.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": "Dunno, but I'm becoming more and more bullish on not just Defense but the entire Industrial sector as a whole.

The issue for the Democrats is not just national debt getting out of control, we'd also see some pressure to add spending on social programs. I recall California doing a study about single payer and even if all the existing employer premiums + Medicare & Medicaid premiums could be redirected, you'd still be short another $300B annually (and that's just one US state). So the defense budget pales in comparison to what these social programs would cost.\n\nAnother thing is that there are many other sectors of the stock market that are dragging on.
