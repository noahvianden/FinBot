{"title": "Help-out-a-billionaire thread", "selftext": "You know, traditionally r/wsb smooth brain has been a simple animal with a heart of gold. If things have gone wrong, you guys haven't learned anything at all from it. But if you have hit a jackpot, you have been generous with donations to charities.\n\nBut the one thing we haven't really shared as much has been the deep wisdom of the ordinary people from all walks of life. I mean, we would teach our own kids everything we know, so why not do the same for those struggling hedge fund managers, right? I mean, they are only trying to make living and are clearly in a need for some fatherly guidance (just not in the Vatican way of giving it), so I just though it would be time to make a concerted effort to give something back.\n\nI was very inspired by the comments section at r/news, where people are already giving some very helpful advice.\n\nu/Blank_bill suggested that they should invest their money. This is a solid advice. I've heard that McDonald's has been known to help learning this, so hedge fund managers really should give it a shot getting a job there. Like u/GhostofRimbaud said it, they should try looking in the paper and going into establishments with resume in hand, give the boss a firm handshake and ask for a job. I like this, it gives a good impression.\n\nu/bill_hilly also very helpfully noted, that stock market has an inherent risk, so they should not invest more than they are willing to lose. But they could use that stimulus check to do that, u/dietsaddad was kind enough to point that one is coming in no time at all, just 10 short months.\n\nMany people, including but not limited to u/BrownSugarBabe, rightfully pointed that skipping the avocado toast and Starbucks coffee and maybe driving an Uber would help to make up the difference. As u/artbored noted, they wouldn't be struggling nearly as much if they just skipped those $7 lattes.\n\nThat's an amazing insight and managers clearly should learn from this. They just have to, as u/csirke4 and many others pointed out, pull themselves by the bootstraps. Maybe learn to code Python or something.\n\nOr perhaps, like u/WeAllSuk pointed, maybe they have some old video games that they could sell.\n\nBut if they can't get a job (although u/coachmdubz said the nearest Amazon warehouse is hiring), they could just, as kindly noted by u/Brewboo, \"maybe take that unpaid internship and through hard work and determination one day they too can have a lucrative career.\"\n\nThis is amazing, with this advice those poor managers on a good career path in no time at all. Or like u/HeyItsTheShanster said, they could learn a trade and be their own bosses.\n\nPersonally, I believe families should help and support each other and it's very normal in most part of the world for the children to help out their struggling parents. I mean, camgirls are always wanted and there is always that occasional r/wallstreetbets millionaire in need of that special massage, that could really help to pay for a tuition if the hedge fund manager's paycheck from the Wendy's is not quite enough.\n\nNow, I know what you guys are thinking: \"hedge fund managers don't read reddit and those texts in billboards and behind flying airplanes are too damn short!\" This is why we could use some outside help to make all the users' helpful advice more visible to them. Just like John Oliver always helped Trump on Fox commercial breaks.\n\nBut I'm sure those poor, struggling hedge fund managers could use all the advice $GME holders can give them from their vast life experiences. Now, we wouldn't want them have to sell one of their yachts, would we?\n\nI am eagerly waiting to hear all the nuggets of wisdom you guys have to give for those poor folks at Melvin Capital and their friends.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: since some people seem confused, let me clarify. Point is that one of the great pleasures of life is to piss people off by making them eat their own words. If you can make it publicly in an incredibly sarcastic and passive-aggressive tone, even better.\n\nIn this case, giving the reckless billionaire fucks running the hedge funds the same condescending advice \"lazy\" young people struggling with a low-wage dead-end jobs have been receiving for years.\n\nEdit 3: It's one thing to shit on hedge funds by refusing to sell, but we can do better, we can really rub it in while we still have the media attention. \n\nIf even one person with journalistic or otherwise relevant background or any connection to reporters, actors, screenwriters or other people sees this and sees some potential comedic value in it and any of the lines end up being used somewhere, we might have been able ruin some bigwig's day.

{"title": "Due Diligence - My Resons for Going Long in Blackberry", "selftext": "I know that last week was a bit on the turbulent side for BB. I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.\n\nCurrently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.\n\nBefore getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.\n\n**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**\n\nFor starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).\n\nIn December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.\n\nHowever, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.\n\n**BLACKBERRY QNX**\n\nBlackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.\n\nRead more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).\n\n**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**\n\nJust like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.\n\nNIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.\n\nWhy is this good for Blackberry?\n\n1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *\"powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng\"* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**\n2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *\"Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology\"* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**\n3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand \"Hycan\", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.\n\nRead more [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology-301211498.html).\n\n**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**\n\nAs you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.\n\nAWS launched its IoT platform in 2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.\n\nBy linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.\n\nThis reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.\n\n**PROJECT KUIPER**\n\nI want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name \"**Project Kuiper**\". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.\n\nHow could BB fit into this thing?\n\nWell, here's my hypothesis:\n\nWhy would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?\n\nAlthough there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way \"out there\". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.\n* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper", "id": "lah1uf", "created_utc": 1612220885.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "Grabbed 300 more today, holding 600 total (averaged down).
