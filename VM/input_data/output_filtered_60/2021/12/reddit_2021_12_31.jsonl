They will never run down inventory completely, but if we assume 6 days of inventory at the end of December (prudent compared to prior months) and a daily production rate of 1.9k cars produced a day, then closing inventory would reduce to 6*1.9= 11.4k. \n\nThis is a reduction in inventory by 16.1k-11.4k=4.7k\n\nIf we take the 57k produced in November and add the 4.7k inventory reduction we might have expected 61.7k deliveries in December (assuming no ramping up of production at all).
