{"title": "🚀🚀 Trending stocks last week - TSLA, CLOV, AAPL, PLTR, SPCE", "selftext": " Hello  everyone! So I was analyzing the trending stocks on reddit on the past  week and I figured out I might just do a post for you guys regarding my  analysis. Keep in mind that this specific tool does not track some  stocks, for instance $WISH, because of the way it is build.\n\nSo, this week's most mentioned stocks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv3vm6cb4u771.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c89129f1e3f41f27943e3e6a9ce627c67dacc06\n\nI  noticed some growth compared to the previous week in TSLA, SPCE and  JPM. With regard to TSLA, we can see that the sentiment is positive, but  going south for the past days:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pe2n8hhc4u771.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a8b7220cb84d58e70ddda15514c3fd8a9c81e7d\n\nRegarding SPCE, the growth was quite recent (as we all know), and the sentiment was also quite positive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tw9czad4u771.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ca5bbc66d66187d26e0fbe8a978167cd8846473\n\nJPM also had quite the explosion this week in post mentioning it, with the sentiment being quite positive as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d76sy9e4u771.png?width=1743&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f36f379eeed4e71df9e761d90a16c6823b87ac7\n\nNOTE:  None of this is financial advice, please do your own due diligence and  understand that the stock market is influenced by multiple factors.", "id": "o90e86", "created_utc": 1624811245.0, "score": 271, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 62, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "🍀💪🏽", "score": 52, "replies": []}, {"body": "🇮🇪🍀", "score": 36, "replies": []}, {"body": "🍀🍀🍀🍀", "score": 53, "replies": []}, {"body": "$CLOV", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "CLOV ♾♾♾♾♾", "score": 56, "replies": []}, {"body": "Clov priming for launch", "score": 56, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "This is really all you need to know. $CLOV", "score": 36, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just give CLOV time baby", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, gonna be a while before it makes big moves again.

Ive heard WISH more than any of these stocks this week.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "It is indeed unfortunate. The problem with tracking WISH in the current version of the tracker is that it would mark posts saying 'I wish I was rich' as a post mentioning WISH. That is a problem with the problem so far and in future versions I am trying to fix it. Hope you understand the problem, but thank you very much for your comment!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Were you not the one that did one that had WISH as the most mentioned? Cause it was, lol. It was number 1 beating AMC. EDIT: it's someone else. They have one they created that has Wish destroying all of these and more as most mentioned this past week including this weekend. Hopefully the factored in what you said about people using that word commonly. But, I think they did because there has been more and more posts here and on twitter of people making big bets on it this past week.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I do understand the problem. But it still deserves to not be ignored from the list. I would include it where it belongs and just mention that 10-15% of WISH mentions are potentially from use of the word, and not of the stock. Then the people reading your post can make their own decisions based on its position on your charts.\n\nIMO, most people saying WISH mean the stock and people who hate the ticker go out of their way never to say the word WISH. The fact it's not on the list at all kinda makes me feel like the list is not based on reality, I think it should be revised cause it feels disingenuous to the amount of love WISH gets on this subreddit.\n\nAlso, 90% of the time people say I wish I was rich, they are intentionally mentioning the ticker.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8x3dy/i\\_built\\_a\\_program\\_that\\_tracks\\_mentions\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8x3dy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Here it is. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8x3dy/i\\_built\\_a\\_program\\_that\\_tracks\\_mentions\\_and/", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Because it’s getting spammed by bots constantly.

The amount of times I've been called a bot for liking something others don't is incredible. You guys are out of your minds and are full of hatred.

All they have done in their history is mention this stock. That seems pretty fake to me. No doubt there are genuine people interested, especially now after the bots did their work, but it has been fishy as hell.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Fair, but it's all ass backwards. The people bashing bots are bashing plenty of real people and calling them names and fakes. When you all keep crying wolf no one can be bothered to believe you anymore. Everyone is tired of hearing you cry fake at every living person and pump and dump at every corner. Also WISH ain't that bad. If you can't see the upside you're just blindly following other bashers. It's like you've unknowingly become a bash bot yourself.", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "This is wrong because $WISH is the top trending stock and the Top stock in volume.
