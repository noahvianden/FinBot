{"title": "Thoughts on \"model 2\", the $25 000 car", "selftext": "When i do my daily commute to work and back (8 miles) i meet \\~500 cars. >90% of them with only one person in the car, going to their workplace. I hate the commuting and i guess most of the persons i meet feel the same.\n\nThere is a huge market for a different way of commuting, here's my thoughts:\n\nThere's been rumors that the $25 000 car is actually two models. My thought about this is that one of them will be fully autonomus commuting vehicle for two persons, without steering wheel. In size and look it'll resemble this:\n\n[https://europe.autonews.com/blogs/renault-twizy-gets-new-life-korea-motorcycle-replacement](https://europe.autonews.com/blogs/renault-twizy-gets-new-life-korea-motorcycle-replacement)\n\nThe intended use case is suburban middle class going to and from work, i.e trips <20 miles. \n\nThat use case is the most common for most cars (at least in europe) .\n\nThe vehicle can be made smaller, hence lighter and with a smaller battery, \\~20-30 kWh\n\nProduction could be extremely high compared to a full size vehicle, probably 3:1 in the same factory with the same resources available.\n\nPerformance is not a priority: You want to go to work in a comfortable way hence acceleration and top speed is not of importance. A smooth ride from A to B is all that matters. If the car is fully autonomous you like to be productive on your way to work without spilling your coffe.\n\nSafety is of course essential, both for the rider and the surrounding. Active and passive safety features will be critical for succes. A small and light vehicle is less safe than a big, but interior AND exterior airbags will take care of the safety both for the passenger and the pedestrians.\n\nA vehicle with an open body will be easier to service and maintain, and if the design is made with Tesla Bot in mind for service, reconditioning, charging et cetera this will be a transport means with cost cutting in mind from the drawing board, through the factory and throughout it's life span.\n\nThe car won't be for sale, It'll be owned and operated by Tesla. \n\nEach car can replace 3-5 other cars + plenty of taxis. The average middle class person spends in the range of $3-500 dollar per month on commuting and is willing to spend about the same to get to and from work in a safe, clean, comfortable and productive way hence each car can bring in $1000-2500 in revenue per month. The cost of building the car will probably be in the range of $10 - $15 000 hence the profitability will be extreme for Tesla\n\nThis is totally in line with Elon's vision to disrupt transport, and this is how each kWh of battery will have the greatest impact on reducing CO2 emissions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your thought?", "id": "pivtkd", "created_utc": 1630919110.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": "There are two devices for two distinct use-cases:\n\n* Privately owned cars\n\n* Fleet-owned robotaxis \n\nThe purchasing considerations are very different between the two: \n\nWhen you buy a car for your own use, you want it to be flexible enough to serve multiple roles (1/2/4 people, with/without luggage, etc) and you want it to be pretty.\n\nWhen you buy 1000 cars for a robotaxi fleet you want to be able to hose down the interior, to shave every cent off per-mile and maintenance costs, and you have no problem with buying 400 single seaters, 400 two seaters, and 150 with 7 seats and 50 vans.\n\nTherefore, once we're in the age of robotic driving, the market splits (and the privately owned car segment is significantly smaller than today's entire car market)", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "The self driving market is one of the trippiest market paradigm shifts I can remember.

So most of them will be sold directly from manufacturers to fleets.\n\nIt may be that the manufacturers will try to operate their own fleets. But that requires a lot of up-front capital. So they may sell self-driving cars to individuals at a price that is well below the value of self-driving software, and then charge them a fee per mile for self-driving for their own use or another's fleet (say $0.1/mile), and a share of the profits if they add their car to their own fleet.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If tesla wants to build a fleet of their own and needs 10 billion to produce a million vehicles they would turn to the capital market and ask for money (if needed) with a valuation of 700 billion that would hardly dilute the stock at all", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I believe they have 14b cash on hand as of the last quarterly update.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "And growing day by day.

In two years, 30k cars will be nothing for Tesla, but it’ll make a huge dent when deployed into a few cities.

{"title": "The Index Fund 'Bubble' - Should you be worried?", "selftext": "A recurring theme over the past year has been one ‘expert’ after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop.   \n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/z8f8yutkpvl71.gif)\n\n>Could Index Funds Be ‘Worse Than Marxism’? – [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/)  \n>  \n>This \\[index funds\\] is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the Great Financial Crisis. It will be the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things – [Michael Burry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html)  \n>  \n>Is Passive Investment Actively Hurting the Economy? - [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-passive-investment-actively-hurting-the-economy)\n\nBut at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week’s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \\[1\\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)\n\nIf you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes\n\n**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**\n\nThe problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)\n\nIf you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \\[2,3\\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.\n\nAdding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it’s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it’s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\\[4\\].\n\nNow that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder\n\n**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**\n\nI believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)\n\nThe above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).\n\nFinally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.\n\n**Alternatives to index funds**\n\nWhile researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.\n\nAs of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN & FB) account for more than 23% of the S&P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.\n\nThere are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation\n\n[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)\n\n[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!\n\nWhile the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!\n\nUntil next week :)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (>90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!\n\n\\[2\\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing’s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.\n\n\\[3\\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.\n\n\\[4\\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other.", "id": "piyri4", "created_utc": 1630932412.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|64|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|218|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq1mv3/an_unbiased_take_on_the_robinhood_ipo_the_good/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9c0zc/onlyfans_the_prn_empire_with_no_prn/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6wr4/does_index_inclusion_positively_affect_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otb1wm/a_primer_into_payment_for_order_flow_pfof/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0esdp/do_hedge_funds_beat_the_market_i_analyzed_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4tjye/do_actively_managed_mutual_funds_beat_the_index/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kl4ixe) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/nobjos, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sooo.... stick to 0dte spy options?", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "> Sooo.... stick to 0dte spy options?\n\nObviously. 60% of the time, at least.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "60% of the time it works 100%", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This thesis is ignoring a rather huge factor.\n\nSometimes people sell.\n\nFund outflows happen, and they can escalate.

Money will come out, prices drop, money comes out etc. In normal trading these stock buys don't hugely affect prices because the buy in was gradual and didn't increase volatility because these stocks are held long term mostly. Volatility will only rocket when everyone is trying to get out of the market at once.\n\nA lot of the money going into the stock market is debt and will come out when interest rates rise, and as the Atlantic article says a lot of these stocks are now increasingly correlated. When something starts tanking everything will, and the logic that you buy the index because weak companies will drop out won't make sense because everything will drop at once, and will drop proportionally to its share of the S&P because that's how these ETFs weight it. The biggest and most inflated stocks will lose the most and won't drop out of the index. When everything is so correlated moves can result in herd mentality and a huge crash.

While you mention that big tech accounts for 23% of the s&p, I would say big tech performs astronomically well since they always bring great returns and any analysis on them turns out well to be true. They drag along the rest of the market and as a result buying a fund pushes the price up on other companies that might be less deserving of a stock price raise.
