{"title": "I am going to short the whole state of California", "selftext": "I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts California is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\n\nUnder the current NON-GOVERNATOR government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of Hollywood California. Due to systemic nepotism, there are Stanford teachers that don't know what IP-addresses are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never not fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The NON-GOVERNATOR Government solved this, against advise of Mel Gibson, with constant remakes. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the Hollywood Buck which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\n\nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates of Silicon Valley (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison watch dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as TSLA stock and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated opinions comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). Californians are more likely to have their privilege checked than any other state as there are so many tales of Political Correctness and shaming and threats of getting cancelled. This equates to the most based citizens leaving CA and most CA based businesses diversifying out of the state as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Californian in history Steve Jobs who is now a dead American.\n\nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock. \nI first thought about shorting California over a year ago when I was researching ~~hot Hollywood actors~~ the state.  (I'm a diamond hand, I read much on the state for fun). I found the only index tracking CA (ECA) wasn't an accurate representation of CA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of CA (mostly to other parts of America). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on CA going full Paper Hands/Detroit. Detroit having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\nMy new broker, Harambe's Diamond Hands, allows negative currency positions as long you post your kids as collateral. Now my native currency are HarambeCoin, where inflation in 2020 was fekkin' high while the Hollywood Buck was fekkin' higher in 2020. That equals a super-fekkin' high return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting HarambeCoin inflation to stay between fekkin' low to fekkin' lower every year while the Hollywood Buck (ticker HOBO) stays north of 69% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for CA to implode.\n\n\nTL;DR: Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/\n\n\nWow, lots of people with no memory, or maybe people are just new to this place.
