Hard lesson to learn and a long lesson as you need the right account circumstances before even getting started analyzing trading like this first hand, and when you get there it feels like you are back at square 1 on the learning curve, because everything you learned about options trading with a child's account turns out is seriously incomplete, useless or wrong. I am back at/still at square one in my learning I feel, even tho I been doing this for a few years now. It is easy to get the basics but tough to get good without a mentor or working in the industry for a time - not impossible to self learn just a long road and I'd love to figure out a better way to address this. \n\nI like your one hand tied/nuts kicked analogy and I agree. It took me too long to realize if you as a trader can't step in to buy or short a full +100 delta of the stock that underlies a contract should you need to (*and* hold that delta overnight when needed) then you are not truly trading options on stocks. You are trading *options on options* at best, I don't know what to call it, most likely you're trading options on lies, hopes, dreams and prayers. Options are contracts with benefits to both buyer and seller, if you can't utilize all the benefits of a contract (should you want to or need to) compared to others in the market who can then you will always be stuck paying full price for a thing but only getting half its features. You give away value for free because you can't utilize it and you may be giving it away without even knowing it. Even if you did realize what is actually happening, you are outgunned in the market and a sucker indeed. Holding all the risk in exchange for a fraction of the reward, maybe. PM margin or at the very least PDT size accounts are a must in order to bring trading in options markets to a slightly, tolerable level of unfair. \n\n> *Your over leveraged if cannot take day off\"\n\nIs this a quote? It's interesting. I guess you could also argue 'if you can take a day off you are under leveraged'. That's ok. Taking a day off shouldn't be free, there should be some cost. Maybe the goal should be a cost as minimal as possible. There are no perpetual motion machines. Even the most algo of algo trading shops I have seen, with many more computers than employees, still have humans show up to work in the office *every day*. There is no such thing as a stable perfect amount of leverage either, so maybe lever up on good on days when you are fully present, and lever down on days you take off, hopefully these days balance in the right way. \n\nLearning on how to adjust that ongoing leverage and risk is the real skill, art and science There are many ways people go about it. I like to use calendar and diagonal spreads. I think calendar and diagonals are the most misunderstood and mispriced premiums in the market. I don't claim to understand them or price them better than anyone else, but at least I know the market maker across from me in the trade can't price them better either. We are guessing together. Ever read a good explanation of the relationship between option price, implied volatility and vega? You have not. Because all else equal and constant, implied volatility = price, and so vega is basically as useful as saying if $100 goes up to $101, that is a 1% increase so $1 = 1%, for now, maybe. Vega is not a risk. Volatility might be a risk tho. In long calendar spreads you will often read you are long volatility and/or long vega...OK...At the same time you will read a long calendar spread profits when the underlying security stays relatively stable and moves little and it losses money if the underlying experiences any relatively large rapid moves in either direction (now that sounds a lot like volatility to me). Well fuck which is it? A calendar spread long volatility but it losses money when the stock is volatile? WTF. Volatility helps long dated options more than short dated options you say AND volatility is what kills a calendar spread? Both can't be true. But both are true. You could say there is a difference between volatility and implied volatility? That's obvious because volatility is volatility and IV is just an output of price. A calendar spread is both long and short volatility at the same time in an unknown ratio the market will decide later. If you want to take a day off sometimes, calendar spreads are your friend, shifting the term structure of the position or flipping the short and long sides make for relatively easy adjustments and hedging. \n\nEnjoy Europe with the family.
