But Tesla is probably not fucked \n\n\n>Following our standard practice, Tesla informed NHTSA about the incident immediately after it occurred. What we know is that the vehicle was on a divided highway with Autopilot engaged when a tractor trailer drove across the highway perpendicular to the Model S. Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S. Had the Model S impacted the front or rear of the trailer, even at high speed, its advanced crash safety system would likely have prevented serious injury as it has in numerous other similar incidents.\n\n>#***It is important to note that Tesla disables Autopilot by default and requires explicit acknowledgement that the system is new technology and still in a public beta phase before it can be enabled. When drivers activate Autopilot, the acknowledgment box explains, among other things, that Autopilot “is an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times,\" and that \"you need to maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle” while using it.***\n\n>Additionally, every time that Autopilot is engaged, the car reminds the driver to “Always keep your hands on the wheel. Be prepared to take over at any time.” The system also makes frequent checks to ensure that the driver's hands remain on the wheel and provides visual and audible alerts if hands-on is not detected. It then gradually slows down the car until hands-on is detected again.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Eh", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "\n\n\nWht would fscomeau do?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Straddle Miracle Grow", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "The tractor trailer was transporting garlic", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Short Tesla\n\n>Millions of drivers will want a refund.

This is not helped by marketing people like Musk over-hyping their systems' capabilities over the objection of engineers.\n\nBut the truth is unless the car is integrated with radar+lidar, it's almost exclusively dependent on image sensors and maybe ultrasound (parking sensors).  Problem with current generation image sensors and detection algorithm is that they're nowhere as good as the human eye.  And if you can't see something clearly, the sensor sure as hell can't either.  This won't change for quite some time, at least a decade or two out.  If you have a late model high-end car think about how often the lane keeping and frontal collision avoidance system misdetects things in the rain or with the sun shining in you face, you can see how far we still have to go.\n\nWhat we're seeing happening is the product of a decade's work picking the low-hanging fruit and got it working 80% for 20% of the work.
