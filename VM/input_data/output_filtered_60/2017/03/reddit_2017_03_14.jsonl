Tl;dr Google Poor Man's Covered Call and watch tastytrade's videos.\n\nYou buy one call farther out in time- I like doing this with LEAPs (long-term equity anticipation securities). The farther out of the money they are, the cheaper they are. Say AMD is at $11. The $15 Jan 2018 option cost is only premium, no intrinsic value. I'm bullish on AMD and I think it will be over $15 by Jan 2018, so I buy the call. If I had more money to spend I'd buy the ATM call, but the $15 call is pretty cheap and I think it will ultimately expire ITM.\n\nIn the meantime, I sell short term calls against it. I might sell the $13 or $14 weekly or monthly call, depending on what I can get for it. If AMD stays below the strike of the written call, it expires worthless and I keep my premium. In a way, this reduces the amount I paid for the LEAP. Selling naked calls requires a lot of buying power, whereas selling a $13 call against my long term $15 call puts me at risk of losing $200 plus the premium I paid for the 15 call minus the amount I collected for the 13 call.\n\nIf AMD starts to creep over $15, the LEAP is gaining intrinsic value. It's simultaneously losing extrinsic value due to time, but that starts to decay much closer to expiration so right now I'm not really worried. I can still keep selling calls above the current price as time moves on, because I have the right to buy the stock at $15. If I sell a $21 call and am assigned, I can exercise and buy for $15 and then turn around and sell it for $21. In the meantime, I've been reducing my cost basis in the $15 call by selling calls against it, so I might even be at the point of basically receiving money for buying the call, so it's all profit.\n\nThis works just like a covered call, except you're covered by owning a call instead of stock. If we get to Jan 2018 and AMD is far enough above $15 and looks like it has room to grow, I'll probably exercise and keep selling calls- but those will be covered by stock instead of the LEAP. \n\nIf for whatever reason I need fast cash and AMD is above $15, I can sell for profit. I could even sell for a profit right now because the extrinsic value has grown the closer the price has gotten to the strike. But if I sell it too early and I'm still really bullish, I lose the opportunity to gain even more profit because the price of the option will increase as if I were holding stock once it's ITM (more or less).

This is offset because your LEAP is gaining value. I imagine your LEAP is a bigger position, right?

However, I keep the premium from selling the $13 call (which is probably negligible in comparison but it's important to note so you know how it works).\n\nI sell the same number of calls as the numbers of LEAPs I own.

I can't tell you how many videos I watched because it doesn't really click until I see it in action. Paper trade some of these and keep an eye on how it works.

You probably won't be assigned until expiration or very close to it.

AMD is pretty volatile and can go up or down a good chunk in one day, so I think it's smart to sell strikes far enough above the current price so it won't go ITM, but even if it does it could fall the next day.
