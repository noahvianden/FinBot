Trade fairs / conventions / exhibitions closed. It means that thousands of companies won't show their new product lines, won't find customers for machines they invested in designing for past 7 years. Some industries rely on trade fairs (you cannot choose textiles for your factory online etc). Some trade fairs happen only every 5 years and every world industry player is there. Many have been cancelled, some have been moved a year forward.\n\n2. All sorts of service industries closed. Some can't cope with 3 month closure. Means insolvency, means unemployment.\n\n3. People are not driving, oil industry suffers.\n\n4. Airlines suffer, oil industry suffers.\n\n5. Even small stuff like beauticians, hairdressers, barbers - suddenly no work, no income. Suddenly they are not using all these stockpiled products like hair dyes, shampoos and stuff. Chemical companies suffer. And so on.\n\n6. Mid-sized companies that were thriving now are facing insolvency in 3-4 months. It's a damage you cannot undo. The big companies will survive, but all these orders for materials/machines/services from small companies will be gone next year, and the year after.\n\n7. All those cancelled surgeries, medical procedures, because hospitals need space for Covid victims. At least in Europe that's happening.\n\n8. In 2007-2008 crisis some of my family and friends were worried about potential unemployment. In the end, 2 lost their jobs, and a few had to agree to salary cuts. This year 2 friends lost their jobs, and like ~30 people have serious threat of unemployment.\n\nAll these small things add up to financial shitstorm in my book...
