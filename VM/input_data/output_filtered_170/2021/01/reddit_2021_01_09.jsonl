However, I think it's time we take this question seriously so I will take the first shot. As you all know Tesla closes at 880 today and is the fifth most valuable company. \n\nAs I said before I'm extremely bullish but this really scares me. To say it is a bubble is the least. The company's future is so priced in that this valuation is even barely justifiable if Tesla right now makes every car on the earth. And PE ratio almost reaches 1700, for reference AMZN sits at 90 and GOOG around 35. I'm not saying TSLA should be a boomer stock, but having some down days and corrections are necessary for a healthy long-term investment.\n\nAlthough I don't intend to sell my shares in the near future, I'm afraid this will be another dot com bubble and everybody will take a bloody hit.

Tech companies scale and add billions by allocating few additional bytes for users. But Tesla has to really physically build, support these cars to stay in business. There is going to recalls, lawsuits, scaling issues, warranty problems etc in future and they have to spend a lot. Tesla is a car company and not a tech company.

Tesla will be the one offering cheapest solar solutions because they make good products as efficiently as possible and pass as much savings to customers as they can while still making enough to grow.

He was stubborn and confident that since we use eyes so computers can you use just cameras. \n\nI have Tesla model 3 and it does a bad job in parking. Auto pilot works great but atleast 5-10 times between LA to SF it does phantom breaking and scares the shit out of me. The model 3 h/w (original not the new one), is laggy, youtube display stutters. I can list a ton like these. The H/W is old for Model 3 and the new H/W will again be old in 2-3 years. People keep their cars for atleast 10 years.

Because the tech will change so much, all the cars has to retrofitted ( or may be obsolete). What if there is a viable solid state battery that comes out in the market. Quantum Scape is confident in launching one.

This also means you have data collection in regions spread so widely that chasing the last 9’s will be dramatically more achievable than something like Waymo’s current model. \n\nLidar wasn’t just brushed off as a cost cutting measure; lidar’s strength is providing highly accurate distance measurements. Humans don’t need to know how many inches / centimeters / etc any object is away, only what is and isn’t enough distance to complete some action. Additionally, Lidar doesn’t work optimally in rain / snow / heavy fog so if you depend on it, your implementation will not support those driving scenarios. \n\nPeople love to say cameras (and radars which Tesla also has in their cars) alone are not enough to go level-5 automation— based on what?

Getting something working from 99% to 99.9% takes 10 times the effort. That is the reason I don't believe in Tesla. Because they have handcuffed themselves and convinced Cameras and Radars will work. I agree Lidars have challenges in adverse weather. I am ok in my car driving like a grandma during adverse weather, but I prefer it to drive better than me, when the weather is great. To make such thing, if we need to add any kind of sensors, we should add it. That's is my point.\n\n\nTesla, Waymo and others are trying for Level-5 automation using different approaches. Waymo works great but it is geo-fenced. But atleast it works. Scaling is hard and expensive, but it is doable. If Waymo can scale their solution by expanding their geo-fence, to me that works great and they will take the market.\n\nTesla approach shines for any route, even if it has never seen. It is awesome. Generic solution to any problem, which is an awesome driver assist. But to make it a level-5 and reach 99.99 and beyond would be hard.\n\nWaymo seems to be working 100% but area restricted. Now you tell me which approach will work? Waymo is willing to add any more sensors or anything to make this work. They are still in development stage, once they figure out it works 100% and it can be scaled, then they will go to production ready vehicles (built on purpose with autopilot in mind). \n\nBut in Tesla's case, they have production cars that has cameras and radar. Any major change to these sensors or adding new ones, would trigger a huge recall. Will Tesla will do this? I doubt it.

In Tesla’s case, the customer is paying to be part of the data collection fleet. In Waymo / Uber situation, the business has to pay for the fleet creation and spread. \n\nBoth companies are in the early stages of achieving autonomy, or something close to it, and it’s possible both can be successful. Waymo is interesting because it might drive the best for its location, but if it takes many years and billions of dollars to scale, it may end up in the dust of another approach. How long could it be before Waymo exists in Seattle where it rains frequently? Phoenix rarely has rain, snow, or dense fog so we can’t say for sure how much work they might need to support it. Other regions, countries, and seasons make up a way more huge market for innovation than just clear sunny areas. \n\n>\tMy car doesn’t park sensibly; Summon is a joke\n\nI understand, I also have a Tesla and I think it has a while to go before I’d trust it for all my driving.

Waymo does work great for  good clear region, but may not work in rain, snow etc. Tesla works for generic scenario, but doesn't seem perfect so far.\n\nBut Waymo can have tweak solutions ( sensors etc) for different market. Just like we use winter tires for specific regions. They can even build another 2 feet of protruding roof for any of these sensors and who cares of looks because it is a RoboTaxi. But Tesla can't add all these gadgets and make the car look weird. It is restricted by form factor of how the car looks and also since the cars are in production, so they want to work with what they have.\n\nThis is my sole argument. One company can add anything to mix to make it work (as it is still evolving), but another company can't any new major external H/W and has to make it work with just software.\n\nAgain as I mentioned earlier, going from 90 -> 99 is 10 times harder and so is 99 -> 99.9.

First you are correct about Tesla at $800B. This model stops on 11Dec2020 when Tesla was “only” $670B. They have around $15B in debt which means the company size (enterprise value or EV) is around $685B ($815B now). \nToyota has a market cap around $250B and debt around $330B for an EV of $580B. \n\nEV is a much more appropriate way to show the size of a company rather than only showing market cap. This is because EV tells you the full amount of capital the company uses to generate products and revenue. \n\nIf we assume similar margins (I believe this is a reasonable assumption for our purposes) then Tesla needs to sell about 15% more cars than Toyota on 11Dec2020 to justify its size. Now at $815B that number has become more sizable at 40%. It seems likely that shareholders are speculating other products such as energy and software will become additional revenue streams justifying the company size. If we assume double the margin as you suggest then the case becomes strong that Tesla is undervalued only accounting for auto sales if they were to sell as many cars as Toyota. \n\nHit me up if you want to talk more as I’m a nerd for this stuff and love discussing.\n\nEdit: assets to capital in 2nd paragraph.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just google what enterprise value means.

But if you disagree with it, it's also easy to point out where and suggest different figures, which is useful too.\n\nJust for reference:\n\n•\t⁠Doing the weighted average it gives a price target in 2024 of $1,583\n•\t⁠If we discount that back four years, at a generous 8% return, it gives a price target today of $1,160\n\nBut it's also clear that autonomy is driving a big chunk of that potential value. Let's say you're about half as optimistic about the future value of autonomous driving (it's valued at about $2,800 per share here, so $1,400) then today's price target would be $850.\n\nIf you think autonomy isn't as valuable and you think it'll take twice as long to hit (push everything to 2028), then that gives a price target today of $630.\n\nSo it seems like most people who are buying TSLA now probably view the long term prospects as including around a 30% chance of autonomy by 2024 to 2028, with valuations of autonomy being somewhat lower than what ARK is predicting.”", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla not only fared very well with the pandemic but the now with S&P inclusion and Biden Administration going all Green-Hurrah!
