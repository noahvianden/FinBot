{"title": "WISH - personal DD - Fair price share target $20 - $40/share.", "selftext": "# How it started\n\n# On 6/9 I was alerted to WISH, before this I had never heard of this company \n\n* After skimming the latest 10-Q and 10-K I found no obvious red flags. \n   * The company is generating decent Revenue $2.5B from latest 10-K, and plowing it all into marketing and product development as per latest 10-Q. \n      * Music to a growth investor‚Äôs ears\n* Considered that WISH IPO on December 16th 2020 and started to trade from $20 to an all time high of $32.85 February 1st 2021 \n* Pulled the trigger on a small amount on 6/9\n   * Stock dipped purchased some more \n      * Stock dipped purchased some more \n      * Repeated until full retard attrition mode reached\n      * Averaged priced $11.20 on 6/9 with ballz deep # of shares\n\nThat night started to dig deeper into the company ...\n\n# Wish App \n\nBest analogy I could come up for the Wish iPhone mobile app is a cross between Amazon app with regards to experience and price levels and delivery times that of Alibaba.\n\nPersonally, I use Amazon Prime for all online shopping. Unless it‚Äôs a hard-to-get item, then I got to E-Bay maybe Etsy or purchase directly from the vendor‚Äôs site. If I need volume, I will use Alibaba (but it‚Äôs a f#$%ing hassle to deal with import tax and delivery on heavy items). I have yet to try Ali Express. \n\nBecause I have never heard of Wish until now, I immediately installed the app and by the end of the night sent an invite code to 3 people and purchased roughly $184 of stuff I wanted to get. \n\nThe app has a nice flow and it upsells using promo codes and add-hoc discounts. Very addictive experience, perfect for a retarded consumer such as myself. That night I ended up with: \n\n* Green Point Laser that could start a fire $12.00 ship cost $4\n* 100 pc drill bit set $8.64 ship cost $11.50\n* 3 pc ex drill set $5.26 ship cost $11.50 \n* 46 pc repair tools/socket wrench $18.23 ship cost $1.00\n* 50 pc titanium drill bit set $9.00 ship cost $3.00\n* Blue tooth mini ear buds $1.89 ship cost $1.00\n* 7 Inch Tablet with Quad core $0.50 (new) ship cost $3.65 (how the F#$%\\^ is that so low, must see it to believe it)\n* Car Cellphone Charger $18.21 ship cost $3.65\n* Tactical flash light $8.55 ship cost $11.50\n* 20x50 HiDef Wide Angle Binoculars $39.00 ship cost $11.50 ( $1400 MSRP  ... have to see it to believe it)\n* Automotive Error code reader $0.50 (ffs @ 0.50 cents I just bought it to see what its like) ship cost $0.75\n* Polarized sun glasses (gift at join) ship cost: $1.00\n\nSo now I wait for it all to arrive. Some of the things are shipped from USA and labeled as such and many other things will take more time as they come from Gina et all (similar to E-Bay and Alibaba) \n\nI was blown away at how cheap and easy it was to place the order. Shipping didn‚Äôt make sense for some of the things, but the price offset that. \n\nThe feeling I had was similar to when I walked into a Walmart store for the first time. The only thing nagging me is that most of the things I bought from Walmart either broke or I threw away so I have a full expectation of the same for the above-mentioned products, but this is not the point and I digress.\n\n**If the above items arrive as described, Wish is my new go to online shopping.**  \n \n\n# Financial Consideration\n\nAmazon and Alibaba are obvious competitors. Because Wish is relatively new it‚Äôs not turning a profit. However, the steady Revenue and user base growth over-compensates this in my opinion.\n\nBased on [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/) I am expecting **2021 Revenue to be around $3.65B** based on historic values\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmmqaxh50h471.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a51d82a88df08e2c5df5209616e543f4a785ab\n\nWISH user base has a very solid growth \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uwnaip10h471.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a20cb2fd7ddc01223a9df0ce29d85a701fbd8cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Based on finance.yahoo.com stats as of 6/10/2021:\n\n* **AMAZON Profitability**\n   * Profit Margin 6.42% \n   * Price to Sales 4.01  \n* **BABA Profitability**\n   * Profit Margin 20.99% \n   * Price to Sales 5.24  \n* WISH **Profitability**\n   * **Profit Margin -28.09%**\n   * **Price to Sales 2.5** \n\nI personally value stock on how much Revenue it could generate.\n\nSo, given my estimated revenue for 2021 of $3.65B and WISH‚Äôs price of $10.79 as of 6/10/2021 it is roughly 2X-3X undervalued against the competitors. Making Fair Value of the stock, in my opinion, $20 - $40 with market cap at around $30B +/- $10B which aligns with original valuation the founders wanted, and only half of what it IPO at. \n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-ipo-shopping-app-public-filing-covid-2020-11#:\\~:text=Wish%20is%20looking%20for%20a,matter%2C%20per%20the%20Financial%20Times.&text=In%20the%20first%20nine%20months,the%20same%20period%20in%202019](https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-ipo-shopping-app-public-filing-covid-2020-11#:~:text=Wish%20is%20looking%20for%20a,matter%2C%20per%20the%20Financial%20Times.&text=In%20the%20first%20nine%20months,the%20same%20period%20in%202019).\n\n# All of this does not take into account accumulating high Short Interest!\n\n# In Conclusion: Riding WISH to its Fair market price of $20-$40, then will see. \n\n***I am not a financial analyst nor advisor; I like to eat green crayons.***\n\nGood Luck to all!\n\nLatest 10-Q: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021027024/wish-10q\\_20210331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021027024/wish-10q_20210331.htm)\n\nLatest 10-K: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021015544/wish-10k\\_20201231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021015544/wish-10k_20201231.htm)", "id": "nwt1ro", "created_utc": 1623345478.0, "score": 528, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Keep us informed how that $1 tablet worked out", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "It was fiddy cents  plus $3.65 for shipping, and okay, I will reply to this comment when it comes.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "!remindme 2 weeks", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "!remindme 3 months", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "This guy has bought stuff from Wish before üòÉ", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I also got my debit card hacked so I never wished againüôè", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I will be messaging you in 14 days on [**2021-06-24 18:10:51 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-06-24%2018:10:51%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwt1ro/wish_personal_dd_fair_price_share_target_20/h1b48t3/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fnwt1ro%2Fwish_personal_dd_fair_price_share_target_20%2Fh1b48t3%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-06-24%2018%3A10%3A51%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20nwt1ro)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "wil work out good as the stock play i suppose.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Ehhh I made some decent coin in at 9 out at 14 next morning", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It could be tablet cover :D just saying ha ha once i ordered a keyboard and they sent me slime/ keyboard cleaner.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stone tablet inbound", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not sure if I screwed something up but the tablet and the car error code reader were both cancelled and refunded to me with this:‚Äù We‚Äôre so sorry!

Price will absolutely fly once this happen and potentially before if people get in. We only need to buy and hold for nearly a week for this to happen. Look up any previous DD post on CLNE where they explain the reason it is being shorted (revenue growth is expected in the medium to long term so it looks like easy money for hedge funds).¬†[Here is a link with short interest over the past year for anyone lazy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clne/short-interest).\n\nCLNE also has several partnerships in the works including a large deal to provide RNG (carbon renewable natural gas) to Amazon for their delivery trucks, and in general green energy is growing priority for the USA and the world in general. As someone who is probably most risk averse than most people here, this makes me feel better as I can always hold in case of a sudden dip for longer term gains.\n\nI also did some more research after reading some of the more surface level posts on CLNE and found that they built their stations near existing Amazon warehouses, which gives them an advantage when negotiating future deals as transportation of materials is factored into negotiations (from what I know, I work as a software engineer for a steel manufacturing business).\n\nCLNE has also not even reached it‚Äôs all time high of $16 yet, whereas most of the other meme'd stocks have well surpassed their's and are in the pump-and-dump territory that leads to a lot of paper handing.
