{"title": "Is WallStreetBets Biased in its BBBY Stickies? [Data]", "selftext": "#TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you think.\n\n**Over the past two weeks, WSB tends to sticky more bullish posts than bearish posts. Both in general, and for BBBY.**\n\n---\n\nAs a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. \n\nAs of late, the main complaint seems to be that I \"only\" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. \n\nSo let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!\n\n#FAQ:\n\nQ: Why since August 5th? \n\nA: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. \n\nQ: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)\n\n---\n\n#Methodology:\n\nI took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.\n\nI don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.\n\n---\n\n#Results!\n\nOverall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.\n\n**BBBY Specific - Summarized**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull|7|\n|Neutral|2|\n|Bear|5|\n|Other|56|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n**BBBY Specific - Detail**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull Serious|6|\n|Bull Shitpost|1|\n|Neutral Shitpost|2|\n|Bear Serious|3|\n|Bear Shitpost|2|\n|Daily Thread|32|\n|Unrelated|24|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n\nWhat about those nebulous \"Daily Thread\" and \"Unrelated / Other\" categories?\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull BBBY|5|\n|Bear BBBY|1|\n|Daily|22|\n|Earnings|1|\n|Trash|1|\n|Weekend|2|\n|***Total***|***32***|\n\n**Unrelated**\n\n|**Topic**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bear AMC|1|\n|Bear GME|1|\n|Bear TSLA|1|\n|*Bear Total*|*3*|\n|Bull AMC|2|\n|Bull GME|1|\n|Bull OXY|1|\n|Bull SPY|5|\n|Bull SQ|1|\n|Bull TSLA|1|\n|*Bull Total*|*11*|\n|Education|1|\n|Legendary Post|2|\n|Meme|1|\n|Neutral Wind|1|\n|News|1|\n|Shitpost|2|\n|Tattoo|2|\n|***Total***|***24***|\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis was fun to put together and only took about an hour. \n\nI was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. \n\nI'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.\n\nThere are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. \n\nThis is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)\n\nAnother limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.\n\n---\n\n||Category|BBBY Daily?|Topic|Is Dupe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[\"Buying more BBBY puts Monday lfg\" by thisismyname2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuab08/buying_more_bbby_puts_monday_lfg/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"I don‚Äôt want bbby to go bankrupt so I just pulled ...\" by MrSingh_Entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wub13h/i_dont_want_bbby_to_go_bankrupt_so_i_just_pulled/)|Bear Shitpost| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, August 22, 2022\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu8ppj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_august_22_2022/)|Daily Thread|Daily||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares....\" by DatSlattSlimeBooBong](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtju81/ryan_cohen_was_an_insider_when_selling_his_shares/)|Bull Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial...\" by obiwanjustblowme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtnust/why_the_baby_acquisition_premise_is/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Aswath Damodaran - Session 1: Intro to Valuation\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wte3eu/aswath_damodaran_session_1_intro_to_valuation/)|Unrelated| |Education|Not Dupe|\n|[\"Lambo Wen?\" by doublejeopardyalex](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt7agl/lambo_wen/)|Unrelated| |Bear TSLA|Not Dupe|\n|[\"675% gains on 2 BBBY options.
