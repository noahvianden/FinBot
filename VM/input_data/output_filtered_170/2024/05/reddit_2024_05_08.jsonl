Use at your own discretion\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\---\n\n**\\*\\*Skip To End Game if You're Only Trying to Play Earnings\\*\\***\n\n\\--\n\n# May 9-10th: the boring drop\n\nDue to ARM's shite guidance, NVDA as well as the rest of the semi-conductors are going to have a cool day tomorrow barring a sizeable increase in jobless claims (more jobless claims = economy doing crap, thus the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates, which Wall Street glazes themselves over). The reason? BS articles like this are being spread by the news that misattributes ARM's increase in pricing to the AI boom (of which it has no relation):\n\n[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842)\n\nNormies eat this shit up and if SPY ain't peaking in the morning we're going to see a decrease or flat market at best bleeding into Friday. \n\nCall/Put skew further shows that traders are consolidating at $900 into the pre-pre-earnings week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wfjhk9dbazc1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4fa3ea1fa1878a5ee298e5b16d03b5a6a80a9d1\n\n[https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/)\n\nThe gist of this is that if we have really good news, NVDA could hit $920 but with poor market news could hit a bottom of $875 by this Friday.\n\nWith VIX (a measure of market volatility, which measures fear) being below 16 and hovering around 13, Market Makers are likely to feed into trends and buy dips so this is bullish in the market overall.\n\n# May 13-17th: the slight recovery then deep decline\n\nHeading into next week we are likely to see a recovery in price from the dip this week followed by a decline preceding earnings the following week. Why? Hedging. Wall Street as well as some retail investors are aware that the previous guidances issues were made under completely different macroeconomic expectations. \n\nPreviously we were under the assumption that 3 rate cuts were coming whilst now only 1 possibly? The result is a drop in price akin to the previous earnings cycle but worse, given the poor earnings we've seen from fellow semiconductor manufacturers. \n\nThe previous earnings cycle was actually positive across the board and what did we see?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3j7wvaqdazc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f638b22d3b0eb198b7d9237993892b15121bd0\n\nRoughly a $75 decline in share price during the week preceding earnings. And this was off of good news in the market. We could see the price hit sub-800 if everyone cashes out all at once in this week, if previous market behavior is anything to go off of.\n\nDepending on CPI on Wednesday and Jobless Claims on Thursday this could be mediated but we shall see. The likely range is 845-895 based on previous volatility around earnings.\n\n# May 20-22nd: Earnings END-GAME\n\nNvidia will most likely continue it's drop from the previous week but this isn't a problem for us. Why? Because we know NVDA is the shit. I mean it truly is in another league of it's own. It quite literally is the industry standard that only those on the know are aware of. Their platform is what pretty much everyone who trains AI is using and will continue to use due to how optimized it is.\n\nWe're talking about the comparison of an iPhone in 2008 to a flimsy flip phone. It's just so much more advanced that they are crushing the competition. This is why regardless of AMD, INTC, SMCI, all of their failures, NVDA will absolutely crush EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. \n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171)\n\nThey are the backbone of all AI training models right now and as it stands, no one is even close to touching them. Thus they will destroy expectations and rebound to even higher highs than Wall Street has expectations for due to their monopoly-like control of the industry. Barring a world war or FTC intervention, there is no way this stock can go down.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1cniy8t", "created_utc": 1715211444.0, "score": 622, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 365 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18t0m69/nio_dd_bullish/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nuia3/roblox_dd_bullish_regrettably/) \n**Account Age** | 9 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/i61wump4kazc1.jpeg?width=274&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=924607db506406f03840263ca1f9e45ebc93633e\n\nYou see baby my calls will go up, dont worry we didnt need that car anyways", "score": 392, "replies": [{"body": "You'll never afford a car with funds like that.", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stfu 🤡", "score": -6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’m dying , I’m legit dying 😭😭😭😂😂😂", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Someone come help this man before he dies 😢", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "She’s underaged", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Buying calls", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "He calls her baby for a reason", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TLDR: it might go up, but it might also go down", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "Puts on sideways", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Probably sell those puts", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You think OP is secretly talking about investments in the former Austrian currency **“Schilling”** ?  \n![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The longer the texts, the more confident that convinces me to do the opposite", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "Another bro did a lengthy one on ARM saying it will drop post earnings.
