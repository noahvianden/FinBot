They will still make around 3 billion of cash flow from operations, and have about 500m FCF. There are about 1.5b of bond payments, \\~1000m has been paid, \\~500 due late this year. That leaves about 1b of cash reduction. There are no bond payments in 2020. Tesla has around 10b of debt. After this year that will be reduced to around 9b. \n\nThe question is what do we expect for 2020? Assuming they hit around 30b of revenue this year, next year should be 40b conservatively, maybe 45b. This would imply around 4b of cash flow from operations. This would imply 1b of FCF in 2020. They have 1.5b due in 2021, 1b due in 2022 and 1.8b due in 2025. In effect Tesla needs to generate \\~1B of FCF per year for the next 6 years to cover their debt repayments. If they budget 3b of capex, that means they need 4b op cash flow. They already generate \\~700m per quarter solely from depreciation and stock-based comp addbacks. So they only need \\~300m more per quarter of cash flow from operations ontop of those two adjustments to reach 1b per quarter rate and 4b per year rate. They don't need to be profitable to pay their debts back over the next 6 years. They just need to break even. \n\nIs it likely that in 2022 Tesla will only be making 4b OCF and 1b FCF? I'm expecting their revenue to be around \\~100b in 2022. Applying even a 10% ratio we get 10b OCF and \\~7b FCF (assuming fixed 3b capex, this will likely increase). Once Tesla grows to above 60b in revenue the debt load becomes dramatically less. \n\nIf I'm sitting in Elon's position and I'm pretty confident we can run the company for 5 years at break even and keep the revenue growing nicely, I wouldn't raise either. Tesla could run the company at 30b revenue break-even profit per year for 5 years and still they could service their debts. Also, after this year's debt payments their leverage has already been reduced by \\~10% in one year. \n\nI'll give you another example/trend. 2017 Tesla had 12b of revenue and 2b of losses, 2018 Tesla had 22b of revenue and 1b of losses. In 2017 Tesla's FCF was -3.5B, in 2018 Tesla's FCF was \\~-300m. 2019 should be 28b revenue, $0 of losses, and $1b of FCF. It seems to me that Tesla is only being viewed as 'struggling to make cash' because they only have 'two good quarters' in history.

FSD and AP rev has reduced but the split between earned revenue and deferred revenue has probably increased. This will increase profit/ but decrease any extra cash flow benefits. Deposits I’d say there are similar levels of customers compared to Q3/4 who are buying already having a deposit. Warranty expenditures are also most likely to be less now than in Q3/4. This is one area I expect Tesla to be able to generate significant savings over the long term. One other area Tesla should target is lowering the cost of repair by giving greater access to their parts catalogue. \n\nAll in all I estimate that maybe these cars have 1-2k less cash flow per car. That would equal 125m per quarter of cash flow in the 2k per car scenario. Q3 had cash flow from operations of 1.4b. We already are .4b above our needed run rate for FY19.
