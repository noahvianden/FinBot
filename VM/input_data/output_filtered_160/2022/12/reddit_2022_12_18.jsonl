{"title": "Where did inflation come from and where it goes", "selftext": "This is largely from [this](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf) 90 page paper (and I did a bit of research to validate the points in the paper). The conclusion is quite enlightening to me.\n\n**Where does inflation come from** (from the paper):\n\n1. inflation comes from a mix of supply chain shortage, commodity price surge, corporate profit markups, and shift in sectorial demand (yeah, i know, old news)\n2. inflation does not come from the excessive stimulus during the pandemic nor the labor shortage we are experiencing\n\ni'll start with the more contentious point 2. One popular theory for the cause of this wave of inflation is the >5 trillion dollar US government spent all together (CARES + CAA + ARP etc.). The money went to government spending related to COVID measures like vaccine, and also individuals and business as stimulus checks. To put things into perspective, that is more than 5/23 = 22% of US 2021 GDP. When you create this much excess money and pump it into the economy, it is not surprising inflation will ensue.\n\nAccording to the paper, this is wrong. Aggregate demand (lump sum of personal consumption, government spending, investment and exports, these all create demand in the economy) is actually below pre-pandemic trend. Note the number is inflation adjusted, but if inflation is a result of too much demand, we should see demand rises before the inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3s6bvur3hm6a1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed5c48b69aa10bebdb6ed162fd43d67d437580e3\n\nThen where did the 5 trillion go? It turns out **the excessive stimulus merely compensated for the demand collapse from COVID, but it did not overcompensate**. Compare this to 2008, without the stimulus checks, the personal consumption never caught up to the original trend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6w4ykvdtim6a1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca3da6ec748df9a242739da0107e7c2dc13d4a2\n\nIt is not hard to understand why, a lot of ppl lost their source of income during the pandemic, so the stimulus check is offset by their loss of income. In addition, say you are not allowed to go to restaurants  for a month. The next month, after COVID restriction is lifted, it's not like you will go to restaurants everyday, every meal. You don't spend all money you saved last month immediately.\n\nIndeed, American household saving increased drastically during pandemic, however data shows these savings are largely held by wealthy households (it comes more from not able to spend money during lockdowns rather than stimulus checks). These people put higher % of their money into investment than consumption.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jccxizyzlm6a1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=25054e21eb3a594a758315c08ea9e59b40ef2378\n\nThe second potential fuel for inflation is labor shortage and the resulting wage-price spiral (higher price causes worker to demand higher wages and in turn makes production more expensive). This has been talked about a lot lately. However, real wage (adjusted for inflation) actually decreased. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vo2953rmm6a1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=a643e405c505730a676f50f19e3b04ce0b6ba85c\n\nA stronger evidence is that inflation started growing in early 2021, when unemployment rate was 6%-7%. The labor shortage was much more severe pre-pandemic, when unemployment rate was 3.5%, but we did not have much inflation then. \n\nNow coming back to point 1, inflation comes from four things: supply chain shortage, commodity price surge, corporate profit markups, and shift in sectorial demand. Supply chain shortage is basically (relatively) short-term disruption from lockdowns. The price for containers, freight etc. spiked several times in 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lnyeis4pm6a1.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b0fe73f1d4e1e5e3b0ed9d130f26c96a36a8323\n\nGas and food (commodity) contributed 2.9% out of 7.7% inflation rate, you must still remember the gas price in June. Ukraine war did not help. But this part is beyond the control of fed and congress.\n\nCorporate profit markups is basically companies raising prices higher than cost because they now can blame it on inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3j1c81jqm6a1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=5473edbefad0f6391b8e73f1e4b3df3dd6724e52\n\nLastly sectorial shift in demand means people shift their spending from one thing to another due to COVID, **without increasing the aggregate demand**. Housing is the prominent example here, after COVID, people abandoned cities in favor of suburbs. If this happens slowly in normal speed, suburb rent will grow and city rent will come down and there is no change in aggregate demand. But because of COVID this happened so fast and some human psychological effect made the market responds slower to price drops than price hikes (e.g. landlord and tenants do not realize the 3k/month apartment in the city may only have a 1k market price now). This explains the inflation in rent that accounts for \\~30% overall inflation. [Signals](https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/) showed that this part of inflation is coming down as sectorial demand shift back.\n\n**Where is inflation heading** (my guess)\n\nThis paper really paint an interesting picture of what happened: so Fed wasn't wrong when they thought inflation would be \"transitory\" back in January. The supply chain problem has been alleviated for the large part (only 11 months later!) and excessive spending / wage-price spiral are just not here. However the expectation for high inflation was already embedded in people's mind, and greedy corporate CEOs decided it was a good time to rake some extra money for a rainy day. That compelled the fed to take decisive actions, which made the raining day come true.\n\nAt this point in time, it seems all the catalyst for inflation are gone. Commodity price has come down, supply chain is going back to normal, rent is coming down but it is not reflected in CPI timely, corporate profit will evaporate in the looming recession. After the last 50 base point hike, US bond yield didn't move much. The bond market doesn't believe in the fed's terminal rate. I personally think we will cut rate some time in 2023.", "id": "zow3bx", "created_utc": 1671361147.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: the Fed and the congress are doing a great job, but inflation is not their fault, nor is the stimulus.
