{"title": "VIX Gang, Stand Back and Stand...BUY!", "selftext": "TLDR; YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBears, if you would like a nice little rub and tug, look no further. This post will explain why buying shares of leveraged volatility products cannot and will not go tits up.\n\nI am down 37 bands since I last posted[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj63p9/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvxy_svxy/) 8 months ago. I haven't given up my thesis or my dollar cost averaging and I won’t until capitulation occurs, be it next year or next week. As I see it, the longer this equities bubble persists, the more time I have to build up my already quite large position. In this post I would like to discuss my perspective on: **Why the VIX is asleep, Hypothetical price targets for UVXY, and How my strategy has changed.**\n\nDisclaimer: The 2x volatility index that I trade is below the $500mm market cap (or AUM in this case) allowed by WSB, so I will be focusing on UVXY for this post. Check my positions at the end of this post to see exactly what I am doing.\n\nAnother Disclaimer: I’m quite regarded. While my DD should be solid from a factual standpoint, only imitate my positions if you don’t mind the possibility of having a few extra inches added to the circumference of your anus.\n\nWithout Further ado.\n\n**Why the VIX is Asleep**\n\nAs many of you may know, the VIX index is calculated using a very complex equation, but essentially is tracking the spread of options premiums on the SPX. In uncertain times or market downturns, as traders scramble for downside protection, these spreads can get sporadic and the VIX will spike.\n\nSo what gives? Why hasn’t there been a meaningful increase in the VIX index since the market has fallen \\~20% last year? I mean, the VIX spiked over 150% with the Fed rate hikes in 2018 while the market dropped \\~18% from September to December. Well the answer has to do with a worrying trend that has started getting out of hand in the past three quarters: institutional investors and hedge funds trading 0DTE options on the SPX. These types of trades create ample liquidity in the options market, rocketing the indices to new highs (remember when QQQ closed +7.35% on 11-10-22 ?) and suppressing the VIX index. This can lead to a vicious cycle with lower lows in the VIX begetting higher highs in the SPX, encouraging further 0DTE  gambling. But every cycle must come to an end…\n\n[0DTE SPX volume at an all time high, while the VIX and VVIX make sharpest declines since Volmageddon](https://preview.redd.it/eassycii7sla1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3f57df1c42927d19e44168e9a502016170e9a9)\n\nThese types of trades generate large profits for the institutions who are able to sell far OTM options without posting collateral. However, as we all know, trading 0DTE comes with its risks. When the narrative regarding the economy changes (consumer debt is at all time highs, while household savings is nearing all time lows btw), or a large player in the 0DTE market leaves for whatever reason (drying up liquidity) hell will break loose. When the price stability in the options market goes haywire, VIX will spike. On top of this, scrambling for 0TE puts to hedge will drill the SPX as MMs need to sell SPX short to gamma hedge.\n\nTo conclude this section, trading 0DTE works very well… until it doesn’t. Now onto the fun part: price targets.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nFirst things first, this volatility spike will not be like Dec 2018. How can I be so sure? Well, because if it was, we would have seen it happen already. In early October 2018, the market reacted swiftly to Fed policy, with the VIX following closely behind.\n\n[VIX reacts to market declines immediately in 2018](https://preview.redd.it/o0xiim3u7sla1.png?width=3785&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7fb142b058b3da191ea3ee1c3754d12acb33cd)\n\nCompare this to what we see now. A sell off, comparable in percent decline, without the fireworks on the VIX:\n\n[VIX stays calm despite 20&#37; drawdown](https://preview.redd.it/qlli2yfy7sla1.png?width=3767&format=png&auto=webp&s=5873c41a1c61979f1c7f7c975cf88e9aa2d18e4a)\n\nOkay, so VIX is dead, so what? Well I’d like to convince you that this is a premonition of something far more violent than the VIX spike in late 2018. I believe that this first 20% leg down was orderly selling by institutions, all of which are preparing for a monstrous capitulation in the coming year. I’d like to remind you that despite the fact that we are off of the all time highs of Jan 2022, we are still in a massive equities bubble that is only exacerbated by earnings contraction and the weakening consumer. Given that we are at the end of a 12 year secular bull run, I think it’s appropriate that we look at the behavior of the VIX in prior recessions.\n\n**2001**\n\nMarch 2000 to June 2001-- SPY: -22.7%, VIX: +40%\n\nJune 2001 to September 2002-- SPY: -38.1%, VIX: +113%\n\n[VIX trades sideways until second leg sell-off](https://preview.redd.it/ybyjqrm28sla1.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&s=217e09c8e4f44c5ede93348e8a5d10690f42796e)\n\n**2008**\n\nOctober 2007 to August 2008-- SPY: -16.7%, VIX: +3.3%\n\nAugust 2008 to October 2008-- SPY: -24.8%, VIX: +419%\n\n[VIX snoozes until MASSIVE spike during OCT '08 capitulation](https://preview.redd.it/nk2rnqq68sla1.png?width=3790&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2e14783f9bb9ec6fd2eaa487a35c6e68bd4ffa6)\n\nIt is apparent that when a big recession is brewing, the VIX will remain relatively tame during the first leg down, before exploding during the final capitulation. So what are my price targets for the coming capitulation?\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nI am going to use the historical prices of UVXY during the COVID crash to extrapolate what we may be able to expect from a leveraged volatility ETF during a full blown panic. I am aware that the COVID crash was a rather unique scenario, with the first pandemic in a century adding extra fear and volatility to the sell off on the way down. I am not here to argue about the exact price that VIX will reach, but given the recent 0DTE gambling, declining housing market, impending wars, persistent inflation, etc. I think it is reasonably realistic to use COVID crash as a model example (especially considering how much larger the bubble has gotten since 2020).\n\nUVXY hit an intraday low of 105.5 on February 19, 2020. After a wild month of trading, UVXY topped out at 1350 on March 18, 2020. This astounding 1180% price increase is a testament to how extreme leveraged volatility ETFs can behave in uncertain times. But wait, UVXY is only a 1.5x leveraged VIX futures product. What if we wanted more leverage? Hypothetically, the 2x leveraged ETF that I own (that I shall not name) would return a staggering 1606%. This is like going from 16.18 (it’s closing price on Friday 3/3) to 276.06. Remember, this is just based on the COVID crash. Whether or not this next spike will come up short or surpass this return, no one can know. What I do know, is that your returns will likely be so significant that you cannot lose money buying shares of these products.\n\n**WHY YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY**\n\n[A painful chart to look at](https://preview.redd.it/8ixiplob8sla1.png?width=2294&format=png&auto=webp&s=7067aa1e76977b6a89021327e48c803a9b7ecb2d)\n\nUVXY decays, we know. We also know that the return needed to break even on a losing trade becomes more and more daunting as your percent loss increases. For the sake of this DD or (perhaps more accurately) hardcore bear porn, please indulge with me. Imagine that on Monday a crash similar to COVID crash begins, it won’t, but just imagine. What does this mean? It means that over the next month, UVXY will go from 4.57 to 58.48, an 1180% return. Wow! If you bought on Friday at close, that's a great return! But let’s be real, that would never happen. We all know that timing the market is extraordinarily difficult. This is the number one reason I quit options. Suppose you still wanted to capture some of the return from that incredible spike in UVXY. Well, what if you dollar cost averaged? I can already hear the replies, “DCA in UVXY?!?!?! What a regard” and on and on. Well I think this strategy may have more merit than you give it credit for. Why? Two reasons: dollar cost averaging allows you to build up a massive position in UVXY (or another volatility product) while not having to time the crash. Sounds like a win-win.\n\nNow, consider the chart I posted above. Consider that in order to break even on this hypothetical UVXY spike you would have had to buy UVXY and then sustain a 92% loss.\n\n12.80x = 1\n\nx= 0.078\n\n1-x = 0.92 = 92%\n\nDo you understand what this means?? It means that to lose money on this trade you would have to own shares of UVXY at an average share price of 58.49 or greater. A price not seen since May 2021! Jeez even I’m not \\*that\\* early on the trade. What’s more, is that you would have had to buy at that price and not have accumulated any more shares. If you so much as bought any shares after that date, you would be in the green due to a lower cost basis.\n\nNow yes, this math works for the COVID crash scenario. Okay, well lets say UVXY only spikes a measly 800%. To break even you would need to buy at an 89% loss. That’s like buying UVXY at 41.13… again, in May 2021.\n\nReference the chart above for other scenarios, but I think you get the picture. Keep this in mind as you consider the percent drawdown in my positions (aka unrealized loss porn) below. Know that my cost basis decreases weekly.\n\n**TO CONCLUDE**\n\nThe 4 phase plan is the same as it’s been with a minor change. I will:\n\n1. DCA into a volatility product until capitulation\n2. Put earnings into SVXY or similar index and ride the volatility back down\n3. **Put money into QQQ** (instead of SPY) with as much margin as I can get\n4. Wait for the real estate market to bottom and buy a house\n\nAnd the most damning evidence that this trade will work:\n\n[can't go tits up](https://preview.redd.it/llm51tik8sla1.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c5640cc3ce2dd3b9a660c4a58ccf728ae73b0dc)\n\nMy LOSS PORN (so far):\n\n[at least they'll be long term capital gains lol](https://preview.redd.it/0r2ewu9n8sla1.png?width=2920&format=png&auto=webp&s=59fac0d9fbcdb2553f660d841f79121e4acae30e)\n\n\\*probably, we'll see", "id": "11icg21", "created_utc": 1677962117.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "Thnx for letting me know that my VIX calls r fucked.

Even at it's peak, the VIX premium to realized vol was -2.5 vol points, meaning the \"options market consensus\" was that vol would go down from there (spoiler: it did) The premium now is about 2.5 vol points (quite reasonable). \n\nI've seen a lot of this nonsense of the rise in 0dte's leading to some sort of volmageddon, and it's utter rubbish.
