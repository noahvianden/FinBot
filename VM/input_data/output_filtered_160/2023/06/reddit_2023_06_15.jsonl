It all started with my emotional attachment to a Nvidia trade, which led me to make impulsive decisions, such as trading massive spy puts.

My thought process was that all I need was a single red day to breakeven and there's no way the market is going to go up for an entire week straight. \n\nWell I got assigned those naked calls and closed them out this morning for a significant loss. Even when I account for the money I made from the put side of the strangle, I lost $8K. May not seem like a lot but that's two months worth of profit. Worst part is I hit my profit target on the trade a few weeks back but decided to keep holding to squeeze out a little more. Part of me is glad this happened now instead of later when I probably would have lost even more. And it laid bare how real that adage, \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\" is.

With rare insight based on his firsthand commodity trading experience, author Mark Douglas demonstrates how the mental matters that allow us function effectively in society are often psychological barriers in trading. After examining how we develop losing attitudes, this book prepares you for a thorough “mental housecleaning” of deeply rooted thought processes. And then it shows the reader how to develop and apply attitudes and behaviors that transcend psychological obstacles and lead to success.\n>\n>The Disciplined Trader helps you join the elite few who have learned how to control their trading behavior (the few traders who consistently take the greatest percentage of profits out of the market) by developing a systematic, step-by-step approach to winning week after week, month after month. The book is divided into three parts: • An overview of the psychological requirements of the trading environment • A definition of the problems and challenges of becoming a successful trader • Basic insights into what behavior may need to be changed, and how to build a framework for accomplishing this goal • How to develop specific trading skills based on a clear, objective perspective on market action “A groundbreaking work published in 1990 examining as to why most traders cannot raise their equity on a consistent basis, bringing the reader to practical conclusions to go about changing any limiting mindset.”—Larry Pesavento, TradingTutor.com\n\n\n**Trading in the Zone Master the Market with Confidence, Discipline, and a Winning Attitude** by Mark Douglas\n\n\n>Douglas uncovers the underlying reasons for lack of consistency and helps traders overcome the ingrained mental habits that cost them money.
