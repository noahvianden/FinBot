They would have to accept major losses consistently if they wanted to compete with ULA or other senior defense players at this time. Federal contracts and resupply missions are the obvious ticket to win in this industry as they are in the hundreds of millions and happen quite often. According to the current awarded Space Force contracts, a falcon heavy launch costs twice as much as a ULA (Boeing and Lockheed) launch at around $340M. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean that these rockets and their respective launch requirements are equivalent. That big number also includes upgrades to the payload fairing, launch sites and a new integration facility for reconnaissance specific missions. It‚Äôs also safe to assume that companies know that once Space X‚Äôs Falcon 9 program gets in the black, the price will be dramatically lower than anyone else‚Äôs if they don‚Äôt follow suit. So I‚Äôm sure we will see more reusable rockets from other companies being tested within the next 5 and in use within the next 10. Space X just has the obvious upper hand and they want to keep that because unlike Tesla, which has publicly published their patents and open sourced them. Space X keeps that information internal and proprietary, which basically means you have to be in the company to even have the opportunity to have the ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù. This is much safer than a patent because the typical consequence of leaking anything DoD contract related is 10 years in prison under the espionage act, not really sure what specific information you could leak out of space x that would qualify under that but it definitely reduces the risk any of spillage in the first place. \n\nTLDR: \n\nFalcon heavy contracts cost twice as much as the current competition. They have to break even on the $1B booster tech they spent before they can undercut the competition. They are playing the long game hoping to remain ahead reusable rocket technology indefinitely.\n\nI know this industry pretty well as I am an engineer in commercial space flight myself.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the answer!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm not sure why you are focusing on Falcon Heavy when it's clearly their niche high performance option that is rarely used.

Not sure how well you follow DoD or NASA contracts but the deal doesn‚Äôt always go to the lowest bidder. That‚Äôs another can of worms I don‚Äôt feel like getting into. But as of now, space X does not have a lower cost option for heavier payloads. Heavy rockets are going to be the norm once the ISS retires and there‚Äôs no more profit in supply missions or sending 100 cube sats into LOE.

The odds of satellite internet replacing all the current fiber optic infrastructure we have today is completely dependent on 3 things, matching (preferably beating) the speed, cost, reliability concurrently. So not very good. \n\nHere‚Äôs the thing, typical ISP‚Äôs that don‚Äôt use space satellites will always have a lot of options to compete with star link or any other equivalents when it comes to the majority of consumers. Aside from the fact that current mainstream ISP‚Äôs have a monopoly on tv and internet that lead to the absurd prices giving them a huge amount of overhead when it comes to revenue that if they need to lower their prices to compete they can easily do so, there are many ways to send fast internet through the air to rural areas that don‚Äôt involve satellites. \n\nThat being said, Satellite internet like star link really has only a hand full of small markets that are up for grabs.

Yes you are right, for many reasons they will definitely be used more frequently should their be profit. \n\nBut for space X specifically, they probably will not sell launches to competition if they are serious about star link as anyone that can afford a space X rocket can probably afford to put star link out of business.
