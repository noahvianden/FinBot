To me, the exit strategy also counts a little towards deciding on investing more in a company.\n\nSo here goes: get yourself an exit strategy for Tesla, and include in it what conditions you'd  need to meet in order to invest even more into Tesla. If you believe Tesla can hit $15k per share in the next 5 years, or any number of years for that matter, that's a gain of more than 18x. Do you feel like you'd go long enough to see that kind of return? Your exit strategy could help answer this.\n\nFor me, I'm already at the limit of my savings, hanging onto emergency and vacation funds and that's about it.
