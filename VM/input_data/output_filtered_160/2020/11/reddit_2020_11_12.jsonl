{"title": "$PLTR - The real bull run begins", "selftext": "There's 1000 idiot bears in this sub running around screaming \"fire!\" because Palantir (barely) beat the earnings expectations.\n\nGet a fucking grip.\n\nThe presentation was actually quite impressive:\n\n* YOY **revenue is up 50%!**\n* Their **private sector business is growing very fast at 35%,** which means they are proving they can diversify off of government reliance.\n* They have a great proven test case where their software is **saving an oil company $1B on an annualized basis**. All those energy companies talk to one another and word is going to spread fast. And despite what all you environmentalist cucks think, oil is still one of the most important industries in the world, and will continue to be for quite some time.\n* Their business is showing **90% of their revenue comes from pre-existing clients**, which means they have extremely high retention. Once they dig their claws in, companies integrate the software into their organizations and it becomes reoccurring income. That means all the new growth they are talking about is a long term gold mine.\n* And finally, they have presented several opportunities to **profit while helping fight COVID,** which means this stock is safe in the event that the pandemic worsens.\n\nUnlike most of the headless bears who are squealing like a bunch of chickens, I actually read the full earnings report and listened to the investor call.\n\nEvery single big shot analyst who had a chance to ask a question started off by first saying:\n\n>*\"Congratulations on your really solid first quarter\".*  \n>  \n>*- Fancy Pants Analysts*\n\nWhile the highly uneducated and emotional reddit bears are running scared, **the big money is impressed**.\n\nAnd consider this, because these guys did a direct listing instead of an IPO, big money hasn't had a chance to get a chunk of the pie yet. At this rate, I am sure they will very soon.\n\nOnce the big cheeses start adding positions, this stock is going to pop off.\n\nTomorrow might be red, but I don't care, because next year will be GREEN GREEN GREEN.\n\nBut guess what, at the time of this posting, the stock is actually green in the after hours trading, which is fucking hilarious.\n\nIf this stock trades green tomorrow after a lack luster EPS beat, that is actually incredibly bullish. That will mean this stock is rallying on fundamental confidence, not a bajillion robin hood retards pumping and dumping.\n\nAnd here is my final argument: do you really think a pentagon-funded, AI and data analytics company that was cofounded by Thiel - a business leader with ties to Facebook, SpaceX, PayPal and the Bilderberg Group - is going to do anything but make absolute fucking bank for the next decade? \n\nI am holding and holding and holding.\n\nI encourage you to join me.\n\n\\---\n\n*My positions: lots of shares at $9.05, $9.80. $10.73 and $11.70.*", "id": "jt5s5n", "created_utc": 1605223401.0, "score": 330, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Get in loser, we are catalyzing the loss of all data privacy but will become wildly rich in the process", "score": 97, "replies": [{"body": "you already lost your privacy to FAANG companies\n\nPLTR will look like the ACLU by comparison", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "FAANG are anti government big brother.
