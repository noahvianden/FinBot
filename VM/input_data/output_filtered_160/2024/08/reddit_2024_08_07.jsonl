{"title": "AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle': 'There's Tremendous Need For More Compute'", "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker‚Äôs performance is being driven by a multiyear AI ‚Äúsupercycle.‚Äù\n\n**What To Know:** Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust.\n\nSu‚Äôs comments on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk On The Street‚Äù Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, ‚ÄúFrom the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There‚Äôs tremendous need for more compute.‚Äù\n\nAMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion.\n\nSu highlighted that analysts and investors are ‚Äúhypersensitive‚Äù to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúEverywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there‚Äôs a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,‚Äù Su added.\n\nAlthough the return on investment isn‚Äôt ‚Äúinstantaneous,‚Äù it‚Äôs occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that‚Äôs absolutely the right thing to do. That‚Äôs the way to think about these investment cycles.‚Äù\n\nAMD‚Äôs strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company‚Äôs potential for sustained growth in the coming years.", "id": "1emldft", "created_utc": 1723059920.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 70 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1emldft/amd_ceo_lisa_su_says_ai_is_in_early_stages_of/) \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"Never ask a barber if you need a haircut\".  \n\n- Warren Buffett", "score": 365, "replies": [{"body": "I also look at stuff to confirm my bias.
