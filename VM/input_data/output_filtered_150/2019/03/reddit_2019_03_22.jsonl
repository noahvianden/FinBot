This would look most like the average response to 'how likely is an electric vehicle to be your next purchase?' of which Tesla is an obvious subset. We are in the period where 2018 demand had major distorting benefits that bunched up and then fell away and now we drop closer to wherever that organic demand line is, and no one really knows where. Tesla basically pulled all the price levers multiple times to find it which is pessimistic and why I haven't jumped on the selloff. \n\n2018 plug-in EV sales were 80% higher than 2017 in the US (Tesla US growth even higher). I think it's reasonable to believe that organic growth is much lower than that, but it doesn't take long to pick up the slack. My firm assumption is that by 2030 only small niches still have preferred interest in ICE. If that's wrong then all bets are off. If it's right then organic demand has to grow at a substantial pace (though not 80% per year).\n\nSo we're in a period of uncertainty. It is possible that most of future demand gets grabbed by competitors, that's the chief theoretical concern, not that Q1 sales are down really. Of course I find that highly unlikely because many car brands will simply fail to produce competitive products and those that do will be cautious of their own self-disrupting growth rates.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed.
