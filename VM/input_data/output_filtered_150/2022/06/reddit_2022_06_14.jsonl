{"title": "Double rate hike tomorrow, not triple", "selftext": "The treasury markets are pricing in two back-to-back 75bps rate hikes with near 100% certainty. That is insane. My opinion is the Fed will take into consideration the recent market fallouts in stocks and bonds and go easy on the rate hikes this time around. They must consider the rate hikes already priced in. Also, the goal of the Fed right now is to reduce consumer spending to curb inflation‚Äîwith the financial markets down 22% ytd, I think consumers are going to be very careful with spending now, and spending will self-correct. Finally, a triple rate hike tomorrow will cause panic and uncertainty, which is what the Fed has been trying to avoid ever since the pandemic. Bottom line is, essentially a 150 bps rate hike has already hit the markets. I think we‚Äôre mooning tomorrow in a sell the rumor, buy the news scenario.\n\nEdit: I was wrong. Fed did a triple hike. I sold my calls at a 15% loss an hour before the announcement bc the price action told me IV will be crushed either way.", "id": "vcgqoh", "created_utc": 1655250060.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|34|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vcgqoh)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vcgqoh)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Go easy?
