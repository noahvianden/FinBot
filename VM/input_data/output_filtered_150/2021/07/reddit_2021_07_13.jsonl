As usual here is the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB.\n\nThe biggest news of the day was NOK. A massive 10% on a large float stock. Great job to anyone who bought into the DD a month or so ago on NOK and made profit.\n\nOther then that just a normal day. AMC(-7.65%), GME(-4.86%), and SPCE(-7.20%) were the biggest losers today. Everyone else kind of just slid around.\n\nBelow are the statistics for today.\n\n# AMC:\n\n[-7.65&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/7b1mqs2sc1b71.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=00541fcba00ba9e3466278fb65dd3040c9275f7e)\n\n# CLOV:\n\n[-7.95&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/7mx9xfo9r1b71.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbbb50cddac443b93a275dcd79d52a2f77c3bf59)\n\n# GME:\n\n[-4.86&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/v92wxflsc1b71.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=326b2782732e0a2f4eb3bbed363bb49036eff596)\n\n# NOK:\n\n[+9.50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/8d78406tc1b71.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9d7e90417d1e0ad742f550a1903edc651e03cd)\n\n# SPCE:\n\n[-7.20&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/k2rtgwrtc1b71.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=b144c00a51916f9649aca3b75a8cb2a3393fd538)\n\n# AAPL:\n\n[+0.49&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/x4y2aleuc1b71.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1e8cffc002e8b3e426a140a41e413ef9236759)\n\n# BB:\n\n[+0.79&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/tbrmaoyuc1b71.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ce894e97938a99acea85c77ffcf78ba358ca97)\n\n# TSLA:\n\n[-2.50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/nb5zgqfvc1b71.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=76148b81b890ac79c1978c748dafe5e671f2fb6f)\n\n# SOFI:\n\n[-2.56&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/jcbz04zvc1b71.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b846420d74985b0aa094d1b05fc3b7f89ad81bc)\n\n# WISH:\n\n[-4.67&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/ugkgw3ywc1b71.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f19160b446b549d1895448484a9e593f44baf8)\n\n**Requested**:\n\n# GSAT:\n\n[-5.59&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/570xu4bsq1b71.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=ece4782010180115fcbaa225a4ffbed2eb4674de)\n\n# WKHS:\n\n[-4.10&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/o8oosw40r1b71.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6671c7e6a22ab2247c5f50917b52fe013531be4)\n\n# SNDL:\n\n[+1.20&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/jk80jnxir1b71.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8354edeb2e27350652f8993038225b293da340)\n\nAs usual let me know if I forgot anything.
