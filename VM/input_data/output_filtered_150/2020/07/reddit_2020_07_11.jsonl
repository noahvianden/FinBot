{"title": "Tesla Model Y price cuts", "selftext": "# [TSLA drops prices for Model Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/3CUdXaK)\n\nThe Long Range AWD version went from $52,990 to $49,990 ($3,000 drop) and Performance AWD version went from $60,990 to $59,990 ($1,000 drop). This is huge because it means Tesla is committed to keep demand for their Electric Vehicles (EVs) high during the pandemic (even after inclusion to S&P 500 based on likely performance beat in Q2 ER).\n\nYou could take this in two ways: A) TSLA is having issues keeping demand during the pandemic and are hurting their profit margins or B) TSLA has optimized manufacturing for Model Y and is capable of bringing prices down to the consumer to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\n\nThe price drop is **YUGE** for Tesla because it allows the Model Y Long Range AWD and Performance AWD MSRP price to qualify for EV rebates in some states (e.g. $2,000 off in NY for EVs with MSRP less than $60,000 and range greater than 120 miles). This means a Model Y Performance in basic configuration could qualify for EV rebates in New York.\n\nConsidering the Model Y captures an extra 5-10% margin over the Model 3 (according to [Sandy Munro](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/articles/sandy-munro-tesla-model-y-costs-are-shocking)), the Model Y is positioned to be one of the most popular, in-demand EVs in the world (surpassing the Model 3 which is insane) since it is a more affordable SUV/CUV. Furthermore, this is consistent with the recent price cuts from the Tesla Model S, 3, and X.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla is going to Mars!
