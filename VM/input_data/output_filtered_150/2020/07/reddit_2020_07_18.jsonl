{"title": "I‚Äôm holding 20k JWN Nordstrom, waiting for good news...", "selftext": "Hey everybody, \n\nI bought 20k worth of Nordstrom (JWN) stocks at ~ $16 per share about a month ago. I‚Äôm fairly confident it‚Äôll bounce up pretty much when news of a vaccine comes and probably also rally a few times before that happens as virus numbers get better. \n\nMy question is, has anyone else here invested in apparel retail/ apparel retail department stores and what is your timeline like? Thanks üôè\n\nEDIT: A few comments to everyone saying I‚Äôve made a very bad decision: \n\nFirst of all, I bought at $16. For the past three months it hasn‚Äôt been below $15 except for one time very briefly and that‚Äôs despite countless bad news. \n\nI‚Äôm not waiting for JWN to get back to $40, at least not necessarily- I‚Äôll see how it goes. I‚Äôm mostly waiting for it to get a big, green day and touch on $20+. I‚Äôll let it simmer for a while there and see if it continues to go up to around $25 and if it does I will probably sell. \n\nNordstrom‚Äôs stores are primarily Nordstrom Racks and off price retail has been doing quite well in recent years. Take a look at ROSS. Nordstrom also operates Hautelook which is another off price business.\n\nNordstrom has been very aware of the challenges ahead for years. Amazon wasn‚Äôt created yesterday. Because of this, it‚Äôs been directing its resources and adjusting toward new consumer habits. Its digital sales has increased and it now operates internationally. The pandemic sped up the need for this process of adjusting crucially - but it was a process already underway hence Nordstrom was better prepared than many others which is why I‚Äôm confident they won‚Äôt go bankrupt. \n\nNordstrom is a very well recognized brand. It‚Äôs an appearance in the new Last of Us 2 game for crying out loud. They talk about it in Judd Apatow‚Äôs new movie King of Staten Island. I know this doesn‚Äôt exactly get a company through a crisis but it‚Äôs just to say that they know how to market themselves quite well. \n\nShopping for clothes is different than shopping books, games or DVD‚Äôs. Sure, we all miss that nostalgic feeling of going to a Blockbuster to get movies but it‚Äôs nothing like the millions of people out there that are passionate about shopping for clothes. It‚Äôs like a sport for some, a family trip or something to do as a tourist on holiday. \n\nE-commerce is destroying B&M retail primarily due to convenience and typically cheaper prices. While prices is going to be a challenge for full line Nordstrom stores, I feel that it‚Äôs off price business will help them. As for convenience, it will forever and ever be a hassle to get the size right when purchasing clothes online. In 2019, for Zalando (huge online apparel store in Europe) 50 % of ALL purchases was returned. Once again this isn‚Äôt an issue with books or video games; you know what you get. Shirts or pants don‚Äôt always fit and you need to return them, wait for another size to arrive and maybe that one isn‚Äôt right either. Sure, delivery speed is getting faster increasingly but it will always be an inherited problem for e-commerce, especially when it comes to clothing.\n\nWhile most people don‚Äôt worry about getting their money back for returns, there‚Äôs always going to be people that want to feel, try and look at clothes before they pay for them. Those people will never shop clothes on Amazon. \n\nDuring the pandemic, many have shopped clothes online. Many haven‚Äôt shopped clothes at all. Post pandemic, there is going to be a lot of wardrobes around that needs new stuff. A lot of people will need to go out and get clothes and like I said, many don‚Äôt buy clothes online. \n\nPeople enjoy spending money. People that don‚Äôt shop online haven‚Äôt been able to for some time now. Nordstrom Racks will be full like never before when everyone feels safe to go out again.", "id": "htfiay", "created_utc": 1595073819.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 145, "comments": [{"body": "Much better stocks to invest in....
