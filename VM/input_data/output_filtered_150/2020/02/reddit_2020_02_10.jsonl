{"title": "YOLO on this tomorrow, 2/11/20", "selftext": "I'll keep this short and sweet. LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor) is announcing earnings tomorrow and is worth your consideration as a YOLO for two reasons:  \n\n\n1.) Jim Anderson, the CEO  \nThis fucker used to be my boss (corporate overlord, I never met him). Our company was sold to AVGO back when they were trading at $65/share and Mr. Anderson made out like a bandit on the increase in value in his shares. Then in May of 2015 he went to become a VP for A-M-Fucking-D. In case you were too young to remember what AMD's stock price was back then I'll remind you. It was $2.30. Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  \n\n\nSo August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is. Then the stock proceeds to fucking skyrocket up to a peak of $24 over the next 12 months.  \n\n\nSo that's reason number 1. Follow the money. Follow Jimbo.  \n\n\n2.) TeCHNiCAlS  \nLSCC closed at $19 flat today, which is in the middle of it's $17.50 to $21.50 range over the last 5 months. However it peaked at $24.2 just 3 weeks ago.  March 20th $25 Calls went from between 20 and 30 cents today.
