{"title": "Blue chips wont be fun next year", "selftext": "Why I believe that sector rotation is inevitable starting now\n \n2020 and 2021 have been extraordinary years. They also have been extraordinary for the stock market. After an initial dip in the stock market when COVID broke out everything and anything rallied. Initial dip only lasted 2 months and then sector by sector flew into all time highs and rallied now for a year and a half. There were massive gains to be made in tech, pharmaceuticals, speculative plays, even the old boring financials and even the housing market… I won’t even mention the short squeezes! I myself had some fun with those.\nNo matter how high the prices looked for the stocks- they just kept getting higher. Critical opinions from analysts and news reporters started disappearing. It just doesn’t look very good if you keep saying that things are overpriced when those prices keep going up, does it? I remember Elon Musk saying that  Tesla prices were too high at $750 pre split- then it reached $1200 post split and now Tesla is trading at 300 PE ratio! And somehow nobody says that it’s that high anymore… Folks, don’t get me wrong, I love Tesla- it’s a great company; and would Elon Musk purpose to me tomorrow I’d say “yes!” without a blink of an eye, but 300 x price per earnings? I suppose Tesla will have to electrify Mars too.\n \nI should not single one stock out. Most stocks have gotten into euphoria zone mid pandemic, mid and small caps including. But what no one seems to have noticed is that while blue chips continued to rally- most mid caps (after reaching highs a year ago) have already consolidated. Yes! That’s exactly what I’m saying -market has already corrected leaving only the shiny blue chips at sky high prices. I really don’t want to be this person spewing gloom and doom everywhere, but I do not see a good year coming for Amazon, Tesla, Google, Ford, Zoom, Nvidia, Home Depot, etc. They are exceptional companies, that are currently priced even more exceptionally (if you know what I mean). We won’t be buying computers to start working from home anymore; we have bought extraordinary amount of cars to avoid public transport so there will be little demand for automobiles in the next 5 years, we have already settled with our new subscriptions, housing market is finally slowing and we are not redesigning our home anymore to accommodate a work from home office. There has been an incredible growth in the past few years but now earnings reports will start coming in showing stagnation or downtrend in demand and euphoria will pop very quickly. Our big growth companies will not be growing that fast anymore and can you really justify 50, 100, 300 PE for something that is not extremely high growth? For something that is possibly very strongly affected by inflation?\n \n \nSo following this thought process what do I think will happen in the stock market? I’ll pretend I’m an oracle here for a second…\nHedge funds need to justify their fees and make some money, most of them do not or are not allowed to go short so they will be looking for opportunities. Possibly stocks that are heavily underpriced with sound fundamentals and that are not that affected by fluctuations in demand. I vouch for the whole pharmaceutical sector to have an amazing year! Data collection agencies, infrastructure, utilities, gold miners should do well. Quite frankly all those beat down forgotten stocks that we were ignoring for the past year should come to life. I believe that after nearly two year stock market euphoria we will come back to fundamentals and conviction plays. Easy money won’t be a thing of the day anymore and things won’t rally “just because”….. here I am with gloom and doom again, but I do think that we need to prepare for more of a whack-a-mole setup in the market for the next few years and stay away from anything that doesn’t appear to be a good deal. I also believe that S&P and Nasdaq will pull back and will make negative gains next year or maybe even a few after, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be gains made in niches or catalyst plays.\n \n Check out a 20 year Nasdaq yearly chart to see for yourself how desperately it needs to consolidate and it does do consolidate! \n\nAs for myself, I’ll be scouting out the stocks that have strong fundamentals, high growth possibilities (without hitting my wallet with high PE) and positive catalysts in the near future.
