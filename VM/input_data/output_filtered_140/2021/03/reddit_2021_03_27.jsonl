If you believe in Ark Invest's price target Tesla's fair price should be currently around $1,300. This is calculated using the $3,000 expected value in 2025 which is discounted by CAPM capital asset expected return: E(r) = r\\_f + beta\\*(E(r\\_m) - r\\_f).\n\nr\\_f is the risk free interest rate or typically 10 year treasury bond yield which is 1.674% as we speak. Beta for Tesla is at 2.06. E(r\\_m) is the expected growth rate of market, which can be S&P 500 average annual return of \\~10%. Plugging all of this into the equation gives expected return of 18.84% for TSLA.\n\nExpected return is used to discount future cash flows and also the future expected valuation of TSLA to be comparable in present moment. We can discount the future value (Ark's price target) to today. To do this we use the formula PV = FV / (1+E(r))\\^t. We'll assume that the price target is calculated for the end of year 2025. This means t will be 1740 days or 4.767 years. Therefore plugging in all values we get PV = 3,000 / (1+0.1884)\\^4.767 = 1,318.\n\nIn other words Tesla's fair price would be around $1,300 if all of the assumptions are taken as they are.
