{"title": "Why you shouldn't secure your puts with cash: The SPAC-secured Put", "selftext": "Now I'm not saying don't sell cash secured puts, I'm saying don't hold the cash after you sell the puts. Instead, use that cash to buy near NAV SPACs. \n\nFor those who don't know, SPACs are blank check companies whose purpose is to bring a private company public via reverse merger. The important thing to know for this strategy, though, is that the money raised by SPACs is held in trusts. When a SPAC finds a company to merge with, shareholders get to A) vote in the merger, and B) are able to redeem their shares for cash at NAV (net asset value). For almost all SPACs, NAV= $10 + a small amount of interest that accumulates offer the life of the trust. \n\nThis effectively creates a hard price floor of $10. While they can and occasionally do fall below this, it is rare and the share price never stays there for long. During the crash in March, some went to like $9.50, but pretty much all recovered back above $10 within a couple weeks. \n\nSo, the point of all this is that near NAV SPACs have extremely limited risk. If I buy a spac at $10.20, my maximum downside is 2%, if that. On the other hand, their upside is limitless. One was up 15x from $10 at once point. This makes SPACs the perfect cash park. \n\nBy buying SPACs with the cash you were using to secure puts, you expose yourself to the daily potential for 20-30%+ gains if you get lucky and a merger is announced while you're holding a specific SPAC, with the aforementioned marginal downside risk. \n\nIf you get assigned on your puts, you can simply sell the SPACs you bought and wheel the assigned shares like normal. Maybe you lose a few dollars on the SPACs here and there, but usually you'll make a small profit, and occasionally you'll make huge profits. Some weeks you'll make more money from theta gains, some it'll be SPACs, but the point is you'll be earning from both as opposed to just one, all without really increasing your risk levels. \n\nThis strategy technically uses margin buying power, but your cash balance always stays positive, and you aren't charged margin interest.\n\nDisclaimer: not a financial advisor\n\nEdit: r/SPACs is a great resource and the mods generally do a great job\n\nEdit2: it appears this strategy won't work with all brokers. I use Webull (options level 3) and it works exactly as I described without being charged any interest for margin, and there's the added benefit of 0 options fees (and that's really for everything $0).", "id": "lie23p", "created_utc": 1613145877.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Both of those are easily addressed.

All this is is using a margin account and buying some SPACs.  I am a little worried a lot of people (not necessarily 0b1000_dirt but a lot of other comments in here) in this thread don't seem to fully grasp how this works.\n\nIn a margin account most stocks are marginable, AKA their liquidation value counts towards your max margin and buying power available.\n\nIn this case what you are doing is trading your cash for SPAC stock and it's equity value is now comprising part of you buying power.  However when you do this you have to give maintenance of 25% to 100% depending on how dangerous the stock is, so you lose some buying power.\n\nAlso now that the stock is backing your options trades a huge decrease in the stock could lower your available margin to the point you get a margin call.  Also it could go way up and increase your margin value.  So you need to be careful exactly what stock positions you are taking and what your total collateral make up is in your account.\n\nYou never want to put 100% of your collateral into one thing.  Don't put 100% in SPACs then sell a shit ton of put against it and don't max out your buying power in a margin account.
