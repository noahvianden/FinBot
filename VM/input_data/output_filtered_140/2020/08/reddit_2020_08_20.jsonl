{"title": "Am I Stupid for Making $TSLA 80% of my Portfolio", "selftext": "Started investing 5 months ago and i was always scared of the market so i mostly got index funds/ETFS. Recently I been thinking heavily that im too young (25) to be investing in index funds so im aiming big. Was about 50% index funds nd 50% a hodgepodge of assorted blue chips and im happy with the small gainz but i feel i could be doing better with all in TSLA.\n\nSo i sold my index funds/ETFs in my ROTH to go almost all in TSLA at 80% of my portfolio.  Accumulated 12 shares within past weeks and I plan to have 20 shares before the split. I plan to save this for 4-8 years and keep adding to it, and hopefully buy a small house and move out. I figured I'm still young enough to aim big and these 20 shares isnt too crazy of an amount ( a lot ot me though) but i think this is the best path to wealth accumulation. The potential is too hard to ignore; This company is the future of Earth in my eyes. I'm just a little nervous but im looking for some opinions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit; it'll be interesting to look back on this post a year later... we will see as i made the call already\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2; damn i just converted my entire ROTH and went 80% TSLA this morning, 10 minutes after open on August 20. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 3; boy am i happy for now. lets see the medium/long term through", "id": "id26me", "created_utc": 1597891493.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "Five out of five nudists agree: nudism is good!

I'm interested in feedback.\n\nI'm pretty new like you, only in TSLA and ARKK (look into Cathie Wood and ARKK if you haven't yet) for the past month. I only buy stocks and hold.\n\n[Here are my percent gains](https://imgur.com/R5Ryk0Y). Certainly nothing to brag about! But it's a good visualization of how diversifying is actually bringing down my gains from TSLA. \n\nThe question you have to ask is if your money could do better elsewhere. If so, jump on that.\n\nARKK is actively managed, they eke out more green days than red. It's filled with stocks like TSLA that are ready to break out. I think it's important to hold some ARKK in case it breaks out, and I don't have the time or interest to research everything in their portfolio. Cathie seems like a goddamn genius and I trust her decisions. I'm only 15% ARKK, the rest TSLA.\n\nMy mentor (a retired stock broker of 40+ years) says a rotation is happening/about to happen from tech sectors to recovery sectors. He mentioned airlines, since they are cheap right now, and will likely come back. I think it's a sure bet, but it will take too much time for too little reward. TSLA could 3x-6x by the time the airlines reach pre-pandemic levels. I dunno.\n\nWarren Buffett only invests in what he understands. I think you are doing that, and it's a good thing. He also prepares for more than one disaster hitting at a time, though. I'm not sure how you can reduce risk like that without sacrificing at least some profitability.\n\nThe challenge for me is how much cash to hold, especially as the stock price increases.

Your gains are def. impressive at almost 30% in a year! Grats man you deserve it. I have heard of ARKK and while im def. interested, i figured it be simpler to buy their biggest holding, TSLA. I think ARKK is def. a good deal, better than QQQ and SPY as it is more innovate and disruptive to the industries. \n  \nAnd interesting insight on the rotation out of tech sector to services sector. i can def see that happening but im just more comfortable with putting my money in tech regardless of rotations. I thikn my move is pretty risky in that TSLA fails, i lose all my money but im willing to bet they outperform and stay relevant. I apoglogize if my financial thoughts aren't the most analytical as I'm not a very good businessman but i know a good company when i see one. \n\nand on ur last question: i think buying each week is an awesome idea. On dips, just buy more. I'm just doing a mix of lump sum and DCA. Aggressive DCA i suppose; split my purchases in different days all within a week. Lump sum wins like 60% of the time according to this Vanguard article i read.
