Now it has shrivelled down to a **2% chance,** after comments from multiple Fed officials late afternoon Monday.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\* Update on 11:30AM ET Meeting \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**>>> Good news - no press release was released.** [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm). **This means the meeting was considered a \"normal\" board meeting and not a real \"emergency\" meeting.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* **IMPORTANT EDIT ABOUT EMERGENCY MEETING \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nAs per further investigation and clarification from commentors, today's meeting is a **planned board meeting**. [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm). A **Press Release will most probably not be made**, as Jan 18, Jan 14. Dec 6, Nov 16, Nov 15 all did not have press releases. (Checked via Wayback Machine). So, this is **90% NOT AN EMERGENCY MEETING**, as what I previously wrote. **If they decided to release a statement, then it will become an emergency meeting. Let's hope not :(**\n\n**By convention, in every meeting, they discuss if they should release details to the public - let's hope this time they DO NOT release anything to the public, and leave it as a normal meeting.**\n\nObviously during the meeting the board will discuss the issues I set at below:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello everyone! Sorry I didn't update you all on my predictions for what the Fed will do in Janurary and my inflation forecast - was a tad bit busy - apologies!\n\n1. Every year February, new seasonal factors for inflation are calculated, causing rebalancing to affect inflation numbers. Used cars (40.5% v 37.3%) and energy prices had larger seasonal factors (though it decreased from 29.3% to 27%), whilst food prices this time again increased (7% v 6.3%).\n2. The Fed will have an ~~emergency meeting~~ (officially an **expedited meeting**) TODAY 11:30AM. They planned this late Thursday afternoon. According to [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm), they're discussing: \"Review and determination by the Board of Governors of the advance and discount rates to be charged by the Federal Reserve Banks.\" Ie they'll be discussing what to do with interest rates. **NOTE**: **Some of you have said this is a planned meeting** **~~- this is incorrect. The next meeting is March 15/16.~~** **HOWEVER, it is TRUE that a board meeting is held every Monday -** [**https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm)**.** **~~However, NO PRESS RELEASES are made after each meeting - except today's one.~~** **\\*\\*\\* It's possible a press release might be made, but unlikely\\*\\*\\*. See** [**https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)**.** The official terminology is a \"**closed board expedited meeting**\", which is not the same as say the COVID emergency meetings, ~~but is still considered an \"emergency\" meeting, since it is outside of the normal schedule.~~\n3. The Russia and Ukraine crisis seems to be more elevated, causing the US to speculate based on intelligence any attack is imminent in the following days. US and Russia talked on Saturday to no avail; France met with Russia Friday; Ukraine has requested an emergency meeting with Russia in the next 48 hrs, and other countries are quickly trying to resolve the situation through diplomatic means.\n4. The yield curve has flattened dramatically. The 10 year yield and 5 year yield are nearly the same number, and both are extremely close to the 30 year yield. The 2 year yield somewhat recovered a little on Friday, but 1.5% is awfully close to 1.955%. The 3 month yield also shot up to 0.338%. Fast flattening generally indicates extreme fear a recession is coming due to excessive Fed action.\n\n~~I'll write up a larger post in the near term on my analysis!~~\n\nIn general, I haven't done too much deep analysis, but presumably:\n\n1. **\\*\\*\\*\\* Important edit: The Fed will discuss these issues, but will most likely NOT release a press release. \\*\\*\\*\\*** The Fed's meeting will be **inconclusive**. The Fed's dual mandate is price stability and full employment, coupled with other secondary goals of GDP growth etc. Powell will most likely cite Russia and Ukraine's geopolitical crisis as a \"wait and see\" issue - ie like last time Omicron was a \"wait and see\" issue. **Oil, gas, defence related commodities, food etc might go up in the short term, due to stockpiling etc, pouring further fuel to the inflation flame**. However, the Fed will probably wait and see if diplomatic solutions can be made, and leave a final decision to the March meeting. They also know the yield curve has dramatically flattened, and any fast rate increase may tip the already fragile and fearful economy into panic mode. **According to even bearish critics, a rate hike in this meeting is extremely unlikely**. A possible scenario is QE stopping earlier by 1 month, which seems possible.\n2. Russia and Ukraine is complicated. Russia is in a tight spot after Putin's comments on **nuclear war being more likely** if Ukraine joins NATO: [https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278](https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278) (Bulletin of the Atomic Scentists ie Doomsday Clock). Both US and France's meeting seem to not have worked. Presumably I'm guessing, after these comments, Russia's WW2 generals had a hard long talk about what will happen to Russia, and what next steps they can do to stop a nuclear confrontation. I suspect some top level officials are already preparing to shield Putin away from using the nuclear launch codes in the future, similar to General Milley's actions toward Trump. However these are speculations. **Recently, satellite imagery from WSJ** and other journalists [https://youtu.be/7Hu5FErz1js](https://youtu.be/7Hu5FErz1js) show around 130,000 troops stationed. This shows some concrete evidence after Russia asked in the UN Security Council meeting if there was any evidence on the 100,000 number. The US will probably release further evidence this week. The US speculated based on intelligence Russia will invade anytime. I suspect Russia knows about **WW2's Operation Bodyguard and the Normandy Landings**, in which the allies purposely gave disinformation to the Germans. The US/EU knows Russia knows the EU and US knows this, which further complicates matters. I suspect intelligence was via spys, and Russia is frantically trying to find these spies. In general, Ukraine seems to want to quickly forge a diplomatic solution with Russia, since the US is hesitating on direct physical involvement. Presumaly, Ukraine and Russia will amend the Minsk Agreement in collaboration with the EU, and possibly install an increasing buffer zone (ie Russia moves troops 10 metres, Ukraine minuses troops etc etc). **I suspect this will drag on for some time.**\n\n**~~\\*\\*\\* On Emergency meetings:~~**\n\n~~It is TRUE that a board meeting is held every Monday -~~ [~~https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm~~](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm)~~.

Economics tells a completely different story where cost dynamics are fundamentally multi-variate from various angles in the trade.

You can expect production to start to gap up then when it becomes clear that keeping prices high is hurting volume sales and that will promote increased production in order to maximize return.\n\nIn other words, by the time the summer comes around the primary factor impacting CPI reporting will likely see a price drop, and the relative year over year costs will start to become relative to 5% inflation in June of 2021 rather than 1.4% in January of 2021.\n\nIn other words, for inflation to remain high, prices would have to start increasing DRAMATICALLY for inflation not to go down, while the rate of inflation is actually decreasing.\n\nThat will give the Fed cover to slow the rate increase curve being priced in right now.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You are truly lost", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "I would rather have low inflation.
