Well we trade them our currency for their goods and services so they can buy our goods and service.  Unfortunately the money coming back usually less than what we trade to them, and if we want to continue our American life style where goods are the cheapest in the world, then yeah we got to keep on printing.\n\nAs far as inflation caused by price hikes by companies, that’s just pure greed.  Most of the current inflation is seen in housing and asset market. Those 3000$ checks the fed gave out did not cause houses to rise that fast in the last two years.  Anyone else saying the “relief” fund had any impact is a joke.\n\nI really don’t know what is a good practice.  When you inflate your currency and deprecate your currency, more foreigners would buy your goods thus increasing economic stimulus.  However, the reverse means it’s cheaper to buy foreign stuff, however that would take a hit on your economy as you can’t sell as much as your own good.  \n\nNo I do not like inflation, as it makes buying shit cheap, but I also know the shit is cheap b/c we can just print money to get it where as other nations have to trade labor for currency to buy the same shit", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Cash hold, surfing down the wave", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I prefer to be gelded and successful than have big balls and live in my car.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Leveraged proshares ultra vix is up alot because of this", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Long tdoc at 33.93 and I only bought enough to fill the slot .
