{"title": "Why First Republic Bank's Stock Probably won't Recover", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/67ffazc2jeoa1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a5af5b643532335129f44de70686e27491afdb)\n\nI did a little digging into First Republic Bank's (FRC) 2022 financials, and there are some troubling details within.  If FRC recorded their assets at fair value, they would have a negative stockholder’s equity (book value) given the unrealized losses that do not appear in the financial statements (aside from the footnotes where I got the information). Their loan book is valued on the Balance Sheet at a $22 billion premium over their fair value, and their Held to Maturity (HTM) Debt Securities (i.e. treasuries and bonds) are valued at a $4.7 billion premium over their fair value. So like SVB, FRC has a large collection of assets that have lost a tremendous amount of value since the Fed started hiking interest rates.\n\nAdditionally, if FRC was to liquidate all of it’s assets (aside from real property it owns, which I excluded from the analysis because real estate is not a liquid asset) in an attempt to stem a bank run on deposits, it would have a $1.27 billion shortfall based on the fair value of its assets at the end of 2022. In other words, if FRC sold all of its investments, sold its loan book, and used all the money plus its existing cash balance, it could not pay back all of its depositors if they wanted all their money back.\n\nTLDR; Stock is down over 70% this week, despite the $30 billion injection of liquidity courtesy of JPM, Wells Fargo, Citi, etc. The valuation on the stock seems to be more in line with reality now, with the book value of FRC's assets being greatly inflated compared to the fair value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\**Full disclosure, I own 30 shares of FRC.* ", "id": "11ub9bq", "created_utc": 1679104635.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Not for HTM designation which sounds like most of these banks and private funds are holding currently. 🏦 💥", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.
