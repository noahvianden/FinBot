{"title": "Earnings concerns", "selftext": "TLDR: I‚Äôm bearish on Teslas 2023 earnings and feel it will fall somewhat dramatically. Growth won‚Äôt be there this year and with a pe of 80+ I don‚Äôt feel confident in its ability to keep this valuation. Here‚Äôs my post from a year ago for some credibility  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/s/GIyZ4G9SYg\n\n\n2021 rev and earn growth of 71% and 700%\n\n2022 rev and earn growth of 51% and 128%\n\n2023 rev and earn growth (with record q4 estimates. 25B and 3B) will be ~19% and ~(-20%)\n\nThis will be the first year that Tesla did not grow a considerable amount since 2019 (which was already an outlier) and if the 19% growth estimate is correct it will lead to Tesla falling below the magic 50% growth number. \n\nThey‚Äôve also missed this 50% growth number for 2022 and most likely will miss again for 2023 in deliveries. \n\nThe company may regain this large growth number in the future due to its energy department which is doing very well. But it‚Äôs not big enough to offset its fall in auto growth this year. \n\nIf we still had a pe of 35 like last year I wouldn‚Äôt be worried, but we‚Äôre sitting closer to 90 pe currently. I‚Äôm extremely bullish on Tesla longterm, but I don‚Äôt think the market is going to react well to upcoming 2023 earnings.\n\nI want to make sure everyone doesn‚Äôt discount this post claiming ‚ÄúFUD and bears‚Äù so here‚Äôs some proof of my belief in Tesla longterm. And that this is just to start a discussion on the topic. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/s/GIyZ4G9SYg\n\nEven if Tesla had an insane quarter and really broke the scale, they‚Äôll still at best have flat earnings y/y and ~25% rev growth. And deliveries won‚Äôt be overly impressive relative to past years. \n\nI really don‚Äôt see Tesla doing well following earnings.

The customer was informed that Tesla was able to review the telemetry and understood there was a crash that resulted in this repair not being covered by warranty.¬† Most, if not all, manufacturer warranties exclude damages caused by a crash because that is the point of insurance coverage.\n\n**Helpful context:** Tesla has the most advanced vehicle telemetry system that can identify emerging issues, determine scope, and allow for faster vehicle and service improvements than has ever been seen in the auto industry.¬†We take action as soon as we see a problem, something that should be celebrated as best-in-class, and is often cited by our regulators as a major safety advantage.\n\n**False accusation:** The author has conflated a noise-related (non-safety) issue with a range of unrelated and disconnected service actions.¬†Contrary to the article‚Äôs statements based on erroneous data, Tesla is truthful and transparent with our safety regulators around the globe and any insinuation otherwise is plain wrong.\n\n**Tesla Service Principles:** a. Our service technicians and advisors diagnose, maintain and fix our customers‚Äô cars efficiently and are not incentivized to profit off customers‚Äô repair needs.  b. Tesla provides our service employees with excellent compensation and benefits packages.¬†They don‚Äôt work off of commission like at other dealers who are incentivized to upsell or overcharge their customers. The best service is no service.¬†When service must be done, we fix 90%+ problems without even needing the customer present ‚Äì either through over-the-air updates or with mobile service at a customer‚Äôs house or workplace.
