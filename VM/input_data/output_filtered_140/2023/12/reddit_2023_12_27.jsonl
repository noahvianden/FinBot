{"title": "Earnings concerns", "selftext": "TLDR: I’m bearish on Teslas 2023 earnings and feel it will fall somewhat dramatically. Growth won’t be there this year and with a pe of 80+ I don’t feel confident in its ability to keep this valuation. Here’s my post from a year ago for some credibility  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/s/GIyZ4G9SYg\n\n\n2021 rev and earn growth of 71% and 700%\n\n2022 rev and earn growth of 51% and 128%\n\n2023 rev and earn growth (with record q4 estimates. 25B and 3B) will be ~19% and ~(-20%)\n\nThis will be the first year that Tesla did not grow a considerable amount since 2019 (which was already an outlier) and if the 19% growth estimate is correct it will lead to Tesla falling below the magic 50% growth number. \n\nThey’ve also missed this 50% growth number for 2022 and most likely will miss again for 2023 in deliveries. \n\nThe company may regain this large growth number in the future due to its energy department which is doing very well. But it’s not big enough to offset its fall in auto growth this year. \n\nIf we still had a pe of 35 like last year I wouldn’t be worried, but we’re sitting closer to 90 pe currently. I’m extremely bullish on Tesla longterm, but I don’t think the market is going to react well to upcoming 2023 earnings.\n\nI want to make sure everyone doesn’t discount this post claiming “FUD and bears” so here’s some proof of my belief in Tesla longterm. And that this is just to start a discussion on the topic. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/s/GIyZ4G9SYg\n\nEven if Tesla had an insane quarter and really broke the scale, they’ll still at best have flat earnings y/y and ~25% rev growth. And deliveries won’t be overly impressive relative to past years. \n\nI really don’t see Tesla doing well following earnings. But I’m not selling more than 10% of my relatively small holding which is now ~30 shares.

There's several quotes from Tesla execs out there where they talk about thier struggles reaching20k, so I'm pretty confident hiring another 40k employees will be an even harder endeavor.

Good luck with your short position moron!**\n\nReuters published an article that leads with a wildly misleading headline and is riddled with incomplete and demonstrably incorrect information.   This latest piece vaguely and nonsensically suggests there are thousands upon thousands of disgruntled Tesla customers. It’s nonsensical because it’s nonfactual—the reality is Tesla’s customer retention is among the best and highest in the industry.\n\n**Misleading headline:**  “Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective.”\n\n**Reality (buried in the article):**  Tesla paid for most of the 120,000 vehicle repairs under warranty.\n\n**Manufactured story:**  The customer photo represents not a failed component, but instead a **post crash component** that was damaged in the course of reducing the adverse effects of a collision. The customer was informed that Tesla was able to review the telemetry and understood there was a crash that resulted in this repair not being covered by warranty.  Most, if not all, manufacturer warranties exclude damages caused by a crash because that is the point of insurance coverage.\n\n**Helpful context:** Tesla has the most advanced vehicle telemetry system that can identify emerging issues, determine scope, and allow for faster vehicle and service improvements than has ever been seen in the auto industry. We take action as soon as we see a problem, something that should be celebrated as best-in-class, and is often cited by our regulators as a major safety advantage.\n\n**False accusation:** The author has conflated a noise-related (non-safety) issue with a range of unrelated and disconnected service actions. Contrary to the article’s statements based on erroneous data, Tesla is truthful and transparent with our safety regulators around the globe and any insinuation otherwise is plain wrong.\n\n**Tesla Service Principles:** a. Our service technicians and advisors diagnose, maintain and fix our customers’ cars efficiently and are not incentivized to profit off customers’ repair needs.  b. Tesla provides our service employees with excellent compensation and benefits packages. They don’t work off of commission like at other dealers who are incentivized to upsell or overcharge their customers. The best service is no service. When service must be done, we fix 90%+ problems without even needing the customer present – either through over-the-air updates or with mobile service at a customer’s house or workplace. To see Tesla’s approach in action, one can refer to this maintenance study from earlier this year, “Tesla was named the cheapest luxury car brand to maintain..” →\n\n[https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-named-cheapest-luxury-car-110000613.html](https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-named-cheapest-luxury-car-110000613.html)\n\nThis cherry-picking approach to journalism results in missing the truth, which is a pattern in many of the negative articles about Tesla. Using one customer’s one-sided version of events as the universal experience of all customers paints a false and misleading picture of Tesla. In reality, for every upset customer, there are hundreds more who are thrilled with their Tesla and eager to repeat their business. The numbers don’t lie in terms of repeat sales and customer satisfaction.  We strive to make every customer a lifelong member of the Tesla family.   While others may have their own agendas, **our principles have been the same since the beginning: to make the safest cars in the world, which are easiest to maintain, while accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy**.\n\n12:47 pm · 27 Dec 2023 · **1.8M** Views", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Can someone reply if they see the above post - I'm testing something.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Deleted", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Show me your short position.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "It was a software update", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "What?
