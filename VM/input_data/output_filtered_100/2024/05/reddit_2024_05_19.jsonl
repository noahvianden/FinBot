Data matters, in fact it's the only thing that matters. \n\nIf I have data that shows less people will die with FSD - then effectively by not allowing FSD, regulators are killing people. There will certainly be FSD deaths and they'll be in the media, but if you can prove there are less deaths/mile it won't matter. \n\nPeople also seem to forget that FSD could launch tomorrow in most states. No regulation approval required. \n\nWhat are the deaths/mile. That is the only thing that will matter. Period. Not even crashes per mile. If there are inconsequential accidents, like fender benders, or curbing the car, etc - that's just something Tesla insurance will have to deal with. When it comes to regulation the only thing that really matters is death (and serious injury). \n\nSo right now they are looking at miles driven per critical disengagement. Once they get that number to say 1x critical disengagement per 100,000 miles, FSD is effectively solved. \n\nElon says FSD 12.4 will have 5x-10x less disengagements than 12.3.
