Understandable as it's a convoluted with several distinct parts.  Here's how it works in a nutshell:\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies like Merck and Pfizer and Eli Lily and hundreds more do all the drug discovery and drug development work.  THEY do the clinical trials you mentioned world wide with various partners.   These trials take promising new molecules through all their required Phases and documentation and the entire process is overseen by the FDA in the US.  Other countries have their own regulatory agencies with their own requirements.  It's a lengthy and costly process and is never guaranteed.  Drugs fail at all stages of the process.  IF the pharmaceutical/biotech company gains the regulatory approvals they need for the drug by demonstrating the drug is safe and efficacious in humans THEN they will manufacture the medicines themselves or make them through contract manufacturers.  This is also a highly-regulated part of the industry.  \n\nOnce the products are made correctly and to exacting standards they sell their finished products primarily to giant drug Distributors like McKesson or Cardinal or AmerisourceBergen in the US.  Other countries have their own distributors and supply chains.  These distributors then sell and distribute the drugs to pharmacy chains and hospital systems and various types of health clinics for dispensing.\n\nPharmacies like CVS and Walgreens and Cost Plus all DISPENSE the drugs.  Pharmacists work there and take prescriptions written by your doctor for you and dispense the meds to you the patient.  Insurers and PBMs dictate what the price is to you and how much you have to co-pay.  They don't work for you.  They work for your employer who pays for the drug plan you receive through your employer.  Their mission is to save your employer money by establishing \"tiers\" of drugs which dictates their price and co-pay level. \n\nThere are mail order pharmacies that do the same thing as the brick and mortar pharmacies  but they mail the drugs to you usually giving you a 90-day supply at a time. All these pharmacies  don't do the actual clinical trials or work with the FDA to get the drugs through the regulatory process.  That's the pharma/biotech companies as I've explained. \n\nCost Plus also isn't a \"compounding pharmacy\". There are hundreds of small specialty compounders all across the US but that's not what the big guys or Cost-Plus is doing.  For the most part they dispense the pre-made pills or liquids, injectables, inhalants, patches, gels, ointments, etc.  already made in standard dosages and dosage forms by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.  Cost-Plus is a mail-order pharmacy using generics and a low fixed markup so that the drugs are as affordable as possible.  The big chains can and are starting to offer the same model for generics.  There's nothing Cost-Plus can do that they can't also do if they can make it work economically.  \n\nIMHO the real value of Cost Plus is that they offer a cheaper alternative to millions of patients  (with or without drug insurance) who can use generics.  They also publish their drug prices and markup so it's clear what they are charging and making.  This was always difficult to get from your pharmacy chain or PBM before.  AND this puts pressure on PBMs/Insurers and pharmacy chains to offer better pricing at least for the same generics.  Many PBMs and chains were marking UP generics and making them needlessly expensive for the patient, just for big profits.  Now the Cost-Plus model is offering transparent pricing and a lower cost option and the chains can't hide behind obscure opaque pricing. \n\nWill they put the chains out of business?  Doubtful, for a whole host of reasons, but they WILL perhaps change the costs of generics accessed through the chains.

What is a 'soft landing'? Let's enumerate the requirements and see how far we get.\n\n1. Inflation needs to run around the fed's 2% target for a sustained period of time. Current status: We are still about 50% higher than that if we look at all items, 100% higher if we look at all items minus food and energy. Sticky, the link I provided, is 150% higher. Progress has been made, but what make you think you can extrapolate continued disinflation particularly without causing other changes, potentially in negative directions?\n2. In taming inflation to fed's target we need to not create a recession through demand destruction. Current status: Well, we haven't hit the target yet, but we also haven't created a recession yet. GDP growth is great, but consumer spending has leveled off to a degree, consumer debt accumulation has leveled off and savings are now under pre-COVID levels. The point here, is there is very little more 'demand destruction' that can happen before shit goes bad. Inflation and rate hikes have caused pain on most ordinary people looking to improve their lives, they have burnt their COVID savings, wages haven't kept pace with inflation and now rates are higher than they have been in 20+ years so financing new stuff through debt is increasing less an option as it's expensive. This gets back to my question in point 1, you're not going to continue to drive inflation down through further punishing the consumer, because the consumer is about to roll over.\n3. The fed will need transition to more accommodating rate policy without restarting inflation. The consumer and people with money are a bit different. The median person is suffering. Their wages are down once corrected for inflation, home loans and car payments are high, they are stuck. But people with much money have been parking it, putting off big purchases as desired by rate hikes. Can the fed lower rates without triggering another round of inflation? Given they haven't even won this fight yet, I remain skeptical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>deficit spending is 1 - reasonable. we spent 6.5 trillion on revenues of  5.5 trillion and even with the rising rates the avg interest rate on  the debt is 3%.\n\n3% and rising quickly!

In early 1994, the economy was approaching its third year of recovery following the 1990-91 recession. By February 1994, the unemployment rate was falling rapidly, down from 7.8% to 6.6%. CPI inflation sat at 2.8%, and the federal funds rate sat at around 3%. With the economy growing and unemployment shrinking rapidly, the Fed was concerned about a potential pick-up of inflation and decided to raise rates preemptively. During 1994, the Fed raised rates seven times, doubling the federal funds rate from 3% to 6%. It then cut its key interest rate, the federal funds rate, three times in 1995 when it saw the economy softening more than required to keep inflation from rising.\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-a-soft-landing/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This article should explain it well:\n\nhttps://mises.org/wire/dangerous-myth-soft-landing", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Increased household access to the internet in 1995 cannot be understated as a positive economic influence.

Ron DeSantis.\n> \n> “The Company is increasingly dividing – rather than delighting – a growing number of consumers,” the letter states, citing a recent poll that found Disney is the fifth most polarizing brand in the world, right behind the disgraced and collapsed crypto exchange FTX.\n> \n> “Disney’s board faces a number of pivotal decisions over the next 12 to 24 months as it rebuilds consumer trust and oversees a complex transformation that includes an optimization of the streaming segment, a direct-to-consumer pivot for ESPN, the evolution of the Company’s film studios and a growth plan for parks,” the letter continued. “The board will also once again need to engage in critical succession planning. Having a sizable owner in the boardroom to bring the market’s perspective and serve as one of many voices would only benefit shareholders. While this type of director may not always be needed at Disney, we contend it is the right addition at this key moment in time.”\n> \n> The letter also slapped back at the investment firm Blackwells Capital, another large shareholder that last week urged Peltz to end what it called his “ego-driven campaign.” Ancora called the firm’s principal, Jason Aintabi, “a publicity-seeking greenmailer with a questionable personal and business history” who opposes Peltz’s efforts despite having “made billions of dollars over many decades” through shareholder activism.\n\nhttps://www.thewrap.com/nelson-peltz-disney-board-seats-ancora-holdings/\n\n> **Bill Ackman Jumps To Musk's Defense Over Anti-Semitism Controversy, Pledges To Stay Invested In X: 'Earth Is Fortunate...'**\n> \n> Tesla CEO Elon Musk, recently criticized for endorsing anti-Semitic comments and lashing out at advertisers choosing to pull out of advertising on his social media platform, found support from fund manager Bill Ackman.\n> \n> What Happened: Ackman, expressing his views on social media platform X, owned by Musk, defended the billionaire entrepreneur’s commitment to free speech and praised his recent interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit.\n> \n> “Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect,” Ackman wrote.\n> \n> Ackman said his firm, which invested in Twitter’s privatization via The Pershing Square (OTC:PSHZF) Foundation, intends to maintain its interest in X and support companies advertising on the platform.\n> \n> “Whether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest.”\n> \n> In the interview, Musk criticized advertisers who abandoned the platform over the anti-Semitic content controversy, asserting that he and X were being treated unfairly compared to other social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.\n> \n> Ackman argued that X is targeted due to its perceived competition with other media organizations and because articles mentioning Musk, especially amid controversies, attract more clicks. He said that even Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) suspended ads on X under media pressure, despite its heavy investment in Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok.\n> \n> “If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing,” Ackman said. “I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board.”\n> \n> Addressing Musk’s response to the anti-Semitic post, Ackman, who is Jewish, stated that Musk did not exhibit any anti-Semitic intent. He supported Musk’s clarification during the interview that Jews often support oppressed groups due to their history.\n> \n> “And he [Musk] is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination,” he added.\n> \n> Ackman expressed gratitude for X’s insulation from external influence. ” “Earth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence,” he said.\n> \n> However, he suggested that a “carefully governed trust” could be a more suitable long-term owner.\n> \n> While Musk thanked Ackman for his support, X is expected to incur losses of $75 million in advertising revenue by year-end due to the suspension of ads by some advertisers, according to a New York Times report.\n\nhttps://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bill-ackman-jumps-to-musks-defense-over-antisemitism-controversy-pledges-to-stay-invested-in-x-earth-is-fortunate-3255625\n\n> But Peltz’s effort does have its share of supporters. Bill Ackman, the influential hedge fund manager and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, was seen at the Dealbook Summit carefully listening to Iger, Elon Musk and other interviewees. Iger’s remarks about Disney pulling its ads from Musk’s X (Twitter) seemed particularly troubling to Ackman, who has expressed disapproval of “Disney [caving] to public pressure” regarding X while investing heavily in TikTok.\n> \n> “If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing,” Ackman wrote on X. “Meanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse. I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board.”\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ike-perlmutter-bob-iger-nelson-peltz-disney-activist-fight-1235715097/\n\nIt's obvious that literally every single Disney investors/shareholder are supporting Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora while BlackWells Capital is barging in as well:\n\n> **Disney Inks Deal With ValueAct While Blackwells Capital Nominates Board Candidates Amid Peltz Proxy Battle**\n> \n> Disney and CEO Bob Iger secured new support from activist investor ValueAct Capital in the company’s proxy fight with Nelson Peltz.\n> \n> The Mouse House also got an unsolicited vote of confidence, in a roundabout way, from Blackwells Capital, which said it is nominating three candidates to the board to rival those picked by Peltz’s Trian Fund Management in a looming proxy fight — although Blackwells called the media company’s agreement with ValueAct “a disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything.”\n> \n> Disney on Tuesday announced an “information sharing” deal with ValueAct, an investor in Disney, which ensures the investment firm will support the company’s recommended slate of nominees for election to the Disney board at the 2024 annual meeting. Under Disney’s confidentiality agreement with ValueAct, the media conglomerate will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on “strategic matters,” including through meetings with the Disney board and management.\n> \n> Separately, Blackwells Capital, another Disney shareholder, announced that it will nominate three candidates — Jessica Schell, a former Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal exec; Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatkoff; and TaskRabbit founder Leah Solivan — for election to the board of directors of Disney, which is expected to be held this spring. In announcing the trio of candidates, Blackwells slammed “Peltz’s reprise of a contrived campaign that is disconnected from the needs of Disney stakeholders.”\n> \n> Disney confirmed that Blackwells Capital provided notice of its intent to nominate the three individuals for election to the company’s board at the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders. Disney said the board’s governance and nominating committee “will review the proposed Blackwells nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process.”\n> \n> In late November, Peltz renewed his proxy battle with Iger and the company’s board and announced plans to nominate two directors. That came after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors.\n> \n> Peltz’s Trian hedge fund subsequently announced it would nominate Peltz and former Disney CFO James Rasulo as candidates for directors of the Disney board at the annual shareholders meeting. Trian controls about $3 billion worth of Disney’s shares, 78% of which are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter (whom Disney alleges has a “longstanding personal agenda” against Iger).\n> \n> Jason Aintabi, Blackwells’ chief investment officer, said in a statement, “We call on Mr. Peltz to end his peacocking so that Disney can focus on its bright future, and not be dragged backward in time. Disney’s current leadership is invaluable to its shareholders, and our three exceptional candidates are being nominated along with a business proposal specifying that any incumbent director outvoted by Blackwells’ nominees be immediately added back to the board following the 2024 Annual Meeting.”\n> \n> Blackwells’ campaign “provides shareholders a necessary alternative to what would otherwise be a solipsistic sideshow,” Aintabi added. Blackwells owns about $5 million worth of Disney shares.\n> \n> At the same time, Aintabi called Disney’s agreement with ValueAct “a disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything. Bringing all shareholders a real and better choice for directors is the necessary act that will support the future success of Disney.”\n> \n> In response to the Blackwells announcement, a rep for Trian said in a statement, “Trian welcomes other shareholders attempting to help fix this iconic but wayward company. We believe long-suffering Disney shareholders need Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo as independent voices and catalysts for much-needed change on what’s been a chronically underperforming board.”\n> \n> To that, Blackwells’ Aintabi responded, “We are gratified that Trian sees the merit in Blackwells nominees given they are independent, have the relevant experience and present themselves without an agenda. Our view remains that Disney shareholders do not need Nelson Peltz or Jay Rasulo on the board; if anyone is needed it’s the Blackwells’ nominees.”\n> \n> ValueAct, in announcing its agreement with the Disney board, touted its “extensive experience investing in media and technology companies navigating significant business transformations,” including Spotify, the New York Times, 21st Century Fox, Nintendo, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce.\n> \n> Iger said in a statement, “ValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we’ve had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders.”\n> \n> Morfit added: “Disney is the world’s leading entertainment company. It has the best intellectual property, sports brand, and parks and experiences assets in the industry. As legacy technologies transition to digital platforms, we believe Disney can lead the media industry forward. We could not be more excited to partner with Bob and the board to help create long-term sustainable shareholder value.”\n\nhttps://variety.com/2024/biz/global/disney-valueact-blackwells-nelson-peltz-board-1235860414/\n\n...and that's why Peltz/Perlmutter will easily take over Disney since they're the most beloved folks among Disney investors while ValueAct/Iger are the most despised. In fact, here are conclusive proofs of that:\n\n> **Bob Iger gets 'C' rating for Disney return: Analyst**\n> \n> Bob Iger's return to Disney (DIS) is one of Yahoo Finance's top stories of 2023. Since reclaiming the helm as CEO, Iger cut costs and restructured the business into three divisions —Entertainment; Parks, Experiences and Products; and ESPN —as he looks to make Disney's streaming business profitable.\n> \n> Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin, who covered the stock during Iger's first tenure as CEO, said she would give the media executive a 'C' for his first year back at Disney.\n> \n> “It's hard to see him stumble in the first year… but in fairness to him, mostly what he's been doing is reversing things Bob Chapek did the prior two years,” Martin told Yahoo Finance Live. “It’s unclear he's been able to move forward at all rather than undoing the one bad decision he made in leadership, which was to hand the reins to Bob Chapek.”\n> \n> Watch the video above to hear Martin discuss Iger's return, Peltz's battle for the board, and what the company could do to change her 'hold' rating on the stock.\n> \n> For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n> \n> https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cpi-report-oracle-slides-revenue-121057416.html\n> \n> Video Transcript\n> \n> And Laura, a near-term issues seems to be all of these activist battles. How should Bob Iger approach handling someone like Nelson Peltz, and perhaps others.\nLAURA MARTIN: So I think what's great for public shareholders about somebody like Nelson Peltz is when Bob Iger comes out and says, we're going to spend $60 billion on the theme park over 10 years, that might be great for him. But public shareholders care about this year and next year because they're going to be retired in 10 years.\n> \n> So I think what Nelson Peltz forces Bob Iger to do is justify the cost structure at the entertainment assets and the TV assets, compared to the revenue growth, which is single digits to negative. And it really forces him to cut costs. I think it's a primary reason they're going to cut a lot of content costs on the streaming side because they can't cut them on the sports side because their rights fees keep going up.\n> \n> So I think what Nelson Peltz does is force Bob Iger to, basically, fire more people, which unless he can grow the revenue faster on the, let's call it the core business, the traditional business, he needs to cut the overhead here.\n> \n> SEANA SMITH: So Laura, it sounds like, if I'm hearing you right, you think that maybe some of the changes that would be enacted by Nelson Peltz would actually better position Disney then for the future, and maybe make you a little bit more positive on the name.\n> \n> LAURA MARTIN: I would say that Nelson Peltz is far more short-term oriented than Bob Iger who's a business builder. And I think public shareholders are more aligned with that kind of time frame.\n> \n> BRAD SMITH: So with that considered, Laura, I mean, we've heard Disney talking about the thousands of acres of land that they could develop on, building out more of the parks, resorts experiences in other parts of the world. That still looks like money going out the door. So at what point do you think Disney is ultimately going to be able to deliver on this, and perhaps satisfy some of the investors?\n> \n> LAURA MARTIN: So I think this is a tale of two cities right now, meaning that the parks are really healthy. So I think Wall Street is supportive of investing money in the parks because the return on capital of money into the parks is going to be positive. But I do think the traditional, like ESPN linear business and the studios have had underwhelming results, meaning, when the market's giving them capital, they're not actually over delivering the cost of capital.\n> \n> So in order to do that, you have to cut costs. So I just think that the economics of the streaming/linear TV business are broken right now for the whole industry, not just for the Walt Disney Company, for the whole industry. So the industry needs to consolidate. It needs to rip out costs. It needs to spend less on content. And I think getting out of India is going to help Disney. They've announced that reliance. And Disney are in, I guess, a handshake deal right now. I think that's helpful. And I think, when they launch ESPN, the app, that's going to be helpful also.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/bob-iger-gets-c-rating-170938667.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JplnHuRu9I\n\nBy the way, we had these news so far:\n\n> **Nelson Peltz's Trian to seek at least three Disney board seats, sources say**\n> \n> Activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing ahead with plans to seek at least three board seats at Disney (DIS.N) as the firm is not satisfied with Disney CEO Bob Iger's changes, several people familiar with the matter said.\n> \n> During a conversation on Thursday morning with Iger, Disney extended an offer for Trian to meet with the company's board but rejected the activist shareholder's request for seats on a board that will soon have 12 members, Trian said in a statement.\n> \n> Trian, which owns roughly $3 billion worth of Disney stock, said it \"intends to take (its) case for change directly to shareholders,\" signaling it will proceed to a second proxy fight and nominate director candidates when the window for nominations opens early next month.\n> \n> \"Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney's CEO is acknowledging that the company's challenges are greater than previously believed,\" Trian said in the statement.\n> Shares in Disney, which has a market capitalization of $169 billion, are down 16% since Feb 9, when Peltz withdrew from his campaign to gain a board seat.\n> \n> Investor enthusiasm lifted Disney stock 20% in the two-and-a-half months after Iger's return in November 2022 but lost most of the gains this year, closing on Thursday at $92.69 per share, less than a dollar higher than the price before Iger was brought back.\n> \n> **RESTRUCTURING, COST-CUTTING**\n> \n> Over the past 12 months, Disney has restructured the company and significantly reduced costs. It told investors earlier this month it is on track to achieve about $7.5 billion in cost savings – $2 billion more than its original target.\n> \n> Disney said it will work to make its streaming business profitable, build ESPN into the \"pre-eminent\" digital sports brand, improve the performance of its film studios and \"turbocharge\" growth at its theme parks, through $60 billion in investment over the next decade.\n> \n> Disney noted Peltz is allied with Isaac Perlmutter, a former Disney executive who was terminated earlier this year and has a \"longstanding personal agenda\" against Iger.\n> \n> The company said Perlmutter's agenda \"may be different than that of all other shareholders.\"\n> \n> Despite Iger's efforts and Thursday morning's phone call, positions appear to have hardened this week.\n> \n> Disney named soon-to-be-retiring Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman and veteran media executive and former group chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, to its board, a pre-emptive step companies targeted by activists often take.\n> \n> The men will join early next year and former Illumina (ILMN.O) chief, Francis deSouza, will leave.\n> \n> **SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT**\n> \n> Another investor, Blackwells Capital, issued a statement of support for Iger and his restructuring of the company, as well as for the two new board members, Gorman and Darroch.\n> \n> Blackwells said displacing these individuals with Peltz and other Trian nominees would deprive shareholders of \"valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company’s history.\"\n> \n> Trian said while the two new Disney directors did represent an improvement from the status quo, they \"would not restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction\".\n> \n> The Disney board on Thursday announced a cash dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on Jan. 10.\n> \n> Disney said it will recommend shareholders support its slate of nominees. Investors and industry analysts are already calling the presumed battle Disney 2.0, but they note it might be tougher this time for Peltz to win over other shareholders.\n> \n> Patrick Gadson, co-head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins which is not involved, said proxy advisers will assess how much change Disney has accomplished.\n> \n> \"If they’ve made significant progress,\" Gadson said of Disney, proxy advisers \"are more likely to allow for time to complete the transformation.\"\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/activist-investor-peltz-seeks-two-seats-disney-board-cnbc-2023-11-30/\n\n...and Disney announced these plans:\n\n> **Disney Reinstates Dividend, Amends Bylaws Amid Push By Nelson Peltz For Board Seat**\n> \n> Disney today announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the second half of its fiscal 2023, its first such payout since the dividend was halted three years ago during Covid.\n> \n> It will be payable January 10, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11. The company had said back in February that it planned to bring back the dividend this year.\n> \n> “This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth,” said Mark Parker, Chairman of the Board. “As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company’s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.”\n> \n> The dividend move comes as activist investor Nelson Peltz, backed by big Disney shareholder and former Marvel boss Ike Perlmutter, is seeking to join the board of the media giant — saying today he would bring the fight “directly to the shareholders” after Disney rejected his offer and named two new directors instead. This push by the founder of Trian Partners has led Disney to restate and amend its corporate bylaws that deal with outside candidates seeking board seats.\n> \n> Shareholders elect directors at a company’s annual meeting. Companies list their nominated directors in a proxy statement ahead of the gathering and provide shareholders with a list of the names on proxy cards. Stockholders can also present other, outside candidates for director, not endorsed by the company, as Peltz says he intends to do. It’s not clear how many board seats he is gunning for. Disney’s fiscal year ends in September and its annual meeting is usually in sometime March. It was held a bit later this year, on April 3, as the company battled Peltz for the first time in the early part of the year. He withdrew from the fight in February, before the meeting. Prior to that, he had set up a dedicated website called Restore the Magic that detailed what he saw as Disney’s failings. Not clear yet what he’ll do this time around. Disney said earlier today that Perlmutter has a “longstanding personal agenda” against Iger.\n> \n> The amendments laid out by Disney in an SEC filing today do the following:\n> \n> -“Address recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the Board’s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the Company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met.”\n> \n> This SEC rule from last year (14a-19) requires all parties use a “universal” proxy card that lists all director nominees presented by both management and shareholders for election at the annual meeting. It was meant to make it easier to get outside shareholders candidates on the ballot so some companies (not just Disney) have been amending their bylaws to make it not quite so easy,\n> \n> -“Require that any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.” The white card is typically used by management.\n> \n> -“Enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to…director nominations made by stockholders, including by requiring: certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder’s solicitation of proxies; and any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the Company’s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.”\n\nhttps://deadline.com/2023/11/disney-reinstates-dividend-amends-bylaws-nelson-peltz-board-seat-1235644175/\n\n> **Disney Board Adopts New Rules for Nominating Directors in Wake of Nelson Peltz’s Announced Proxy Fight**\n> \n> Company also announces first cash dividend for shareholders in more than three years\n> \n> The same day activist investor Nelson Peltz announced he was launching a proxy campaign to get seats on Disney’s board of directors, the company adopted amended bylaws covering nominations of directors by outside parties.\n> \n> Meanwhile, in a bid to win shareholder favor amid the brewing proxy battle, Disney separately Thursday announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable Jan. 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 11, 2023. It’s the company’s first dividend payments to investors in more than three years, after Disney suspended them during the COVID pandemic.\n> \n> On Nov. 30, Disney’s board “amended and restated” the company’s bylaws, which became effective as of Thursday, the company said in an SEC filing Thursday.\n> \n> Among other things, the amendments “enhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to business proposals submitted and director nominations made by stockholders,” Disney said in the filing. That includes requiring “certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder’s solicitation of proxies” and that “any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the company’s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.”\n> \n> In addition, Disney’s revised bylaws “address recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the board’s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met,” Disney said.\n> \n> The SEC’s Rule 14a-19, which went into effect for shareholder meetings involving contested director elections held after Aug. 31, 2022, establish new notice and filing requirements for all soliciting parties, as well as formatting and presentation requirements for universal proxy cards. In addition, the rules require shareholders presenting their own director candidates in the contest to solicit holders of a minimum of 67% of the voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election.\n> \n> Disney’s new bylaws also require that “any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.”\n> \n> The announced intention by Peltz’s Trian Fund Management to launch a proxy fight to get its directors on the board comes a day after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors, with terms starting in early 2024.\n> \n> Peltz’s Trian, which controls about $3 billion in Disney stock, issued a statement Thursday that after the Disney board rejected Trian’s request for board seats, including one for Peltz, the hedge fund will “take our case for change directly to shareholders.”\n> \n> In response, Disney noted that 78% of the shares claimed to be beneficially owned by Trian are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter. Disney said Perlmutter “was terminated from his employment by Disney earlier this year and has voiced his longstanding personal agenda against Disney’s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which may be different than that of all other shareholders.” Perlmutter did not immediately have any comment, his rep said.\n> \n> On Thursday, investment management company Blackwells Capital, a Disney shareholder since 2018, weighed in on the drama by issuing a statement of support for Iger’s leadership of the company and the board appointments of Gorman and Darroch. “Displacing these individuals or other members of the board with Mr. Peltz and other Trian-selected nominees would deprive shareholders of valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company’s history,” Blackwells said. “Blackwells is concerned that Trian’s campaign prioritizes Mr. Peltz’s ego over what is best for all Disney shareholders, and that its latest effort may cost Disney shareholders upwards of $50 million and serve only as a value destructive fog for Disney’s leadership and board.”\n> \n> Blackwells chief investment officer Jason Aintabi said in a statement, “Mindless, drum-beating activism is not the right strategy for shareholders. Disney’s board is acting in the best interests of all shareholders and should be allowed the time to focus on driving value at one of America’s most iconic companies without this fatuous sideshow.”\n> \n> Regarding the reinstatement of the dividend, Disney chairman Mark Parker said in a statement, “This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth. As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company’s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.”\n\nhttps://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-board-bylaws-nominating-directors-nelson-peltz-proxy-fight-1235815361/\n\nAnd when it comes to dividend, one guy is pointing this out:\n\n> they have about 1.8 billion shares outstanding, so it's roughly a $550 million payout. the last time they paid a dividend was 2019, and they paid out $0.88 per share; roughly 3x as much.\n> \n> just to put in perspective, disney is going to lose about $500 million in november alone from the marvels and wish flops.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/187u045/disney_brings_back_its_dividend_after_threeyear/kbh01np/\n\nAll of these are 100% conclusive proofs that Iger knows that he will lose the proxy war for certain and will be ousted and get replaced by Peltz and/or Perlmutter as the next CEO, especially since Iger is the most despised individual among every single Disney shareholders/investors while Peltz/Trian is/are the most beloved folks among every single Disney shareholders/investors. Those who claim that Peltz/Perlmutter can't become Disney CEOs themselves, they will become Disney CEOs because they will fire every single Disney board members and replace them entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter's goons. How? By bringing in a puppet CEO whom they will control very easily:\n\n> Pelz is gonna handpick your buddy Igers replacement very soon. No more pandering anymore, enjoy.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kceom7n/\n\n> I said pick the replacement, doubt they will run it themselves (at least not for long) but it’ll prevent some Iger loyalist hack\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kcep6v5/\n\n> Highly doubt Chapek would come back, and Iger’s words are meaningless at this point. Probably will be pull someone cutthroat that will stop employees from dictating the company, maybe a video game executive or something\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kceuqx9/\n\nOnce they make a video game executive their puppet CEO, all of these will happen overnight and they will become the majority Disney shareholder or even own every single Disney shares.\n\nThe problem is, Peltz has a history of completely hacking off General Electric until there was nothing left and Perlmutter has a history of saying this:\n\n> If Disney's stock price keeps falling, Iger also has to worry about agitating more investors.\n> \n> Iger is already tangling with ex-Marvel exec Ike Perlmutter, one of Disney's biggest individual shareholders, who has joined activist investor Peltz's fight to try to improve Disney's results by getting a bigger say over its strategy and operations.\n> \n> **Perlmutter has told people he wants to break up Disney as much as he can and gain control of some of the IP, and \"people underestimate Ike at their peril,\" said a source familiar with Perlmutter's conversations.**\n> \n> Disney's largely liberal stance on hot-button social issues could bring out other activist investors with political as well as financial motivations, like Paul Singer of Elliott Investment Management, a big GOP donor. There are people who \"would love to take down the 'woke' company,\" the source added.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/bob-iger-ceo-disney-return-insiders-anxious-losing-faith-2023-11\n\n...which is why all of these will happen soon after 2023:\n\n1. Bob Iger, Pete Docter, Kevin Feige, Jennifer Lee, and Kathleen Kennedy will get fired immediately and Peltz/Perlmutter will become co-CEOs of Disney while the entire Disney board will be replaced with Trian members and Perlmutter's minions while Docter, Feige, and Lee will respectively be replaced by John Kricfalusi, Ethan Van Sciver, and Chris Savino.\n\n2. Literally every single upcoming Disney releases including **Kingdomf of the Planet of the Apes**, **Inside Out 2**, **Deadpool 3**, **Elio**, and **Avatar 3** will be completely scrapped for tax write-offs.\n\n3. Pixar will be sold to Sony (which then will be shut down entirely), Walt Disney Animation Studios will be sold to Comcast (which then will be shut down entirely), Lucasfilm and 20th Century Studios will be sold to The Daily Wire, and Marvel will be kept by Perlmutter himself.\n\n4. Kevin Feige, Pete Docter, and Jennifer Lee will be completely blacklisted from Hollywood by Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora for spreading \"woke and pedophilic agenda\" to children. Feige and Docter will flee to Japan where the former will become a producer of **Godzilla** films and other Toho monster films while the latter will become a full-time animator at Studio Ghibli. Lee, on the other hand, will never be heard from ever again. Ironically, Kathleen Kennedy will be spared due to her status as a veteran producer.\n\n5. Every single Disney theme parks will be demolished to make ways for something else. In places of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, state prisons will be built, in place of Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Resort California, Russian propaganda centers will be built to improve the reputation of Russia, and in place of Tokyo Disney Resort, hentai clubs will be built. As for Walt Disney World, once it's demolished, one half of it will be replaced with hentai clubs that also perform conversion therapy while the other half will be replaced with state prisons as Ron DeSantis always wanted. All Disney stores will be shut down immediately and give ways to anime stores instead.\n\nIt should also be remembered that far-right bullshitters on YouTube praised David Zaslav when he scrapped **Batgirl** because they perceived it as him waging war against \"woke garbages\". Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora will do the same thing for the entire upcoming Disney releases to appease those same far-right bullshitters and spite Iger/Feige and no one will be able to stop them since they will have the total control of Disney and its boards, meaning that they can just ignore shareholders even if they don't like any of those decisions that they pull off. Rermember, Peltz/Perlmutter would be CEOs and the board would be filled entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter's goons.\n\nI advise you all to read everything here carefully before making any rebuttals.\n\nP.S.

It primarily discusses the involvement of activist investors like Nelson Peltz, Ancora Holdings, and others in a proxy battle for board seats and influence at Disney. The text also mentions the concerns and strategies of Disney's current CEO, Bob Iger, and the company's response to these investor actions. It suggests a significant shareholder support for Peltz and his allies, as well as a criticism of Iger's leadership and Disney's recent performance.  \n>  \n>**Assessment of Validity:**\n\n1. **Complete Takeover by Peltz/Perlmutter/Ancora/Ackman**: The claim that these investors will completely take over Disney and become the majority shareholders or own all shares is speculative and lacks concrete evidence. Corporate takeovers, especially of a company as large and complex as Disney, involve numerous legal, financial, and regulatory hurdles. It's also important to note that shareholder support can be fluid and influenced by various factors, not just investor activism.\n2. **Criticism of Disney's Performance and Leadership**: The text reflects a valid critique of Disney's recent performance and decisions, particularly under Bob Chapek's leadership. However, it's worth noting that corporate governance and strategy are complex, and different stakeholders might have varied perspectives on what's best for the company.\n3. **Dramatic Changes Predicted**: The text's predictions, such as the firing of top executives, scrapping of major projects, selling off major studios, and radical changes to theme parks, are extreme and should be approached with skepticism. While activist investors can influence corporate strategy, such radical changes seem improbable and are not typically how corporate governance unfolds, even in contentious situations.\n4. **Peltz and Perlmutter's Alleged Intentions**: The claim that Peltz and Perlmutter intend to break up Disney or take control of its intellectual property is a significant assertion that would require more concrete evidence to be deemed credible.\n5. **Feasibility of the Predicted Outcomes**: Many of the outcomes predicted in the text, like the replacement of key personnel and the selling off of major divisions, seem implausible and overly dramatic in the context of normal corporate operations and governance.\n\n>In summary, while the text raises legitimate points about shareholder activism and criticism of Disney's leadership, many of its claims and predictions are speculative and not supported by solid evidence. The actual outcome of the proxy battle and its impact on Disney will likely be more nuanced and less extreme than the text suggests.", "score": 37, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think you should have just meant to be rude", "score": 52, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yep, bet the mental health pro will do the same as most of us, read the first three lines, then scroll down into cringe.", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did you read the entire thing?

Your assertion is that these investors, especially Peltz and Perlmutter, are gaining significant support from Disney's shareholders and are poised to take control of the company.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. Investment firms like Ancora and individuals like Bill Ackman are aligning with Peltz and Perlmutter in their efforts to gain board seats at Disney.\n2.

Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect. I think he is entirely correct that he and @X are treated unfairly and inconsistently by advertisers. \n> \n> @tiktok_us @instagram @facebook and others have enormous amounts of problematic content, antisemitic and otherwise, but the advertisers don’t boycott those platforms. \n> \n> Musk is targeted because the other media organizations view @X as a competitor and any time his name is in an article about controversies, it draws clicks. MSM is incentivized to attack him as it actually drives attention to their sites and therefore more revenues. It is these attack articles by other media organizations that put pressure on the @Disney’s of the world to stop advertising on X. \n> \n> If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing. Meanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse.  I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board. \n> \n> X presents the opportunity for advertisers to access an incredible global audience that is not available elsewhere. And it is cheap compared to other alternatives because of current circumstances.  \n> \n> On Musk and antisemitism:\n> \n> After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent when he responded with the ‘actual truth’ tweet, and further clarified thereafter. \n> \n> I thought he made what he meant extremely clear in the @andrewrsorkin interview, namely, that Jews are drawn to support ‘oppressed’ groups and causes through various non-profits due to our history of being an oppressed minority. \n> \n> Musk points out correctly that a number of these organizations and their members support Hamas. And he is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination. \n> \n> Many Jews are doing that right now. \n> \n> To use a Muskism, Earth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence.  That said, perhaps some form of very carefully governed trust would be a better forever owner than any individual. \n> \n> @PershingSqFdn invested in the Twitter privatization in support of free speech. Whether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest. \n> \n> I am more inclined to like and support companies that advertise on the platform because I appreciate their support for free speech. I have actually bought products I learned about from ads on @X. I can’t think of another example of my responding to direct advertising other than on X. \n> \n> Unfortunately, recent (and society’s long-term experience) with non-profit governance, see @OpenAI\n, certain private universities etc. should not give anyone confidence that a traditional non-profit would be a better owner of X than Musk. \n> \n> Perhaps some day the ownership of X should be distributed to each American, one share for each American during their lives and one for each person born, with a charter which permanently vests the free speech principles by which it operates. \n> \n> Until then, we all should be grateful that X is owned by Musk.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/billackman/status/1730442461644730553?s=46&t=heuN3aUb-lI7mK8tmq9uxw\n\nAlso, Elon Musk is calling Bob Iger to get fired immediately, essentially joining forces with Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter:\n\n> **Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, saying he should be 'fired immediately'**\n>\n> 1. Elon Musk is attacking yet another advertiser that has left X: Disney.\n> \n> 2. He pounced on news that New Mexico sued Meta over allegations it didn't shut down child exploitation.\n> \n> 3.

The media giant, long known to be a box-office monster, has suffered a number of disappointments in recent years. In an effort to restrategize, Iger will cut back on movies and other new content to better the company’s financial standing, as it looks to cut billions of dollars in costs and make its streaming business profitable.\n> \n> Disney has said the proxy fight is apparently in part due to a personal grudge held by Peltz’s ally and former Marvel boss Ike Perlmutter. Trian has oversight of shares owned by Perlmutter, who has been an outspoken critic of Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n> \n> The fight launched by Trian last month came the morning after Disney appointed Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky TV boss Jeremy Darroch to its board, in what appeared to be a move to temper Trian’s discontent.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/trian-nominates-peltz-and-former-disney-exec-to-media-giants-board.html\n\n> **In Disney Board Fight, Nelson Peltz Will Nominate Himself and Ex-Disney CFO Jay Rasulo as Director Candidates**\n> \n> Activist investor Nelson Peltz, who’s looking to shake up Disney‘s board, plans to nominate two directors as candidates for directors of the Mouse House’s board: Peltz himself, and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.\n> \n> Peltz’s Trian Fund Management said Thursday it submitted a notice of its intention to nominate the two independent director candidates at Disney’s 2024 annual shareholders meeting, expected to be held next spring.\n> \n> “Disney is one of the most iconic companies in the world with unrivaled scale, unparalleled customer loyalty, irreplaceable intellectual property (IP) and an enviable commercial flywheel. However, Disney has woefully underperformed its peers and its potential,” Trian said in a statement.\n> \n> Disney confirmed that Trian provided notice of its intent to nominate Peltz and Rasulo as directors. The company said the board’s governance and nominating committee, which evaluates director nominations, “will review the proposed Trian nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process.”\n> \n> Responding to Trian, Disney said the company “has an experienced, diverse and highly qualified board that is focused on the long-term performance of the company, strategic growth initiatives including the ongoing transformation of its businesses, the succession planning process, and increasing shareholder value.”\n> \n> Last month, Peltz’s Trian Fund Management renewed its proxy fight to get its directors on the Disney board. That came a day after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors, with terms starting in early 2024. Trian, which controls about $3 billion in Disney stock, said that after the media conglomerate’s board rejected its request for board seats that it would “take our case for change directly to shareholders.”\n> \n> In a response Nov. 30, Disney noted that 78% of the shares claimed to be beneficially owned by Trian are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter. Disney said Perlmutter “was terminated from his employment by Disney earlier this year and has voiced his longstanding personal agenda against Disney’s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which may be different than that of all other shareholders.”\n> \n> Rasulo, who served as Disney’s CFO from 2010-15, said in a statement provided by Trian, “The Disney I know and love has lost its way. As independent voices in the boardroom, Nelson and I are confident that the combination of my decades of experience at Disney, Nelson’s significant boardroom skills and history of driving positive strategic change, and our combined consumer brands expertise and financial acumen, will be additive to the Disney board. With a shareholder mandate, Nelson and I look forward to helping the board and management reorient the company towards delighting its consumers again and driving significant value for its owners.”\n> \n> Before being appointed CFO, Rasulo was chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide from 2005-09 and president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts from 2002-05. When Rasulo left the company in 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger praised his “strategic acumen and savvy insight” and said the exec had been “a vital contributor to Disney’s success.”\n> \n> Peltz asserts that Disney stock has underperformed its media-industry peers and the broader market over the last decade — and even before that, shares languished since Iger was first appointed CEO in 2005. Trian claims “Disney shareholders were once over $200 billion wealthier than they are now,” referencing the cumulative market value lost between Disney’s all-time high closing stock price on March 8, 2021 and Oct. 6.\n> \n> “Mr. Iger has sold the vast majority of his ownership stake built up primarily through share-based compensation — more than $1 billion of Disney stock – leaving shareholders alone to face the daunting reality of a complex turnaround in a rapidly evolving industry,” Trian said in its Dec. 14 statement.\n> \n> Key problems for Disney, according to Trian, are that Wall Street consensus earnings-per-share estimates for the company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2025 have “fallen meaningfully, even as the company claims to be cutting billions of costs,” while “studio content continues to disappoint consumers, slowing the speed of the flywheel and threatening future earnings growth.”\n> \n> Trian continued, “The root cause of Disney’s underperformance, in our view, is a board that is too closely connected to a long-tenured CEO and too disconnected from shareholders’ interests.”\n> \n> “To resolve the malaise and crisis of confidence among Disney shareholders, the Board needs fresh perspectives from truly independent directors selected by the shareholders themselves,” Peltz said in Trian’s announcement Thursday. “Jay and I have the strategic, operating, financial and governance expertise to help Disney and are committed to working with the other members of the Board and management team to address the fundamental issues underlying the Company’s continued poor performance. There is much that can be done to revive Disney and restore the confidence of Disney shareholders, and Trian looks forward to discussing these opportunities with our fellow shareholders over the coming months.”\n> \n> On Nov. 30, the day Peltz announced the proxy fight, Disney adopted new bylaws covering the nomination of directors, apparently in part to require Peltz to disclose details of Perlmutter’s involvement in the proxy fight. And, seeking to woo shareholders amid the brewing battle, Disney announced its first cash dividend payments to investors in more than three years.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-board-nelson-peltz-nominates-jay-rasulo-1235838088/", "score": -11, "replies": [{"body": "> **Bob Iger Prepares for Ike’s Pirate Ship to Fire at Disney**\n> \n> As ousted Marvel mogul Ike Perlmutter and activist investor Nelson Peltz enlist former Disney exec Jay Rasulo in their quest to reshape the studio, the CEO faces a somewhat more credible challenge to his reign.\n> \n> “You broke my heart.”\n> \n> That’s what former Marvel Entertainment chairman and CEO Ike Perlmutter said to Bob Iger, according to The Wall Street Journal, when Iger made it clear in 2015 that he was not going to name veteran Disney executive and Perlmutter favorite Jay Rasulo as his eventual successor. (He anointed Tom Staggs instead, and Staggs was out the following year. Being a potential successor was hazardous duty at Disney, at least in those days.)\n> \n> Iger’s relationship with Perlmutter went sharply downhill from there and last March, after incrementally stripping Perlmutter of his duties at Marvel, Iger ejected the contentious billionaire from the company altogether. Even before that happened, Perlmutter had backed his friend and Palm Beach neighbor, Nelson Peltz, in his quest for a seat on Disney’s board, which Peltz and Perlmutter argue is too cozy with Iger to be effective.\n> \n> Peltz dropped that first run at Disney after Iger pledged to slash costs and lay off thousands of employees. But with Disney stock still languishing, Peltz and Perlmutter are back, having added Rasulo to the team. The goal is to get board seats for both Peltz and Rasulo and — one must suspect — eventually to install Rasulo in the CEO job that eluded him years ago. Presented with Peltz’s first run at the company, it would seem very possible that shareholders would dismiss him and Perlmutter as two 81-year-olds driven by Perlmutter’s quest for revenge.\n> \n> But with Rasulo on board, they’ve added a respected longtime Disney executive. Rasulo had largely disappeared from the public eye, serving on various boards including iHeartMedia and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. In a Dec. 14 statement announcing his alliance with Peltz and Perlmutter, Rasulo said, “The Disney I know and love has lost its way.”\n> \n> Says one Disney veteran, “Jay has credibility. He’s not some Palm Beach crank. He’s a very legitimate voice about where Disney was eight years ago. Ike is angry and eating three nights a week at Mar-a-Lago but Jay showing up on that side is a very significant event.”\n> \n> Iger appears to be taking the challenge seriously, enlisting reinforcements of his own: On Jan. 3, Disney secured support from the Mason Morfit-led investment fund ValueAct Capital Management, which has agreed to back its board of director nominees as part of a strategic consulting deal. Meanwhile, shareholder and investment firm Blackwells Capital LLC may be a wild card in the mix. While a Blackwells exec stated Wednesday that Peltz should “end his peacocking,” in a nod to backing Iger, the firm also plans to nominate its own board members — Jessica Schell, Craig Hatkoff and Leah Solivan — something that holds no appeal for Disney.\n> \n> The question for Disney shareholders is whether they are antsy enough at this point to take a chance on the more credible Perlmutter-backed dissidents, whose talk of love and broken hearts is at odds with their cold-blooded reputations. Peltz is an activist investor who has swooped in on a broad assortment of companies that were seen as undervalued. Perlmutter is a controversy magnet with a well-established reputation for squeezing a dollar until it begs for mercy.\n> \n> Rasulo was just the sort of tough executive Perlmutter would favor: One Disney veteran describes him as effective but also as “sort of a blunt instrument” as he made tough budget cuts and sometimes referred to other executives as “children playing at business.” A Disney insider rolls his eyes at Rasulo’s claim that he is jumping into the fray out of love for the company. “If that was really his motive he wouldn’t try to engage in a fight along with Nelson frigging Peltz and Ike Perlmutter,” he says. “Ike wants retribution and Peltz wants a fast buck. They don’t give a shit about the company.”\n> \n> Perlmutter’s longtime attorney, John Turitzin, bristles at that. “It’s an absurd suggestion to make,” he says. “[Perlmutter] has got, I don’t know how many billions of dollars tied up in Disney. He’s not going to [play] a revenge game with the majority of his personal wealth.” (Perlmutter became one of Disney’s largest individual shareholders when he sold Marvel to Disney for $4 billion in 2009. Turitzin says he has never sold a share.)\n> \n> Perlmutter is very much a self-made man who was never a natural fit at Disney, which has always tried to front executives who present a friendly face to the public. Before Disney and the other legacy entertainment companies were engulfed in troubles, Iger was the smooth, deft embodiment of that idea. For most of that time, Perlmutter presented no face at all: Photographs of him were all but nonexistent until Donald Trump appointed him as an adviser on veterans affairs. (That led to a ProPublica investigation and an allegation from House Democrats that Perlmutter and two other Mar-a-Lago associates had illegally tried to influence government officials “to further their own personal interests.” At one point Veterans Administration officials, ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange during an event to promote suicide-prevention, were startled when Captain America turned up beside them on the podium as Spider-Man waved from the trading floor below.)\n> \n> For years, Perlmutter made waves at Disney, in part because of thrift that was extreme to the point of fishing paperclips out of waste-paper baskets. And there was more. In 2012, Financial Times reported that he had driven several executives out of Disney’s consumer products division, including the chairman of the highly profitable unit, and three African American women who sought financial settlements. Another woman was moved to a different division after alleging that Perlmutter had threatened her, saying he had a bullet with her name on it. Both Disney and Perlmutter declined to comment at the time. (Perlmutter, known to carry a gun, was named in a 2018 bribery trial when former NYPD Sgt. David Villanueva testified that he had helped expedite the renewal of Perlmutter’s gun license.)\n> \n> When Marvel replaced Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle in the 2010 Iron Man sequel, Perlmutter was reported to have told a Disney executive that the move saved money and no one would notice because Black people look the same. Turitzin says Perlmutter has told him that he never made that comment.\n> \n> In his memoir, Iger wrote that Perlmutter had stood in the way of two of Marvel’s groundbreaking films. “I called Ike and told him to tell his team to stop putting up roadblocks and ordered that we put both Black Panther and Captain Marvel into production,” Iger wrote. At that point, Marvel’s Kevin Feige was said to be on the brink of leaving the company. Perlmutter’s attorney Turitzin says the mogul resisted Black Panther, which was the first to go into production, “not because [he was] racist but because it had never been done before” and its success wasn’t guaranteed.\n> \n> In the year since Iger returned as CEO, Disney has faced numerous well-documented challenges: losses at the streamer (which Iger has pledged will be profitable in 2024), a faltering performance from animated films, a Marvel slump and more. Above all, the stock is still stalled. Major institutional shareholders are waiting to see what specific proposals the Peltz triumvirate will present in the weeks ahead, before Disney’s still-unscheduled annual meeting.\n> \n> With the company’s array of problems that don’t lend themselves to quick fixes, will shareholders be drawn to Peltz’s pitch? One longtime Disney exec thinks Rasulo will make all the difference. “It’s going to be a long, cold winter at Disney and these guys are going to make the most of it,” he says. “They’re going to go for it and they’re going to get something.”\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/bob-iger-ike-perlmutter-jay-rasulo-fight-disney-1235777572/\n\nAll of these mean that every single Disney investors/shareholders aside from ValueAct are now supporting Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter after Jay Rasulo got nominated as a board member, which is proven by Disney's rising stock value.", "score": -9, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH… Positions or ban", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Positions or ban", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "tl;dr?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did anyone read all this???

Granted, the source is Inside the Magic, but still:\n\n> **For Sale? Elon Musk Has the Ultimate Power Move To Get Even With Bob Iger**\n> \n> As the war against The Walt Disney Company rages on, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk could play a massive power move and worm his way into the House of Mouse.\n> \n> Over the last few years, Disney has come under fire from outsiders, claiming the company to be heading in a dangerous direction when it comes to its content. As the company strives to be as diverse and inclusive as possible, many fans of the once untouchable entertainment giant have declared this direction as a “woke agenda.”\n> \n> From a same-sex kiss in Pixar’s Lightyear (2022) to the studio’s first-ever openly gay teen in Strange World (2022), the casting of Black actress Halle Bailey as Ariel in The Little Mermaid (2023) and rumored appointment of a person of color to play Hercules in the future, Disney’s efforts are loud and clear. So loud that the phrase “go woke, go broke” has been circulating online for a while now.\n> \n> And the box office failings and supposed lack of content direction have also caught the attention of numerous key players in the wider business world. There is Nelson Peltz, who is battling for a place on the Mouse House’s board after Disney’s multiyear stock low in 2023. This is the second proxy battle against Disney; Peltz ended his first attempt following the company’s severe cost-cutting measures, led by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, but reignited the attack late last year. Trian Fund Management’s Peltz is also being supported by two former Disney executives, Ike Perlmutter and Jay Rasulo, in his bid for a seat on the board.\n> \n> **Disney and Elon Musk**\n> \n> But perhaps even noisier than Nelson Peltz is Tesla and X owner Elon Musk. Musk has been extremely vocal in his attacks on The Walt Disney Company. Disney pulled advertisements from X (formerly Twitter) following Musk’s promotion of an anti-semitic conspiracy theory on the social platform, with Musk later telling Bob Iger to “go f*** himself” at the New York Times Dealbook Summit they both attended in late 2023.\n> \n> Not long after his expletive-ridden tirade against the CEO, Musk continued his assault on X, writing, “He should be fired immediately. Walt Disney is turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.” The businessman then pulled Disney+, the Mouse’s streaming service, from his Tesla vehicles.\n> \n> In a fairly one-sided battle, one may assume that the feud between the two business giants will eventually die down, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. In a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk will now help fund a new fight against Disney–Gina Carano’s lawsuit. Once lined up to be part of the new wave of Star Wars, Gina Carano was fired from Lucasfilm in early 2021 following months of controversial social media posts and online interactions. The hammer fell on her time as Cara Dune after the actress and former MMA star seemingly compared being a Republican to being Jewish in the Holocaust. The incendiary comments that came amid the height of the pandemic also saw Carano’s talent agency, UTA, part ways with her.\n> \n> The lawsuit from Carano is based on wrongful termination and discrimination regarding her political views and is aimed at both Disney and its subsidiary, Lucasfilm, which creates Star Wars content. In her suit, funded by Musk’s X, Carano seeks that Lucasfilm recast her in the sci-fi franchise.\n> \n> “As a sign of X Corp’s commitment to free speech, we’re proud to provide financial support for Gina Carano’s lawsuit, empowering her to seek vindication of her free speech rights on X and the ability to work without bullying, harassment, or discrimination,” X’s Head of Business, Joe Benarroch, said in a statement, via The Hollywood Reporter.\n> \n> So, with Musk banging at the door, could the entrepreneur, like others, actually make a bid to take on Disney in a more brutal fashion? Well, part of one Disney theme park just went up for sale, and it could be Musk’s ticket into the Mickey Mouse palace.\n> \n> According to the Financial Times, U.S. activist fund Elliott Management is calling on Japan’s largest property group, Mitsui Fudosan, to launch a 1 trillion yen (approx. $6.8 billion) share buyback.\n> \n> “The report said Elliott also demanded the company sell down its $3.6 billion stake in Oriental Land, which runs Tokyo Disneyland, citing people familiar with the matter at both Elliott and Mitsui,” wrote CNBC. The outlet also stated that shares in The Oriental Land Company fell by 2.2%, with Mitsui currently owning a 5.4% stake, making it Oriental Land’s second-largest stakeholder.\n> \n> Tokyo Disney Resort is unusual in the way that Disney does not actually own the parks; Disney licenses The Oriental Land Company to operate the Disney parks in Tokyo. But with this part of the empire going up for sale, could Musk make a bid for it? Nothing the businessman does seems to make sense, so while there is only a small chance he’d infiltrate Disney this way, there is still a possibility that he would do this to get even with Iger. And it would cost him a fraction of the cost of Twitter.\n> \n> In fact, it was only earlier this week that some of Musk’s more ardent followers suggested he buy The Walt Disney Company. After posting Disney’s diversity and inclusion standards on X, with the caption, “An anonymous source just sent me this from Disney. It is mandatory, institutionalized racism and sexism!” Musk responded to a comment asking him to buy Disney and “fix it” with the thinking face emoji. Musk’s reply got just under 1 million views.\n> \n> This was just the latest chapter in the animosity the SpaceX co-founder holds for Disney. In December 2023, Musk tweeted that “Disney has a major content problem. Almost their entire upcoming slate is unwatchable. They are the world’s biggest example of go woke, go broke lol.”\n> \n> Iger isn’t the only business owner to be in the sights of Musk. When Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg launched Threads as an offshoot of Instagram and a direct competitor to X, Musk challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match, which the latter accepted. So far, this battle has yet to happen, but–as he said to his first wife, Justine, during their wedding dance–Musk is keen to be the “alpha” in all of his relationships.\n> \n> The Nelson Peltz and Elon Musk sagas began not long after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wore down Disney with its political attacks against the company. It all started when Disney opposed the HB 1557 bill, which became colloquially named the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, in 2022. What followed was a legal battle that dominated the political landscape of the Sunshine State and later that of the entire United States as Gov. DeSantis aimed to secure the Republican Party nomination for the 2024 Presidential Election.\n> \n> With The Walt Disney Company’s Q1 Earnings Call arriving later today, it will be interesting to see if Bob Iger addresses these noisy business developments. The saga unfolding around Disney may read like a Shakespearean tragedy (or comedy, depending on how you look at it), but with a legacy at stake, will Disney find the power to fend off those knocking at the gate and reignite trust across its century-wide fanbase?\n\nhttps://insidethemagic.net/2024/02/elon-musk-and-disney-bob-iger-sale-th1/", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}

They wanted that too. The thing was: the Boing 737 was a little lower to the ground than the corresponding Airbus, so a larger engine would not fit. \n\nThat meant that Boing had to change so much on the 737 that it would basically become a new airplane regulatory wise, and that would be expensive. They struggled for a while to fit the larger engine onto the 737 and eventually came up with a solution: mount it a little further in front of the wing. The airplane could stay the same and the 737 Max was born. \n\nMoving the engine further forward did have an impact: it caused the stability of the airplane to change. The 737 max would now push it's nose upwards. This was a change to the 737 that would mean pilots would need new training - and that is also expensive. \n\nSo what did Boing do? they kept this raising of the nose a secret and instead installed a computer system, that would make the pilots feel they were flying a normal 737. \n\nThe computer system MCAS would simply push down the nose, when the nose normally would push up. The MCAS would simply correct the pitch of the airplane without the knowledge of the pilots. \n\nWe know that the pilots onboard the 737 max of Ethiopean Airlines were struggeling to keep the nose up. We also know that the MCAS kept correcting the nose down. Eventually the MCAS won and the 737 max crashed straight into the ground nose first.

I fully see the potential in it, and how powerful continuous improvement can be due to the compounding interest effect.  Spending half an hour making an improvement that saves 15 seconds a day will, in 6 months or less, lead to more productivity! \n\nThe problem is that the directors/management seemed to have a very different view on what was important in Kaizen and cherry-picked the stuff they liked, omitting the parts they didn't like. They had me read a book on it by an author I don't remember, who seemed like he missed the forest for the trees. He pretty much outright wrote \"don't worry about feedback from your employees, change should be led from the top down\". The author even trimmed 5S down to 3S! The author also wrote that he had poor adoption of the system by his staff at his facility, which on one hand I get that people are naturally resistant to change, but I think it had more to do with his interpretation of Kaizen. His solution was to fire anyone who pushed back: around three quarters of his workforce.\n\nAnother frustration was that we were constantly told that we needed to make these continuous improvements, but were not given time, budget, or resources to make these changes. If production numbers were lower than the previous day because we spent half an hour making CI changes we would get reprimanded. If the KPIs dropped at all there would be an investigation. They wanted all of the benefits of continuous improvement without any of the investment.\n\nA final bit of frustration came from the fact that we were in pharmaceuticals which is of course a highly regulated industry. Tight regulations and heavy documentation on every process leads to a lot of inherent resistance to change. When making ANY change to the process flow requires multiple layers of review and quite a bit of paperwork, there's inherently a larger initial time investment required for any change. That's not to say that continuous improvement can't work, but you need to be smart about it. The payoff in time savings needs to be enough to justify the time cost of implementation, and you might need to be looking farther into the future for when your time investments start paying off. There's things you can do to help mitigate this like saving up a number of smaller changes and pushing them all through in one process review, but no matter how I tried to explain this to management they didn't get it. They instead instructed us to just make their changes without going through the necessary pathways which constantly got us in trouble with regulatory and quality control. \n\nSorry to bitch, I just feel like far too many people in manufacturing treat Kaizen and lean manufacturing as just another buzzword and \"adopt it\" without actually understanding the core principles.

Sure the sensors are small, but the change required due to balance issues lead to a change in the design of a ton of systems.\n\nThe reason Boeing got in trouble was due to trying to circumvent FAA regulations that required them to have the FAA do a full inspection of the new build and pilot training revamp.

The 737 max 8 was grounded worldwide and in order to be operable again it had to go through probably the toughest and most thorough recertification process from nearly every international aviation body to allow it to fly again. No government was going to take a risk on approving the plane without checking every inch. It’s perfectly safe now, and likely more safe than by other plane as it’s been tested more than other planes. \n\nAlso mcas had its issues, and problems with implementation. But in some context they were right about how it was to be used. Properly trained pilots were to respond to mcas in the same way as another issue and they threw the same error. So any properly trained pilot should have been able to resolve the stall no problem (this is why you didn’t see this happen in US or Europe). Boeings biggest fault is not having a redundancy in the sensor, which is definitely bad. \n\n“A380 has never had an airframe loss and zero fatalities” \n\nI really hope that I don’t have to explain why comparing to completely different airplanes makes zero sense. A380 is a 4 engine plane used sparringly by airlines because most airports can’t even fit the thing. It flies many times fewer legs, there are fewer of them out there and are no longer being built, and you’re comparing it to one of the workhorse airplanes that run nonstop all day. \n\nComparing an airplane hitting another airplane on the runway again makes zero sense. Do you really believe it held up cause it was an airbus? A Boeing would have done the same. That is not at all comparable to a real plane crash by losing control mid air, I’m surprised I have to say that. \n\nIf you want to stop flying because of a specific plane being used then that’s fine, your choice. But I can also say it makes zero sense when you look at the data. Check how many US commercial flights deaths there have been in the last decade and understand that Boeing has been flying like half of those flights, up to 50k (total) a day, and has been essentially incident/death free.

And yet it’s verbatim what the Labor Department asks in its Consumer Expenditure Survey, which in turn plays a huge role in calculating relative weightings in the crucial U.S. consumer price index. That’s because CPI considers housing as an investment good and not something that’s consumed (that would be shelter, “the service that housing units provide”). But economists can’t just ignore it altogether, so they attempt to get around this distinction by coming up with what’s known as “owners’ equivalent rent,” informed by responses to that one question.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Americans are slower to adjust their expectations for a hypothetical rental price of their home than the housing market is to react to dynamic changes in supply and demand. Owners’ equivalent rent increased 2% in April from a year earlier, according to Wednesday’s CPI report, little changed from the prior three months and close to the slowest annual growth since 2012. By contrast, data from the National Association of Realtors this week showed that the median price for a single-family home in the U.S. rose 16.2% in the first quarter from the same period in 2020, the most on record and in line with just about every measure of the housing market. This kind of wide discrepancy, unseen since the mid-2000s housing bubble, could have significant consequences for reported inflation statistics and monetary policy in the world’s largest economy.\n\nHousing is a big part of overall measured inflation. Owners’ equivalent rent makes up one-fourth of CPI on its own, according to the Labor Department’s latest relative importance of components data, a larger share than food and energy combined. Those are stripped out for the core measure of price growth that the Federal Reserve prefers, meaning the pickup in homeowners’ perceptions for how much they could get in rent will go a long way toward reaching the central bank’s goals.\n\nThe thing is, using just about any time frame, owners’ equivalent rent understates the price appreciation in the housing market relative to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. In the past decade, the hypothetical figure is up 31.5% while the latter has soared 73.3%. Over 30 years, the trend is about the same. More recently, owners’ equivalent rent increased 0.2% in April from the prior month, compared with a 0.8% jump in headline CPI and a 0.9% surge in the core measure. It’s never been that low relative to core CPI in at least the past two decades.\n\nIt’s not as if the Fed is oblivious to the rapid appreciation in home prices. “The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn,” Chair Jerome Powell said last month at a press conference. While he acknowledged that “it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house,” the central bank is showing no signs of reducing its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and appears content to let the wealth effect for current homeowners, driven by its policies that suppress long-term interest rates, help drive the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nNow, the Fed prefers to look at a different measure of inflation anyway: the personal consumption expenditures price index. But CPI is linked to bond market measures of inflation expectations, which the central bank also watches closely. And it stands to reason that if the tide starts to turn on owners’ equivalent rent, keeping CPI elevated, that will feed into the national psyche and drive up survey-based measures of expected price growth as well, which policy makers have also worried were falling too far.\n\nAt what point will homeowners’ boost how much they could charge for rent? History suggests perhaps never. Consider that in late 2005, the S&P CoreLogic home price index was up almost 15% year-over-year and that at one point in early 2009, the same index tumbled almost 13%. In each of those periods, owners’ equivalent rent rose on a year-over-year basis. Even though housing prices began to tumble in 2006, 2007 and 2008, the hypothetical component of CPI never had a down month. In fact, it experiences little volatility at all.\n\nI’m going to stop short of calling this calculation completely bogus — but it’s hard to make the argument that it reflects economic reality, either. More likely, homeowners simply aren’t well equipped to estimate how much rent they could get for their residence relative to yearly swings in its market price. The idea of renting property during a pandemic also might skew the data. And all of this is to say nothing of the complex formulas employed by Labor Department economists. So the figure ticks higher each month, in strong housing markets and weak ones, either moving in line with overall inflation or trailing it. Even if it started to climb faster, in line with any measure of U.S. housing prices, there’s always the chance that one-off spikes in categories like used cars and trucks, airfares and hotel costs will fall back to more normal levels.\n\nThere are always questions when it comes to inflation.

Rather than design an entirely new plane to compete with Airbus’s new offering, Boeing decided to use the tried-and-true 737 airframe, and just slap more efficient engines on it and call it the 737-max. The problem was, the 737 sits too low for the new, larger engines to sit under the wings. Their solution was to move the engines forward and slightly higher so they wouldn’t drag on the ground.

{"title": "The housing market is finally going to dump soon.", "selftext": "Yes, I know. Everyone's been claiming it, for over a year now. Really, there are always permabears saying it's going to finally correct or crash or whatever, and the Big Short has not helped things as now everyone wants to be a Michael Burry and call a new top. I've been a small time RE investor for a bit now, physical property not stock. So I've always got my ear to the state of RE value and trends, and I'm generally bullish on it as it is a protected asset class that the state insists on propping up and becomes generally more scarce due to regulatory creep. But for the time being, I think the dump is finally coming within the next half-year.\n\n1. For once, the Fed is actually working against the housing market. They quite literally are trying to induce some kind of correction by yanking up interest rates to their highest levels in 25+ years. So there are no smoke and mirrors financing policies that can toss them a lifeboat right now.\n2. As many have heard, the effective monthly mortgage payment is basically at its highest point ever, by a huge margin. The cost to own has surged past the cost to rent. We're talking 50+% in under a year for the same priced home, and as home values rocketed during COVID QE there is now nowhere to go but down in order to meet demand.\n3. Demand has been frozen, this is known by all in the industry. While values have only flatlined the industry itself (RE agents, mortgage personnel) are in recession as transactions are simply not happening. So why have values only treaded water rather than dumping?\n4. Supply has simply not been there. Historically low supply. Literally just not enough houses to cause any sort of market panic or crash. People still need to buy homes to live in, and for the time being sellers have found a buyer for their price, eventually, just not as quickly as 2021-2022.\n\nWith all of these factors in mind, consider a few things just happened:\n\nHome values have double topped and are on the downswing [https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\\_existing\\_home\\_median\\_sales\\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_existing_home_median_sales_price)\n\nand more critically:\n\n[US housing supply is finally soaring back to levels unseen since the great housing crash of 2007](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR)\n\nFrozen demand is finally starting to meet a glut of supply, and mortgage rates have remained largely unchanged, still the most expensive time to buy a house in American history. Commercial RE has already been in hell and a foreclosure crunch is expected. Probabilities markets predict that the Fed will be cutting rates within the next half-year, where they accurately assessed the rate hikes prior. This means the expectation from people with actual money (not idiotic talking heads with no stakes), is that a recession and dovish pivot is on the agenda next.\n\nI'm personally betting on at least a small housing crash this year and loading up on some puts to hedge my portfolio.

Time on market proves this.  \n\nThe reason why home prices haven’t declined and are plateauing is because potential sellers are in their homes with insane gains over the past 3 years (contributing to massive equity) and their rates are lower than they would get now.  This gives sellers the thought of “I don’t HAVE to sell so I’m not adjusting my price.”  I usually just let those ones sit on the market untouched.  Keep your house, then.  \n\nI see a lot of (ignorant) realtors saying, “when rates go down, housing is going to explode again and home prices will increase exponentially because demand will re-enter the market.”  My take on it is, “doubt it.”  And here’s why: when rates come down enough to reignite demand, then you’ll have god knows how many homeowners putting their homes on the market in order to cash out their gains and upgrade since they can’t cash out refi right now because they’ll lose their lower rate.  This, in turn, will probably flood the market with supply which, in my opinion, will be what moves the market down to more logical pricing.  One could say, “well, they’ll cash out refi when the rates come down,” and this I doubt because psychologically, Americans love buying new things when they make a ton of money.  From a psychological standpoint, after people have paid over asking for homes they honestly really didn’t love, they’ll sell and try to buy something they actually wanted.\n\nAdditionally, historically, when the fed pivots and begins to decrease fed funds rates, this triggers a spike in unemployment.  I’ll bet, if this happens this go around, we’ll see demand remain suppressed due to unemployment increase and FUD within the buyer circle forcing potential buyers to be more conservative and not pursue purchasing until it’s clear their jobs are safe.\n\nAt the end of the day, there’s so many ways this could play out, and it’s impossible to predict the future.

But it can’t, now, and it won’t when rates come down if we project what’s most likely to happened looking at historical unemployment changes during the Fed’s previous rate reduction cycles after pivoting.  \n\nAs to your comment on home sellers being buyers, yes, you’re correct, however, there have been a TON of “investors” (and I use this term lightly) that bought during the housing boom to jump into the STR space.  A lot of those STR’s that were bought over the last 2-3 years are beginning to hit the market because they aren’t performing as expected and are becoming more of a liability.  In my market, I’m seeing quite a few “Airbnb’s” hitting the market because it became over saturated over the past couple years and people aren’t making any money like they were.  Other “investors” that purchased rentals and are looking to exit and move on to more passive investing because they realize being a landlord is not as passive as they thought it would be and most likely won’t turn into buyers.  Just because someone is selling a house doesn’t mean they are going to become buyers.  And I’d be willing to bet quite a large chunk of them won’t become buyers when they list their house(s).

So what's the lesson, a PE buyout, layoffs, directors leaving, these are all clues and red flags as an employee to jettison the job right away, and look for a new ventures that is at step 1 or 2 in the cycle and move to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to know more:\n\n[https://www.dailyimpact.net/2023/07/09/pirate-equity-ransacking-the-world/](https://www.dailyimpact.net/2023/07/09/pirate-equity-ransacking-the-world/)\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/private-equity-firms-bankruptcies-plunder-book/673896/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/private-equity-firms-bankruptcies-plunder-book/673896/)\n\n[https://brusselsmorning.com/next-financial-crisis-private-equity/35238/](https://brusselsmorning.com/next-financial-crisis-private-equity/35238/)\n\n[https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it)\n\n[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/private-equity-buyout-kkr-houdaille/](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/private-equity-buyout-kkr-houdaille/)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "That’s an awesome lifecycle summary and on point. The improvement that could be made in any industry is when approaching the cost savings phase, understanding that the slow destruction of a company can indeed be avoided.  And I don’t blame consultants, as many have very, very good ideas and strategies. The issue is the flunkies that get placed as CEO and other key executive roles that mis-apply concepts. Going back to one of my earlier comments, Lean Manufacturing is one of the most mis-applied methodologies out there, usually implemented under coaching from consultants but then the company comes up with their “own version” and mis-applies across the board. Ends in some short term gains but many times disastrous results. Some of my favorites are the complete arbitrary cutting of inventory without understanding supply chain basics, or arbitrary cuts to direct labor without understanding labor balancing for maintaining your target output, or the recent phenomenon of forcing everything to a digital screen whether or not it should be digitized.  The overarching mistake is the all or nothing mindset that doesn’t view things as tools to help already skilled leaders and staff, but rather as forced adherence to a rigid set of rules. That stamps out creativity, virtually stops best practice sharing across business units. The best the company can ever do now is limited to the few people that came up with the system.
