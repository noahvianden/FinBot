{"title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End", "selftext": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/zuckerberg-meta-nvidia-gpu-b0632fed\n\nOn Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.\n\n“Our long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,” he wrote in the post. “We’re building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap” for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta’s progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.\n\nStart-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ’s GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta’s H100 purchases.\n\nThe H100 is Nvidia’s current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.\n\nThough, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.\n\nLink to video \n\nhttps://x.com/stockmktnewz/status/1748039110256685481?s=46&t=oN4WEfF1pxTYkKs03Quflg", "id": "19a67ll", "created_utc": 1705625705.0, "score": 652, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "Bullish for Nvidia as if they needed more reasons.", "score": 407, "replies": [{"body": "Crazy to think that even at the insane compute power and astronomical cost of these units today, in 10 or so years, the typical consumer device will be just as or more powerful.  Moore's law marches on.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Moores law will be a myth in a few decades", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Moore's Law is technological advancement on a sigmoid curve (S-curve).

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "19ag4tj", "created_utc": 1705660209.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 443, "comments": [{"body": "TSLA might be the first stock to get kicked out of the Magnificent 7 lmao", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "International got banned awhile ago (from Reddit in general, not just this sub).

The semiconductor industry is much more complex than other businesses I own, and analyst estimates for semis are hard to trust given how swiftly they can get moved up or down. So it's tough for me to judge whether AMD grows into its current price. Admittedly it was one of the first individual stocks I bought, at ATH ($150s). It proceeded to tank almost instantly, and then I averaged down all throughout 2022. I'm now up 60% on my AMD holdings and it is about 2.3% of my portfolio.\n\nI am excited about the MI300 sales which apparently may present real competition to NVDA. And given how much NVDA GPU's are being bought up by companies like META, I wonder if there may be a limit on NVDA's ability to supply the market and generating demand for AMD.\n\nBut this is all qualitative judgement here and faith in the company. I'm not holding onto AMD because I am waiting for some NVDA type explosion. I'm just wondering if it would be smart to start trimming or if this is just a buy/hold forever that will outperform the market. It was the correct call to buy in aggressively, but it may not have been a wise call for me to do given my limited background.\n\n----\n\nIn other news, I am seriously considering imminently adding HCC to my portfolio despite being at ATH. And I am getting very interested in CELH and ENPH. CELH is very expensive but its growth trajectory is insane, and the Bank of America analyst downgrade doesn't really make any sense today. ENPH has cheapened substantially both on trailing/forward basis, and we may be in the trough part of earnings.\n\nI'm also considering if I should just sell out of JPM. It's done decently for me, I'm up 32% on it. But unsure if more alpha is really justified here. Banks are another difficult to analyze industry for me.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "IMO AMD is still worth owning even if they never get the spotlight NVDA has - they serve a market segment that needs serving, that NVDA doesn't necessarily target.\n\n\nThat being said, the lesser stack of AMD/leaning on open source for supporting software does put AMDs offerings into a very similar boat to what hyperscalers will be capable of making for themselves (google, Amazon, Microsoft, and even apple), which they will also offer to others via cloud (dont expect msft to sell chips, but they can still eat into chips segments). \n\nBefore msft et al makes chips to mitigate reliance on NVDA, they will have completely decoupled from what AMD offers, imo. \n\nI actually don't know or understand what the grand vision of AMD is. They are competent, but if they don't have a strong guiding philosophy besides \"later and cheaper\", I would be worried.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I think you are likely underestimating the work involved in creating TPUs capable of competing with AMDs products. Google has done it, but will all big tech bother to enter a completely different market segment, drop potentially billions in R&D when they could just get some teams to make a software layer for cheaper AMD / Intel products. AMD spends 1.5billion a quarter on R&D, lets say one third of that is AI server R&D . How many companies in the world are going to drop 2 billion a year to make a better product.\n\nTheir addressable market is every company other than Google, Microsoft, Meta and maybe Amazon.\n\nI agree that Nvidia will take a lion's share, but we've seen AMD can do very well taking the scraps from Nvidia's table.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely - it is why only hyperscalers can even consider doing what we've seen them do. I know enough to know it is incredibly difficult, which is why I was so bullish on AAPL once they revealed the m1 chips - they did the hard work because their vision demanded it of them at that point.\n\nIt is good to remember though - the GPUs help make GPUs.

High financing costs are hitting their demand with high correlation to the housing market transaction volume. Chinese companies have also been flooding the market with cheaper, and steadily improving alternatives that are eating their margins and growth. There are now a few chinese companies that use similar microinverter tech that are direct competitors, so their main moat is the reputation of high quality, software and monitoring they offer- no longer the microinverter tech.

This acquisition has not been blocked. This is a rumor based on an anonymous source. Even if the EU bureaucracy decides to formally oppose the deal, Amazon can and will sue to move forward or they will have to pay a large penalty to iRobot. \nAnother clarification Amazon did not drop the purchase price arbitrarily. After the deal was negotiated IRBT received a $200 million 3 year term loan for working capital . As a result, that debt would transfer to Amazon reducing the value of the assets acquired, simple math. \nI read IRBT’s latest 10Q and the Company is struggling but the acquisition by Amazon is a major reason for that. After the deal was announced IRBT lost a top 5 customer who carried their products, also other retailers who compete with Amazon reduced marketing efforts and orders. If the acquisition does not close, with a little hard work IRBT should be able to get that major customer back and re-engage with other retailer customers to restore lost business and increase joint marketing efforts. They can probably increase sales by 20% within a year of cancellation of the Amazon deal. \nAlso the company on YTD basis still spends 20% on R&D which is $150 million annually. Way higher than needed but that’s probably also a requirement of the deal with Amazon. If the deal gets cancelled (big IF), an independent struggling company is not going to spend 20% of revenue on R&D.  They will cut this in half. So in the event the deal gets canceled IRBT gets a large termination payment that it uses to pay down debt. Within a year they restore lost business and cut R&D and SGA costs; the combined impact of these moves could add well over $110 million to the bottom line, restoring the company to profitability. That alone is worth $1Billion in market cap. Once the company restarts earnings calls and markets the turnaround of a machine learning AI pioneer it will likely see an additional market cap bump. \n\nIn fact the company maybe in a better position if the deal gets cancelled from an equity shareholder perspective.

{"title": "S&P 500 rallies 1% to all-time high, surpassing previous record set in 2022: Live updates", "selftext": "The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday as investors returned to buying equities in force in recent days following a short-lived market stumble to start the new year.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.\n\nAll three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.\n\nFollowing a 19% loss in 2022, the S&P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.\n\nBut they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.\n\n\"In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024,\" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\n\nThe tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&P 500's best-performing sector week to date.\n\nWhether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 \"is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not,\" Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.\n\n\"Multiples rise coming out of economic slowdowns, because investors are pricing in a recovery. If that recovery doesn't materialize, then you do have to question the sustainability of not only holding on to new highs, but making new highs beyond that,\" Stucky added.\n\nFresh consumer data on Friday indicated that consumers are becoming more confident on the economy and inflation. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed a 21.4% year-over-year jump to reach its highest level since July 2021.\n\nInsurance company Travelers rose more than 5% after posting an earnings beat. Schlumberger gained nearly 2% after beating on top and bottom lines, and Ally Financial surged over 10% after reporting strong quarterly results and a sale of a business unit to Synchrony Financial.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/01/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html", "id": "19au3bn", "created_utc": 1705699202.0, "score": 1343, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 412, "comments": [{"body": "This is why it pays to be greedy when stocks are down.
