{"title": "Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter", "selftext": "\nTesla’s stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla’s growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla’s lead remains substantial.\n\nTesla’s 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tesla’s stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company’s upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html\n", "id": "1fufyjo", "created_utc": 1727875027.0, "score": 136, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Looks like Tesla sales have effectively plateaued.

The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890\n\nTotal production Q3 2024: 469,796\n\nAnalysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.\n\nDeliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.\n\nIn the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.\n\nTesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.\n\nIn the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.\n\nGM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.\n\nFord plans to report results on Wednesday.\n\nTesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.\n\nThe company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.\n\nShares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.\n\nTesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.\n\nBut Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.\n\nTesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”\n\nMusk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html", "id": "1fuftc7", "created_utc": 1727874606.0, "score": 429, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 246, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla would need to deliver 514,925 in Q4 for zero growth in 2024 over 2023.

You need to eliminate zombie companies that consume credit without generating good returns, so that credit can start flowing again into sectors that truly deserve it.\n\nA major sector that was consuming credit and starting to form an excessively large bubble was real estate. It didn’t just collapse on its own; the government decided to burst the bubble.\n\nThe stimulus China has provided in recent times is not a \"bazooka\" as people are claiming. In fact, if they leave it as is, I doubt it will do much to restore the economy. What they are aiming for is to restore confidence in the system. To restore consumer confidence, which was lost for a reason: people close to them losing their jobs due to industry closures (which weren’t performing) or because they lost value in their only form of investment, which was real estate.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a bad thing if the country manages to do it right (as Ray Dalio says, a beautifully deleveraging cycle). It can be a difficult process but China, being an authoritarian country, is well positioned to handle it. They have all their debt in their local currency, they have large reserves to back up a possible currency collapse, and they control the banks and companies across the country.\n\nAlso, while the drop in real estate value seems chaotic, it’s really not.

When Uber/Grab came into the market, people who had access to credit bought fleets of cars and found drivers to work in shifts, doing a revenue share with the drivers. Some people who bought cars for themselves became drivers on the network to pay off their cars sooner or for extra money. In Vietnam, where motorbikes are the primary mode of transport and are also bookable for ride-share, drivers who give people rides can also do food/package deliveries. Ho Chi Minh City has over 9 million people and is densely populated, so the total addressable market (TAM) is large. All drivers and investors with cars on the network make money despite cars and fuel costing more than in the US. The city has hit that critical mass where it has become hyper-efficient.\n\nIn Vietnam, I don’t own a car. It is pretty common for me to book 4-8 rides a day (when I used to go to an office here). On days I don’t book rides at all, I book food/grocery deliveries from 1-4 places daily. It’s cheaper and/or faster to have food delivered to me (I’d have to do a round trip vs. one way).  When I’m in the US, I dread being in Bay Area traffic and having to go out to get food.  The preferences and behavior changed happened really quick.  My transportation and delivery costs each month does not break $300 a month.  \n\nYou can imagine that eliminating human driver costs and using solar/battery technology would result in much more cost savings for these fleet owners.

That equipment would be worth nothing to them at auction.\n\nSo Intel is marking down these machines on their books as say $200M a piece of PP&E book value, but they and the other fab equipment are deeply illiquid, and Intel couldn't actually resell them for $200M. I would be surprised if they could auction off their plants for a quarter of their book value. \n\nAs far as Intel's node - 2nm is a marketing term, so take that with a grain of salt, and the big thing is that its yield and performance aren't yet known. For comparison, Samsung claims to currently have a leading-edge 2nm process, but yields are reportedly 10%.

{"title": "DD: Chinese stock market is undergoing a once in a life time generational wealth building opportunity.", "selftext": "My position is above.\n\nTL:DR: China is about to rag pull housing to direct majority of wealth into the stock market (similar to the US).\n\nCurrently, the majority of wealth of Chinese citizens are in real estate. People brag about how many houses they have in Beijing or Shanghai and they view those properties as retirement vehicles.\n\nThose people are about to be rag pulled. Remember the saying, don’t fight the fed? Don’t fight the Xi.\n\nFor the last 20-30 years, the Chinese stock market is filled with rampant speculation and exit schemes via IPO. That might still be true, but that is about to change too. \n\nYes, the Chinese economy faces tremendous headwind, the real estate bubble is collapsing, tons of animosity with the US, etc, but Xi stumbled upon the pure genius competitive play.\n\nYou see, each pay check, people PILE into the US market. Over a life time, owning US company generates wealth and allow people to retire.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I have zero second thoughts about putting money into SPY, VOO, etc every pay check. As a result, American company like google, nvidia, apple, gets floated like crazy.\n\nMeanwhile, stock traders are viewed as gamblers. Everyone knows someone who blown up their account. No one would trust their retirement in the market. The tremendous wealth of the people are literally in brick and mortar (housing). In fact, China has a deflation problem because people LOVE to save.\n\nXi must have stumbled upon a freaking genius play. They see the opportunity to shift wealth and possibly rescue governments from debt by shifting wealth from real estate into stock market. \n\nYou see, by allowing real estate to eventually go free fall as Chinese people capitulate and pile into stock market, China can solve multiple problem all at once. Government in debt? Probably already positioned into stock market very cheaply and now the people will transfer their wealth to bolster the government. Wanting to become more competitive in tech and brew local AI giants? Instead of having the masses put their piggy bank literally in the wall, you are now mentally training them to pile money into home grown company every month like Americans with their 401k. Housing market collapse? Let it go. You are dumb if you failed to unload grossly overpriced real estate. \n\nYou see, the situation here, is that all this doesn’t depend on the west. This is a genius play to solve the housing crisis by rag pulling the Chinese boomers and liquidate their retirement funding in the form of realestate and create affordable housings all at once. The ghost towns will still be there but because housing will be allowed to drop it wont matter since the new focus will be to protect the stock market. At the same time this solve the local government debt crisis because they would have gone into stock market ahead of time. The people who are hurt the most are boomers sitting on millions of unrealized gain from housing. At the same time this would also help their companies to be more competitive as tremendous amount of wealth are raised for them to pile into chips and AI.\n\nThe end result would be a stock market that is persistently rising and generate long term wealth similar to the US one. There will be one day where people literally put money into Chinese stock every month.\n\nThe west knows this and if US dislike China as much as I think, the institutions will try their hardest to short and crash the Chinese market. It’ll be an epic battle of bulls and bears. The west know that if it can destroy confidence in the Chinese market while housing market is collapsing, it will absolutely eviscerate China. Xi knows this too, and he will use the might of an entire nation to defend the market and kill the shorts.\n\nI am not a finance professional and this is not financial advice. Chinese market is incredibly volatile and do so at your own risk. My belief is that it’s best to leverage a small principal into the Chinese market because potential of losses is extreme but gain is extreme as well. Therefore almost all my position is in YINN which is 3x bull. To tell you how the west think about China, Yinn is considered to be a low energy state where as YANG represents the sun and rising energy. Of course on the American market Yang is the short ticker.\n\nThe best part about this whole situation is that since this is an internal wealth transfer, I don’t even think they depend on the west for this to work (they are robbing their own boomers). \n\nRetails are just along for the ride. Don’t fight the Xi.

If you're still glazing that fraud, this post isn't for you, imho betting on Tesla's competitors is the way to make real money on Robo Taxi day. \n\nHere are the facts: Google's Waymo is far more advanced than Tsla's FSD. Waymo has over 20+ million miles of real-world driving and 20+ billion miles in simulation to Tesla's 0 fucking miles. Google invested in Uber in 2013, so it's no surprise they partnered to embark on their self-driving ambitions. When Tesla fails to deliver, I believe we will see a spike in Uber as the market realizes that Tesla will not be a true competitor in autonomous driving.\n\nAnother potential winner of Tesla's RoboTaxi days is Mobileye (MBLY). They used to be a partner of Tesla until they cut their ties with Tesla based on Elon's lies about the current capabilities of Tesla's FSD. MBLY currently has several partnerships with car makers including NIO, BMW, and Volkswagen. \n\nIn 2021, Mobileye announced that the first robotaxi services would be deployed in Munich, Germany. This partnership is still active, with the goal of launching a scalable autonomous ride-hailing service in the coming years. \n\nTesla's failure on 10/10 I believe will open the door for the market to realize it isn't at true player in the space and will boost UBER and MBLY. \n\nI'm still building a position, but I have 10/18 MBLY 15 C\nand UBER  10/11 77 C and 10/18 80 C\n\nMBLY also has a very high SI, so if it goes, it will go. \n\nI've been pretty spot on of late, so let's see.\n\nEdit: Uber calls paid", "id": "1fuii9x", "created_utc": 1727881834.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 342 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 9 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "i saw a mom put her kid into a waymo this morning in west LA…. waymo has already won", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "I ride Waymo here in Phoenix now almost exclusively.
