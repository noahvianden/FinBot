This is a big part of why most auto-makers try to control as much of their own supply chain as possible, cutting out the middle men reduces costs. This is part of why Tesla bought Maxwell to start making their own batteries.\n\nSo yes, while Tesla is reducing their prices, they're also reducing their costs in the back end.\n\nThe same thing is happening in China. It's cheaper for Tesla to make cars in China that they're selling to the Chinese, and because it's cheaper for them it's allows them to charge the Chinese a lower price, while maintaining the same profit margin, which will allow more Chinese to buy their cars.\n\n> -At what point would you be concerned with their unprofitability? (If you are not already concerned)\n\nI suggest you look up some youtube videos from stock experts who bought into Tesla. Profits in the short term aren't everything. There's several key facts that make this a much better quarter then the market initially saw it despite the unprofitability:\n\n* Tesla is still growing something like 60% Year over Year despite being a multi-billion dollar corporation. There's few corporations that boast those kinds of numbers, fast growth even at a loss in the short term often helps build profits in the long term.\n\n* While Tesla's profits are down, their revenue is up quite a bit in 3 of the last 4 quarters, so the short term numbers aren't all bad either.\n\nThat said, the point Tesla longs would be concerned about the lack of profits is when Tesla stops growing and is still losing money.\n\n> -What do you think changes about the business model in 2020 and beyond that makes this a good investment? China factory? FSD? Something else?\n\nI think Tesla's will sell decently in China, though and the Model Y will sell a ton, especially in the US where bigger cars are more popular.\n\nThat said, while I'm a Tesla long, I'm actually extremely skeptical about Tesla's robotaxi strategy with FSD. I'm just extremely skeptical that there's anywhere near the amount of money in a taxi business as they think, especially of the $30,000 a year claim by Elon. But I don't think FSD is a money pit fail by any means, I think the auto-pilot and promise of FSD makes it a more attractive car, and long term will be a great safety and convenience feature to sell the car. \n\nI also actually think that Tesla has a decent shot at being the first to market with FSD. I'm a software developer, and I think the way Google & most others are attempting to solve FSD just sounds WAY too time consuming and impractical to work on a world wide scale.
