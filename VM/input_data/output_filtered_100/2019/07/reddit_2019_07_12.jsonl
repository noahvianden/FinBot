Here's the explanation if you really want and it all starts with understanding how a large corporation works.\n\nFirst there's the PR aspect of it. You know all of those crazy aerodynamic futuristic trucks that were coming out the last 10 years? Probably not because you obviously don't know the trucking industry. Well, they never happened. But guess who had nice a lot of nice PR with articles and press conferences about buying those trucks and their pre-orders? Walmart, Swift,etc. Big names of the industry. How many ever hit the road? Zero. Wait, I did see one once, bobtailing. Probably heading back from the promotional release.\n\nSecond, comes the compartmentalized management structure of a massive corporation. This leads to manipulation and decisions that aren't good for the big picture. The Vice President of Fleet Acquisitions Stave is tasked with fleet purchases. His bonus numbers are based off of his ability to save money here. Take the CNG trucks for example. Steve finds out he can get a huge subsidy by purchasing CNG trucks. All of a sudden Steve is able to purchase the trucks he's required and he saved a ton of money. Steve gets a huge bonus check and everyone is happy, everyone above him at least. Steve didn't care that CNG trucks weren't reliable. \n\nShop manager at the terminal level John does though. His trucks are personally keeping the local hook in business. The fuel infrastructure is weak and the stations available are all letting oil from the compressors mix with the fuel causing all kinds of issues. John is only given X amount of dollars to fix trucks monthly and keeps his bonus as long as those monthly numbers stay within those bounds. John starts realizing that if he just doesn't fix the truck, he doesn't have to pay for repairs. Shit's good for John now. \n\nAlvin, the terminal transportation manager is now getting fucked though. He doesn't have enough trucks to operate. He is paying drivers to sit and wait for a truck when they come in at their specified route time and there is no truck. He now has to start renting trucks to get the job done. Things are still good for John though, because the rental truck comes out of Steve's account in transportation, not the shop. This goes on and on, and even Alvin starts figuring out some stupid shit to do to make his numbers look better. Then you start to realize this is being done in every aspect of the corporation and it makes you wonder how much money is being lost through all of this. Steve had a good year though.\n\nThe cash cow company that is owned by one of the corporations you named operates exactly this way.\n\nRealistically though, this Tesla truck that is heavy as hell falls mostly under the first aspect. Even at a companies like Pepsi and AB a Tesla truck will only be good for certain portions of their fleets. Pepsi most likely would push these trucks to Frito as there is less weight being hauled there often times. They and AB could use them for their end point deliveries since range and weight won't be an issue there.

A couple of them realized that if they just cut back the the quantity of loads they did, they could ensure that there were always trucks and drivers waiting for work. Most late deliveries not caused by manufacturing or shipping were due to lack of trucks or a driver calling off, etc. They would put the rest on common carriers even though it cost more, coming out of another department's budget of course. This lead to long term effects when their drivers began quitting at an impressive rate due to lack of work that lead to all of the costs associated with having to hire and train new drivers.

These do exist in standard diesels but are far from standard. A traditional sleeper does not weigh that much and generally are below 20,000. Daycabs, which is where Tesla is right now, generally fall below 18,000 lbs. Some down to 15,500 or so. Many companies have weight limits on trucks they'll allow to lease on to them, let alone buy themselves. This is usually around 18,000-19,000 lbs. This is because their customers require a certain minimum freight weight be shipped with each load. With their comparison 4,000 lbs more would be closing in on 26,000 pounds of the \"standard truck\". \n\nEven if they used a real comparison, 4000 lbs is huge in trucking. That means less freight being shipped per load which means higher costs for the customers. They're not going to lose money because a carrier wants to go electric. The savings in fuel costs and all of that applies to the carrier not the customer.\n\nNikola estimates have been 20000-23000 lbs with their hydrogen fuel cell trucks with a sleeper. This is already beating out Tesla. They have their own problems with infrastructure. There is a ton of applied research being done with cryogenics right now to increase hydrogen shipping efficiency to help with that infrastructure. The range is actually comparable to a diesel truck, unlike the Tesla. Just like with Tesla cars, fanboys seem to act like Tesla is the only person in their markets. They have competition not only in electric but they will always be competing against standard motors as well. \n\nAnd it comes right back down to the point that everything Tesla says looks good if you don't know shit about the industry, which you clearly don't. The fact that you think 4000 lbs is no big deal is proof of that. \n\nWill there be a market for electric trucks? Definitely. Trying to make it out to be 80% of the trucking industry is absolutely laughable. That PR is really working wonders apparently.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A conventional tractor, as we’ve said, has a tare weight of around 32,000 pounds when fully fueled and with a lightweight box trailer in place. Remove the trailer and the truck itself is about 22,500 pounds. It’s difficult to then go to just the weight of the powertrain components and fuel, but they’re considerably less than 11,000 pounds in all.\n\nLooking at the shipping weight for a crated engine and transmission for a Class 8 truck, we can see that they weigh about 8,000 pounds on average. Add in fuel and other components and another 1,500 pounds (at most) are put on the truck. We then assume that the rest of the truck (framing, braking systems, air compressor, etc) are about the same for the Tesla Semi in order for it to meet Class 8 standards. So we call those a wash. But clearly they're not.\n\nThat means that the Semi  is roughly two tons heavier than would be a standard day cab big truck in the Class 8 category. But only today.\n\nThe fact that you're just ignoring the Maxwell capacitor advancement and the new, non-18650 larger cells from Tesla kind of says it all.\n\nIf you're buying stock for a truck made this year then you're right.

If the Tesla is currently running four battery packs what do you think the weight reduction will be when Tesla moves to 2170 cells with 50% more capacity? \n\nWell let's see 4t/1.5 = 2.667 so a weight reduction of 1.33 tons.
