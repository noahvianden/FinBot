The numbers in that source are only for the first 6 months of 2018, but the F150 has been the #1 selling truck [42 years in a row](https://www.thedrive.com/news/25771/ford-f-series-is-americas-best-selling-truck-for-42nd-straight-year)\n\n\nThere's no way Tesla could realistically take the #1 spot or even compete with Ford, Gm, Toyota, or Ram.  They absolutley could compete with Honda's ridgeline, Nissan's Titan/Frontier and the GMC Canyon (the highest seller in that group was 40k units).    It will be interesting to see the production numbers or expectations.  \n\n\nIF they were to take a large chunk of the F150, Silverado, Ram, or Tundra's market share, it could be bad news for those automakers.  In 2007, when gas prices were $4/gallon, dealerships couldnt move Trucks and SUVs (source, I sold cars at a dealership that had both a Ford dealership and a Chrsyler/dodge/Jeep/Ram dealership in the same lot, we sold on both lots).  \nThe big American auto manufacturers make their bread and butter off of trucks and SUVs.   The auto makers were struggling BEFORE the market and financial industry went to shit.  \nTheres a lot more room for profitability selling the F150 vs the Focus that is competing with Honda/Toyota (we called the focus \"fuck us\" because we'd only make the minimum commission i.e. there is very little profit).  \n\n\nIF gas prices go up again, it will be VERY interesting to see how an electric truck fares.  A lot of these trucks only get 15-20 mpg. \n\nAt the end of the day, I dont see a lot of the good ol boys ditching their tried and true ford/chevy/ram.  Even the Tundra,  which is a much better truck than the 3, cant come close.   \n  \nIn 2020, Ford is re-rolling out the ranger, so it's pretty safe to assume that will be somewhere in the top 10 (Tacoma is #4, Colorado is #6).", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "LOL that’s what I immediately thought.

Never depend on these components to keep you safe. It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times.\n\nWarning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down Model S. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.\n\nWarning: Although Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is capable of detecting pedestrians and cyclists, never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow Model S down for them. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.\n\nWarning: Do not use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on city streets or on roads where traffic conditions are constantly changing.\n\nWarning: Do not use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control on winding roads with sharp curves, on icy or slippery road surfaces, or when weather conditions (such as heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) make it inappropriate to drive at a consistent speed. Traffic- Aware Cruise Control does not adapt driving speed based on road and driving conditions.\n\nWarning: When you adjust the cruising speed based on the speed limit, the set speed does not change when the speed limit changes. You must pull the cruise control lever again to cruise at the new speed limit. You can also manually adjust your cruising speed at any time (see Changing the Set Speed on page 85).\n\nWarning: Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Speed Assist to determine an accurate or appropriate cruising speed. Always cruise at a safe speed based on road conditions and applicable speed limits.\n\n\nWarning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may occasionally cause Model S to brake when not required or when you are not expecting it. This can be caused by closely following a vehicle ahead, detecting vehicles or objects in adjacent lanes (especially on curves), etc.\n\nWarning: Due to limitations inherent in the onboard GPS (Global Positioning System), you may experience situations in which Traffic-Aware Cruise Control slows down the vehicle, especially near highway exits where a curve is detected and/or you are actively navigating to a destination and not following the route.\n\nWarning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and, especially in situations when you are driving over\n50 mph (80 km/h), may not brake/ decelerate when a vehicle or object is only partially in the driving lane or when a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary or slow-moving vehicle or object is in front of you. Always pay attention to the road ahead and stay prepared to take immediate corrective action. Depending on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to avoid a collision can result in serious injury or death. In addition, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may react to vehicles or objectsthat either do not exist or are not in the lane of travel, causing Model S to slow down unnecessarily or inappropriately.\n\nWarning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may be unable to provide adequate speed control because of limited braking capability and hills. It can also misjudge the distance from a vehicle ahead. Driving downhill can increase driving speed, causing Model S to exceed your set speed (and potentially the road's speed limit). Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to slow down the vehicle enough to prevent a collision. Always keep your eyes on the road when driving and be prepared to take corrective action as needed. Depending on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to slow the vehicle down enough to prevent a collision can result in serious injury or death.\n\nWarning: In some cases (such as having insufficient data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not automatically reduce the set speed on the highway interchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to determine an appropriate driving speed. Tesla recommends driving at a speed that is safe for road conditions and within posted speed limits.\n\nWarning: It is the driver's responsibility to determine and maintain a safe following distance at all times. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to maintain an accurate or appropriate following distance.\nWarning: Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down Model S to avoid a collision. Always watch the road in front of you and stay prepared to take immediate corrective action.\n\nWarning: Overtake Acceleration can cancel for many unforeseen reasons in addition to those listed above (for example, lack of GPS data). Stay alert and never depend on Overtake Acceleration to increase your driving speed.\n\nWarning: Overtake Acceleration increases your driving speed whenever the appropriate turn signal is engaged, and accelerates Model S closer to the vehicle ahead.

This could be caused by dirt, mud, ice, snow, fog, etc.\n• The traction control setting is manually disabled or is repeatedly engaging to prevent wheels from slipping.\n• The wheels are spinning while at a standstill.\n• The Traffic-Aware Cruise Control system is failing or requires service.\nWhen Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is unavailable or cancels, Model S no longer drives consistently at a set speed and no longer maintains a specified distance\n\nWarning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control can cancel unexpectedly at any time for unforeseen reasons.
