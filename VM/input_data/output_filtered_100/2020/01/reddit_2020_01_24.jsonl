I personally use the Spy indicator. If spy drops but say TSLA is fine, but the macro event drags it down with it, this is a good way to enter.\n\nIf you look at the 510 strike jan 2021 Leap. The premium is about 134. This means if you want to write short calls 10 contracts at a time, you'll need to buy 10 leap contracts for about 134000. This sounds like alot, however storm himself does have this capital.\n\nNext if you look at the strikes for 570 for jan 31, 2020 you get about 33 per contract. What does this mean? It means that if you write this contract, you've already gotten yourself 24% of the capital back in 1 month. Your ROI is looking around 4-5 months.\n\nNow it should be pretty fucking obvious why you will recover your initial cost. Now you can ask, what if the stock tanks?
