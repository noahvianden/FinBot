Walgreens Boots Alliance\n8:00 am, December 2, 2020\n\nTickers: AMZN CVS RAD\nCategories: Trading Ideas\nRead the full article\n\nThe two largest pharmacy chains in the U.S. have grown through unit expansion and several major acquisitions. The companies have seen their share prices fall on concerns surrounding Amazon.com's entry into the market.\n\nBenzinga is looking at how CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) stack up in Stock Wars.\n\nAbout CVS Health: CVS is a player in the pharmacy, insurance and benefits management businesses. The company has over 9,900 retail pharmacy locations and over 1,100 walk-in clinics.\n\nCVS has over 105 million plan members for its pharmacy benefits and 37 million health insurance product customers.\n\nOne in three Americans interact with CVS on a yearly basis. Over 70% of the U.S. population lives within three miles of a CVS store.\n\nRelated Link: Stock Wars: Home Depot Vs. Lowe’s\n\nAbout Walgreens Boots: Walgreens has a presence in more than 25 countries and operates over 21,000 stores across its held companies. In the U.S., Walgreens has over 9,000 stores.\n\nAround 78% of the U.S. population lives within a five-mile radius of a Walgreens-owned store.\n\nMajor Acquisitions: In 2018, CVS acquired managed health care company Aetna in a $70-billion deal. The completed deal led CVS to three major priorities going forward: making health care accessible, simplifying how consumers access care and lowering costs.\n\nWalgreens attempted to buy Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD) in a large $17-billion deal between two of the top three retail pharmacy companies in the U.S.\n\nThe deal with Rite Aid faced heavy pressure from the Federal Trade Commission. Walgreens eventually acquired 1,932 Rite Aid stores in a separate $4.4-billion deal.\n\nIn 2014, Walgreens completed its acquisition of Alliance Boots. Walgreens restructured into a holding company structure after acquiring the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that it did not own.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid: With its ownership of Aetna, CVS Health is a major player in the Medicare and Medicaid health care market.\n\nPiper Sandler recently initiated coverage of CVS and cited the growth in Medicaid as a catalyst going forward under a Joe Biden presidency.\n\nAnalyst Sarah James sees CVS adding $700 million annually for its health insurance plan business due to Biden winning the 2020 election. The plan business could hit $8.4 billion in annual revenue.\n\nFighting Off Amazon: E-commerce leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced plans to launch Amazon Pharmacy to take on the $300-billion pharmacy market.\n\nThe plan for Amazon is to offer prescription medicines for home delivery, including free delivery for Amazon Prime members.\n\nThe announcement from Amazon has put pressure on retail pharmacy stocks.\n\nBoth companies will need to fight to fend off disruptor Amazon. Right now, Amazon's offering will only be available to Prime members. Amazon also cannot ship certain drugs through the mail.\n\nFinancials: CVS had revenue of $256.8 billion in fiscal 2019, which represents year-over-year growth of 32%. The company has grown its revenue in each of the last five years, going from $153.3 billion to $256.8 billion.\n\nWalgreens had revenue of $139.5 billion in fiscal 2020. The company has grown sales in each of the last five years, going from $117.4 billion to $139.5 billion.\n\nCVS has increased its earnings per share in four out of the last five years, with fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 both posting $7.08 in earnings per share.\n\nWalgreens has seen earnings per share fall several times, going from $3.85 to $3.80 and $5.07 to $4.32. Fiscal 2020 earnings per share were $4.74.\n\nStock Performance: Shares of CVS Health are down 9% in 2020. The company’s shares have lost 28% of their value over the last five years.\n\nCVS Health has a market capitalization of $89 billion.\n\nShares of Walgreens Boots are down 36% in 2020. The company’s shares are down 55% in the last five years.\n\nWalgreens Boots shares have a market capitalization of $33 billion.\n\nBenzinga’s Take: In the Piper Sandler analyst note, it was said that CVS had more stores offering COVID-19 tests, which brought new customers to CVS stores.\n\nOf the 3 million tests done, 40% were done for people who were not CVS customers.\n\nAdd in the logistics of CVS having stores within three miles of 70% of the population and health insurance plan offerings that could benefit from a Biden presidency, and CVS could be the winner.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting notes.

When market opened, the price dropped another 10% and I started panicking. \n\nI started wondering if I made a wrong investment and did a lot of research on the internet. It was then where I came across this forum and interacted with the people here. I began reading more about Tesla's business plan and the more I read, the more I was convinced that Tesla is the way forward. Ever since then, I would buy every dip and even average up at times because I was confident in Tesla. I had a boomer friend who told me Tesla is bound to fail. I retaliated by saying \"don't come crying when I'm rich in 5 years time\". \n\nWhenever my friends asked me what is a solid stock to invest in now, I would always recommend Tesla.

Putting a ban on income tax in the constitution was literally the dumbest thing Texas has done. I'll explain.\n\nTexas needs money to pay for things as a government, it has to come from somewhere and there are three main sources: Sales Tax, Property Tax and income tax.\n\nYou cut Income tax, you are left with two taxes. They hate hate sales taxes, so they raise the only one left. Property Taxes each year through assessing your homes value as more and more. You can not avoid this and it is in fact a defacto wealth tax, on average you are going to pay 2% a year on your homes assessed value. People are made to feel good because that home you likely don't own (the bank does) is \"worth\" more. \n\nSo if you own a modest $250k home in Austin area (which in on the low end) you are paying $5k a year in property tax to rent your land from the government. If you make $80k a year with $65k take home, 7.5% of your income is going to taxes. More reasonable is a $400k home since you want to live somewhere you kids will have a good school, well then you are paying 12.3% of your post tax income to property taxes. \n\nworse, let's say Musk moves to Texas, he buys a nice ranch in the Austin area, he could be paying near the same rate as that $400k home because of AG exemptions, hell, he can have someone pay to run cattle on there and write off the cost of the land as a business expense on top of things. The point being, even if he was paying full 2% on the value of the land, it doesn't add much to the tax base in the state. Let's not even use musk since he's uber wealthy, let's use a $1million dollar earner with a nice home at $1.2 million in value, well he's paying $24k a year while pulling in $671k a year, he pays only 3.5%, he would need to be in a home $4.12 million before he paid the same taxes as the $400k person. \n\nLastly, property taxes stay in the local area and leads to concentration of wealth and better schools in certain areas and worse schools in others. It makes pockets of prosperity while other areas lag with much lower tax bases.\n\nThe only choice for state and local governments to raise money to pay for their communities is through either sales tax or property tax increases, both of which hit the majority of income earners way harder than they hit high earners. The median household income in Texas is $60k, with the median property value being $180k, so your average Texan pays 7% of their post tax income to the state. That rich person above pays half that rate despite living in a home worth 6x. \n\nOk, rant over ...", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "California's average effective property tax rate is actually among the lowest comparing to other states: at 0.72%.  Adding additional parcel taxes and fees, it can reach around 1%. However, Average housing price in California is approximately $ 450,000. Therefore, average property taxes paid on the house is up to $4,500/ year.\n \nTexas' property tax rate is at 1.9 %.

In this case the median home value in Texas is $186k, but frankly that is not realistic in anywhere near Austin. You are going to find a minimum of $225k as something you would live in and wouldn't require major work. Also, the tax rate in Austin is 2.1%\n\n2) California has some funky property tax rules where you have these locked in values which have been keeping taxes super low for tons of boomers who stay in their homes, but has screwed over all the new buyers. I don't know all the rules like I know Texas, but I've looked at property and it's way cheaper. \n\n3) in CA if you make $80k a year you will pay 2.41% or $1,926 in state taxes. So that is $92,000 worth of home value in Texas. Of course we can get into tax reduction due to mortgage interest tax deductions and the benefit of earning more in CA over Texas, etc. \n\nThe main point of my post is that income tax isn't a bad thing. My brother took a huge hit with the oil field work pullback, but one thing that has helped him this year is his property tax in Colorado is under a grand, which is near impossible in Texas. It's so low because CO has an income tax, so property tax is much more reasonable.

They are entering 3nm risk production in 2021 [2]. Those sorry shit eating cucks at intel have stated their 7nm process maybe delayed until 2023 [3]. 2023? Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you wont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  Your last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was all under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal seconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" [4]. You're fucking nothing. From \"CPU giant\" to this?\n\nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work. TSM has the backing of the American government [7]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT YOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can't even find a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe [5]? Go fuck yourself. AMD is already on 7nm [4] and Lisa Su is have her raging cock injected with even more erection enhancers AS WE SPEAK YOU FUCKING PISS DRINKER.\n\nKeep buying Intel stock bobby [8]. Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock all the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options at 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make money off of you losing money because you're a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. It's so fucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and fab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable than whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN? Or maybe you can get another one of your marketing goons to tell everyone on the call how great AMD is [9].\n\nBuy Intel PUTS now and gather round to watch it burn.\n\nINTL 53.5 PUT 10/23\n\nUpdate 10/23/2020 INTL -10% ME +100%:\n\nFuck all you god damn doubters and haters. I doubled my fucking principal with this put. To all of you idiots who mocked me for doing extensive research and analysis and making an aggressive call, FUCK YOU. I'm an actual expert who works in this industry and has payed close attention to this stuff.  You idiots are just some fucking asswads who don't know the first thing about this shit.  I made money while Bob Swan and you asshats lost money. I'm plotting my next move and in my next post, I'm going to come clean about Intel and what all of this was REALLY about. I have positions that I am MUCH certain about and I will show you. Follow me and I will lead you retards to tendy town.\n\nBe on the lookout for my next post.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production\n[2] https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/19/tsmc-3nm-risk-production-in-2021-paves-the-way-to-2020-mass-production\n[3] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021\n[4] https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-tsmc-not-long-term/\n[5] https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately\n[6] https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/intels-chief-engineer-out-amid-manufacturing-crisis.html\n[7] https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/taiwan-semiconductor-secures-government-aid-for-us.aspx\n[8] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hznvk1/intel_ceo_bob_swan_just_bought_8000_shares_at/\n[9] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFHBgb9SY1Y&ab_channel=GamersNexus", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">When we start seeing 1000$ quantum machines for retail you'll see something mooning.\n\nyou have no idea about what you are talking about.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "RemindMe! 31 Dec 2020", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 26 days on [**2020-12-31 00:00:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-12-31%2000:00:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6sicg/intc_going_up_past_55_by_end_of_2021/geodosq/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fk6sicg%2Fintc_going_up_past_55_by_end_of_2021%2Fgeodosq%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202020-12-31%2000%3A00%3A00%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20k6sicg)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "What the fuck are you fucking talking about you dip shit?
