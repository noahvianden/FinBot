You've probably heard of FANG (or FANGMAN), which are the stocks making up over 30% of the market in Facebook, Apple, NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix. There's talks of them breaking up some of the groups to have a \"one-vision\" business and not be able to use their monopoly-like hold to branch into things like AI, healthcare, safer food processing/delivery...you know, things that would help the pandemic but are hurting the other billionaire's buddies in the Senate or House that have/invest in smaller business that are hurt by that. They aren't going anywhere, although they are volatile, all have grown, and grown, and grown. It's an aggressive approach , but that's where you want to diversify. Have some tech, some healthcare, some entertainment, and consumer type stocks that have solid backgrounds, and either good value or growth.\n\nIn fact, think about the state the world will be in for the next couple years. Healthcare, energy, and food will never go away, so look at solid stocks in those markets (what type of energy might change depending on the election, so I'd hold off on that). Invest in some healthcare stocks for the vaccine (can't really go wrong with Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson as they make a lot more than just a hopefully available soon vaccine), Zoom (ZM) has changed the way we do business and companies have seen how much it saves time/money/effort in the marketplace, so anything that makes remote access for people easier will do well.\n\nI'm gonna provide two link that'll keep you busy for days/weeks and you'll come out with every question you have answered for the most part.\n\n[https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/overview](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/overview) \\- teaches you literally everything about the market.\n\n[https://finviz.com/](https://finviz.com/) \\- a great site, especially the maps section, gives you an idea about how stocks/ETFs have done over the past day-year, with filters able to be set to see relative volume to % gain, etc.\n\nGood luck!

So even bad days on the market can be buying opportunities. Also, historically, tomorrow is the best day in the S&P 500 of the year, and the 8 days leading up to the election HISTORICALLY have been great, usually because we know who's going to win, this year, not so much with that plus COVID.\n\nAgain, good luck and may you get rich or die trying (except the die part)!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would put some in AMD since they just had a big merger and will beat earnings and you'll have a little dip to buy.

That presents a massive opportunity for those who are paying attention. Are you paying attention?\n\nThis massive short position is coupled with extremely low sentiment in the bond markets generally. In fact sentiment has just bounced off of 0%. These sort of excessive conditions are exactly what veteran traders look toward for opportunity. Typically when we see sentiment this low, we see a move upward in prices.\n\n[Source: http:\\/\\/jayonthemarkets.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/5y22bvyl5qv51.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=92f1992b11774cad1b01493e00e7ba4dc16d022e)\n\nThe hedge funds are betting on interest rates rising. They are betting on inflation. They are betting on a weak dollar. And they will be wrong on every count.\n\nThis bet stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Fed and QE operates. Let's discuss this now.\n\n# Money Printer Does NOT Go Brrrrr\n\nThis can be a complex topic, so I'll keep this as simple and brief as I can.\n\nQuantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.\n\nHere is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against. Which means if the banks aren't lending, QE funds are not entering the economy. And the banks are not lending, because they would have to risk their own capital to do so.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/rv8habwo5qv51.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=088d7eb9fbc951077497470555c158d0dfb5d738)\n\nIn fact, it's much worse than that. Because the Fed is removing bonds from the open market, and not paying cash for them. Those bonds could be sold for actual cash, which would provide actual liquidity in the market. Despite all the Fed's talk about \"creating liquidity,\" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system.\n\nWhy would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/gc1uehxq5qv51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c247dcf0587444893384c00da32371078eb7242a)\n\nSee, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through credit expansion. So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.\n\nOnly when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in \"forward guidance.\" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.\n\n# For Every Seller, There is a Buyer...\n\nWe all know that every seller needs a buyer. So who is buying the bonds that the hedge funds are shorting in record numbers?\n\nAnswer: The big commercial banks, both foreign and domestic. In other words, the Smart Money. Commercial banks have accumulated a whopping $4.464 TRILLION in securities.\n\nThe Banks are setting up a huge trap for the hedge funds, buying up their bonds for cheap and waiting for the inevitable cover. The Smart Money knows how the Fed works. They know deflation and falling interest rates are coming. And the banks are buying up bonds left and right.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/releases\\/h8\\/current\\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/anvzrxrs5qv51.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=23cc9bc56b0141a969bcb64fc518b64342a03da2)\n\nIn the last 20-year treasury auction, there were $53 billion in bids for a $22 billion offer. That's called DEMAND, folks. Foreign investors bid $16 billion and primary dealer banks bid $31 billion. The banks, both foreign and domestic, want more bonds.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.treasurydirect.gov\\/instit\\/annceresult\\/press\\/preanre\\/2020\\/R\\_20201021\\_3.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/6jn0jfov5qv51.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1704a7a5fc82052ab4891d684936f330269fa92)\n\nThe banks also control lending standards. They are not showing much willingness to open up business and lend. They know that would be risky, because the economy still has not truly recovered. They likely also know that stock prices are inflated, and are prepping for the next leg down.\n\n# The Day WSB Beat the Hedge Funds?\n\nWe have a real opportunity here... An opportunity to bet WITH the Smart Money, and to help squeeze the hedge funds out of their irrational position. Also an opportunity to profit off all the ignorant speculators (looking at most of you) who don't understand how QE works, who think Powell is \"printing money\" and holding up stocks, who think inflation and higher interest rates are just around the corner, when the opposite is true.\n\nAn alliance between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, the smart and the...retarded. All to take money out of the hands of these leveraged dopes on Wall Street.\n\nInterest rates are going to zero. And bonds move inverse to yields, so we will go long bonds. Lucky for us, there is a convenient ETF that allows us to trade the long-term bond market: TLT. And yes, this ETF has options...\n\nI know what you are thinking. \"Bonds? Ok grandpa.\" TLT is no TSLA.

I honestly can’t say what a reasonable target is at this point because the market structure has changed dramatically over the past 2 years. It’s possible that the bond market will continue to fetch higher bids because of the volatile nature of the market these days. I am convinced that the new era of speculation with options trading volume exponentially outpacing past years has shifted the structure to be much more chaotic and volatile. This can be both good and bad - we will see some mini crashes and perhaps a big one at some point, but with Fed intervention I think we will rebound from those lows at a much faster pace than we have in previous decades.
