I'm an EE and design substations connecting wind/solar to the grid and our company stock has shot up 50% this last year and we are growing quite substantially and from what I hear vestas are the best turbines quality wise and have more of the market share than siemens and GE. Also important to note that note that as all of these wind farms get thrown up it's similar to Boeing selling 747's in that a significant amount of revenue comes from maintaining these. Another thing is that it's not like we are going to just pop up all these wind farms and then forget about them; the life expectancy of them is that of pretty much everything else on the grid (circuit breakers, transformers, etc)  20-25 years. So if they're this profitable in their growth stage, how profitable do you think they'll be 10-20 years from now when they have the majority of the TAM and they need to replace and maintain everything? People say China will start undercutting and take a share in the market but what they don't consider is the cost of shipping giant football field sized blades across the ocean when vestas has a factory in Colorado.

Simple example: You invest $100 with the expectation of getting $110 back in 2 years. Now the boss says you won't get the money back for 3. Your investment just dropped in value.\n\nSo coming at this as a financial professional, maybe you can help us calculate an estimate of this as it relates to Tesla. Tesla has made a pretty compelling case that they can grow at least 40-50% per year or more, for at least the next 10 years and likely more. Suppose you own $1000 worth of Tesla, and suppose it grows at 45% per year for 5 years, at which point it would be worth ~$6400. The current US inflation rate is about 1.3%, and the current 10-year US treasury rate is 0.78%. So about what do you figure would be the net present value of $6400 five years from now, compared to $1000 right now if you sold your Tesla right now?\n\nAs a shareholder, and with Tesla growing as fast as it is and as it is expected to in the future, I would consider it insane to focus on near-term profits and give up that expected future growth.\n\n> Apart from that: Amazon has re-invested its earnings in projects (e.g. AWS) that investors think will be even more profitable.\n\nHow would that be different from what Tesla is doing?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You are confusing the 'growth rate' of the company with the 'growth rate' of the stock.   \nIn standard bond market terms, consider two bonds with yearly cashflows:\n\n.03  .03 .03 .03 1.03\n\n.03  .05  .08 .12  1.18\n\nThe second one is clearly worth more than the first one, and it *current* price reflects that.  Now if you change the cashflows to\n\n0 .03  .05  .08 .12  1.18 ,  it is worth less.\n\nSo... your 45% growth is priced in -- otherwise nobody would pay 400 billion (current market cap) for a company that has a current 'yield' of less than .1%.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\nThanks - OK, so I see your explanation in terms of a bond, with specified payment year by year, and in the example you gave where the total dollar return is the same but every payment is shifted a year later.\n\nAnd by \"priced in\" presumably you mean the combined evaluations of all people involved in the stock. For which there's considerable disagreement - some people appear to value the stock only by expected next year's earnings, while others look at expected earnings many years out. And many of the latter group appear to believe that a near-term drop in earnings is likely to be a glitch rather than a 1-year delay in the entire growth story - that if there were lower than expected earnings in 2021, it would have little impact on what they expect earnings to be in 2030 or cumulative 2021-2030.\n\nIn the context of your earlier comment \"The value of the company depends on both generating massive profits and generating them soon\", it's not clear to me what you mean by \"profits\". Many authors and advisors have said that it's a mistake for very fast growing companies to try to maximize for profits early on - they should instead be trying to grow the size of the company as quickly as they reasonably can, which is what Tesla largely seems to be doing lately. Others recommend working to maintain a small but positive level of profits while otherwise working to grow quickly. I know as a shareholder I'm much more impressed that they're working very quickly on four factories during a pandemic (with positive free cash flow) than I would be by some large GAAP earnings but no work on the factories.

So now some of the shorts start buying back their stock before they suffer heavy losses. And this pushes the stock up even more. This causes even more of the shorts to buy back the stock. Price moons even more. This cycle continues. This is known as a short squeeze.\n\nIt's a feedback loop.
