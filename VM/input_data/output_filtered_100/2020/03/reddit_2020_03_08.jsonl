Am concidering selling some shares to buy long term calls.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There are several factors which affect the price of an option:\n\n**-The price of the underlying stock (Inherent Value)**\n\nA call option varies directly with the stock price. That is, when the stock goes down, the price of the call option goes down, and the inverse is true as well - when the stock goes up, the price of the call option goes up.\n\nA put option varies inversely - moving in the opposite direction of a change in stock price.\n\nThe strength of this relationship - how much the call price changes each time the underlying stock price changes - is called the option's **Delta**. Now, also keep in mind that the Delta of the option changes as the stock price changes. The measure of how much the Delta changes per change in the stock price is called the **Gamma** (think of gamma as the acceleration to delta's velocity).\n\n**-The amount of time remaining until the option expires (Time Value)**\n\nThe more time until the option expires, the higher chance it has of increasing (or decreasing!) in value before expiration, so it is more valuable.\n\nSince time (unlike stock price) moves at a steady rate in one direction, the time value is greatest when the option is issued. **Theta** measures the rate at which the option value decreases each day. This is often referred to as **Theta Decay**. Theta is low when the option has a lot of time remaining and increases as the option nears expiration.\n\n**-The implied volatility of the underlying stock**\n\nOptions trading is all about trying to predict a change in the price of the stock. If the stock's price doesn't change very much or very often, the option is more likely to expire worthless. The reverse is also true - the more volatile the stock, the better chance the stock has of expiring in the money. Therefore, a stock with higher implied volatility (not the same as historical volatility - what you see when you look at the chart for the day).\n\nThe option's sensitivity to Implied Volatility is referred to as **Vega**.\n\n**-Changes in interest rates**\n\nCall options generally rise when the interest rate rises and fall when interest rates fall. Puts are the opposite. This is measured with **Rho**.\n\nSo, as you can see its quite complex and often the price of an option does *not* behave intuitively. There have been plenty of days recently when TSLA is flat or negative for the day but TSLA calls go up several percent simply due to the volatility (Vega).\n\nYou can get burned real fast with them if you don't understand them.

Not saying this is likely to happen, but just wanted to see what those contrarian factors may be.\n\n1) The fact is that this bug has a low kill rate (for now) in the working age population at 0.2% or less. The hospitalization rate for severe cases is also not clear for this age group alone, but seems to be less than the 10-20% quoted before. Potentially, this group could go back to work and just deal with the bug if kept quarantined from older or more vulnerable populations who could get sicker.\n\n2)  Rapid tests can help people determine whether to quarantine. South korean tests can already identify corona results in hours not days. There's US companies working on tests that can give a positive or negative in minutes:\n\n [https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-company-says-rapid-detection-is-needed-to-slow-spread-of-coronavirus/2087414/](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-company-says-rapid-detection-is-needed-to-slow-spread-of-coronavirus/2087414/) \n\nIf these can be deployed more broadly, they can help identify when someone needs to quarantine, before they can spread the disease\n\n3) Past pandemics have had a rapid recovery in a matter of months not years:\n\n [https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy](https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy) \n\nIn what ways is this different from past pandemics?\n\n4) China and Korea seem to have a lid on their cases and are getting back to work. So it can be done. Will have to be seen if the handwashing and quarantine of people with a sniffle will keep numbers down once the crowds build back up, but it seems it is possible. \n\nAgain, I'm not convinced any of this will save the US from the shitshow it's about to fall into for the next month or so. And certain sectors like travel and tourism are probably fucked for a long time no matter what happens. Just want to see what alternate hypothesis are out there that have a chance of driving the market broadly in the other direction. \n\nIf you can add to this DD to help it become less retarded please do.", "id": "ffbwtp", "created_utc": 1583670584.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "When the majority thinks it's going down, like when your barber tells you to move to gold.", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "\"*Buy when people are fearful.

{"title": "COVID DD", "selftext": "If you're not in bear gang, it's not too late to join, and I suggest you do so promptly because shits about to hit the fan frens. That being said, I plan on riding the \"V\" down and up on this one, and lastly, if you're a perma bull you're in luck I've got some companies at the bottom that I think will go up over the next few months.\n\n**What's about to happen:**\n\nLet's stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: \"*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* \" [\\[1\\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)\n\nSince H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you've probably had it at one point or another -- it's just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...\n\nFirst off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it's one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\\[4\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it'll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\\[5\\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&geo1=01). There's also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\\[6\\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/).\n\nBuddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is 'Map Virus' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that's how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one 'chad spreader'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it'll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it's already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\\[8\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).\n\nWhat matters is that we can see that something like \\~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \\~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \\~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire...\n\nIf we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we've got evidence of that already [\\[9\\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).\n\nBut that's not all. Italy is fucked. They just announced a quarantine of 1/4 of their fucking population [\\[10\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70). Take wild guess how that's going to fare for their economy. The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it's highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\\[11\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what's going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.\n\nSo let's get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\\[12\\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \\~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.\n\nHowever, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we're looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we're looking at a total of \\~60.8 million infected in a year's time. This corresponds to \\~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \\~1.16m people dead [\\[14\\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza).\n\nNow, I'm willing to bet that my boy Donnie isn't interested in losing a massive chunk of his voting block so I'm betting that we see quarantines very soon in the USA, entire cities shut down just like we've seen in China and just like we've seen in Italy and Iran. It's going to happen and when it does, the lemmings will be shocked. I mean, this shouldn't come as a surprise, there's already runs on toilet paper in Australia over this thing [\\[15\\]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/australians-scrap-toilet-rolls-coronavirus-panic-buying-200308014116516.html).\n\nAnyways, I think we'll get a cure eventually and that everybody reading this will be fine, in fact I'm not a doomer whatsoever. Society will continue on and SPY will eventually recover and I'll join bull gang again, but I'm sure Monday will be a bloodbath after Italy quarantined like 16 million people.\n\nBut back to my point, just think about what'll happen to SPY when a US city announces a quarantine. They're already preparing for it by declaring states of emergency now [\\[16\\]](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-202-declaring-disaster-emergency-state-new-york). The fear will be real and it already is...\n\n**EDIT:** Figured I'd add a bit more on Canada as I don't think it's priced in up there quite yet. Again, I took some numbers from StatsCanada [\\[17\\]](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-520-x/2010001/t334-eng.htm) and plugged them in against current known mortality rates and we ended up with this [\\[18\\]](https://imgur.com/a/YBX7XFV). Estimated 234k dead which... is bad, but that's a flood of dead people in a short amount of time. Also I assume a 30% infection rate but I think this things going to have a much high infection rate because of the fact that we corral all our old into old folks homes... it just takes one sick caretaker and they've all got it and the worst part is that you can have it and spread it without even knowing [\\[19\\]](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission-chinese-woman-relatives-2020-2). So this basically becomes a catch-22. If elderly care takers don't show up to work because they're sick, elderly people die, if they do show up, there's a chance they're giving them COVID-19, it just takes one and they'll all catch it... real morbid stuff. Basically each old folks home is a tranche in a CDO for the few of you retards that know what I'm talking about...\n\nSo how do we profiteer from this? And what will inevitably transpire?\n\n**EDIT 2:** [SPX e-minis currently trading at shy of -5%... we're hitting the circuit breakers tomorrow. Fed will drop rates again by end of week.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/es00)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know half of you retards skipped to here but kudos to the champions that read everything I wrote.\n\n1. General stock market decline, puts on $SPY or high beta stocks if IV isn't too high\n2. for my perma-bull frens, calls on funeral home and burial companies: $SCI, $CSV, $MATW, $PLC:CA, $DTY:UK, etc. **EDIT:** (as u/dollarsandcents101 pointed out be careful on funeral homes... could ban funerals if this thing really get's going)\n3. Puts on old folks care homes because those are probably going to be vacant here very shortly and thus less cash flows to investors... stocks like: $WELL, $VTR $OHI, **EDIT:** $CSH.UN:CA (Canadian, option chain is a lot less liquid than USA so... be careful), SIA:CA (another one, already crashing, has options, less liquid though)\n4. I'm still bearish airlines and travel... I mean go look at the chart of $AAL. After 9/11 that stock went from $40 a share to literally $2 a share... in 2003. The same thing happened during the GFC, stock again went from over $40 a share to a fucking penny stock -- traded at like $0.30 per share. Get ready for round 3... I look forward to buying calls on airlines after this is all over.\n5. bearish any developing country/emerging market ETF's. They're going to get hit hard.\n6. I don't know anything about medical or medical research stocks but calls and puts on companies researching corona virus cure. Again... correct me if I'm wrong but to my understanding it's zero-sum, the company that gets a solid cure makes bank and the rest are fucked but again idk this isn't my area whatsoever. Also looks like a lot of these stocks are rocketing and IV is massive so I'm sitting on the sidelines on this one\n\nIf you're from r/all wanting to get in on the tendies, I saved a special one just for you!

We've had past scares like H1N1 or ebola that didn't have any major impact. But my it seemed clear that the characteristics of this new virus was disruptive and dangerous enough to seriously affect the behavior of economic actors and thus negatively impact the economy as a whole. Here's some highlights of what was discussed:\n\n>This is why I said for nCoV to \"blow over\", an affordable treatment needs to be developed pretty much right now. Think about it, who would unnecessarily risk a trip to the movies or take a vacation with the risk of a catching HIGHLY infectious disease that spreads in many ways and spreads asymptomatically and can outright KILL you at up to a 25% probability without hospitalization?\n\n>**Affordable and effective treatment SOON and vaccines before the next flu seasons are crucial to avoiding lasting economic decline**\n\n>But why would there be economic decline? Well, because people will change their behavior as long as the threat of the virus remains. Let's look at what industries will be affected:\n\n- All tourism industry related businesses in Asia will take a huge hit. I'm talking about airlines, hotels, tours, restaurants, tourist destinations, markets, etc.\n\n- Reports already show that business declined by as much as 80% in some tourism driven markets in Thailand. Overall air traffic in China has shrunk from over 17,000 daily flights to 5,000. Hotels, cruises, flights are getting canceled left and right.\n\n- **Many businesses that run on tight margins and those with complex supply chains and a Just-in-Time manufacturing strategy will be seriously hit by this and may even have to file for bankruptcy.** Let's take something like restaurants into consideration. The ones who specialize in deliveries may actually thrive in this market but most restaurants that depend on foot traffic or has high markups and depend on ambience to attract customers will suffer or shutter. They have to keep paying expensive rent and other overhead costs while customers may take months to slowly return. \n\n- **Expect a lot of businesses to start massive layoffs.** Vulnerable Asian airlines will be first. Many airlines like China Airline are already halting recruiting new flight attendants. Others like Cathay Pacific which has negative operating cash flow are asking their crew to take up to month long unpaid leave. They are canceling up to 50% of their flights stretching into at least march. How can they possibly remove the threat of this virus if no treatment/vaccine has been developed? The reason they are shutting down flights will therefore persist, and they will suffer a prolonged period of diminished business.\n\n- **America and the West will also feel the reverberations of China's hard fall.** The ways that the West's economy is tied to China's is too much to even try to list. But just understand that the biggest growth of profit over the last 20 years for many of the largest companies have come from China's consumer class. If that consumer class is not buying stuff, stocks will tank. Companies that spent the last 10 years using cheap debt to finance growth may go into bankruptcy when they are faced from such a drastic and sudden dip in their business. Expect all the weak poorly run businesses to get shaken up and many of them failing in the coming months. \n\n- There will be a feedback loop. There are many industries we can FOR SURE predict big problems for in 2020. We are guaranteed to see layoffs in airlines (especially Asian airlines) in the coming months. Set a reminder on this comment if you don't believe. I can even name you specific companies that will probably go bankrupt.\n\n- **Layoffs will compound upon itself. When airlines, hotels, restaurants, malls, etc are firing workers, the workers won't have money to spend on buying things. This means other businesses may suffer enough to also start firing some workers. Businesses in 2020 overall are so overleveraged that a large percentage of them are not going to be able to handle even a few months of lower business.** They simply can't pay all the expenses and the debt obligation.\n\n>So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our \"dip\".\n\nAfter I posted this thread, the market (American) went on to make record breaking all time highs. I believe a few things are responsible for this:\n\n- Capital flight from Asia\n\n- Monetary actions from China and other nations\n\n- Poor modeling of previous \"health scares\" including the much talked about \"V-shaped recovery\"\n\n- Use of lagging indicators. There is still news coming out of \"positive economic news\" like ones regarding unemployment.\n\n- Downplay of the virus by governments and international health organization WHO\n\n- Pure ignorance (this was the \"it's just the flu\" period)\n\nAfter a month, we've come to find out some more information about the virus. Some are bad but there are some good news as well.\n\n**Let's start with the good news:**\n\n- Various currently available drugs like Chloroquine have shown efficacy in treating infected patients. Don't expect peer reviewed studies anytime soon, this is just based on what was observed in China where health officials tried throwing all types of drugs at it until they noticed Chloroquine seems to work.\n\n- [Speculation] Heat and humidity may play a part in slowing the spread of the virus: see Singapore, India where they have tested a significant number of patients. Singapore is especially transparent and aggressive in finding cases. If they can contain this as a travel hub, then they may have a roadmap for our own containment once the weather warms. Other coronaviruses also slowed in heat\n\n- [Speculation] Diet may play a part in the spread of the virus. Indian diet rich in Curcumin/Turmeric may have an advantage in either fighting infection or dealing with the symptoms of infection. Hundreds of Indian students were evacuated from the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak and not a single one was infected after quarantine and testing.\n\n- Let's all hope the weather can give the Northern Hemisphere some much needed help in combating this virus (stay out of the Southern Hemisphere)\n\n**Now some bad news:**\n\n- [Controversial] The virus may have mutated at least once. The newer strain is more aggressive. This was a fear that was talked about in the thread from a month ago:\n\n>RNA viruses like nCoV mutates extremely quickly. This means potential resistance or immunization from catching nCoV once may be lost if the virus mutates enough. This also means that there may never be permanent immunization. Any vaccine developed for it may only be effective for a portion of the mutations. And each flu season may bring many different strains of this virus that will be unaffected by developed vaccines. In other words, nCoV may be here to stay, much like other flu viruses.\n\n- It is being reported that it is possible to catch both strains at once (Chinese Journal National Science Review)\n\n- [Speculation] Guangdong reports up to 13% of patients tested positive for virus again weeks after \"recovering\". There are many possible explanations for this, some are benign but there have been several reports from health officials in various parts of China that they're seeing reinfection. Some viruses, the ones that target and manipulate the immune system response, cause more damage the second/third+ time of infection. Some diseases use our antibodies to cause more damage. \n\n- Patients who \"recovered\" from the virus including the recent man in his 30's die after recovery. There is lasting lunge damage in some patients. This means worse lunge function and injuries that allow for opportunistic infections.\n\n- WHO saying around 20% of infected cases require hospitalization. These patients have pneumonia and will drown in lunge liquid if they don't get on ventilators or as a worst case scenario ECMO machines. There are 300 ECMO machines in America. \n\n- Very little has been done to contain virus spread in America. Up to a few days ago, only 500 have been tested compared to tens of thousands in South Korea, a nation a fraction the size/wealth of us. For over a month since China shut its country down, we didn't even have a working test kit. The earlier one was defective.\n\n**Will things get better or worse?**\n\n- For America, things will get much worse before it gets better.\n\nEdit: This sub is preventing me from posting the second part of my analysis and shadow deleting my comments, please read the continuation here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fexlqx/the_coronavirus_is_vastly_under_appreciated/fjt4h07/", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "sorry I need positions at the end to even think about reading that", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "so your thesis is \"shit's pretty bad, buy puts\"\n\nyou're not wrong it was just a lot of effort to say that is all i'm saying", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "what put would be good for that", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "yeah ive been telling everyone at our job this, resort in nj, however between member, golf and locals well be fine, just gonna have alot of staff cutbacks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\none thing missing from this is the worlds economy is completely based on the american economy. and when america is fucked, rest of the world is fucked.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "...more toilet paper for our bungholes?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Calls on $CAT \n\nSomeone has to supply enough bulldozers to dig the mass graves", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Man this shit reminds me of the first half of \"The Stand\"", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "no idea if you are joking, but yeah funerals are banned in Italy now.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "They're banned here in Italy now", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Funerals banned in Italy confirmed", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Is WSB turning smart?

{"title": "Why Volatility is Here To Stay: The Market Will Continue to Have Large Swings", "selftext": "How long will the VIX continue to remain above 40? Why do we still have 100 point swings and why do we have face ripping dips and rallies? As previously mentioned, this correction was the fastest in history and the markets haven't experienced volatility like this since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSo let's take a look at what happened since the 2008 financial crisis:\n\n[SPY 15 Yr\\/1 Wk](https://preview.redd.it/dpr1jcm5yhl41.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=851140c510db69678317f70dfc9b14329f9731ca)\n\nThe rapid selling of 1 week reached a selling climax and found support at 284.82, the October 2019 low. On 3/3/20 at 10 am, the Fed announced an emergency 50 bps rate cut, where SPY briefly peaked at 313.84. In effect, we are **range bound between 313.84 and 284.82.** Think of this as the high volatility zone.\n\n[SPY 10 Day\\/ 30 min](https://preview.redd.it/hnve7b88yhl41.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b35e48cea5686669c1aec2fcc643b02d4c56483)\n\nThis is not the first time that this pattern has occurred in market cycles. Wyckoff provides a convenient road map. \\[1\\] This is not to say that we are in accumulation phase. On the contrary, I believe we will continue to the downside and we will enter a distribution phase to the downside. 285.54 served as our lower bound in our trading range, upon which a large automatic rally happened and was short lived.\n\nMarket makers do not necessarily trade stocks or options like we do. We have to realize they really trade off of volatility. As previously noted, when autists such as ourselves rapidly purchase options, market makers purchase the underlying asset in order to delta hedge or be delta neutral, and take advantage of the change in gamma and vega. Think of the delta as the first rate of change of the asset, and that gamma is the second derivative, the rate of change of the rate of change. Thus, while delta is linear, gamma is non-linear and really gives you the tendies in a long position. Theta is the rate of time decay, and eats away at your profits. The gamma flip happened at around 325, since MM are more or less net short starting when we passed the 283.2% retracement from the 2008 lows, and the probability of options being in the money favored puts.\n\n[SPY Put\\/Call Gamma and Prob. ITM](https://preview.redd.it/6p15fc4ayhl41.png?width=2822&format=png&auto=webp&s=de285a520d658f5a43fde439f30171e333592890)\n\nStarting around the 325 strike, you can see there are large increases in gamma for both put and call positions, along with corresponding changes in the probability of being in the money. Okay, so MM are most likely short gamma, we are in a place of high volatility, and VIX will continue to remain at elevated levels in this range-bounded zone. So what's next? The biggest problem right now facing the market is uncertainty. Thus, it is highly likely that we are going to retest the 285 low, which Wyckoff refers to as a secondary test based on the price action on 3/6/20. The 2% rally in the last 10-15 min of trading is mostly MM short covering. Everyone screaming that the Fed is pumping like clockwork need to realize that MM want to close and lock in profits after 2 red days, especially when heading into the weekend. Due to this uncertainty and with additional bad news expected over the weekend, I believe we are going to still face more downside as we close near the 285, before having another large rally to the upside.\n\n[Largest option sales for SPY 3\\/6\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/z93o3b4dyhl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=1488df1baba93fff4bff418f9a01e4e2f946e058)\n\nThis is supported by the large amount of March 20 calls and April 17 puts purchased within the last few hours of trading. Between 305-307 is the 200 DMA and EMA. These call options were purchased at a discount, and will most likely be used for a hedge when the ST bounce and squeeze happens. However, it appears that a lot of MM expect the S&P to hit around 270-285, with 285 the lower end of the trading range. 281 and 273 are the August and June 2019 low's respectively.\n\nThe question over the coming weeks is will continue to rally, form new resistance, and then break out of this high volatility zone? Let's take a look at the number of cases of coronavirus within the United States.\n\n[Coronavirus reported infections, Jim Bianco](https://preview.redd.it/nqjloalkyhl41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7091f7aeb7c59b3b068fb84ae0d885c426d47ad6)\n\nNote the Y-axis is logarithmic. This means that unless we see a plateauing, or curvature of the line for cases, we are in an exponential phase of growth. Again, we as humans have a relatively easy time grasping linear relations (e.g. delta), but have difficulty rationalizing exponential or non-linear trends (gamma/exponential). As of 11:20 AM, EST, the US has 340 confirmed cases. Another increase of approximately 20% cases compared to yesterday.\n\nCDC reports 164 cases and 11 deaths. Simply dividing case number by deaths does not give the true mortality, since there is a delay of 1-2 weeks from the incubation period. However, this number would be even higher since the CDC had fewer cases. For this example, we will just divide case number and deaths for now, giving a mortality rate of 6.7%. WHO estimates a mortality of 3.4% which is close to what Italy has. In reality, due to limited testing, the mortality rate might be closer to 1% which is 10x higher than the flu. How many undiagnosed cases do we really have in the United States? The next few weeks will reveal a problem orders of magnitude larger than expected. Hence, a retest of the 285 will be essential to test the resilience of the market.\n\nThe American Hospital association is predicting 1-2% of patients will require ICU care. ICU units are distinguished from the ER due to the necessity of advanced life support systems such as a mechanical ventilator to aid in breathing.\n\n[AHA report to hospitals](https://preview.redd.it/l20zac9myhl41.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=430e81606c1a9e4d9396dd55393fb2c64f31d2d3)\n\nLet's say the US takes proactive measures and has 1/10th of these cases. 9.6 million affected, 480,000 admitted to the hospital, and 190,000 requiring ICU intervention. How many beds are in the US ready for ICU treatment? How many are occupied already? If patients cannot access critical care, this will be the tipping point for the US. This is already occurring in Italy and South Korea, where patients need to be transferred to other hospitals due to the overwhelming number of cases each hospital treats. This is explained well in this tweet. \\[2\\]\n\n[Critical care beds in the USA](https://preview.redd.it/qqfbh2hoyhl41.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c5fd3877dc08f35e7db9108bfb8cab5ad0e269f)\n\nOne more quick note. During high financial stress and downside, gold will be quickly sold and liquidated in order to cover other positions. We are repeatedly entering cycles where gold hits new highs, followed by large swings in the S&P. These are good opportunities to enter quick short positions as gold hits new highs.\n\n[GLD 10 D\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/7137nb5qyhl41.png?width=2114&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b92f7019b1b151da4e85d5e8ec88fca9d454a7)\n\nPending another large leg down, especially around the 285 retest, we will see gold quickly sold off again despite the bullish nature of the options. Only until we exit the high volatility zone, do I believe gold will stabilize and continue a run up higher. Before this occurs however, we may see gold prices reach 1400-1500 first. Note the Jun 30 puts at 148 strike.\n\n[Largest option sales for GLD 3\\/6\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/p316ycbtyhl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=05897c01445a7d5120f8fb8cc0ac307d8a46dc7a)\n\nThings to look at are the 10-yr, additional pending rate cuts from the next FOMC meeting, and oil prices. Commodities tend to provide a more clean signal compared to equities about the global macroeconomic status. This is not a game between bear vs. bull. Look for key levels, position before the large moves. Look for patterns. This is us, WSB, vs. the market makers.\n\n**tl;dr Range bound 285-315. Going to retest 285 before moving back to 315. Buckle up, going to be a lot of large swings as volatility will stay high or even increase. Coronavirus cases going to go boom. Gold will move to the upside, but be careful for a large drop.**\n\n**Just to be SUPER clear, long term puts at April are being played by MM. But there will be a bounce soon since we are so oversold. MM have prepared for this by purchasing large amounts of March 20 calls. Be prepared for their games.**\n\n\\[1\\] - [https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\\_analysis:the\\_wyckoff\\_method](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method)\n\n\\[2\\] - [https://twitter.com/LizSpecht/status/1236095180459003909](https://twitter.com/LizSpecht/status/1236095180459003909)\n\nUpdate 1 3/7/20: US has now 401 cases, an increase of 18% in just 5 hours.\n\nUpdate 2 3/8/20: WTI oil looking at a 20-25% drop upon opening of futures later today. Can update with a new post if people are interested.\n\nUSA confirmed cases 484 as of 4:10 EST. Most likely hit more than 500 by tomorrow. 1-2000 by next week. Around 3-4000 at least by end of month.\n\n[\\/ES futures 6pm EST 3\\/8\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/llotkyapuil41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=75b45dbc07f02270e12c8f2c981655e5e30d5fcc)\n\nJust made a new low on the /ES futures. Bouncing again at 285, the lower range. Most likely going to sell puts at the open.\n\nWow, we just hit 30/barrel of WTI. Insane. We are witnessing history guys. Seeing a lot of comments about buying USO calls, saying this is the bottom. People have been trying to call the bottom on oil for months now. Still seeing us retest $26.05.\n\n[\\/CL futures 6:05 EST 3\\/8\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/dak7qsp6vil41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=0487ddf33ac2ed0a35df769024943fd9184a2000)\n\nAnother contrarian indicator given the price action. Even though we have hit -5% in /ES and passed 2850, there's actually tens of thousands of puts OTM purchased on TLT during Friday. Now that begets the question, if treasuries are the safe haven asset as more people are selling, then who is buying these puts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69a2ljz2mkl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9874d98b41439c80601ef87e030a90f964d9683\n\nUpdate 3 3/9/19 - Given the nature of limit downs, people are going to be running for the exits. Wouldn't be surprised to see us hit the 7% breaker. I think there will be intervention before hitting the lower ones to prevent mass panic. SPY 273.09 is the June 2019 low.\n\nUpdate 4 3/9/19 - Look at this call positioning from this morning for SPX. They are loading up on the cheap for 3/20.\n\n[3\\/9\\/20 SPX options](https://preview.redd.it/ndu2thpk2ol41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=1381c3d1a4a7071a3c3e68c5d06c0def76f226c3)\n\nRetest of the -5% at the previous 285 was rejected. Ended lower than -7% circuit breaker and even below the August 2019 low at 273.09, creating a sign of weakness. Larger sell volume present in the final hours of trading. Most likely going to continue to the downside, but still expecting a bounce which will be used to shake out people holding their puts.\n\n[3\\/9\\/20 SPY 20 D\\/1 Hr](https://preview.redd.it/9ial8viumpl41.png?width=2114&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2b5e8f20ad2525efe405bd86f8bcee384ac865)\n\nUpdate 5 3/10/20 - Climbed back into the 285-315 channel before breaking down again from that news from CNBC. Still think we will pop back into the channel during the cash open as MM seek to test supply in the upthrust phase, and try to nab as many puts as they can. As with most trading days the past few weeks, the last hour of trading will be the most revealing. I expect significant accumulation of 4/17 puts.\n\n[3\\/10\\/20 SPY 10 D\\/30 Min](https://preview.redd.it/yqkc8xqlbul41.png?width=2114&format=png&auto=webp&s=849ccf6406ad2f612a1a76342cfd4ddd6f2c6ae8)\n\nUpdated new post today: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgnqbh/was\\_the\\_circuit\\_breaker\\_on\\_monday\\_an\\_engineered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgnqbh/was_the_circuit_breaker_on_monday_an_engineered/)", "id": "ffh9cd", "created_utc": 1583694389.0, "score": 2101, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 326, "comments": [{"body": "It is people like you who make this sub worth refreshing every fifteen seconds as I begrudgingly drag on through my sad life on the weekend with no flashy dildos to stare at.
