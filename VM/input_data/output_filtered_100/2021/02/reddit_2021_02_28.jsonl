{"title": "Options trading opportunity costs compared to passive (index funds) investing", "selftext": "Almost everything in life has opportunity costs/trade-offs.  For investing or trading there are a lot of strategies: passive (index funds) to aggressive (WSB gambling style) with many options within that range.\n\nFor passive index fund investing:\n\n1) Almost zero time investment on my part - just set automatic investing based on payroll dates and forget it.  I can use free time in other parts of my life or on other ways to earn additional money if I wanted.\n\n2) Over the long term, expected return is about 10% (not adjustment for inflation) - for example, DJIA is about 10%/year (so, $100 in one year will be $110).\n\n3) Favorable tax treatment of capital gains (long-term gains since these are long-term investments) - 0-20%.\n\nFor options trading:\n\n1) Requires more time than passive investing in index funds.\n\n2) Likely will result in higher annual returns.  I just took a simple example of WalMart shares and ran some numbers using the wheels strategy.  I roughly calculated 20% annual returns.  Of course, there are higher risks here too (compared to passive investing).\n\n3) Less favorable treatment of investment / earned returns (short-term capital gains) - 0-37%\n\nHere is a question to this group: how much time does it take you to trade options (for our example, let's assume you also have a regular job) and what have been your turns (if you don't mind sharing)?  In other words, is it worth trading options from the financial returns, additional risks, higher taxes (that diminish your ultimate take-home pay) vs passive investing?", "id": "luj60g", "created_utc": 1614527666.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "3 percent a month for eight  years leads to X amount, 6 percent a month leads to 10 X the amount.\n\nWe doubled our rate and ten timed our return.

Of course you are only getting paid that, for the immense amount of work you will have to put in, to prepare yourself.

If we look at Jan 2023 calls for QQQ, the 95 delta call has a strike of 175, and the mid price is about 152 (bid-ask spreads are wider on these long-dated options). Adding 175 to 152 gives us our breakeven price of 327, and QQQ is trading at almost 323 - this means that the **extrinsic** value of the option sits at around $4. You'll incur theta decay, but it's just on that extrinsic value of $4 over 2+ years, so it's not really that bad. I like to think of that $4 as the fee you pay for leverage and a capped downside (you're protected if QQQ crashes below your strike of 175, wheras with buy-and-hold you have full downside exposure).\n\nThe other method is a synthetic long position - you sell a put and buy a call at the same strike, which has a theoretical performance identical to holding 100 shares of the underlying. If we look at QQQ, I can sell the 320 put and buy the 320 call at a net debit of 1.52 at the mid price. This means for $152 I can enter a position that's equivalent to buying 100 shares of QQQ at 320. Theta decay doesn't really enter into the picture here, since you have a long and a short position at the same strike, they should (roughly) balance out.\n\nThe major benefit of these methods is that they are more capital-efficient - whether you pay for the call or you put up a margin requirement for the short put, you're looking at about ~40% of the capital required versus buy-and-hold. The downside is that you are ultimately paying some money for this capital efficiency, and you aren't collecting dividends as you would for buy-and-hold (though with QQQ div yield of 0.55%, this may not be much of an issue).\n\nAlso worth noting that LEAP positions, if held longer than one year, are taxed at long-term cap gain rates if you're in the USA - same tax treatment as if you were doing buy-and-hold.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I sell the option and buy a the farthest out option available.

The put can be cheaper and further out. Since you are in it for the long haul, NO MATTER where Tesla goes over the next couple of years, just keep reestablishing the collar every month/week. With effective execution and paying some attention to certain adjustments,  you can reduce your basis on Tesla to a very low dollar amount if not nothing. This way your downside and upside are both limited, but since you immediately reestablish it, and since you are receiving a credit each time (makes sense to lose more on the downside as you were initially bullish on the stock, but that does not really matter if you are sharp enough), you are effectively reducing your cost basis on Tesla.\n\nSo basically I am just asking you to write the same call, but add a further otm put. If the call gets past it's strike, close the position and re-establish the collar. Same for the downside. But instead of a leap, we are working with weekly's and monthly's.\n\nIf you are ready to put some work in, and read up a little, you might as well net a whole million of this over the next two or three years, instead of netting 200 k and undertaking the FULL downside risk.

If they think the price is gonna go down but they've held this contract for a while and now it's expiring but they have no confidence in the stock then they'll probably let the contract expire. I know it sounds like a ton of money, at it is, but we also have to remember that the cost of premium is basically cost of doing business. It's literally like insurance. I don't like spending money on car insurance if I never use it but I'd much rather have it in case I need to file a claim. Buying a contract is something similar....if the stock goes to moon, I'd much rather have a contract I can exercise to secure a lower price. In your case, you most likely wouldn't be buying contracts in those amounts until you get your feet wet. The premium also should be only a fraction of your cash position. Because if the premium is already high and you exhaust your funds on just buying a contract, imagine what the strike price is and you'll need way more money to exercise the contract and call away the stock. In this example $1,421 x 100 (options trade in lots of 100 shares). I'm again speaking from the other side....you'd be opposite of that if you're selling a contract of course. Don't you EVER sell a Covered Call without owning the stock. It's called a NAKED CALL and ultimately the most risky strategy in options trading. If the contracts gets exercised and you don't have the shares and the price is mooning, the loss infinite. COVERED CALLS on the other hand are totally safe. You write calls on a stock you own and can collect premiums hoping they'll never exercise the contract so you keep your stock. You don't even need a hedge strategy at that point.

Expected moves are useful for spotting opportunity or managing risk but they are also important for trade strategies in options themselves, for instance with strike selection. I'll start with SPY, also check in on Gamestop, before looking at companies reporting earnings this week. With the earnings stocks, I've included their prior earnings actual moves for comparison. \n\nIn case I missed something you're tracking, a searchable list with the expected move and prior earnings moves can be found on the Options AI calendar.

In other words, it's all about the weekly options and retail demand for not so cheap upside calls:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zb5cdzqyjak61.gif\n\nSpeaking of Gamestop, I wrote again last week about how nuts the options are and that they're practically giving away call spreads when compared to out-of-the-money calls. Also, how directional butterflies can be used for bearish positioning, as implied volatility usually gets killed in these stocks as they go lower and out of the money puts can get crushed even while getting the direction right. Worth a read if you're involved in Gamestop or any similar stocks, the article is on LEARN [here](https://learn.optionsai.com/gamestop-and-high-volatility-options/) and is very similar to a post I wrote on r/options a few weeks ago.

The best way to think about the two is that the nearer dated option will be more sensitive to the IV collapse after earnings in one way, but the longer dated will be in another way, and what the stock does on earnings will determine how it will play out. Here's an oversimplified explanation:\n\nThe nearer dated option will have more overall extrinsic premium because it is simply worth more being closer to ATM. It will also be trading at a higher IV, because it is closer to the event and the IV will be downward sloping as you go out in time. However! The OTM options are pure vega, as they are 100% extrinsic premium so more of what they are made up of is sensitive to IV coming in. Not to mention, the nearer dated option is only one contract whereas the farther dated is two. So the first direct comparison to be made is what is the net amount of extrinsic premium between the two.\n\nAnd here's the nuanced part. It depends what the stock does. If the stock goes up on earnings, but not enough to make the OTM calls ITM, the ITM option will do much better, because its intrinsic deltas will be making money off the move higher. And it's likely that those deltas more than make up for any losses on the extrinsic premium coming in due to IV coming in. \n\nOf course, if the stock went above the OTM Calls, you'd have two of them and they would start to see the same effect x2. But from a pure probability standpoint, the ITM/ATM call is the more likely event.

Ant was dramatically overleveraged, and regulators  stepped in to prevent a collapse. [https://www.techbuzzchina.com/newsletter/signup/extra-buzz-19-ant-group-the-biggest-ipo-that-wasnt?fbclid=IwAR3T9V0ThoGj3W-vS3e-TCZJ1wpyKXJkmBZoUXLYeMBIpBcaMy1COgw2Qbs](https://www.techbuzzchina.com/newsletter/signup/extra-buzz-19-ant-group-the-biggest-ipo-that-wasnt?fbclid=IwAR3T9V0ThoGj3W-vS3e-TCZJ1wpyKXJkmBZoUXLYeMBIpBcaMy1COgw2Qbs)\n\nNow to BABA, they trade at 27 times earnings. Coca Cola, the trusty dividend company, trades at 28 times earnings. Forward PE is even more egregious. BABA has sturdy competition in its retail business from Pinduoduo and JD, but BABA operates a platform with ancillary tools to keep merchants there, giving staying power. BABA is the leader in the transition to cloud (47% in 2019 according to Canalys). BABA is the inversed Amazon in terms of profitability. BABA makes money from their retail platform, doesn't get into the weeds, and is currently sacrificing profitability for market share in cloud.\n\nFurthermore, BABA has stakes in a wide range of logistics and consumer service companies. Even after appropriately discounting ADR and BABA being a Chinese company, to me it's criminally undervalued trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO while having clear future growth. Would love to hear how BABA deserves this low multiple.\n\nTLDR: BABA has growth in cloud, even after writing off their retail growth, with stakes in many companies, acting as a counterweight to the giant Tencent, all while trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO.\n\nPosition: 3 shares at $246 (sad college kid noises)\n\nEdit: KO is a comparison to show low the market is pricing BABA's future growth.\n\n2nd Edit: \"Criminally Undervalued\" was my Substack writing bleeding over into real life.

You can't actually own a 'share' of these Chinese companies. The China market would be a great high-growth, moderately high risk market to invest into.\n\nInstead you are buying a share in a VIE. When you invest in BABA you are buying a share of a shell company in the Cayman Islands. That company has a contract to send the actual Alibaba in China capital for a contractual right to the company's profits in the future. It should be noted at this stage they do not issue dividend's, so this contractual promise isn't fully enacted yet.\n\nThat is the intermediary that matters, not the language barrier. Anyone can read the numbers. This shell company, or it's shareholders, doesn't own stock in Alibaba and has no voting power in Alibaba. From the country and the company, all the foreign investors get is a contractual promise that they don't want to ruin the trust of this relationship so they can continue to attract foreign investment.\n\nAnother issue is China is slowly taking away any independence Hong Kong had. Hong Kong is critical, because it has served as financial geopolitical intermediary between the free capitalist markets across the world and the semi-state controlled markets inside China. As they tighten down more, it increases risk of the state control of the financial conduits between these two types of markets.\n\nMedium and long term there is definitely more risk in this set up for the foreign investor and the risk could come from the individual company or from country-level policy.\n\nThe other problem is the Communist Party/Xi, even if the Jack Ma relationship was normalizing, sent a clear message that they will be concerned at anymore growth that gives them more market share and there will be ongoing anti-trust concerns. They are directly nervous about the monopoly power. The problem is BABA is priced to reflect future growth, especially having no current dividend. It would be worth more if we knew they were safe to gain market share much more without attracting regulators, so I'm forced to calculate a value more on their current profits now vs. growth in profits later.\n\nAlso, KO is a bad American/domestic comparison. AMZN would be best.  KO is a value company with less room to grow, but makes a strong profit that generates dividends @ 3.43% over the long-term and they have a safer, stable position in the market for their products. There is lower uncertainty and a wider moat with future competition. With such a high dividend, that is why it prices so well, investors are getting direct returns quicker. AMZN is in similar industries and it a Growth company with no dividend where investors are placing a higher value on the company due to perceived future growth. There is more uncertainty, because we don't know how much competition might develop in the future as that market is still developing overall. Same can be said for BABA.\n\nStill, China is a very large market with lots of room to grow. This means a great deal of potential.\n\nMy recommendation... treat this more carefully and slightly more speculatively. I keep my investment in China <1% of my total Portfolio and I try to keep that in multiple companies. Don't lose sight that these are mostly Growth companies and make sure to keep your portfolio balanced with Value companies -and- make sure you factor in a little more risk than you would with a domestic company where you have a solid ownership share. As a BABA investor myself, China just sent a message of higher risk on future growth.

This is a problem.  This is also why the world’s balance sheet is negative.  There’s accounting fraud going on, and the dollar is a depreciating asset.

I’m making a new one instead of editing the other so you’ll see it.  The overall balance of a country is referred to as its [Net International Investment Position (NIIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_international_investment_position).\n\nIf you add up the NIIP of every country in the list in that link, you’ll notice that Earth is $3.9T in debt to itself.  There may be countries not in that list, but I wouldn’t expect them to make an appreciable difference.  So $3.9T so far, and that number is accelerating.  In fact, it can’t not accelerate or there would be deflation and the economy would collapse.  Some people think this can keep going forever, and I understand their thinking on the matter, but in my opinion - history shows that eventually inflation collapses a currency.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "From my perspective that $3.9T is only half of the picture. If I may borrow an overused and simplified analogy. If I as a parent give my daughter an IOU for $20, then the Net Parent Investment Position would be $20. If every parent on my street did this - there are 6 houses - we are looking at a street-wide NPIP of $120. I admit that does sound bad. But the other half of the equation that makes it net to 0 in my head is that this $120 is a debit. That means there is also a $120 of credit held by all the kids on the street. If we then sum the debit (-$120) and credit ($120), the net position of the street is actually 0.\n\nOvertime the kids on the street may mark down the debt by returning the $120 to their parents - maybe in exchange for sweets. So my daughter may give me $10 of that $20 in exchange for some chocolate biscuits. Now the NPIP is $120 - $10 = $110. But the outstanding credit is also $120 - $10 = $110, so the net position is still 0. This will hold true whether we give more IOUs to our kids or they spend them for sweets and so reduce supply, etc.\n\nSo I think I'm not overly worried by increasing debt, by itself at least. I do think debt is a problem for households like you and me, simply because we don't have the ability to create new IOUs out of thin air. In the above analogy, each parent is a currency-issuing state and each child is a citizen of it.\n\nI am worried about balance sheet recessions, given how much debt private citizens owe to banks, so I think contrary to intuition it is good for the government to temporarily accelerate stimulus to help households get a grip on their own debt. (Maybe private debt isn't such a problem in the US, idk!) But yeah, government debt I am not so worried about!\n\nSpecifically regarding hyperinflation and the parent-child analogy: I would worry if the supply of sweets dropped and parents on the street started issuing loads of new IOUs - which actually is precisely what has happened over the last year with Covid19!! However, with a strong vaccination rollout - the US and the UK are doing really well - I see economic activity rebounding and so I wouldn't be too worried about a long-term drop in supply. \n\nOfc I may be totally wrong, but hey-ho", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In the link I shared, it includes the children’s NIIP as well.  The children are in debt to the parents, and the parents are in debt to the children.  I know it doesn’t make sense but this is literally the way things are!  The parents are evil and there is accounting fraud happening.\n\nTo keep using your analogy:\n\nLet’s say that the only way for the children on the street to get money is from their parents.  When the parents give the money to the kids, it’s actually a loan and the kids have to pay it back with 10% interest.  Each kid gets $100 and there are 10 kids on the street.  So the total amount lent is $1000 and the total amount needed to pay back is $1100.  What’s going to happen?  Doesn’t matter how you cut the pie, $1000 is not enough to pay back a $1100 loan.  The kids may not be interested in the overall picture though.  They’re going to end up fighting and bullying or making some clever loans between themselves to end up ahead so that they can pay their parents back.  Little Jimmy tried his best but ultimately ends up with the short end of the stick.  Now he’s bankrupt and has to get punished.  But Jimmy’s parents feel bad for him and bail him out.  “Here Jimmy, here’s $50, go play some more.  Now you owe us $55.”  Jimmy’s parents never got their $100 back, and lent out $50 to Jimmy.  So now the *parents* on the street have a NIIP of -$100.  This keeps repeating and repeating, eventually the kids are in debt and the parents are in debt.  The whole street’s NIIP is negative.  The credits and debits don’t wash.\n\nThis is how debt-backed currencies work.  It’s literally impossible, by definition, for the credits and debits to wash.  The only way to keep paying debts is to keep printing the currency.  The Fed, at this point, is the sole source of dollars in circulation.  The Fed isn’t part of the government; it is a private corporation with shareholders, and it charges interest on every dollar it lends out.  Failure and inflation are baked right in to the whole system.  This is why all the fights all the politicians keep having about raising the debt ceiling is absolutely retarded.  You **have** to keep raising the debt ceiling, or the economy you created can’t work!  Without continued inflation the system will collapse.\n\nThis is how it works.  Every time the Fed prints more dollars, they are committing accounting fraud.  The politicians give it their blessing, which makes it legal.  If you or I behaved this way, we’d go to jail.  But it’s okay for the Fed.  🤦🏼‍♂️ Again, all the world’s FIATS operate this way.

Bollinger bands which will give you a projection of the extremes and middle of vol (Based on previous price action).

{"title": "Complete Guide to Trading The Wheel – Thetagang Strategy", "selftext": "*“It has been said, ‘time heals all wounds.’ I do not agree. The wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But it is never gone.” – Rose Kennedy*\n\n**CAUTION:** This guide is designed for the Redditor who has, at the very least, a basic understanding of how financial markets work, and have, at a bare minimum, some experience in trading stocks and options with their own brokerage account. If this does not apply to you, please stop reading immediately. Trading is highly risky and can bring about monetary losses if not careful.\n\nHello Reddit! This is my guide to trading The Wheel, thetagang style! Since I’ve written a comprehensive guide on my approach to trading Options Spreads, I noticed a number of similarities between the two, so I thought I’d also create a guide to help alleviate some of the learning pain for beginners.\n\nI made it my goal to design a guide that captivates both beginners and professionals; covering the basics while also discussing the more advanced/important things to look out for to increase the success rate of The Wheel. As a bonus, I also share my own $0.02 / personal experience with The Wheel at the end. Of course, some of the statements made in this guide are influenced by my personal experience with The Wheel, including some lessons learned from my mistakes made and losses realized.\n\nBefore we dive into The Wheel, let’s refresh our memory what an option is: a financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying equity at an agreed upon strike price on or before an expiration date.\n\nIf you think about it, selling options is just like being in the business of selling insurance. In our modern society, insurance is a necessity, for it helps people protect themselves against the risk of financial loss. And where there is demand for a necessity, there is opportunity to supply; there is a reason why there are many profitable insurance companies, both small and large, private and public!\n\nProfitable insurance businesses will sell policies to the people who need it, and collect a premium until the policy term expires, whether naturally or artificially. With options, you can be in the business of selling insurance, all *without* jumping over the hurdles of setting up an insurance company! So how do we go about profiting from selling insurance premiums? By spending a ton of money on clever and funny ads about 15 minutes and 15 percent of course. Just kidding! If only selling options works that way. Though there’s a good chance you might find extra 15 percent portfolio gains after spending 15 minutes learning about selling options!\n\nSo how do we go about making a profit from selling options? The same way insurance businesses go about selling policies of course! By selling policies for as high of a premium as possible, while making as low of a payout as possible to the policy holders! When it comes to insurance premiums, they tend to be priced the highest when the probability of a risk event goes up. Think about the demand for umbrellas, raincoats, rainboots etc. during a rainy day – that’s when demand for protection against the elements are high, and when vendors can subsequently price and sell them for higher than during a regular sunny day.\n\nI find that visualizing options contracts as insurance policies helps to understand the purpose of The Wheel strategy better: in the market, there is demand for Put options whenever stockholders wish to protect the downside, and a demand for Call options whenever short sellers wish to protect the upside. The Wheel aims to provide additional gains by means of selling options to these buyers for a premium.\n\nWhether you plan on Wheeling in your brokerage or retirement account, there are a few challenges you’ll need to overcome. Firstly, you’ll need to ensure your account is approved to perform key components of The Wheel, primarily:\n\nSelling a Cash Secured Put (CSP)\n\n\\- You put up, at a minimum, a cash amount of 100x of the strike price as collateral, to be able to sell a Put option, while collecting the Put Premium.\n\nSelling a Covered Call (CC)\n\n\\- You put up, at a minimum, a 100 lot of shares as collateral, to be able to sell a Call option, while collecting the Call Premium.\n\nSecondly, depending on the way you react to the above statements, you can already tell if The Wheel is a strategy for you. Due to the nature of options contracts in providing leverage (100x) the strategy can quickly require a substantial amount of capital to invest, depending on the underlying stock of course. The 100x amount may seem low if you are Wheeling penny stocks, and can quickly seem massive if you are Wheeling stocks like AMZN, BKNG, GOOGL, or CMG!\n\nNow that we understand the requirements, we can proceed to discuss The Wheel strategy at its simplest form:\n\n\\- Step 1: Sell a Cash Secured Put to Collect Premium\n\na. If Put Expires OTM --> Back to Step 1\n\nb. If Put Assigned ITM --> Buy Stock at Assigned Price and go to Step 2\n\n\\- Step 2: Hold Stock & Sell a Covered Call to Collect Premium\n\nc. If Call Expires OTM --> Back to Step 2\n\nd. If Call Exercised ITM --> Sell Stock at Exercised Price and go back to Step 1!\n\n\\*OTM – Out of The Money, ITM – In The Money\n\nWe want to profit the way insurance companies do: sell as many policies and collect as much premium as we can. Translated to The Wheel, it would mean that we try to sell as many Put and/or Call options as we can, while hoping for the options to expire OTM so we can collect the premium and move on.\n\nHow do we ensure that we can sell options that pays a high premium? When it rains, you sell umbrellas and raincoats! When people are hungry at the ball game, you sell snacks and drinks! It’s all a game of supply and demand. The best indicator of a great stock to start Wheeling will be its Implied Volatility (IV) and/or its IV Rank (IVR). IV will come in %, anywhere from 0 to 100s of %, while IVR will be between 0 and 100. You generally want to know when the forecast calls for the heaviest rain, so look for something volatile and ranked high. Personally, I look for at least 50% IVR.\n\nYour brokerage should have this data available for you, and if not, do a quick search and you’ll find that there are a number of screeners out there who will give you this data for free albeit delayed; you don’t need IV/IVR data by the second, a 10-, 15- or 20-minute delay is fine, since you’re selling options days and weeks out anyway. Be warned: IV/IVR are both just indicators – once you identify high IV/IVR stocks, you need to understand why they are ranked high – did someone find out about fraud and theft? Is the company’s business model going obsolete, or are they filing bankruptcy? Whatever the reason, if the stock price is suddenly going to zero, there’s no reason to sell an option as insurance on the stock.\n\nAnother place you can find great stocks to sell options on is right here on Reddit! Just take a peek at the hottest threads to find what stocks are hotly discussed. Some of Reddit threads will even give you a weekly list of high IV tickers, all for free! Again, please make sure you understand why the stock has high IV/IVR before you dip your toes in!\n\nIn theory, The Wheel seems like a no lose, always win strategy; sell options as insurance, and walk away with pockets full of premiums. In practice however, the results may surprise you. I should warn you that The Wheel is by no means a magic silver bullet; losses are still possible especially when the strategy is executed poorly.\n\nI’m going to list some of the most common mistakes made, challenges faced, and risks encountered:\n\n\\- You decide to Wheel only *one* stock in your portfolio. This is an insanely bad idea and is no different from YOLO-ing your entire savings into one stock. The worst-case scenario can happen where the stock plummets and breaches your short Put option where you get assigned and forced to buy the stock at a high price. Now you’re stuck bag-holding a depreciated stock with unrealized losses in your account.\n\nIf you don’t have enough capital to hold a diversified risk basket of stocks, at a minimum of 100x each, then The Wheel is not for you! Yes, Wheeling solely EV, solely Cannabis, or solely GME is also a bad idea! Always *diversify*!\n\n\\- You do not perform your own due diligence (DD) on the underlying stock and decide to start Wheeling the underlying. The worst-case scenario is where you have FOMO and start Wheeling by selling a CSP when the underlying has moved up significantly, where it has a significant chance of pulling back and catching you in assignment.\n\nBeing assigned the stock, you are now holding the depreciated shares and immediately sell a CC when the underlying dropped significantly, where it now has a significant chance of pushing back up and having your shares called away, before you even get the chance to let the stock appreciate back and help recoup some of your unrealized losses.\n\n\\- When Wheeling, it is completely normal to see unrealized P/L numbers on your account swing widely, especially when the option has yet to expire, as the underlying stock price moves up and down. The worst-case scenario is where you get emotionally swayed by seeing big red numbers, and you buy back the option you sold at a significant loss, without even actually going through The Wheel. Yes, this can happen on both sides, the Put and the Call.\n\n\\- Again, without performing your own DD, you begin Wheeling a high IV stock. A stock with a high IV does not automatically mean that it’s great for Wheeling! Some recent (as of Feb 2021) worst-case examples (granted, it was hard to foresee what was coming with these underlying): see WKHS or CCIV. This is why we emphasize on Wheeling a *diversified* basked of stocks!\n\nOne other consideration is to take in all available information at this point in time – yes, the stock has now dropped significantly: why is it doing that? Are they unable to grow their revenue? Has the company been found to be a fraud? Point is, if the underlying stock is a poor investment, you should cut your losses and move on to your next investment to find returns!\n\n\\- When Wheeling, you sell CSPs on the underlying, but because of how strong the stock is, you never get assigned, and the stock keeps going up and now you feel like you missed out! Or you sell CCs on the underlying, but somehow the stock keeps going up only after your shares were called away, and now you feel like you missed out!\n\nUnderstand that this is the inherent nature of The Wheel. When you sell a CSP, you are selling an insurance policy stating that the strike price you sold a Put at is the price you are willing to buy the stock at, if and when it drops to that level. Conversely, when you sell a CC, you are selling an insurance policy stating that the strike price you sold a Call at is the price you are willing to part with your stock.\n\n\\- You decide to Wheel an underlying stock that is not liquid, which even worse, is its options which are even less liquid. This means that on the options chain, you see massive gaps between the bid-ask spread. By Wheeling a non-liquid underlying, you potentially sell insurance policies that are low in demand, and thus collect low premiums that do not compensate you enough for the risk you are taking on.\n\nAnd here are some good tips and tricks, as it relates to selling options and The Wheel:\n\n\\- Only sell options on or Wheel underlying stocks with a high IV, which allows you to collect sufficient premium for the risk you are incurring. Having a high IV underlying also allows you to sell options further OTM to avoid assignment/exercise.\n\n\\- Options accelerate in decay at the 45 Days To Expiration (DTE) mark, so sell options that expire in 45 days or less. Selling a further expiry gives you more margin for error, while selling a closer expiry gives you less margin for error.\n\n\\- If the option you sold has lost significant value since you sold it, whether from theta decay, or a gamma or vega movement, it’s a good idea to take profits off the table by buying back the option and initiating a sell on another option.\n\n\\- If you prefer *not* to own the underlying stock and am trying to avoid assignment/exercise of the option sold, you can choose to roll the option. What this means is to buy back the option you sold while simultaneously selling another option, both transactions when netted should allow you to collect additional premium, if not a one-for-one exchange.\n\n**My $0.02**: like trading/investing with other strategies, one should be careful not to get swayed by emotions. The Wheel has many emotional avenues one can easily wander down: seeing unrealized losses when the underlying breaches your short option strike, or seeing your shares get called away and feel like you’ve missed out on the additional returns. Bad selection of the underlying stock to Wheel can also sometimes feel like “bag-holding with extra steps” due to the nature of taxes and time spent under portfolio management.\n\nThe Wheel is best used with the approach of selling Puts only when the underlying has moved significantly lower and selling Calls only when the underlying has moved significantly higher. It’s best approached using a combination of Fundamental Analysis (FA) and Technical Analysis (TA) to identify the low and high points of the stock before selling an option, that way you increase your chances of collecting option premiums without having your short option going ITM; I use the same approach when trading options spreads.\n\nThere may also be efficiency in returns to be found with a hybridized approach: instead of solely selling Puts on the underlying while waiting for assignment, consider both selling Puts *and* buying stock in the underlying. While this approach is far more complex due to multiple moving parts involved, it allows you to reap the multiple benefits of the wheel and not feel left out.\n\nIn my experience, I have found The Wheel’s returns after taxes to be lackluster *after* factoring in the investment of my time to monitor the underlying and manage my positions; if you’re actively monitoring and investing, why not seek higher returns to account for your time and energy investment? The best consideration: if I’m spending all this time to do The Wheel, am I getting paid enough to do it? Am I going to beat buying & holding an ETF *after* taxes? Am I getting compensated enough in the form of returns for experiencing the stress and emotions from The Wheel? For me, it was a solid “no” to all of the above, but YMMV.\n\n**TL;DR** The Wheel can be an effective tool when used correctly, but its use requires both a sizable portfolio along with dedication of one’s time towards active monitoring of the underlying and management of portfolio positions. In summary:\n\n*Pros*\n\n\\- Ability to collect Put premiums from excess volatility to lower cost average.\n\n\\- Ability to collect Call premiums from excess volatility to reap additional returns.\n\n*Neutral*\n\n\\- Requires sizable portfolio to allow for diversification of risk.\n\n\\- Requires active monitoring of underlying stock & overall market.\n\n\\- Requires active management of portfolio positions.\n\n\\- Incurs short term capital gains tax, due to the nature of trading in and out of positions <1yr.\n\n*Cons*\n\n\\- Potential to miss entry point into underlying stock when Put option is not assigned.\n\n\\- Potential to cap underlying stock returns when Call option sold is exercised.\n\nThanks for reading! As with any new strategy, I highly recommend that you paper trade it first to get yourself familiar before going in with your own hard-earned cash.\n\nLet me know if there are other interesting thetagang (or even non-thetagang) strategies you’d like my two cents on. Like my opinion on The Wheel, I promise I will try my best to be factual and impartial to the strategy, while also giving you my own personal experience with the strategy (if I’ve traded it).\n\n**DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor, just an opportunistic trader who has invested more than a decade of his own time and personal money to trade different stocks & options strategies for portfolio gains, sharing his experience for your kind Upvotes and Awards.**\n\nEdit: Noticed some funny/unknown symbols showing - edited post to remove them.

This can allow you to more safely trade very high IV tickers that you like for the long term. CCIV is an example of this for me, but you are right that it is not the best pick for a tradition wheel strategy.\n\nUsing CCIV as an example: at $25 or under I'd sell an ATM put and buy an ATM long. I'm high conviction it's going up, so this lets me capture the upside more than a put and gives me the option to exercise and go long stock. If it goes down and I'm assigned and the long call expires worthless, I don't care because I'm happy to buy at 25 anyway. \n\nAt $25-$50 I'll just sell the .3ish delta put.\n\nOver $50 I'll look for entry selling 2 OTM and buying 1 ATM put. You are basically using a short put to fund a but debit spread. I like to do ratios for a small credit.\n\nLet's say I'm assigned in the lower end of the price range and I'm high conviction there is a lot of upside. People alway complain about how they sell a CC and the underlying blasts through the strike price. Solution: sell two OTM calls and buy one ATM call. This is sometimes called a \"stock repair strategy\" because you can do this to break even faster on a stock that tanked, but you can also just use it to capture more upside on volatile stock you believe in. \n\nWhat if you got got last week and one of your .3 delta calls went deep ITM and got assigned? What if you want to sell covered calls but you think the underlying may take a few months to recover and the price you were assigned at doesn't have the premium to make it worth it to cap your upside? What if you don't want to use up all that buying power for months holding 100 shares? Solution: sell the stock for a loss, buy a deep ITM call six months out. Then sell 2 OTM and buy 1 ATM call for an PMCC ratio style. Free up that buying power.\n\nSecond tweak is: don't limit yourself to \"cash secured puts\" use margin responsibly. You aren't paying interest unless you get assigned, and stay small enough that you could get assigned and not be called. If you are young, margin reduces your risk over time. There is literature on this. It is actually very helpful have a margin account and be able to clearly see how the broker views your risk level per position. This is even more useful with portfolio margin so you can see how they view the risk of your portfolio as a whole.

Your stock could drop 20% in a week and if you set yourself up right you still make your money.  It is insane.  \n\n2) when doing the wheel you should make a long list of COMPANIES that you like.  Then you should do your DD and decide how much you think those COMPANIES are worth per share.\n\nThen, you should decide how much you would be willing to pay for the stock.  This sounds strange but if I think a company is worth $100 I don't want to pay $100.  Where is my upside.  I would want to buy at $70 or $80 (or less of course).  This will represent the MAXIMUM put strike you would want to sell.  The key here is that if you get assigned you want to be happy that you got assigned.  With the wheel if you set it up right even when you loose you WIN!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will do an example:  Apple (aapl)\n\nSince in 2021 they will make $4.50 a share and their long term growth rate is about 10 percent I think Apple is worth $90 per share.  That is way under what its stock aapl is trading for BUT if aapl were to drop to under $110 depending on its volatility I might then be at a point I could sell some $90 puts.  If it fell further I could do better and sell $80 puts maybe.  If I got assigned I now think it is worth $100 so I wanted to be greedy and did not mind holding stock for longer I could always do the $100 ccs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said right now puts on aapl have very low premium so I would not pick that but this weekend I went through 40+ stocks and actually found a few that surprised me (CCL and dollartree).\n\n3) don't be greedy.  if you sell a put and the price of that put plummets don't be afraid to book your gains.  Keep in mind the first 75% of the gains are the easiest and the next 15% are as hard to get as the first 75% so once you have good gains you will probably have a better opportunity to get into.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your put falls by 90% or falls to 1 or 2 cents no reason to waste time waiting for the last drop of lemon juice.  Take the gains and move onto the next trade.  Better to do 2 trades in a week each getting you 0.8% then to only do 1 and get the full 1%.  So far my average trade out of my first 14 trades only goes 3 days and that includes weekends...\n\n4) singles are good only aim for home run when the pitch lines up right\n\n1% on a trade where you don't really know where it is going is a good thing.  Keep doing those.  I only line up a big one when I am really certain that a stock is about to bottom so only then do I sell puts just under the current price.  Otherwise I am 10-30% under and usually 20% so that I have wiggle room if I am wrong about the trade.  I sold $25 PLTR puts last week and actually made a bit of money...
