Think about it like buying a house. There is a house on sale for $100,000. I don't have 100k, but I do have 20k for a down payment. I put in my 20k, and the bank gives me the rest to cover it. I now own this house, which means I have selling power over it. It doesn't matter that I'm 80k in debt now to the bank, I still can sell it. If the housing market goes up, and the house is now worth $120,000, I can sell this, and make 20k profit. I give 80k to the bank, recoupe my 20k, and have 20k left over. I just doubled my money, a 100% return, even though the price of the house only went up by 20%. This is what leverage does.\n\n\n\nNow, back from the allegory to real stocks. An call option is the chance to buy a stock at a given price. My option I listed in the top thread is for a strike of $760. The contracts are for 100 stock, so 1 contract means I can buy 100 shares of TSLA for $760 each, regardless of the price. If the stock is $850, I can buy in for $760 and then immediately sell for $850. Or I could just sell the contract itself and not buy in which is what most people will do, and still make the same profit.\n\nTo get the priviledge of getting the stock at a discount, you have to pay for it. This is the option you are buying. You buy the right to buy the stock at the price. This is like the downpayment on the home. You don't buy the home outright you are buying the contract to pay it off in the future. For options the price is called it's premium.\n\nSo if I buy in at around $22 premium, at 100 shares in a contract that's $2200. The strike is at $760, so for me to break even the stock has to hit $782, the stock price plus the premium. Now here is the key difference when trading options. **They have an expiration date.** my expiration is on October the 1st, so if the stock fails to hit my break even by then I'll lose on the investment. So some may consider the options to be more risky. However, the risk gains me leverage. If the stock increases in 20% value, like in our home buying example, to 912$ a share, my initial investment of $2200 is now worth ~$15,000. Covering my premium, that nets me ~$12,800. How did I get the worth of $15,000? Take the stock price, minus the strike price. That makes my option shares worth $152 a piece, and I have 100 of them in a contract. So that means I have $15,000. \n\nEven if the stock doesn't hit the break even or my target by october 1st, I can still profit if investors think it will and I sell before then.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm simplfying things a lot here but this is the basic jist of it. Options allow higher risk-reward then trading shares of a company. It gives buying and selling power over many many more shares than you would be able to afford on your own, so you can profit many more times from the stock price going up. It can be a fantastic boon to your portfolio, but it is very risky. Only put in what you can afford to lose.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "THANKS!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Well my strategy with options is to get in the money calls.

On July 4, 2005, they were at Eberhard‚Äôs house in Woodside celebrating Independence Day and figured it was as good a moment as any to see what happened when the Roadster‚Äôs batteries caught on fire. Someone taped twenty of the batteries together, put a heating strip wire into the bundle, and set it off. ‚ÄúIt went up like a cluster of bottle rockets,‚Äù Lyons said. Instead of twenty batteries, the Roadster would have close to 7,000, and the thought of what an explosion at that scale would be like horrified the engineers. One of the perks of an electric car was meant to be that it moved people away from a flammable liquid like gasoline and the endless explosions that take place in an engine. Rich people were unlikely to pay a high price for something even more dangerous, and the early nightmare scenario for the employees at Tesla was that a rich, famous person would get caught in a fire caused by the car. ‚ÄúIt was one of those ‚Äòoh shit‚Äô moments,‚Äù Lyons said. ‚ÄúThat is when we really sobered up.‚Äù\n\nTesla formed a six-person task force to deal with the battery issue. They were\npulled off all other work and given money to begin running experiments. The first explosions started taking place at the Tesla headquarters, where the engineers filmed them in slow motion. Once saner minds prevailed, Tesla moved its explosion research to a blast area behind an electrical substation maintained by the fire department. Blast by blast, the engineers learned a great deal about the inner workings of the batteries. They developed methods for arranging them in ways that would prevent fires spreading from one battery to the next and other techniques for stopping explosions altogether. Thousands of batteries exploded along the way, and the effort was worth it. It was still early days, for sure, but Tesla was on the verge of inventing battery technology that would set it apart from rivals for years to come and would become one of the company‚Äôs great advantages.\n\n\\- Excerpt from Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "This aged very well", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "GM: hey just dump a bunch of contracting and expanding pouch cells in as little space as you can and sell it asap", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This just popped up on my youtube https://youtube.com/shorts/aKnGry4mohU?feature=share\n\nüêê", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Hey!
