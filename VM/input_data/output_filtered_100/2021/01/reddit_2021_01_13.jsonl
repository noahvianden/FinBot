The OEM‚Äôs are Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, CNH Industrials, Renault and PSA. The 6th is not shown. We heard about Renault today. I expect to hear about others soon.

Mr. Marsh also mentions they want to be the EU leader in Fuel Cell Bus, Trains, Maritime and Aviation. He pointed out that by 2030 there will be 500,000 LCVs (the Renault deal will get some of these), 50,000 trucks and buses, 1,000 fuel cell trains and 3,700 hydrogen refueling stations.\n\nWe are still waiting to hear about the Liquid Hydrogen and Gaseous Hydrogen solutions via onsite electrolyzers Plug is offering to existing customers.

These partners were also mentioned in the 2020 symposium.\n\nMr. Marsh also mentioned there would be new partnerships for Multi MW systems in various countries.\n\nWe will still hear more about the Walmart logistics expansion that began in August 2020 and will significantly expand in 2021.\n\nWe are also waiting for the new on the 4th pedestal customer and sometime after that, we should hear about the 5th and 6th pedestal customer Plug is working to finalize.\n\nOf course there is also the contra act for data center backup power systems that will also include onsite electrolyzers to produce hydrogen and produce fuel for on road trucks.\n\nLastly, we will hear progress on the regional aviation fuel cell project.\n\nThere will be good news this month on the reason behind finalizing Amazon‚Äôs warrants.\n\nThere are several more things in the works but I need to stop and enjoy a glass of Dewars 12 year old scotch and contemplate increasing my $500 year end share price", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I am relatively new to the stock market and did some research on Odonate Therapeutics.

Those insider trades you linked to are related to employee compensation. The other dilutive event is AMD selling stock to raise capital to invest in projects. It dilutes shareholders while not changing the overall value of an investors holdings, because for every dollar of dilution, the balance sheet of the company improves by a dollar. \n\nAnother example: Let's say there's a company that is literally $10, and it has 10 shares, of which you own 1. I sell an additional share of stock for $1. Oh no! Now you don't have 10% of the company anymore! You only have 9%! You've been diluted! Your new percentage of the company is worth.... $1!

{"title": "This is what Palantir does [A data analyst's take]", "selftext": "I'll let you guys in on a secret since none of you retards seem to get it.\n\n**Amazon Redshift sucks**. AWS is great no doubt. Redshift also deserves credit for being pioneers, but the data community has found in the last 10 years that it suffers from architectural issues that make it difficult for organizations to function without a central data engineering team, which becomes less feasible the larger you get.\n\nIn the early 2010s, forward looking companies started to realize the issue with Redshift style data warehousing, and attempted to solve this problem by creating a \"data lake\" of flat files to serve as the organizations \"source of truth\" instead of relying solely on data warehouses. Many companies failed to set this up after trying, and reverted to their old ways of settling for fragmented clusters on Redshift.\n\n**Now let me introduce you to Snowflake**. Snowflake solves this issue by doing the \"data lake\" part for you. You can pretend like you're using Redshift and they'll figure out the rest. Plus they let you scale your cluster size based on what you need without commitment? Plus QOL improvements for SQL? Whoa! No wonder they are valued at $100 billion.\n\n**Here comes Palantir though**, and they are like \"No no no no no you guys are much more retarded than that. Not even Snowflake will save you retards. You need us to do it for you. Because we are super smart. And you are not.\"\n\nAnd let me tell me you, they are sort of right, in some cases. Which cases? Well, so far governments around the world. Also Japanese companies, who are notorious for being late to the data party.\n\nMy first impression as a data analyst when I saw Palantir Foundry and Gotham was \"pshhhhhhh I can do that\". But the more I thought about it, that's exactly why I get paid the way I do.\n\nI am long PLTR because I think most financial analysts are underestimating the appeal of simplification and quality that Palantir brings to the table. They are attempting to replace me. They think they can do it harder, better, faster, and stronger. So far the downside is cost, but they are obviously trying to market themselves as a premium company, and succeeding at it so far.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Today they are Airflow-plus x Tableau-lite w/ Apple marketing, but tomorrow they will replace data analysts like myself.", "id": "kw53zi", "created_utc": 1610498952.0, "score": 648, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 179, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 487, "replies": [{"body": "Added a TL;DR section for this retard", "score": 307, "replies": [{"body": "Can you give me a TL:DR on the TL:DR?", "score": 159, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Stonks", "score": 56, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks!

{"title": "GME - EndGame: DTC Infinity.", "selftext": "Hello again folks. I‚Äôve taken some time to do my own DD on GME and sharing it with you, in addition to all the other great DD out there. I‚Äôm going to cover shorts, debt, and what I think might accelerate GME‚Äôs mission to Mars.\n\n**TL:DR;** GME is a ticking time bomb. Shorts R Fuk. Buy shares, Sell puts to acquire shares cheaper. Buy leaps on red days. No idea what's gonna happen in the very short term but 2021 will be massive.\n\n# About the Shorts\n\nSo, updated short interest came out today. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, shorts **increased** their positions through the end of the year:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[12\\/31 short position update](https://preview.redd.it/k66xyn1oq1b61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=a61c48086c09a509fe4a7152db90ba4a3c082323)\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\nI really can‚Äôt figure out the macro logic here because from the outside it looks like they‚Äôre digging their own graves.\n\nOn the day-to-day scale, I think I understand how this is happening. If you look at the days with a high short volume ratio, the narrative is clear: Shorts are actively trying to defend GME crossing 20 significantly, and coming in hard when threatened. Shorts also took advantage of general market selloff on Jan 4 to push GME down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Days with heavy shorting activity](https://preview.redd.it/dir3ss9sq1b61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0859c5aff4dce709a27b945786507ba9c4de18)\n\nThis is also why GME ended up ***only*** \\~12% after the recent RC announcement. Short volume was a whopping **4MM** shares on that day.\n\nThe problem is shorts are doing all this active shorting to defend their existing short positions, but they‚Äôre either not able or not choosing to close all of the intraday shorting, so it‚Äôs accumulating. As of 12/31 the **total short positions (71.2M) exceed total issued shares (69.75M).**\n\n# The precarious position of the shorter\n\nShorts find themselves in a very precarious position. Let‚Äôs talk about the float and DTC (days-to-close). **The DTC number you see above is a lie.** There‚Äôs an argument to be made that **DTC is infinity.**\n\nThere are a total of 69.75M shares issued by GME. According to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kw0djb/gme_floatshort_data/) who has a CapIQ subscription, insiders hold 22.8M shares. I was able to verify using this [nasdaq source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity) that the top insiders hold about 20% of shares:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top Insider Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/id7ppwjvq1b61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc9f4103776787f435ebbe719f5420c776d7ad1)\n\nThe thing with insiders is that they can‚Äôt easily sell due to lots of restrictions so they‚Äôre not considered part of the ‚Äúactively‚Äù traded part of the stock. I.e. They can‚Äôt just sell on price action.\n\nIn addition to insiders, [**institutions now own 110% of GME shares**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)**.** (Thanks shorters!). Some of these institutions may actively trade, but the top holdings (FMR, BlackRock, Vanguard, etc.) *will not trade based on price action* as they are generally holding for their ETFs / index funds that hold GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Institutional Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/de46p98yq1b61.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b3b9332efb259e72eae6209a3ce1743ed0b462f)\n\nNow, thought experiment. What happens ***if*** shorts decide to cover? They have to buy back 71M shares. Who are they going to buy it back from?\n\n1. They can‚Äôt buy them back from insiders.\n2. Let‚Äôs be conservative here, and say that Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard will hold on to their shares, but all of the other institutions will paper hand when shorts start to cover. This is very conservative because there are other institutions that hold GME for their own ETFs.\n\nSo, 69.75M shares - 22.8M for insiders - 23.43M held by BlackRock/Vanguard/Fidelity = **23.52M shares left.** So fuck all other short-to-float ratios out there, the **short % of tradable float is at least 300%.**\n\n[Investopedia ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Days%20to%20cover%2C%20also%20called%20short%20ratio%2C%20measures%20the%20expected,for%20the%20company%20in%20question.)tells us that days to cover is *‚Äúcalculated by taking the* ***number of currently shorted shares*** *and* ***dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume*** *for the company in question.‚Äù*\n\nGME‚Äôs [20-day average daily volume](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/technical-analysis) is about 10.4M shares, so that‚Äôs about 6.83 days to cover. This, however, is **a lie.** *The DTC definition listed by Investopedia stops making sense when short interest exceeds purchasable float.*\n\nMath whiz‚Äôs out there‚Ä¶ if you have to buy 71M shares from a pool of 23.5M shares, and GME‚Äôs daily volume is 11M shares a day, how many days will it take to cover?\n\nAnswer: **Infinity. You can‚Äôt. You can never cover.** There literally are not enough shares to buy to close your shorts. You can only buy-to-close 23.5M shares, and that‚Äôs even if you can convince all of them to sell (i.e. $$$$$). **True DTC is Infinity.** This is part of the reason shorts haven‚Äôt covered. *There‚Äôs no way out of the burning building they‚Äôre in.*\n\n# How it gets worse part 1) Institutional Buying\n\nHere‚Äôs how it gets worse. Besides all the retards like you and me buying GME b/c of Lord Cohen and u/DeepFuckingValue, GME is about to cross some serious thresholds that make it attractive to more institutional buying.\n\nFirst, in the recent [Q4 numbers](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results) release:\n\n* ‚ÄúThe Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however, unless further unforeseen COVID-19 related impacts occur, it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and **profitability** in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nSo, GME is about to cross into the positive EPS category, which in addition to the debt story below is going to potentially **unlock** **more institutional buying** that is currently blocked by rules like not investing in companies with negative P/E.\n\nSecond, let‚Äôs talk about debt.\n\n## Debt\n\nBusinesses leverage debt to scale; particularly true with retail businesses that have to pay for inventory in advance of selling it. High cost of debt -> lower profits -> lower ability to pay debt -> higher debt costs, and the cycle continues. On the flipside, if GME was able to increase its credit rating, you get lower debt costs, higher profitability, which leads to higher credit rating, etc.\n\nI believe we‚Äôre seeing a campaign from GME to pay down debt to reduce a) restrictive covenants in the 2021 notes (preventing things like more share buybacks) and b) upgrade their bonds to investment grade.\n\nNot only will a credit upgrade lead to cheaper debt, it will **unlock more institutional investment that are currently restricted against buying equities with below-investment-grade debt ratings.**\n\n## Debt\n\n* Debt was $472MM up until July 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l87lqgtwr1b61.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c897cd39f4b8874839fcdf602802cf015d78b22\n\n* GME announced a voluntary pre-payment of $125MM of debt ([link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html)) that will happen 3 days after the earnings call (earnings Dec 8, debt repayment Dec 11)... ‚Äú**using cash generated from operations to reduce our outstanding debt‚Äù**\n\n## Debt rating:\n\n* First, take a look at GME‚Äôs bond pricing. GME‚Äôs bonds were significantly impacted by the March crash. However, GME‚Äôs bond pricing has recovered and is now **trading at par**, meaning the market believes that GME will pay back its debt (i.e. not a bankruptcy risk).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME Bonds trading at par](https://preview.redd.it/cu6rpvpur1b61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd2fd2376d717c198e65aa7d9f22ed4ec77b853)\n\n* Now, look at its Moody‚Äôs rating history. First, for context, anything under a Baa3 rating is considered junk (ratings chart here) and greatly affects who can buy your bonds and what types of rates you get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Moody's debt ratings. GME currently sits at B3](https://preview.redd.it/56e3ba82s1b61.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f56f076c11f01204a1086b43670a5a48ab7f30)\n\nHere are Moody‚Äôs actions on GME ([source](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/GameStop-Corp-credit-rating-808528072)). In particular:\n\n* Downgrade on 5/2019 to Ba2\n* Downgrade on 1/2020 to B2\n* Downgrade on 4/2020 to Caa1\n* Upgrade on 7/2020 to B3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME upgraded to B3 in Jul 2020](https://preview.redd.it/menraih6s1b61.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=da868433f2546ffe1c5ce3294e48559d9f03e256)\n\n## Speculation on debt:\n\n* GME is working with Moody‚Äôs & others to get credit rating back to Investment grade. Showing **positive earnings/profitability** and **paying back debt early** is key to this. I believe we should see an upgrade soon to at least Baa3 (the lowest level of investment-grade debt).\n* The market is not generally considering GME‚Äôs debt as risky as Moody‚Äôs credit rating would suggest. The market can move faster than Moody‚Äôs.\n\nPositive EPS + Debt ratings upgrade = massive institutional buying = shorts further in the hole.\n\n# How it gets worse part 2) Passive Buying Feedback Loop\n\nGME is part of [62 ETFs holding about 10.7M shares](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME) in addition to a whole bunch in index funds (not ETFs). I couldn‚Äôt get a number for index funds but am going to estimate around 10M for them as well given the Vanguard/Fidelity numbers above.\n\nMore than 50% of these holdings are passive, **market-cap weighted funds**. Now here‚Äôs the feedback loop that really fucks the short story up.\n\n1. Institutions buy GME ->\n2. Price goes up ->\n3. Market Cap Goes up ->\n4. Weight in Funds Goes up ->\n5. ETFs buy more GME for every $ of inflow ->\n6. Price goes up -> return to step 3\n\nAt $20, GME is already up >5x from its low of \\~$4 in 2020. This means that for every $1 thrown into IWM, for example, Blackrock is putting 5x as much of that $1 into GME as it was back at GME‚Äôs lows. As GME‚Äôs price goes up, **any market-cap weighted fund puts more money into GME for every $1 of inflow.**\n\nThe passive feedback loop has already started. It will really kick into high gear with institutional buying.\n\n# Other speculations:\n\n1. I believe RC is already slated to be CEO, and this will be announced in the June 2021 annual shareholder meeting.\n   1. This is why the ICR presentation was pulled. RC didn‚Äôt want the content in the ICR presentation to be the market-adopted story on the GME strategy.\n   2. 3 board members are retiring. I believe this is part of a pre-negotiated deal where RC is taking over. The 3 that are stepping down didn‚Äôt agree with the mgmt change.\n2. GME is due for a re-rate of price/sales. GME is currently trading at a P/S of 1 - if you ONLY include the ecommerce revenue. From a total revenue perspective it‚Äôs closer to .2. **GME is currently worth less than its quarterly revenue.** From the [Q4 sales pre-release](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results):\n   1. ‚ÄúNet quarterly sales were $1.770 billion‚Äù\n   2. ‚ÄúE-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company‚Äôs $1.0 billion growth objective;‚Äù\n\nAt this point, it‚Äôs really the endgame for shorts. They have to find a way to exit before Cohen is CEO.\n\n# ", "id": "kwb827", "created_utc": 1610521104.0, "score": 1587, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 387, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 678, "replies": [{"body": "I can't really wrap my head around how the system allows for more shorts than longs.

Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy.

It is not some AWS relationship). There is INSANE value here. TSLA can be a customer. They have a HUGE percentage of the EV world already are customers of BB. QNX by BB is in 175 MM cars already. \n\nThis shit is only at 4x sales, and by the end of 2021, it will be at 10x sales with sales at least doubling.

It's severely tied into government contracts, which are droll kind of dull investments that are generally baked into price well in advance.  Not going to be a lot of \"surprises\" there.  And the downward pressure conviction on the equity, especially since around Thanksgiving, has been significant.  Institutional investors WANT to send it down.  Why pick such a difficult fight?

We never use it anymore unless there's literally zero traffic on the freeway.  The issue with the autopilot is that not only is it (by TSLA's own admission) janky, but it lulls the driver into a false sense of security.  Even with it forcing you to keep your hands on the wheel, we had 2 instances where it actively tried to harm us and, though we were paying attention, our reaction speed was slowed because we were expecting the computer to address the problem and it took a moment to realize it wasn't going to happen.  Autopilot with navigation was a disaster, especially when it tried to change lanes in rush hour traffic.  Just flat-out unsafe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNetwork of chargers:  A useful asset in the short-term, but I feel as EV's become more ubiquitous, both the free market and utilities will eat away at that.  Local municipalities will start offering these stations, much like Wifi is basically available everywhere today.  Further, they did the Apple thing and didn't bother to standardize with the other car manufacturers, creating this hodgepodge of dongles and incompatibility.  That was a tactical error, in my opinion.  Also, to my knowledge, superchargers can't charge anything except a Tesla (I could be wrong).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as to the Audi:Tesla comparison:  The interior of my S feels cheap and plasticy compared to our Audi, which feels supple and refined.  In the Audi, everything is intuitively placed exactly where I feel it should be.  On the Tesla, things are poorly positioned (the armrest, for example, is positioned so far back even though I have the seat far back because I'm tall that I have to bend my arm unnaturally to use it), or else they force you to go through the infotainment screen for everything, which is clunky and things are buried multiple menus deep.   Audi thought of all the \"little things\" like cubby compartments in the door wells, lights in the sunvisor mirrors (and reasonably sized sunvisor mirrors), etc.  My S has none of that.  My Audi has a HUD on my windshield.  It's unforgivable that Tesla doesn't have the ability to use Android Auto, and the Nav screen, though 10 times larger than the Audi's, lacks important details like individual street names unless they're main roads.  The blind spot detection mirrors alert you when shifting lanes out of the corner of your eyes - the Tesla makes me look at the console.  The seats are contoured better in the Audi.  The Tesla's acoustics are absolutely TERRIBLE, both because of subpar audio equipment (compared to the Bang & Oluffsen in the Audi) as well as the fact that it turns out that glass roof is positively terrible for sound.  On that same note, can't have satellite radio in the Tesla - you have to stream it.  Which doesn't sound bad, except we winter in Aspen and there are a lot of mobile dead spots that a satellite radio wouldn't have problems with, and the LTE pickup on the Tesla is poor.  With regards to powertrain....sure, my S is fast, but my Audi has a supercharger, so it was no slouch (and has higher end speed).  Tesla's AWD is light years behind Audi's quattro (not as important when we're in our Marina Del Rey residence, but in our Colorado residences it's a huge deal).  And my Tesla's first set of wheels only lasted 8000 miles because I'm aggressive off the line and the instant torque the Tesla generates eats away the rubber like nobody's business because tires just aren't designed for that.  Plus, frankly, I just miss the growl of an engine in the Tesla.  I felt rather than making \"Fart mode\" (which we recently discovered), they could have created a simulated engine growl.  On and on and on.  Were I coming from a Honda, the Tesla would have blown me away.  But coming from Audi, it just drove home that VW does everything just...better, because they've been in the game longer and make cars, not science projects.   And they do it for a fraction of the cost, and we don't have to stop for an hour every 225 miles on a longer trip.  We've also had issues with the tech failing.  I also don't like that my car is tracking where I go and feeing that information to the company for selling purposes.\n\nTL:DR:  TSLA, as a stock, is only interesting to me from the perspective of municipal battery farm sale and distribution (but I've got early VC money in a company called Bloom Energy that's a direct competitor there using a different methodology), but I can't justify that kind of price on a company that is wholly dependent upon government subsidies to succeed.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't understand how Tesla is \"light years ahead\" in regards to automation technology.
