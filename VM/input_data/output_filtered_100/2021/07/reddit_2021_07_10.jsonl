The official report will be released after close on Monday, but it will lag by about 10 days.  There has been a lot of shorting since then.\n\nCalls on ATOS expiring on July 16 represent a total share demand of 39.3M shares according to TD Friday Morning and July Call volume on Friday represented an additional 3.9M shares.\n\nAccording to my Delta based spreadsheet, a share price of $9.00 would create additional IMMEDIATE share demand in excess of 13M shares (on top of the shares MMs should already be holding).  There's simply NOT enough liquidity to accommodate that demand.  This could send prices skyrocketing, creating increased margin requirements on the shorts and forcing them to cover.\n\nI am well aware of the eye rolls that mentioning GME and a squeeze in the same post causes, but do the math for yourself!  This could be really BIG!\n\nImagine the effect on share prices if a few whales jumped in with massive ITM call purchases, about an hour before market close on this coming Friday...

It's not really \"priced in\", except to the extent that \"big money\" would attempt to create a plot that looks like [this](https://spotgamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20200213_gplot.png).\n\nThis says that MM's are positive gamma (so OWN options) above 3252, and short for a spot under that.  That was Feb 13th last year.\n\nIf we pull up a [chart](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx) we'll notice that immediately after that period, the S&P fell, a lot, which pushed MM's into extremely negative gamma, which forced them to sell into the dips, which exacerbated price movements.  We had days of -10%.\n\nIt's instead just telling you the *behavior* of large money flows.\n\nIt's ultimately a bet on IV.  If you think IV is lower than what the realized volatility will be, you should be positive gamma.  If you think IV is higher than what the realized volatility will be, then you should be short gamma.\n\nAs I said though, when MM's are long gamma, they tend to depress big moves (because they're buying low and selling high), and when they're short gamma, they exacerbate big moves.  It becomes like the tail wagging the dog.\n\nIf there's a large open interest in calls, it doesn't actually mean MM's are *selling* them. Imagine there was a huge price spike, to, say, $9, and a bunch of retail bought at the peak.  They're now stuck with those shares, and want to *sell calls*.  Giving MM's a chance to be positive gamma at a lower IV than they believe is \"going to happen\".\n\nUnless you have any way to know what the distribution of gamma *actually* is, you're blindly guessing about volatility flows.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "This week should be interesting", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I want to personally thank OP u/wornredshoes .

If gamma starts running away anytime Wed-Fri I'm going big. Very big (big for a trade that can easily go to zero or just get torched in general). \n\nFor those who can stomach writing naked calls, there could be a huge day trade thrus and/or fri.

Right now, my general sense is that most of the investment community is still extremely skeptical that Tesla can get FSD working to the point where it becomes a substantial revenue source.  If FSD revenue creeps up unexpectedly, it could drive a lot of FOMO buying once everyone realizes that what was once believed impossible, is actually working and profitable.  \n\nBeta 9 is very important today though, because from the videos I have seen, it validates Tesla's assertion that radar is no longer necessary for FSD.

Still the progression I think will be gradual. Once Tesla starts to get there it won't be a overnight thing. You have years of regulatory work, but also just setting up all the systems around running a taxi business. Like regardless of how driverless your car is, someone can still puke in it, you need support centers to handle failures. Waymo has actually done really well in that regard. They got all the customer experience stuff you need for a self driving taxi, customer support, remote override, support drivers. Even if Tesla suddenly gets a perfect self driving system working you still need all that support stuff, it takes time to build up, especially all over the world.\n\nI don't think you should care about self driving taxi revenue until there's actual revenue from self driving taxis, then it will start to grow over time. General FSD revenue from subscriptions and personal use I think will be huge though.\n\nLike even $99/month in some kind of long term scenario with 15 years of Teslas on the road with 10 million cars made per year it's $180 billion per year of revenue just from the subscription. I think in the medium term one huge potential could be FSD subscription for Tesla Semi, because that shit becomes professional software. Even if you still need a driver and it's just a driver assist feature many companies would probably still get it to reduce accidents and driver fatigue. If Tesla can get regulatory approval for just something minor like longer truck driving hours with FSD, it's an auto include. \n\nProfessional software ain't cheap, a basic ANSYS fluid simulation license costs around $10k per year, after an initial $30k purchase. So I can see Tesla charging $20k/year for one Tesla Semi FSD license if you can go driverless on highways. Amazon has 20,000 semi-trucks, they would just put in an order for say 5,000 trucks to get started and pay the $20k/year without thinking much about it. There's 2 million semi trucks on the road just in the US, just taking all of that to account for the rest of the world you could have 2 million semi trucks paying $20k/year for FSD, which is another $40 billion in revenue.

{"title": "What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.\n\nI am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.\n\nNevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.\n\nLet's get started with the \"guide\" I use for investing.\n\n# Before we start\n\n1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:\n\n|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Assets** \\- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|\n|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|\n\nWhere to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.\n\n**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.\n\nEDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)\n\n\\---\n\n2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:\n\n|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|\n|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|\n\nYou may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.\n\n\\--\n\n# Doing your own DD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Previous Steps**|\n|:-|\n\n\nThe question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:\n\n1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**\n\nStart informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.\n\n2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.\n\nThe tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.\n\n3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.\n\nNow it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.\n\nIn the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.\n\nAssuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**First Filter**|\n|:-|\n\n\nYou want a company that gives you a \"**yes\"** for the following questions:\n\n|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|\n|:-|:-|\n|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|\n|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a \"living\" company.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Second Filter**|\n|:-|\n\n\nAre you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.\n\n*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*\n\n* **Balance Sheet**\n   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?\n   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n* **Income Statement:**\n   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?\n   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n\nHere you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a \"**yes**\" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Third Filter**|\n|:-|\n\n\nLet's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company‚Äôs assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**\n\nHow much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Fourth Filter**|\n|:-|\n\n\n**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.\n\nA higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.\n\n**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.\n\nA higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.\n\nA low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.\n\nWhen the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.\n\nCompare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:\n\n* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.\n* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.\n* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.\n* P/E >= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.\n\nAre you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Fifth Filter**|\n|:-|\n\n\nKeep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!\n\nIt's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.\n\n\\--\n\nIf this helps at least one person, it will have been worth it.

Just took another read through and perhaps one other area that could be improved is when you are speaking on valuing a company through the P/E.

I would take a look into comparable companies analysis, where you use several different multiples to value a stock, with the most important probably being forward EV/EBITDA. Different companies are valued with differing multiples depending on their maturity/industry. \n\nAlso one last thing, when you look at these multiples like P/E. I would not use historical P/E, but rather next year‚Äôs P/E, as equities trade on future expectations but prior performance.

{"title": "The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble", "selftext": "Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people‚Äôs wildly speculative hope about the housing market going ‚Äúdown‚Äù.\n\nTo be ‚Äúconstructive,‚Äù I‚Äôve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don‚Äôt have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn‚Äôt follow the instruction manual. \n\nCH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future\n\nFrom the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. \n\n‚ÄúThe land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts\".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.‚Äù\n\nLand is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is ‚ÄúOne for all,‚Äù and Private Land is ‚ÄúAll for one.‚Äù \n\nWith that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the ‚Äúhouse of cards‚Äù fell apart for land, didn‚Äôt it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.\n\nThe first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. \n\nAfter all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater‚Ä¶ There is no reason to stay is there?\n\nCh 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past\n\nNow that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. \n\nHousehold formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\\[1\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. \n\nSo, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. \n\n  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or‚Ä¶ They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. \n\nCh 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation\n\nCongratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. \n\nWith that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\\[2\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBroker Freedom Credit,‚Äù which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\\[3\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage‚Äôs ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. \n\nThis means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. \n\nTo add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\\[4\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)\n\nCh 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners\n\nFirst the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: ‚ÄúThe policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower‚Äôs student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.‚Äù[\\[5\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)\n\nSecondly, with the supreme court‚Äôs decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria‚Äôs removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\\[6\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)\n\nFinally, ‚ÄúStarting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac‚Äôs version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area‚Äôs median household income will qualify‚Ä¶ The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year ‚Äî or an average of $100 to $250 each month.‚Äù[\\[7\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)\n\nCh 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.\n\nAs of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\\[8\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\\[9\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)\n\nThe reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. \n\nIn the words of Brett Kavanaugh: \" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.\"\n\nChapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  \n\n\n1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.\n\n2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. \n\n3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. \n\n4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. \n\n5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn‚Äôt cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it‚Äôs better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. \n\nCh. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home\n\n1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers ‚Äúdown payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.‚Äù Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: ‚ÄúThe program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.‚Äù \n\n2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home‚Äôs configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home‚Äôs value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you ‚Äúextra‚Äù cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you ‚Äúfix up‚Äù the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. \n\n3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then ‚Äúmove up‚Äù in 5 years. \n\n4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. \n\n5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. \n\n6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. \n\n7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank. \n\nThe End (Or Out to Lunch)\n\n\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref1) [newresconst.pdf (census.gov)](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref2) [Price Match | United Wholesale Mortgage (uwm.com)](https://www.uwm.com/price-match/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Slider&utm_campaign=PriceMatch) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref3) [5zpcxsawan871.png (3400√ó4400) (redd.it)](https://preview.redd.it/5zpcxsawan871.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c06a8a1bf04fc69ac3b82250942f3248d4feba)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref4) [Will U.S. Housing Prices Drop in 2022?

Lots of people thought they would WFH forever and moved far away or even out of state but are learning they have to go back, either full time or hybrid. This starts the selling.

So they start to look to dump their shit while they still can. At this point they are hoping to break even. \n\nThen comes the end of forebearance, another factor.

Now we have a ton of inventory all in the same area, so naturally prices fall. \n\nThen they begin to return to 2019 levels as more and more want out. No one wants to be left holding the bag so they panic sell. Think of the frenzied thoughtless panic buying of the last year and a half moving in reverse. Then you have those who couldn‚Äôt buy this last year and a half cuz they were priced out or couldn‚Äôt win bids start to buy cuz they see their opening.

This will continue for, at least, the next five years.\n\nThis is attributed to a few things. More millennials are moving towards high density cities and thus don‚Äôt have a chance in hell of buying unless they are set up with an above average salary. This large movement into cities with high median valued homes prevents people from buying. Further, the percentage of homeowners in the millennial generation is 47.9% which is about 20% below Gen X. This will likely increase a student debts are paid and they start families likely forcing them to move to more affordable areas (37% or participants according to this survey) https://www.forbes.com/sites/nigelwilson/2021/08/18/us-millennials-home-ownership-and-the-growing-chasm-between-aspiration-and-reality/?sh=7171d0bf5498\n\nThat is potentially 37% more homebuyers entering into the real estate market moving to cheap and affordable areas such as Detroit.\n\n>\tWhy would we want to give people that already have a significant amount of debt even more debt?\n\nBecause unlike credit card, medical, or student loan debt; buying a house will put money back into your own pocket through a mortgage. Other loans are just money pits where you receive nothing in return. To put down 20k and in 10-30 years own a home worth 200k is a different kind of debt. It builds wealth. The original poster was implying that student loan debt will be lowered to allow more people to get a mortgage and thus enter the housing market. We used to calculate DTI based on different calculations that were based on the outstanding debt instead of monthly payments and would usually ruin people‚Äôs DTI and make them ineligible. This change by Fannie will make the debt a fraction of what we used to put down to calculate DTI.\n\n>\tThis is an absolutely terrible idea. It makes it even easier for subprimes to get into the home buying game. This is exactly what caused the last crash. Subprime shit bundled in with real AAA loans.\n\nRefinance mortgages are the least risky transaction for mortgage brokers. These are people that have already purchased a home. ARMs are typically not issued as much as they used to be which was the real catalyst for people losing their homes in 08. Paying 1% interest for 2 years to have it jump up to 7% will can break people‚Äôs finances. The name of the game in 08 was to refinance before your ARM moved to the next interest bracket. However, once inflation caused an increase in interest people had no chance. They were left to refinance for 7% or pay their ARM at 7%. \n\nThis allowing lower income borrowers to take advantage of lower interest rates makes the whole market less risky. In an economic downtown people will have lower PITIA‚Äôs and therefore be less likely to default. I don‚Äôt think this is a bad thing and certainly isn‚Äôt a red flag leading to a 08 level of a housing crash.\n\n>\t4% is still really fucking high.\n\nThat is not true.

The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as mortgage-backed securities with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).

COVID 19 has not helped with this. But this is a 20-40 year problem for the housing market, and hopefully immigration helps us get to that rate of replacement, alongside more progressive policies around child rearing and low income support. It's a large reason why i support the reconciliation process and the Jobs and Families Act (thinking generationally). If maternity leave/paternity leave is mandated, the Child Tax Credit is expanded, University is cheaper (thus less student debt), and healthcare is more readily subsidized... People will have more children. Whether the amount of kids will be enough, is a different story.

Ginnie Mae is full faith and credit, and Fannie and Freddie are authorized to borrow from the treasury to keep the loans whole... So in essence, full faith and credit).

There's nothing wrong with it, the government had already earmarked it under President Trump, but it's just taking time. The government deficit is high, but still low relative to other nations that have gone into a debt crisis. We are nowhere near close to where Greece was. Furthermore, we may as well borrow when yields are at the lowest they've ever been. Better than deficit spending when T Notes are back to normal.\n\nCh 7 (subpoint 2): My point about that is actually that flippers are rational actors. They still have to pay a realtor to sell the house once they've done flipping it. They also need a certain ROI for the work itself. The calculation is that after a certain (invisible) threshold, you'll have outbid them. But it'll still be cheaper than buying a move in ready house to outbid them and renovate the home than to just over bid on a move in ready home.

You're bringing Los Angeles up to me as well, which is one of the Very High Cost of Living Area's I specifically mention is NOT a place you should buy to own/rent, because they are terrible to rent out and it's cheaper to rent than to own. The NYT has a great tool called the rent vs. Own calculator (I'm paraphrasing here). But, yes, you bring up Los Angelas and that's 100% the wrong city to bring up.

Land, and in the short term housing, are constant supply goods. And the rent charged for their use is subsequently based on whatever the market is willing to bear. This is fundamentally driven by the income available to pay rent (i.e. the income of the renters). Said more simply, if your thesis is correct, and landlords will raise rents to compensate for their higher property taxes etc., then the market was capable of accepting higher rents prior to the higher property taxes, so why wait for the property taxes to raise the rents?\n\nAnd if this part of your thesis breaks, if the landlords do not have pricing power in relation to changes in their costs, then what *does* determine the return of landlords?

In the meantime, lumber is dropping rapidly, and there's a chance it could fall below 700 today. I haven't checked real time prices yet, but it ended yesterday at 712.90. Lag times between prices and the impact on margin (I.E. home building starts tends to be 60-90 days). Copper is falling too. I expect Cement will fall in the coming months. Aluminum (hopefully) should start a slow descent in the coming months. You're going to start seeing the FY forecast for 2021 expand in terms of margin and revenues, as you have for KBH homes and Lennar already. Furthermore, 2022 numbers should continue to grow in terms  of strong margin expansion. By September or a month or two thereafter supply chain and whatever labor shortages there are should have cooled or started to cool.\n4. The home inventory shortage is from 3.5-5.5M depending on which source you cite, but whichever the number, that's a strong tailwind for the sector for the next 5-10 years. Their Debt to Equity is significantly lower than it was in early 2020, and there is a chance it could (and imho they should) eliminate it entirely in the next year or two. They don't need to pay those higher interest rates if they don't have to, and their bond ratings have increased dramatically, and will continue to increase. Which leads me to:\n5. Their financing (in the case of CCS at least) means that lower interest rates help them in the short term.\n6. The homebuilder confidence index is literally at near all time highs, at 89. They have a right to be confident, and the reason for the recent tick down was because of labor, supply chain issues, and high material costs. Those will resolve themselves, and in the case of the latter, have done so (and will continue to do so) in significant fashion.\n\nIn short---> Rising commodity prices forced home prices higher, which consumers accepted. --->commodities lower, but prices remain the same =higher margins that are sticky--> Lower debt to equity ratios which will eventually lead to higher sticky multiples due to increased buybacks and dividend raises.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow.

The reason behind that is that it's a better indicator. For example, 2020 prices at the pump were *exorbiently* low as demand cratered, so obviously it's going to look wild compared to 2021.

The market is simply not pricing them by their multiple as a streaming service either, and I'd be damned if their is a better dividend available for this price and this growth potential on the market. The only matter I would caution you on that might not come up in a financial analysis is that their executive team, especially Shari Redstone, are dubiously competent at best, and actively disdainful of their common stock shareholders at worst.
