This would trigger some heavy reaction in the stock markets and the housing market. However stocks are liquid and would recover relatively quicker to the housing after every rate increase. The fed will attempt to \"balance\" out everything they attempt to fix will be met by an overreaction/held hostage by the large investors. It could possibly lead of quicker than expected multiple rate increases eventually in the longer term (I had read a central banker quote that rates fall slowly but tend to rise quickly). It is possible that the situation will drag to avoid a catastrophic financial situation.\n\nPeople who have recently taken out loans will feel the pain of inflation and rising mortgage rates. The supply of money in the market for loans will be more targeted and the government will be have some co-investing schemes (part ownership by govt which could be bought off by the buyer later, or if the buyer sells, the govt will take a part of capital gains) for home buyers to keep the market afloat.\n\nMy investment strategy would be to invest in top quality stocks with relatively lower risk of market failure and good balance sheet with a lot of cash and positive cash flow.

There is a reason that Putin didn't meet with Elon when asked, and that's EVs are taking power away from Russia. (And it doesn't help that Space X got all of Russia's US space contracts)\n\nMass rapid EV adoption is super bullish for fossil fuels. The amount of energy that will be expended in the transition years will be hilarious. Unless we're somehow using solar powered excavators, rock crushers, mining trucks,  nuclear drybulk ships and magic green power when we plug them in at home. Decreasing the cost of energy to the consumer will also increase miles driven. \n\nRussia is selling energy they don't much care how you decide to use it. While $5-6 gas will make EVs look good $150 oil makes exploration and production look good outside of Russia which would not be fun for Vlad.\n\nIf your country produces a surplus of energy why would you care to meet with EV Jesus?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "\\>> There is a reason that Putin didn't meet with Elon when asked\n\nI thought it was because Putin and the russian oligarchs had a huge short position in Dogecoin!", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "it seems as though this week has been nothing but bad news for TSLA, peak FUD, reminds me of model 3 ramp uncertainty times and makes me think that the company is truly about to start rampaging returns soon. the FUD i'm talking about news on the SEC probe, the Fremont Racism thing, and the CNBC Taylor Ogan Drama. and then we got Musk doing Hitler memes which do not seem to be received positively...\n\nBut, to be optimistic, we just got pictures of dozens of model Y's from Giga Texas in the south parking lot, so we may actually have a few hundred if not thousands of delivery's coming from Austin this quarter.

But there's millions of cars out there with AP, and a good percentage of them are camera only now. Even if just 1% of all trips have some kind of phantom braking, and 1% of those people complain on some forum, it's going to be a lot of complaints. But it's going to be vastly outnumbered by the number of people who are having zero problems and never bother to mention it because it's completely normal to them.\n\nAnd the way statistical distributions work, the few number of problems aren't going to be evenly spread out. A few unlucky people are going to end up with a bunch of them just by chance. And for them it's going to seem like a \"disaster\", but it's mostly just bad luck. And until Tesla can figure out a way for braking to be nearly perfect, there will always be some unlucky people who get a bunch of phantom braking.\n\nI mean, Tesla could just choose to have AP be less cautious, and only brake when it's *very* confident it needs to. But it seems like from a safety perspective Tesla decided that it's better to have some unnecessary braking, especially in difficult situations.\n\n> Try going from radar autopilot to a vision autopilot without FSD beta on a 1 lane non interstate road.\n\nThis seems like a situation where you shouldn't be using AP? It's not really designed for that, and they'll let you turn it on based on your own judgement if you think it's safe and appropriate. But if it's giving you a lot of false braking, that's a sign that it's a bad situation to be engaging FSD. It's just not designed to work well there, and the result of being a little extra cautious for highway driving means that it's going to be way too cautious in a situation like that.\n\nAP is designed and tuned to work well and be safe for highway driving. I think if you use it where it works well and stop using it where it doesn't work well, you'll have much better results. For example, there's hundreds and hundreds of hours of people recording themselves driving with FSD on youtube. And anytime they go on the highway, it automatically switches over to regular camera only AP. You can see how well it works, it's not like there's all these people recording themselves and FSD works great and then it switches to AP on the highway and suddenly there's tons of phantom braking.

Especially a protest that has been relatively peaceful and is something that will end in ~month anyway.\n\nThis is a very fair question and I think something we'd love to see covered in the news more. What's going on, particularly in Ottawa, is that law enforcement have been timid about claiming jurisdiction. When the convoy arrived they were supposed to stay in the Parliament area, they did not. They parked in residential areas and began blaring their horns. The municipal police didn't want to touch it because they saw it as a National issue, it's a \"national protest\" after all, despite the fact that most mandates are provincial, not national. Of course the federal police force in Ottawa is actually relatively small, and there was certainly a strong worry about pushing these occupants out of the residential areas because many of them have brought their children.\n\nThe emergency powers were enacted, again in part, for a number of reasons, including giving stronger jurisdictional authority where needed, for example giving RCMP (federal police) the jurisdiction to enforce the law in residential Ottawa. Typically RCMP only enforce the federal area and around embassies.  \n\nAdditionally, the emergency powers enabled the use of financial tools, namely blocking significant funding coming from the US and disabling the financing of this occupation. This is probably the most effective and peaceful way to discourage these occupants from staying. When you have international interest groups financing your occupancy, it's easy to stick around. Cutting off the international funding in particular is useful to get people to go home. It's also non-violent.  \n\nWhich fundamental rights do you feel are being violated?

If he's cooky and weird they hate him for it, and if he acts like a typical CEO they'll hate him too. They make fun of him for having a big house and for selling it and living in tiny house.

Specifically, most PLTR critics say that Palantir won't be able to expand their business beyond traditional government/military contracts, and that Palantir's business is too manpower heavy and not scalable.\n\nThe critics are likely incorrect, based on my due diligence.  Palantir's commercial growth for their Foundry platform is showing signs of exponential takeoff.  Foundry is a generalized code platform that can be deployed quickly: in as little as a few days, compared to years for a custom consulting project.  \n\nI will say that there's no guarantee that PLTR will moon, just because TSLA did.  Uncertainty + risk is the nature of investing.  \n\nI went against the Mainstream consensus and held TSLA shares through all of the 2010s through the present, because of the conclusions I reached through due diligence of Tesla. \n\nIt's the same process that's led me to conclude that the Mainstream consensus on Palantir is also incorrect.  It will take years to find out.  I could be wrong, and there's no way to know in advance.  However, this is a risk I am willing to take.  I can also afford it, as 80% of my portfolio is in TSLA, maybe 15% in Index funds ETFs, and just 5% in much more speculative stuff like PLTR and ARKG", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Have you ever had a debate about PLTR with a bear that you think made good points?

On nearly every issue I dug deeper into: scalability, stock-based compensation, government vs. commercial business, and weirder stuff like data privacy, the bears were just consistently making the wrong calls. \n\nEven among professional investors, this has been evident.  Dave Lee's YouTube channel had an episode where Dave interviewed Ross Gerber about Palantir.  Gerber manages close to 2 Billion in assets, but made so many false statements about Palantir that [Dave ended up taking down the interview down and tweeting about his reasons for doing so](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/rupfp3/nice_now_he_has_to_back_up_his_claims_and_i_doubt/).\n\n**The bearish arguments that made the most sense to me actually came from Palantir's CEO himself.**  Alex Karp often said that the biggest hurdle to growing Palantir's business was convincing customers to buy a product they didn't know would be useful to them.  In many cases, potential customers' own IT departments opposed Palantir because they either didn't know much about it, or viewed it as a threat to their usefulness. \n\nThe best bear argument against Palantir at the moment, IMO, is that may not be able to grow their business as quickly as they project.  The company has gone from a U.S. commercial salesforce of 12 persons in 2020 to 80 persons in 2021, but nobody can know in advance how effective this will be at maintaining the rate of new Palantir Foundry subscriptions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "uncomfortable laugh", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I knew you'd show up when I mentioned Dave", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wow, thanks for the explainer!

There should be no need for custom code.

However, this is beginning to taper off and has a ceiling of about 5% dilution going forward.  It's been a source of much controversy and even anger from shareholders who didn't look into the regulatory filings, but a lot of it was from CEO Alex Karp exercising long-dated options from a decade ago.\n\nPalantir's finances are very robust.  They have around 2.5 Billion in liquid assets, zero debt, and had positive cash flow of 424 Million for 2021.  Extremely low risk of bankruptcy (close to zero risk in practical terms).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ultimately, do you see PLTR returns surpassing TSLA in the next 10 Years? \n\nI don't know.  \n\nTesla's addressable market is almost infinite at this point, given that every vehicle and power source needs to be transitioned to electric and renewable ASAP.  There's also vast need for robot labor and electric grid management products.  \n\nPalantir also has what I believe to be a very long growth runway, but I'm not entirely sure how big their addressable market gets.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, I'd love some more info about their revenue by product and segment, their pricing and sales model, etc. Do you know where I can find that?\n\nThe [investor presentations](https://investors.palantir.com/financials/quarterly-results) talk about customer acquisitions and the size of licensing fees, but there's not a whole lot of detail on how much they charge for the different services. \n\nSo far, there's no PLTR equivalent of Rob Mauer yet.  Dave Lee has discussed Palantir in a few of his non-TSLA related videos.  YouTubers Tom Nash and \"Palantir Vision\" also cover the company, but I don't think their understanding of Palantir's business is anywhere as good as Mauer's is of Tesla.  \n\nIt took years for the TSLA investor community to develop its current level of knowledge.  Palantir has been publicly traded less than 2 years, so the depth of expertise is not nearly as great.  \n\nI see PLTR today, as where TSLA was in the mid to late 2010's.  There's deep uncertainty about its future prospects, and a lot of misunderstanding in the mainstream about what the company actually does.  PLTR could trade sideways for years, like TSLA did for the 5.5 year period between 2014 and the end of 2019. \n\nMy assessment is that TSLA is a surer bet right now, but I like Palantir enough as a company to own some shares.

Decisionmakers don't have a \"birds eye\" view of what is going on within their organizations.  There can be significant lag between getting all the data together, organizing it, and analyzing it, by which time the scenario may have changed.  \n\nPalantir's Foundry platform ingests data from multiple, isolated sources and organizes it so that it can be analyzed.

{"title": "Facebook Ads Customer Here. Let Me Tell You Why Facebook aka Meta Will Not Be Back. Former IT Worker and Current eCommerce Owner.", "selftext": "First of all, I am writing this from a Facebook Customer (not user) point of view, also someone who was in the IT/TMT industry. I do not invest in the stock market, I don't play financial games, and I have no interest in making bets. \n\nThe reason I am writing this is that I want to give my two cents as someone who works in this field and might know a bit more insight detail about how shitty Facebook has become for advertisers, WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FACEBOOK'S REVENUE. I gave this advice to my buddies back in May and also October of 2021 and they've made some pretty good money when FB crashed (well, I am from NYC and a grad from a business school that's ten minutes away from Wall Street).\n\n**I**.\tiOS 14.5 Update Impact\n\n1.\tBefore iOS 14.5 Update: The obvious reason that everyone knows, is Apple's iOS 14.5 update killed FB advertising ROI, right before the update my friends and I who are all working in the eCommerce field can easily make high return on ads spend (ROAS) because the FB ads algorithm works wonders. we can easily attain a minimum of 300% ROAS, and most of the time it averages 500% for low-medium priced products and 1000%+ for high ticket products. This is the norm for the eCommerce industry using Facebook ads combined with professional marketers and content creators. I was a solo player doing it all myself with no professional help and I was able to get 400% ROAS as well.\n\n2.\tAfter Update: Now, since the update, our ads died, no matter what we tried we never got ROAS over 500%, my average ROAS on ad spend average is less than 200% since the update till today. Most of my friends working in the eCommerce industry quit Facebook ads because it is not profitable anymore, I am not talking about one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of eCommerce advertisers. They are not spending any more on FB ads and moved on to other platforms such as Google, Pinterest, and Tik Tok (I will get to this big part soon). At first, we thought it's gonna take some time for Facebook to catch up on the data lost and eventually get back on our feet, but it's been a year and we sincerely do not see the hope of getting back to what it used to be. Another indicator of this is that Facebook's revenue from mobile ads is much much greater than their non-mobile ads, part of this contributes to the much larger customer base, but another part of this is because mobile ads provide much more user data than non-mobile devices for FB to target better. I tried this personally because Facebook allows us to advertise and target based on devices, non-mobile device users deliver extremely shitty results.\n\n3.\tEffect Across All Categories: The shitty ads ROI not only reflected on the eCommerce field but also one of the major fields that bring billions to FB: Apps and Games. Apps and Games rely heavily on FB for acquiring new users, but since no data is available for FB to target better, it has become extremely expensive to acquire new users and force developers to shift their marketing budget to other platforms (Google/Youtube, Apple, Tik Tok). This is information is provided by my buddy who works at Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd in China, the developer of popular online game Arknights. He was also a former analyzer at ByteDance.\n\n4.\tTLDR: FB ads are shit now, will not rebound. Advertisers are moving away from FB\n\n**II**.\tFailing Attempt On Ecommerce\n\n1.\tFB Knows Nothing About eCommerce: Everyone knows that eCommerce is big for the internet, but not FB. Seriously, for years FB only provides ads service to the eCommerce ecosystem and nothing else. It was super easy money for them because ads spend is the easiest profit to catch and everything else is hard, dirty work that requires a lot of resources, talent, and investment. Facebook only attempted to get into the eCommerce domain seriously right after the iOS update because that is the only way they can save user purchase data on their system. Facebook Shop and Instagram Shop were only available after the update and they did a half-ass job on it, the design, backend, bugs, cross-function coordination is just a nightmare. Shop users facing bugs every day and I was unable to create offers and product launches for months during the peak holiday season.\n\n2.\tFB Cross-function Coordination: This is a big issue here for FB. One of the reasons I warned my friends at Wall Street in October is because FB was rolling out a big promotion for all Shop users, FB was paying for all of the shipping costs and giving big discounts for the customers using FB Shop and Instagram Shop. They cover Shipping up to $20 and discount up to $100. For example, a customer can go on my Facebook Shop and purchase a product for $5, and he will pay $5 for the order. I can set the shipping fee to $20, FB will need to pay me $25 for this order and they only receive $5 from the customer. This is great for eCommerce owners because it will boost sales and acquire a large amount of Shop users for FB. The problem? We have no way to advertise this deal, FB Ads department is like completely in another dimension when this promotion was going on. When we run ads on Facebook, we can drive the traffic to anywhere such as our Business Page, website, or a single post, ads piece, but when they launch the Shop service, the option is not on the FB Ads, aka WE CAN NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC TO FB SHOP USING FB ADS DIRECTLY. This is a complete disaster because we have to drive the traffic first to our FB Page or our Website, and then direct the customers to the Shop page, if you work in the internet industry you know that every step will drive away more than 50% of the users because human is lazy as f\\*\\*k. What this means for Facebook, when the eCommerce department of FB is spending perhaps millions and millions of dollar subsidizing FB Shop owners, their Ads department are wasting millions and millions of dollar driving traffics elsewhere but not directly to FB Shop which will be much more effective.\n\n3.\tSupply Chain and Logistics: The only reason I brought this up is that FB was trying to get into the eCommerce domain. Unlike Amazon, which has supply chain management groups in China to source products and manufactures, warehouses to store inventory, provide fleets to deliver packages. FB has nothing, even Shopify is doing much better than FB, and Shopify is building their logistic warehouse and delivery service (Go Shopify!). You cannot be an eCommerce platform if you have none of these, the only thing FB provides is ads, their agency in China have no communication whatsoever in the supply chain field, they are only there to open new ads account and collect money, period.\n\n4.\tTLDR: Facebook Ecommerce is failing, it‚Äôs lacking users, shop owners, logistics, supply chain. The internal issue is also holding it back, FB is only good in Ads. A sign that FB is not good at diversifying its income.\n\n**III**.\tTik Tok Challenge\n\n1.\tUser Challenge: I think everyone knows about this so I am not going into much detail, basically Tik Tok users are growing extremely fast and eating up the market share of Facebook. Not only this, but the users are much younger and spend much more time browsing the videos, which means the future is in Tik Tok‚Äôs hands. There is a lot of hating going on on Tik Tok because you cannot change the fact that young users are addicted to it. Instagram comes up with Reel as a response but it is also a half-assed job. Just like they come up with Story in response to Snapchat, they are copycats that cannot challenge the original. According to Al Ries and Jack Trout‚Äôs Positioning theory for marketing, once a brand is positioned in the mind of a consumer, it is extremely hard to change. Tik Tok is the king of a short video app, period. If FB run Reels as an independent app instead of an add-on feature on Instagram, it would‚Äôve been much better because a separate app/brand not associated with FB is easier to market than a subsidy.\n\n2.\tAds Challenge: Needless to say, TT and FB are in the same business, they are big on the advertising business. The difference is their algorithm and method, FB rely heavily on user data since day 1 of their inception. They kept it this way and thought that this will not change, but uh oh, Apple just said FU and shoved a middle finger right at Zuck‚Äôs face. Google is about to do the same soon. TT, on the other hand, also exploits user data heavily but they have come up with new ways to partner with advertisers. Not only do they provide a platform for advertisers to run ads automatically, but they also have partnerships on running organic traffic challenges across their platform for more viral effects. In other words, Facebook lets the advertisers do all the work, rely solely on their algorithm, but TT gives the option of doing work together, this is a big incentive for big advertisers because it will gain an advantage over small advertisers. You can see a lot of video challenges going on TT and a lot of them are events organized by TT to promote for big customers. TT as a new player in town was actually behind FB because TT lacks the data of the worldwide user that FB has been collecting and using for years, but now the loss of these data would put them in the same position.\n\np.s Google is in the Ads business, too, but their service is inelastic as FB services are more elastic. Also, FB collects data from users, but users provide Google with data voluntarily.\n\n3.\teCommerce Challenge: this is a very important advantage of TT, as you may know, TT has a Chinese counterpart: Douyin in China, they have been exploring e-commerce for years and was wildly successful. Tik Tok Shop is bringing billions of GMV for ByteDance and eating up the market share of top players such as Alibaba and [JD.com](https://JD.com). TT as the global version of Douyin can try and duplicate the success of eCommerce on a global scale. With already established supply chain, vendors, and manufacturer relationship, it‚Äôs easy for them to convince these Chinese Sellers to go global (mind you that global eCommerce is a big industry in China, and the majority of sellers on Amazon are also based in China). Their biggest challenge is logistics. In my honest opinion and reliable sources, TT is doing much much better than FB, they may not have as much user data as FB, but I believe they have more consumer buyer data than FB and they can improve their eCommerce algorithm with these. \n\np.s. my former eCommerce partner sells phone cases on Douyin (China) using their Shop and Ads system, their annual revenue is about $30 to $40 million with a 30% net profit margin for years 2019-2021\n\n4.\tOther Fields: this is purely my opinion, I used to work in the TMT industry in Beijing with friends and clients from companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and ByteDance, basically all the big tech companies. ByteDance has a very strong crisis awareness and it is always looking into diversifying its portfolio, they have tried medical, education, gaming, media, entertainment, eCommerce, and enterprise service. Not only do they enter these domains, but also leverage their strength of user traffic to succeed in these fields. In contrast, Facebook purchased Instagram and Whatsapp and contains itself in the social network and advertising domain. Their biggest step out was the purchase of Oculus VR and Meta concept. VR and Meta are nowhere to be profitable soon because of hardware limitations for our era, period (prediction from former executives of Qualcomm, also clients from Huawei, no one in the hardware industry believes in the VR concept, HTC believed in it and look where they are now).\n\n5.\tTLDR: Tik Tok is eating up FB‚Äôs market slowly, they are also doing a better job on other domains such as eCommerce than FB did. FB‚Äôs only income is advertising and their services are not inelastic like Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is late here in NYC and I am tired, this is everything I have in mind regarding Facebook. Like I said in the beginning, I am an outsider in the world of Wall Street, I just hope this information I provided can be some help for everyone here. Of course, don‚Äôt just take my words for it because these are purely my personal experience and observation around the industry that I am in. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for me, not just for FB. I also welcome anyone who has a different opinion and is willing to explain it.\n\n\n\nEdit 2.18.2021\n\nThis is to explain why FB is in more trouble than others such as Google and Amazon because someone asked in the comment, also explain how Ads Tracking works\ni\n\nFB can have data built into their software, model, AI, or whatever you call it, and use them to profit based on a prediction of how users behave. The advertisers will use the system and bid on ads placement in order to sell whatever they need to sell. The issue here is data are dynamic and it is always changing, what they have today may not work tomorrow. Of course, they have information like your birthday, location, name, and occupation that you provided to FB on your profile. What they do not have are your daily behavior and privacy information, and no they are not able to save it because they never had that kind of access in the first place.\n\nLet me explain it in detail here,\nWhen you allow an app to track for ads, such as FB, your mobile device actually assigned you an Ads-ID to be used by these apps (Apple calls it advertisingIdentifier and Google calls it Advertising ID), and the Ads-ID can be changed, this is why when you search for a pair of Nike sneakers on Google, you start to see it everywhere when you use other app or view other websites. The apps use that Ads-ID to identify you can collect data to build a model specifically on your profile to deliver ads that are relevant to you. You search for Nike on Google using Safari, Safari now knows that Ads-ID 0001 did this, and now FB App received this information that Ads-ID 0001 is interested in Nike, you will start seeing relevant ads because of this. Other apps such as free games or whatever news app also receive this information and they have Ads SDK built to them provided by platforms such as Google or FB and now you start seeing Nike ads on those apps to for retargeting you to make a purchase. \n\nThe Ads-ID was the first step in protecting our privacy, these ads companies only know our Ads-ID and were never able to identify us personally (they could if they really wanted to and be total evil and read the information line to line, but that's not profitable).\n\nFB relies heavily on this type of dynamic data they collect on a daily basis and there is no way they will save this enormous amount of data to their server because old data will not work well anyway after a certain time. Now, what happens after iOS 14.5 update is people opt out of tracking, opting out was always an option, it's nothing new, what Apple did here is making a default option that you are opted out, whereas before the update you were opted in for tracking as default option. This caused more than 95% of users to opt-out which is a total nightmare for FB. What happens here now is that FB cannot identify who we are through that Ads-ID anymore and cannot build models and deliver ads that are relevant to users. You still get the same amount of advertising on your devices but they are just not relevant to you anymore. Take our first example again, you search for Nike sneakers, but all the ads you are seeing after could be a baby diaper, car insurance, beauty products, or pet food even though you do not have a pet. All of this is because FB cannot identify who you are, where you are, what you do every single day, all of a sudden, FB doesn't know who you are and what you want.\n\nThis is the ultimate atomic bomb here because almost 100% of their revenue is from ads, this affects not FB but also Instagram because they are running on the same model, and Whatsapp is definitely not gonna help here because even if they push out something to make money it will be based on the same model. If they charge a fee people just gonna run To telegram or other messenger apps.\n\nNow let me explain why Google and Amazon weren't affected by this and why Google is able to push this anti-tracking policy.\n\nAmazon as an eCommerce website, all of the user data, purchase behavior, and relevant information are all being acted on either their website or within its app, so this information collected daily is being processed and saved on Amazon's side, it does not need the Ads-ID because everything is done within Amazon itself. Amazon can do identifying itself without relying on Ads-ID because it can predict your purchase behavior based on what you are doing within the Amazon app, no need for them to collect outside of their app or website. FB on the other hand is constantly collecting data that is outside of their app, take our old example again, when you search for Nike on Safari, Facebook knows it because it is allowed to track, other information such as where you are at the very moment now, what text you sent, what games you play, or which side-chick you are visiting tonight are all being collected even though these actions are performed outside of Facebook app because it was allowed to track. This is why Facebook was so eager to push their FB/Instagram Shop out and subsidize hundreds of millions into in on October, November, and December last year because they want user purchase data and buying behavior to start being performed within FB/Instagram app in order to improve their advertising performance. I think they failed miserably because they did a horrible job.\n\nGoogle is almost on the same page with Amazon in another way. Everything we need Google for is actually performed within Google's app or website, so they did not need that much data outside of their domain in order to perform well. Especially their main ads category is Search Ads because users actively provide data that is needed by Google by searching everything they need on Google. Google's search ads built models based on the enormous amount of searching data they actively receive every single day, they don't need to go out of their way to collect our personal information in order to sell more ads. Of course, it would help Google if they do collect, but it is not critical for them, unlike Facebook.\n\nBtw, Google and Amazon can identify you and your behavior by your user ID, no Ads-ID is needed for them, especially Google, they can identify you cross-platform such as Google Search, Map. Youtube, Gmail, and any other platform that uses Google Account to log in.\n\nTLDR: Facebook actively collects our data outside of their domain for maximum ads efficiency and now they can't do it, Instagram uses the same model that's why it's no help.

FB can have data built into their software, model, AI, or whatever you call it, and use them to profit based on a prediction of how users behave. The advertisers will use the system and bid on ads placement in order to sell whatever they need to sell. The issue here is data are dynamic and it is always changing, what they have today may not work tomorrow. Of course, they have information like your birthday, location, name, and occupation that you provided to FB on your profile. What they do not have are your daily behavior and privacy information, and no they are not able to save it because they never had that kind of access in the first place.\n\nLet me explain it in detail here,\n\nWhen you allow an app to track for ads, such as FB, your mobile device actually assigned you an Ads-ID to be used by these apps (Apple calls it advertisingIdentifier and Google calls it Advertising ID), and the Ads-ID can be changed, this is why when you search for a pair of Nike sneakers on Google, you start to see it everywhere when you use other app or view other websites. The apps use that Ads-ID to identify you can collect data to build a model specifically on your profile to deliver ads that are relevant to you. You search for Nike on Google using Safari, Safari now knows that Ads-ID 0001 did this, and now FB App received this information that Ads-ID 0001 is interested in Nike, you will start seeing relevant ads because of this. Other apps such as free games or whatever news app also receive this information and they have Ads SDK built to them provided by platforms such as Google or FB and now you start seeing Nike ads on those apps to for retargeting you to make a purchase. This was the first step in protecting our privacy, these ads companies only knows our Ads-ID and were never able to identify us personally (they could if they really wanted to and be total evil and read the information line to line, but that's not profitable).\n\nFB relies heavily on this type of dynamic data they collect on a daily basis and there is no way they will save this enormous amount of data to their server because old data will not work well anyway after a certain time. Now, what happens after iOS 14.5 update is people opt out of tracking, opting out was always an option, it's nothing new, what Apple did here is making a default option that you are opted out, whereas before the update you were opted in for tracking as default option. This caused more than 95% of users to opt-out which is a total nightmare for FB. What happens here now is that FB cannot identify who we are through that Ads-ID anymore and cannot build models and deliver ads that are relevant to users. You still get the same amount of advertising on your devices but they are just not relevant to you anymore. Take our first example again, you search for Nike sneakers, but all the ads you are seeing after could be a baby diaper, car insurance, beauty products, or pet food even though you do not have a pet. All of this is because FB cannot identify who you are, where you are, what you do every single day, all of a sudden, FB doesn't know who you are and what you want.\n\nThis is the ultimate atomic bomb here because almost 100% of their revenue is from ads, this affects not FB but also Instagram because they are running on the same model, and Whatsapp is definitely not gonna help here because even if they push out something to make money it will be based on the same model. \n\nNow let me explain why Google and Amazon weren't affected by this and why Google is able to push this anti-tracking policy.\n\nAmazon as an eCommerce website, all of the user data, purchase behavior, and relevant information are all being acted on either their website or within its app, so this information collected daily is being processed and saved on Amazon's side, it does not need the Ads-ID because everything is done within Amazon itself. Amazon can do identifying itself without relying on Ads-ID because it can predict your purchase behavior based on what you are doing within the Amazon app, no need for them to collect outside of their app or website. FB on the other hand is constantly collecting data that is outside of their app, take our old example again, when you search for Nike on Safari, Facebook knows it because it is allowed to track, other information such as where you are at the very moment now, what text you sent, what games you play, or which side-chick you are visiting tonight are all being collected even though these actions are performed outside of Facebook app because it was allowed to track. This is why Facebook was so eager to push their FB/Instagram Shop out and subsidize hundreds of millions into in on October, November, and December last year because they want user purchase data and buying behavior to start being performed within FB/Instagram app in order to improve their advertising performance. Which I think they failed miserably.\n\nGoogle is almost on the same page with Amazon in another way. Everything we need Google for is actually performed within Google's app or website, so they did not need that much data outside of their domain in order to perform well. Especially their main ads category is Search Ads because users actively provide data that is needed by Google by searching everything they need on Google. Google's search ads built models based on the enormous amount of searching data they actively receive every single day, they don't need to go out of their way to collect our personal information in order to sell more ads. Of course, it would help Google if they do collect, but it is not critical for them, unlike Facebook.\n\nTLDR: Facebook actively collects our data outside of their domain for maximum ads efficiency and now they can't do it, Instagram uses the same model that's why it's no help. Google/Amazon isn't affected much because we actively give data/information to them, they don't need to collect as much data as FB outside of their domain in order to profit so much.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If you are so interested, go check for how long ago Mark have alerted for small businesses and other marketeers, such as yourself, would have a business hurt.

{"title": "[TA] AMC is aiming for 32$ (Cup & Handle, 1H)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.tradingview.com\\/x\\/avUz5zBq\\/](https://preview.redd.it/04rxraxtodi81.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=514e45d0b38f659b4cd351904b7d31520d32db0c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're looking at the 1 hour chart for the AMC stock price and things look quite good after the recent drop in the whole stock market.The previous downtrend was very intense and got extended by fear about inflation & the planned interest rate hikes throughout 2022. We saw the market bottoming out about 3 weeks ago. While the whole market is retracing, we see different patterns emerging among the many stocks we can trade. The AMC stock price is currently printing a Cup & Handle on the intraday chart.\n\nWe could've spotted the trendchange for the stock price with a \"change of market structure\", a very basic but powerful pattern (covered that in one of my videos extensively). The price is moving from lower highs to lower lows within a downtrend. As soon as we see a change of structure, the price will aim for higher highs and higher lows. The circumstance is underlined by a rounding bottom, which forms the cup.What we want to see is decreasing volume during the downtrend & increasing volume during the uptrend. This translates to the sellers being exhausted and the buyers being back in control.\n\nThe price is sitting right below a key level at 20$, which has been relevant for the past 5 years. We saw many support/resistance flips at this price level and the chances for breaking this level within the current upwards trend are pretty high. This price is the break-out level we're looking for.\n\nDuring the past trading-days, we can observe the price being rejected at the 20$ mark multiple times. Still, buyers manage to push the price further in this direction - which increases the probability for the breakout. I'm also expecting this price level to be an important support during 2022.\n\nWhen we're looking for a target projection for the Cup & Handle pattern, we measure the decrease in price from the breakout level to the bottom of the Cup (53.18%). We use the same size to project a target from the breakout level, which brings us to 32$. Coincidentally this price is also our previous high from December 2021 and the starting point for the downfall. We can expect some sell pressure there (traders breaking even or taking profit).\n\nI'm expecting the price to aggressively move towards the 32$ level within the next 3 weeks. Those 3 weeks are leading to the earnings, which are expected to be better than the forecast. I don't think that this is priced in yet and especially short-term traders will join the train for short-term gains. This additional momentum, combined with the option market/ shorts being liquidated, will fuel the upcoming breakout.\n\nLooking forward to it! I'll keep you guys updated.  \n\n\nEdit:[In this (german) video i go a bit more into detail](https://youtu.be/vNgVSGJnt0c)", "id": "sumllc", "created_utc": 1645097154.0, "score": 388, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "I cup and handle your wife‚Äôs tits while I clapped her cheeks yesterday", "score": 555, "replies": [{"body": "This just finished me off üòÇ", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "That's exactly what your wife said!", "score": 58, "replies": []}, {"body": "I red that with Connor McGregor's voice", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "lmao nice", "score": 32, "replies": []}, {"body": "A.M.CDEEZNUTZ", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I concur", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bruh ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cup and handle?

And every other major survival game.  I often use ARK as an example of the direction MMOs should have gone post WoW, and where they would have gone much earlier if projects were being directed by enthusiasts instead of bizdev people.\n\nI've made products on Roblox, worked in mobile in the early days on AR products as a Unity dev, played Eve off/on for nearly two decades, and tried out nearly every major game IP. I was there for virtual boy, wii fit, WoW peak popularity, rockband, Google Glass, Pokemon Go, have a VR headset, have a personal VR project, and currently I'm using one of my game related reddit accounts to post this.\n\nIf you notice there are trends with all those products - they don't take over the world permanently.  ARK is doing well currently due to the 2020/COVID bump, but if you look at the userbase charts it was [on its way out](https://playtracker.net/insight/game/1375) in 2019.\n\nI like gaming products and social engagement related products.  I do think there is and will be an industry for them.  But it's not going the way of Ready Player One like many think, and if Meta is banking on it then it's already on its way of going the direction of Yahoo, Myspace, AOL, etc because those projects aren't going to permanently support a stock valuation the level Meta is at.  Keep in mind that a lot of the population is resistant to FB related products - people join FB out of necessity, Insta is new enough that youth still join it willingly, but FB had to acquire it.  Similarly FB had to acquire Oculus.  If FB had home grown oculus it would have received significantly less support.(consider how much backlash non adoptees had to google glass beta testers - many going in to public spaces with google glass were treated with outright hostility due to people not wanting recording devices pointed at them...that was a product from google a decade ago when people were still more neutral towards the company rather than Meta now which has had a negative sentiment for a while).\n\nWe will gradually have more AR and VR tech, but VR games are going to continue being niche.  10m users is nothing to a big tech company like Meta that cares about having billions of users and having continual major growth on the horizon(and oculus only has 4.6m cumulative sales last I checked - that's not much better than MSFT's Zune).  MSFT stock dipped hard back around 2001 after it reached max penetration with windows and struggled to find users in other markets.  Keep in mind that it was first to market with some products and had second place with others...but it was never dominant enough for it to matter to the stock price, those projects were barely keeping the company relevant and it was going the way of IBM or HP as a whole.  XBox, Zune, Bing, Surface, Windows phones, content stores, buying LinkedIn, and surface tablets/laptops didn't do much  -  it took Azure to save the company from increasing irrelevance.  Stock price followed this, it took over a decade for it to return to relevance.  I had coworkers roll their eyes when mentioning the stock awards they got during that period because it was just going to be turned to cash ASAP and turned in to a different stock instead of being considered a valuable capital asset like today.
