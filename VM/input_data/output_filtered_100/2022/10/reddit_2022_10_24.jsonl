A better GDP report failed to cheer traders.  \n\nThe Hang Seng Index slumped 5 per cent to 15,401.64 at the local noon trading break, the lowest level since May 2009.

HSBC added 0.1 per cent before its earnings report.\nAlibaba Group plunged 9.8 per cent to HK$62.80, set for a record-low close, and Tencent Holdings slumped 8.3 per cent to HK$213.40. Meituan crashed 11 per cent to HK$125.40. Chinese developers Longfor Group plunged 12 per cent to HK$16.84 and Country Garden lost 7.7 per cent to HK$1.32.  \n\nXi secured a tradition-breaking third-term as the Communist Party boss after its 20th National Congress over the weekend, and headed a new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) with four close allies, while sidelining Premier Li Keqiang among others.  \n  \nThe risk premium for Chinese stocks in offshore markets “could stay elevated in the short-run, possibly due to investor concerns over the absence of recognised market-oriented economic reformers in the newly-configured PSC,” Goldman Sachs said in a report to clients.  \n  \nXi, in a report to the Congress, had called for “regulating the mechanism of wealth accumulation,” signalling a tighter oversight of private capital following months of crackdown on tech companies, while also pushing his vision for “common prosperity to help close the wealth gap in the nation.\nHSBC gained 0.1 per cent to HK$41.60. Pre-tax profit probably dropped 55 per cent from a year earlier, according to market consensus, before its third-quarter report on Tuesday.

Do you agree with Professor Siegel?  Where do you see U.S. real estate prices heading in the next 12-18 months?\n\nSome other expert opinions including Professor Siegel:\n\n# Jeremy Siegel, Wharton professor of finance\n\n\"I expect housing prices fall 10% to 15%, and the housing prices are accelerating on the downside,\" Siegel told CNBC in a recent interview, noting that housing prices by any indicator are going down.\n\nIn a separate interview with CNBC, he said: \"I think we're gonna have the second-biggest housing price decline since post WWII period over the next 12 months. That's a very, very significant factor for wealth \\[and\\] for equity in the housing market.\"\n\n# Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics\n\n\"Buckle in. Assuming rates remain near their current 6.5% and the economy skirts recession, then national house prices will fall almost 10% peak-to-trough,\" he said in a recent tweet. \"Most of those declines will happen sooner rather than later. And house prices will fall 20% if there is a typical recession.\"\n\nIn a recent housing report, he said: \"The housing market is the most interest-rate-sensitive sector of the economy. It's on the front lines of the fallout from the Fed's efforts to bring down inflation.\"\n\n\"There's going to be a coast-to-coast downturn in the housing market. It's going to be brutal. No part of the market is immune.\"\n\n# David Rosenberg, veteran economist and Rosenberg Research chief\n\n\"We have a massive housing bubble right now. Most of the household balance sheet is residential real estate, and it is equities,\" Rosenberg said in a RealVision interview released this week.\n\nThe economist pointed to the Fed's tightening efforts to bring inflation down from recent rates of 8-9% to its 2% target.\n\n\"They want the stock market to go down. They want home prices to go down. Why? Because there's not a snowball's chance in hell they're going to get to their 2% holy grail consumer inflation, without there being a period now of asset deflation. It is 100% necessary.\"\n\n# Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist\n\nThe veteran economist agrees there's a severe downturn coming — but he expects it will be a while before higher rates really hit home prices and demand. \n\n\"The Fed's rate hikes have indeed led to a sharp fall in applications for building permits. However, construction employment hasn't yet even begun to decline, presumably because many workers are still busy finishing houses started when rates were lower,\" he said in a recent comment piece.\n\n\"And the wider economic effects of the coming housing slump are still many months away,\" he said. \n\n# Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics\n\nShepherdson believes the steep drop in home sales hasn't hit bottom yet, and even buyers who set their sights lower to cheaper houses will still face bigger mortgage payments.\n\n\"We expect a drop of 15-to-20% over the next year, in order to restore the pre-COVID price-to-income ratio,\" the strategist said in a note last week. \n\n\"In short, housing is in free-fall. So far, most of the hit is in sales volumes, but prices are now falling too, and they have a long way to go.\"\n\n# Don Peebles, real estate developer and Peebles Corp. CEO\n\n\"I think the housing market is on its way into a recession. We're going to see price declines — price declines have already begun to take place,\" Peebles told Fox News last week.\n\n\"I look at this as though we have this freight train out of control, speeding up, speeding up with low interest rates, and no one looked to start slowing it down or stepping on the brakes. Now all of a sudden its going to come crashing into the station,\" he said. \n\n# Chen Zhao, economics research lead at real estate brokerage Redfin\n\n\"The housing market is going to get worse before it gets better,\" Chao said last week, alongside a report that found a record 22% of homes for sale had a price drop in September.\n\n\"With inflation still rampant, the Federal Reserve will likely continue hiking interest rates. That means we may not see high mortgage rates — the primary killer of housing demand — decline until early to mid-2023.\"\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/home-prices-housing-crash-fall-jeremy-siegel-paul-krugman-bubble-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/home-prices-housing-crash-fall-jeremy-siegel-paul-krugman-bubble-2022-10)", "id": "yc85k4", "created_utc": 1666608868.0, "score": 2355, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 714, "comments": [{"body": "20% decline after 2 years of 20% gains seems appropriate and not shocking", "score": 1691, "replies": [{"body": "That sounds like a best case scenario for home owners tbh", "score": 437, "replies": [{"body": "Getting married and moving out next year.

Fact is, we can't get exact numbers without having exact numbers.  A lot of it depends on the rent payment, home purchase price, mortgage rate, and shape the house is in.\n\nThat said, you mention things like down payment in your example, but they will have that in both scenarios. The only difference is what they do with the money in the meantime and the difference in the eventual home purchase price potentially reducing the down payment as well.  Sure, they could buy a bond and gain 5% yearly on that down payment... or they could put it in the stock market and lose 20%. I don't think we can include investments.\n\nAlso, you don't seem to be considering that the delay in purchasing the house will result in 2 extra years of payments.  Although the first 2 years won't put much towards principal, it will still pay 2 years of interest that they'd be paying anyway.  So 2 years of rent + 30Y mortgage = 32 years of payments vs. buying the house immediately and having it paid off in 30 years.  And so, at that point, you just have to subtract taxes and insurance from the rent payment to get how much money was (roughly) saved by taking the loan immediately.\n\nI'm not saying buying immediately is the better move, I'm just saying it's not as cut and dry as most people seem to think.  If home prices drop 20% in 2 years, it's probably a good idea to wait... if they drop 10% or less... harder to say.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A 2 year 70k treasury bond at 4.5% \\*will\\* earn $6800. That is how bonds work. Sure, you could invest it in the stock market and make 30k. Or invest it in the stock market and make 20k. But in this example, we're choosing to invest in treasury bonds. Baring complete economic collapse, as long as you hold it to maturity that treasury bond is earning you 4.5% a year. So you absolutely need to consider the lost opportunity cost of not investing in bonds when considering a down payment.\n\nPerson 1: Buys house at 350,000 as in the above example. As the math shows, their remaining principle after 2 years is 274,105.85. They have spent $120,000. Even give them back they get back say $14k in taxes deductions. That means they are down $106,000. Honestly its probably much more than this given property upkeep, property taxes, insurance... but we were being generous.\n\nPerson 2: Buys bond, rents for 2 years as in the example above. Down $29,200.\n\nIf two years later, the housing market hasn't changed at all. house still costs 350,000. Mortgage is still 7%, person 2 can 70k on a down payment, then immediately spend 6800 to further pay down the principle. They are now down $106,000, just like person 1. But their remaining principle is $273,320. From this point out, their monthly payments will be the same as person 1 (as they got the same loan) but each month their loan will earn slightly less interest so they'll get to pay slightly more to principle. So person 2 comes out ahead. Note that in this example, were both generously undercounting person 1's expenses and also assuming person 2 doesn't also make some money investing the \\~300 that remains in their bank account each month because they only spend 1500 on rent rather than 1800 on a mortgage.\n\nNow of course, if now that 350,000 house is 380,000 suddenly person 2 is behind (unless mortgage rates drop. But even then, person 1 can refinance for less than 30k, so they probably made the right call). So person 1 still can certainly come out ahead. You just don't need a 10% drop for renting to be the right call. Even if property values stay flat, it'll probably have been better to rent.\n\nPersonally... you'd obviously have to look at the exact numbers for your area.

Why'd they do that?\n\nNow I'm going oh, you want a guarantee?  Ok, I'm going to assume they left it all in their money market account and made 1%.

Rent payments are often more than the mortgage/taxes/insurance/maintenance so the landlords don't lose money, if you want an equivalent space to rent.

Abolished Single Family Zoning. Some cities will fight it but the default norm has been changed by the state government.\n3. All commercial spaces can be converted to denser apartment/condo building WITHOUT any approvals from community.\n4. Every house built over 2500sqft land can split it into 2 lots. Moreover, they can build ADU on each lot as well. Basically allowing 4 units on what is a SFH today.\n5. Enforcing RHNA housing element for each city. As per new RHNA guideline, each city has to build about 3x more housing units in next 8 years than they did in past few decades! Failure to submit a plan for it will result into Builder's remedy and city/county will have to approve all projects that meet state housing requirements without any community feedback.\n\nMoreover, California is investing the most in public transit.

You always hear the argument that a mortgage is cheaper than renting, and that can be true, but only if you saved up money to be able to put in a down payment and hopefully enough to avoid PMI. Otherwise you are paying into interest rates for a long long time. Sure you can refinance, but how much more are you paying for the total price of your home after 30 years?\n\nIt's one of those things that you can input numbers into a mortgage calculator and see what you can potentially afford monthly, or an overall budget for a house assuming you are never laid off, become ill, divorced, etc. However, those calculators and what people never talk about is the total cost of the house, with interest, will be.\n\nMy grandparents had an idea of the total cost of their home with interest and that gave them the incentive to pay it off as quickly as possible to avoid the interest costs applied to their loan. I don't ever recall a loan officer or real estate agent ever informing me about my house purchase and the lifetime costs of the home because they all assume that it will appreciate in value and be sold off for a profit way before it will ever be paid off. Who does that nowadays when home buyers can use the home new valuation to buy a moar biggerer house that also costs more but its ok because it will also appreciate more? And so on and so on\n\nYou'll find financial advice on why credit cards are bad but also good to build credit, but a home is good debt because it appreciates in value, except when it doesn't, like now.

Though inflation remains high, the Fed's Loretta Mester, James Bullard, and Neel Kashkari have made comments suggesting the Fed could pause on rate hikes in December. That led stocks to rally last week despite mixed corporate earnings reports.\n\n\"Inflation is becoming less of a blackhole of pain and the Fed sees that,\" Lee said. \"While skeptics say this is because something is 'gonna break,' commentary by Fed members show it is arguably more due to acknowledging that monetary policy takes time.\"\n\nOther experts have also noted inflation is trending down, raising concerns that the Fed could overtighten financial conditions if it plows forward with more aggressive rate increases. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel noted that there is a lag of about 18 months between what Consumer Price Index data shows and what inflation is \"on the ground,\" meaning the inflation picture could be far less bleak than the Fed initially believed. \n\n\"A more nuanced dialogue is taking place regarding CPI as well. \\[The\\] Fed conditioned markets to only focus on 'hard' data,\" Lee said. \"Many investors are starting to see the fallacy of looking at lagged CPI versus leading \\[CPI indicators\\],\" he added. \n\nLabor market conditions are also showing signs of cooling, a key signal the Fed is watching for to understand if inflation is easing. \n\n\"All of this, in our view, are reasons that any equity rally should exceed that seen in July, which was the 'false dawn of a Fed pivot,'\" Lee said, noting that the rally in July lasted for 23 days and resulted in stocks gaining 16%. Already, the S&P 500 gained 3% in an impressive turnaround last week, boosted by hope the central bank will ease up on aggressive measures to control inflation. \n\nBut other analysts remain skeptical. Ned Davis Research noted that a Fed pause in interest rate hikes wouldn't be enough to boost stocks, and any gains made would be fleeting until the Fed signals a true policy pivot. And a pivot likely won't happen until the Fed sees clearer inflation data, more softness in the labor market, or \"something breaks in the financial system,\" the research firm added, casting some doubt on any potential upside for stocks. ", "id": "ycd9wb", "created_utc": 1666623088.0, "score": 290, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 189, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And boy do I have a spicy one for you today...   Lasers BITCH!\n \nApril 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it’s clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouchée for what will happen next.\n\nDevelopments since April 2021 include:\nMavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It’s getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.\n \nMVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for \"good business practices\".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.\n\nMVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. \nMVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an “OEM friendly” white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\n\nNow the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..\n\nMavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...\n\nMavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. \n\nMavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.\n\nMavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.\nMVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. \n\nMVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/\nTo which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???\n\nSumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.\n\nMVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...\n\nSingle Unit - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/3.jpg\n5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg\nTalk about classy..\n\nMVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July’s earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying “Mavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen”. Sumit’s character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...\n \nThe MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   \n\nTheir investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. \n\nThey have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  \n\nIn January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That’s a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. \n\nIn addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ\n\nDone so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   \n\nMany AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. \nThen factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. \nIt’s going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it’s inevitable.\n\nOh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.\n\nListen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to \"short squeeze these nuts\" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.\n\nTLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW\n\nP.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.  \n\nPositions \nhttps://imgur.com/Z2dvqdS\nAnd a Spreadbet account that makes Bill Hwang look like a genius", "id": "ycgz7f", "created_utc": 1666631887.0, "score": 404, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 375, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|138|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ycgz7f/mvis_lasers_are_the_future_and_the_future_is_now/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ycgz7f)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ycgz7f)\n    \n>TL;DR: MVIS is a undervalued company with a lot of potential.

He made an overbid for a company that's failed to monetize its user growth. It seems that a fundamental change in how to monetize twitter is needed. A lot of investors likely want out.\n\nTwitter has the social media network problem. It was theorized that once the size of the network reaches a critical point, adding new users will boost revenue and profitability because of scale. This is slowly unravelling across all major social media companies.\n\n*and SECOND, he's actually planning to fire 74% of Twitter workers. Now, how the hell is that beneficial to our economy??!! Is he going to pay for their unemployment benefits, and why would he?*\n\nTBH, He's not really incorrect in laying off employees.Twitter had \\~ 4000 employees in 2018. Now it has 7500.[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TWTR/twitter/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TWTR/twitter/number-of-employees)\n\nHe's buying the company, and feels like there's a lot of bloat. Also, for all the hype about growth, twitter's revenue is actually declining (as compared to 2021). 75% may be too far, but 50% doesn't seem unreasonable.\n\nFurther, Elon musk is known to be a hard ass. He works his employees to their breaking point and then some. That might be wrong morally, but he clearly doesn't think so.\n\n*Is he going to pay for their unemployment benefits?* Probably. This is something you can't get out of easily. Further, a lot of employees that will be laid off will likely get a generous severance.\n\n*He's just a typical Capitalist looking only for his own fortune.* Yeah. But this was never unexpected. However, he also looked out for basically every shareholder of twitter this year, who would've seen \\~ $20/ share (50%) loss. On the low end, they could've seen a SNAPesque crash. This also includes all employees who own stock.\n\n*Twitter is right: Elon is just trying to stall the process and has already made up his mind of not buying, and that's the reason he's coming up with all these negative BS statements. He rather loses 1 billion than invest 44.*  Yeah. You're probably right. Something tells me he doesn't care though. He's made some insane bets. TSLA has a good year, and he could make all that back.
