As rates go up, specifically the risk free rate that the fed is basically changing, the calculation for where to invest changes. I'm sure there's tons of math models about supply and demand and other stuff but the part I like to focus on is just that big funds, pension funds, etc, allocate their money on a risk reward basis. \n\nWhen the risk free rate goes up, it's not just that people irrationally flee stocks. Where would they flee to? Cash? No. What really happens is big funds sell out of some of their dividend stocks and buy bonds instead. And then they or other funds sell out of their risky super high multiple tech stocks to buy safer dividend stocks. In short, the whole market pushes a little further to safety or yield depending on your point of view. \n\nSelling dividend stocks to buy 4% bonds makes sense. It's risk free, and you are selling your 2% dividend with a possibile equity upside, to a guaranteed 4%. \n\nSelling high pe tech with the possibility of a moonshot for 2% guaranteed yield with a possibility of equity appreciation also makes sense. Why wait 40 years for your tech stocks earnings to actually come in when you can get some hard dividends right now and rotate back into tech if it looks super cheap. \n\nIn reality, if rates go and stay above 4%, stocks will have some real competition with bonds and fixed income for investment dollars. When rates were 1% or lower there really was almost no downside to betting on moonshots. Money supply was increasing, which meant both the moonshot stocks could finally become profitable or at the very least attract some of the new printed money as new bagholders for you to sell to. \n\nBut with rates going to 4% there's going to be fewer new dollars heading to stocks as compared to last year. There's real competition for those dollars now. If people start locking up money in bonds, that money stays locked for years. It won't come rushing back into stocks any time soon. And it also can't be spent by old farmer joe on gifts for the grandkids. This also means with more money locking itself up for some years, and less money being invested in stocks AND less money being spent on crap, earnings could also take a hit. \n\nIt's not just the fear or the panic or the irrational market. It's real money leaving the market to go lock itself up somewhere else. That's why stocks sell off on interest rate rises. And it gets worse the higher rates go. If rates ever went to 10%, why would anyone buy stocks when they could get a 10% yield risk free?", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "While good points, I‚Äôve to disagree on one thing. Dollars being locked up by buying bonds. Bonds can be bought in the market or directly from the debtor. In the case of buying it from the market, someone else, specifically the person that sells you the bond, makes the money that they are now free to spend it on goods, services and assets. If a company issues bond and you‚Äôre buying it, the company is raising capital to buy inventory or pay people for goods or services. So money isn‚Äôt locked up unless the bond issuer does nothing with the money and let it sit on the balance sheet. Generally they don‚Äôt do that.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Your point is well made except for Treasury debt. Buying government debt doesn't necessarily get redeployed, or at least not in a 1:1 way where buying new apple issue bonds or buying any debt on the open market will.\n\nAlso, as rates rise, anyone on the open market selling you the debt is likely taking a loss on it. They COULD use that money, but it's less than it was when they started (likely). You're also right that the money from a new issue of corporate debt would be used and deployed, but it likely won't be used to invest in stocks. Yes I do understand that the money will circulate and could eventually find it's way into stocks, but then we go back to the real competition for investor dollars again and it's just as likely the second order money gets put in fixed income or is used to grow or expand directly or pay down existing debt or etc etc etc. \n\nAgain, it's not that the money disappears.

And yes it absolutely matters what you eat.\n\n\"Calories in, calories out\" is accurate. But not all calories are created equal. And what i mean, is how we've decided to calculate what any one food's total calories are.\n\nWe don't take into account fiber calorie loss or protein calorie loss. Or how different foods affect hunger. These are very important. I'll explain.\n\nSugar/Carbs and Fat have about a 90 percent calorie absorption rate when consumed. Protein is 70 percent, due to the body needing to use energy to turn the protein into useable forms (has to break the protein molecule apart before it's useable, unlike fats and carbs that are already in a useable form)\n\nAlso sugar/carbs are not satiating. They also cause release of dopamine in the brain, causing them to be 'addictive'. For example if you eat a meal that is mostly carbs you'll be hungry again in 15 minutes to an hour. On top of that you may crave the dopamine rush from eating the sugar/carbs causing you to eat more. You may have self control but most humans do not. This is why sugar/carbs are so bad. They don't full you up and they're addictive. Most of the world falls into this. This is why sugar/carbs are so bad. Especially in the sedentary lifestyle most of world is in, and the ease of access and price of these 'bad' foods.\n\nFats/oils are satiating and they don't cause a dopamine release. You'll be hungry 4 hours later and not have the addictive craving for them (if you disagree with this, you're probably confusing carbs+fats with the carbs causing the issue).\n\nSo if you eat 1000 calories of carbs or 1000 of fats. You'll end up eating much less in the day if the calories are from fats.\n\nProtein is also very satiating (we get hungry much later after consumption) and we only use a portion of the 'raw' calorie value. 1000 calories now becomes 700 and you feel full for longer.\n\nThen there's fiber! Yeehaw this is the good one. Fiber (insoluble) has calories but your body doesn't absorb them. So if you eat 1000 calories of a food that is 50 percent fiber. You'll only use 500 calories. Fiber is also 'bulking' making you feel full longer.\n\nIn total it absolutely matters what you eat. Not all food is created equal. And the way the government, companies, food labels describe calories does not help people to know actually how many calories they're going to absorb for any given food.\n\nTldr;\nEat protein, high fiber foods (vegetables and beans) and fats. Your actual calorie absorption will be less and you'll eat much less, than if you consume sugars/carbs.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "When a burger doesn‚Äôt rot or mold after a week of being in your car, what makes people think it‚Äôs safe to eat", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Only 2-3 times a week you‚Äôre making it seem like that‚Äôs normal", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You think 2-3 times a week eating out/fast food for Americans is extreme and in no way possibly \"normal\" for many?\n\nThat's actually fucking hilarious.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Wait that‚Äôs normal in America?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I have several coworkers at my shop who eat out 2-3 times a *day*.

My crystal ball says food is going to go up the most out of most categories for the next several years.\n\nIt won't matter how cheap energy gets either.\n\nI can point to a few major reasons:\n\n1. Drought. Many places in the world experienced serious drought conditions this year which will have driven crop yields down. Rivers dried up (France, Italy, China), and reservoirs are at historic lows (USA, China). If water doesn't return, and is properly managed when it does, food output from these regions could be drastically curtailed. There are already early measures in place to reducing water usage on farms, some of which has already impacted food production.\n2. Fertilizer prices. Fertilizer is a major component of the cost of food, and the prices on fertilizers has skyrocketed due to the war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia. Russia is one of the worlds top exporters of fertilizers. There is enough fertilizer production in the rest of the world to cover any loss, but it will take years to get going. So there will either be lower yields as farmers curtail fertilizer usage, prices rise to cover costs, or farmers switch crops.\n3. Speaking of war: Ukraine and Russia represent some of the largest exporters of wheat in the world. Ukraines harvest will be minimal. Even if Russia exports a normal crop, there will still be disruptions due to changes in supply routing. Ukraine alone represents a little less than 5% of the worlds total food calories.\n4. World reserves of food were already low before all this. There isn't the normal amount of food stores currently as there has been several years of disruptions (plague, drought) already, leading to some drawdowns of stored foods. To try and curb waste and rebuild stores, food prices must rise to destroy demand.\n\nAll of this combined will put tremendous pressure on food prices for years to come.\n\nNone of this even takes into account the increasing problems of the global climate crisis, which will only negatively impact future food production.\n\nIt will take years of bumper crops (not likely) to level food prices or a drastic, sudden drop in demand.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nobody cares.

Usually this happens to bulk products, new products, and services. Primary reason is competition. And for natural resources prices are always volitile.

When the shudder and close the economy shrinks. But it's not like the people and know-how died. The new business has already found a better way and is capturing the more productive, profitable market. \n\n\nPlease do not assume a deleveraging would not happen. Yes ask for a raise and quit your job every time they don't make it higher than your market worth and or inflation adjusted. The way this happens is not how the media, big businesses, and the corporate-minded-political-puppets would have you believe. It's got to require higher interest rates to reset the bond market and re-discover the margins that make investors happy again - happy enough to risk opening a new business.\n\n\nYou tend to notice inflation overtime but let's not ignore that you definitely just enjoyed 10+ years of a boom, unheard of in USA history. Yes it was caused by propping up the giant mega firms via corporate welfare, and yes we will \"pay\" in the form of business pain. That's why we need economic systems in place like no-profit government run segments: healthcare, housing, and hearty food. All should be a very low price and regulated.

Instead nothing happens and we are basically back at fudalism. It's important we vote this midterms all blue so we can see what a checks and balances system would bring with a red Supreme Court (let's face it) a blue Federal Government and a mixed bag local government.

You mentioned housing (the single largest cost in the vast swaths of household budgets), but also autos seem to be peaking as well, and prices have already started dropping in the used vehicle market amid increasing defaults and repo-based supply increases. Apparel as well is showing weakness amid major discounting and will more than likely drop in price for the Holiday season to multi-year lows.\n\nSo while your argument makes sense mathematically, there are in fact very real deflationary forces at work in the economy, and is in part a large reason equities are repricing valuations at these levels because of the real possibility of deflation, or stagflation at the best.\n\nPerhaps that foot long at Subway may not go down to $10 from $12, but there will probably be an opportunity for a competitor to come in and undercut prices so that the ‚Äúcost‚Äù is essentially less (i.e. maybe Subway customers just go to Jersey Mike‚Äôs and buy a similar sandwich for $10).
