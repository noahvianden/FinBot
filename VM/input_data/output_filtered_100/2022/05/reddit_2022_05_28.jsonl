{"title": "Sharing a 100% risk-free but relatively low-return strategy", "selftext": "*Update: I received many comments on the strategy is equivalent to buying a CD or worse than selling naked puts or covered calls. I wish to highlight that this strategy can net a risk-free 4% to 5% relatively easily in this kind of stock market with some tech and penny stocks via selling ITM calls and buying OTM puts. The 2.68% annual return is an example using SPY via ATM calls and puts, which is much easier to understand for sharing purpose, but this strategy can surely do better. If you are looking for a risk-free 10% return, no, I do not identify any such strategy yet, and I will not share it if I found it.*\n\nThe strategy is:\n\n1. Buy 100 shares of SPY (e.g., at $415/share)\n2. Sell ATM call leap with same strike (e.g., Dec 2024 $415C nets $6,300)\n3. Buy ATM put leap with same strike (e.g., Dec 2024 $415P costs $5,000)\n4. Collect dividends (e.g., \\~$1,400 for 2.5 years when not including Q4 2024's dividend)\n\nAll the numbers above are by market close on 5/27/2022. This nets us a risk-free $2,700 using $38,800 (\\~6.96% over 2.6 years, or \\~2.68% per year). Due to stock market crash, call leaps now worth more than put leaps.\n\n**Yes, 2.68% is not a good return. Try this strategy with some big tech or penny stocks (those with no dividends) by selling ITM call leaps and buying OTM put leaps. 5% (may be even up to 8%) is achievable, but we need to wait for the limit price transaction to go through. Patience is the key.**\n\nTip 1: This is a high volatility strategy. You want SPY at lower price as much as possible (like $380 last week, not $415 yesterday). Deploy it during a big red day to maximize profits.\n\nTip 2: The best moment has sailed, so this tip doesn't apply anymore to \"high\" interest rate environment for next few years. Around a year ago, we could borrow multiple years of money at rate < 1% via selling SPX options box spreads (note: SPX options will not get exercised before due date) and use them to deploy this strategy to big tech stocks *now*. Assuming 5% risk-free return, this will net us a risk-free 4% for every 1x borrowing. Not recommending borrowing a lot (no risk on paper doesn't mean no risk in practice), but we can tune our leverage based on our risk appetite. For example, 2x leverage means a risk free 9% return for deploying this strategy to the tech and penny stocks.\n\nTip 3: This strategy doesn't work on some (not all) meme stocks like GME, AMC, UPST etc. due to the put leaps costing more than the call leaps.", "id": "uztia7", "created_utc": 1653763443.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Terrific!

Remember that consumer spending is literally the engine of the economy. When you track economic reports, consumer spending and consumer habits are ALWAYS highlighted and referenced. As inflation has risen, consumers have been spending less and less on goods. They have instead been spending on services.\n\nThe very real fear is that as inflation hits a point of no return, consumers stop spending on goods and services altogether.

What the fed is trying to do is slow demand down but not to a halt (aka the fabled soft landing) so the supply/demand imbalance is less unhinged, especially in areas of extremely inelastic short term supply (shipping, energy).

Recession is more than 2Q of negative GDP according to the text books. We entered our first month of Negative GDP in March (Q1) and that was only revised down. Hence, the concern is whether this sustains through to the second Quarter.\n\nThe issue with Inflation is that whereas, typically negative GDP would indicate that we should start monetary easing, you can't do it right now. That is because Inflation is off the charts. The Prob for the Fed isn't all the mumbo jumbo people about on timing, it's the nature of the inflation itself. He has said this over and over and over again and yet it's as if he is screaming into the wind. The major causes of inflation which he cannot impact and do not appear to be subsiding until Q3-Q1 of next year are:\n\n1. Rising energy prices - The energy companies have some limitations on how much capacity they can bring on due to the fact that they still need equip and there is a shortage right now in equip that will take a wee bit of time to alleviate. Easier than some other things but you still have a little problemo with steel (think iron + nickle shortage).\n2. Rising Food Prices - The world had quite low grain crop production in everything but Soy globally. Then you cut off huge suppliers with UK & RUS and destabilized the region in general. Also, China's not exporting fertilizer b/c it would like to move off of 1 child and Russia and Belarus are not able to export to many countries (Brazil is still taking all their products. They are in an election year and it would be very destabilizing to cut it off).\n3. Semi's - Shortage for sure. This still appears demand drive from what I can hear, but it's not consumer demand (which is easier), it's business demand. Now this gets interesting, b/c the 1 thing the Fed can help with might actually exacerbate this if and only if China remains in lockdown or we escalate issues with China. But for now, it's driving up the other major component of CPI which is Autos.\n\nSo those 3 things, the Fed has no control. The only thing it has control on is Labor. And that is often a function of business growth.\n\n</calibration ended, let me know if I missed how you're thinking about it.>\n\nSO THEN.... \n\nIn the saga, the reason people are about recession is ... how much will the fed have to do this? Will they overshoot given rising input costs? So the issue is the \"real\" cost vs. the absolute increase in prices. And all of this is definitely up for debate 4sho.... But if the angry folks are right (not sure they are) then the Fed will cause company margins to overly compress. They will not be able to pass through inflation and companies will therefore not be able to hire people. They also worry that the Fed won't then cease its behavior or that once they do cease raising rates, some sort of cycle of low production will have begun that just takes the economy out of control. It's not a crazy point, but I think it should be a more thoughtfully discussed \"hypothesis\" in news media. I mean, at least talk about it as a hypothesis so people can trouble shoot the different parts of it.\n\nFor me, the bigger issue is stagflation, which I'm defining as inflation with flat to slightly down GDP growth (I'll take flat as +/-50bps given the inflation).\n\nIn the case of Stagflation, it's very hard to know if you should actually stimulate growth or do what the Fed is doing now. Technically in both cases you should try to get the inflation under control, but if you think of China as a case study... it almost looked like massive inflation in the early years of their growth and against all odds (meaning case studies in Latin America and other countries in SE Asia), they let it ride and let production come up to meet things. I mean ... fair point, poor case study...they were in such an earlier part of their economy.... but if the picture is stagflation, it's not easy to know what to do or find proper case studies to help you out. Plus, they did this during one of the lowest energy and raw material cost cycles (i.e. the mid '90s to mid'00s and then from post 2008-current.) But it's an intriguing case study nonetheless as it flies in the face of every economist at the time (MMT is still very new).\n\nBTW...

So his short position is essentially him clapping back at Elon by saying without saying that he's wrong and that batteries are the wrong way forward. I disagree, independent of having a vested interest in Tesla's stock that I own potentially coloring my view here, in that while hydrogen will eventually dominate how we manage energy at scale (fusion when we figure that out, and then graphene tech for a variety of applications which have a net positive on hydrogen tech too), but the current means of dealing with hydrogen from an energy standpoint is not a good one.  \n\n\nIt's true, hydrogen's energy density and efficiency curve is better than batteries. It's also the most abundant element in the entire universe and you can convert water through electrolysis into component hydrogen and oxygen; and with so much of the world being water, the supply is practically limitless. But hydrogen has a huge upstream cost and a downstream cost, so for a consumer, its a pretty bad technology. For corporations and big industry, arguably its not. Also, Elon has stated in the past that he'd be interested in doing an electric plane but has since opted not to. I would imagine that his statements about this are roughly around the time Bill/Bezos were looking at hydrogen and planes and other mobility options, and saw him as a massive threat to their interests because Musk's companies are disruptive as all heck. Thus, Gates then opening a short position against Tesla makes, in a way, sense. Bezos is a different brand of petty, but I think he's smart enough to at least understand that opening up negative investment positions against Musk's companies is a stupid play and seems to have avoided that entirely as far as we know (which is pretty damn smart of him, considering how dumb BlOrgin can be).", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Most of the words hydrogen comes from  Methane gas (natural gas).

The liar is intentionally avoiding the truth and the bullshitter may potentially be telling the truth or providing elements of the truth without the intention of doing so.

How?\n\nIt was getting cheap loans from finance companies including banks to finance these payments.\n\nThey’d get a loan, buy the land way more than market, build the apartments-\n\n(And very crucially, because house prices were just continually rising (like we see in the west), these companies knew even though they overpaid for the land at the time...by the time those buildings were built, house prices would have gone up enough that they could now make a profit even though they overpaid.\n\nThey would then pay off old loans and repeat the process, getting more loans for more land, AND they were selling these houses before they were even completed.\n\n This pumped the market up to the 40x ratios.\n\n\nNOW back to the 3 red lines, that Xi implemented.\n\nThe problem with being dictator is when everything goes right it’s all you, but when t goes wrong it’s also all you.\n\nXi is all about “look China, I took you from rice farmers to industrialists. now you all have electricity and houses”\n\nBut if the average person would have to save all their income for 40 years to buy a house, they’ll probably not be so obedient and might have an uprising, Xi knows this.\n\nSo, I can’t remember all the red lines but the main one is that building developers have to drop their loan : cash ratios wayyyyy down. I think before it was like they had 3x what they had in cash as loans, and now they have to drop it down to like 1.2x or maybe even 0.9x I can’t remember.\n\nSo these developers have not been able to keep overpaying for land and sending prices through the roof. Which was exactly Xi s plan, because he knew there was no prosperity when nobody can afford to live and he got ahead of it and made these building companies eat the cost.\n\nNow of course western governments would literally never do anything like this, and I also feel like western companies aren’t so bad in terms or the loans : cash ratios and of course our salary : house price ratios are wayyy better than China’s even for people on the low end of the scale.\n\nSo, China’s housing economy has crashed for different reasons, namely, the Chinese government has purposefully forced these developers to eat the costs and cool down the housing market.\n\nWhereas western governments have been captured by the real estate lobbying and would never in a million years allow this to happen.\n\nSo while the western housing market may crash, it is highly highly unlikely to be due to anything happening with china’s real estate market at all.\n\n- also I’ve probably left out a bunch of stuff cuz it’s just a quick comment but if people have questions just ask, or google anything I said such as China 3 red lines for a better understanding.\n\nAlso note : Xi implemented the 3 red line policy fairly recently, basically only a few months before the Chinese house crash.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Apple also has fantastic production efficiency, does a lot in-house, has special privileges with its manufacturers (for example, Foxconn making sure that Apple products are assembled on time even when everything else is on hold), and is actively working on reducing its reliance on China for manufacturing. The fact that they plan a huge stock buyback is also a good sign of its health, in my opinion.\n\nYes, a couple of bad quarters could be bad for the company. And yes, it’s still very reliant on iPhone sales. Generally, I expect their growth to slow in the future, possibly turning into a value stock over the next 5–10 years. But I don’t think Apple has any more risks than Google, and the argument “it’s not the same price it was in 2019” doesn’t really convince me.\n\nIf you want to play some short-term bets against Apple be my guest, but I’m sleeping very well with my shares (admittedly, I’ve sold a lot this year and only have 700 left).", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Only, lol.
