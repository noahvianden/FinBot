I entered in on this trade for an average credit of .29 per contract. Apple dropped some and i was worried of early assignment. (Didnt happen)Apple then dropped to 139 and some change at its lowest point again worried of early assignment but did not want to take massive losses of buying back the spread. I then bought 4 contracts long put spread 149/148 for .95 premium. So had a severely messed up butter fly 40 shorts at 150, 44longs at 149, 4shorts at 148. Stock started climbing bought back 2 of the 148 shorts to lock in profit on those incase the stock plummeted again. \n\nPosition totals at the time 40short 150, 44long 149, 2 short 148. I was planning to close out the remaining 148 shorts around 2:35pm cst. TD ameritrade closed out all the positions. \nSold 2 149/148 long vertical spread for .76 credit. .19loss on the spread. \nThey bought back the 40 short 150/149 spread for .99 debit for .61loss on that spread.\nThey then went on to sell the remaining 2 long 149 puts for 1.4 credit.\n\nThe stock was 2$ below the 149 strikes at the time they did this and Apple closed at 147.11 yesterday. I was aware that my contracts were all ITM and my exit strategy was to buy back the 2 remaining shorts at 148 strike to lock in profit. On those which in total would have come to approx 3100$ total on the all 148 shorts, I was watching that the stock was not going to move above the 149 strike before 530pm. (The deadline to exercise them). If it did I would exercise as I was considering the 150puts would be assigned to limit risk of possibility of having to hold the stock over the weekend. Since the stock was right around 147 I figured better to let them go to expiry and keep an eye on them after hours, just incase the stock moved above the 149 strike I would have to call them to tell them to exercise it. If the stock still went above the 150 point I would have still exercised to limit risk of the possible assignment since of a otm 150put.(stock stayed at under 148 all the way through the exercise deadline). I talked to a guy at the trade desk who was pretty rude but his answer \"it was to limit risk\" then ended the chat before I could reply. To me this is not a sufficient answer, I then asked again today when I called the guy told me, \"because I didn't call them ahead of time they assumed I wasn't watching my positions\" again this is a bs answer because they do not say anywhere that you have to call them to tell them you are watching your positions and to not close them 30-45min before market close. They only say if you want or do not want to exercise you have to let them know. Also, one of the reasons the guy gave me was that there was a possibility of no assignment because the stock was climbing and the buyer of the contracts might not want to exercise. So wouldn't that mean max profit achieved plus the boot of exercising my contracts and buying 4400 shares at market 147ish and selling at 149i mean that's a potential for 8800approx profit plus the 1180 in total premium?\n\nQuestions to be answered:\n\n1) Why would they close out the positions for more of a loss then letting expire itm and auto assign and exercise? Loss would have been 2820 total minus additional 777 total profit from the additional 4 long 149puts? (The loss they incurred was over 6300$ with just liquidating)\n\n2) if they were to close out contracts that are ITM why didn't they exercise and hold to see if assignment happened? Wouldn't this be in my best interest? \n\n3) why don't they state in a disclosure that you have to call them an hour or more before market close to tell them not to close positions early for losses?\n\n4) they are aware of my 886k Roth Ira so that even if I was assigned I could cover the shares with cash, why would they let other people take on huge margin calls and loss their ass but not me? \n\n5) isn't what they did to liquidate the positions more risky then just exercising the longs to sell the shares at a guaranteed price? Keeping the define risk?\n\n6) Why would they just sell my 2 additional long 149 puts and let the remaining 2 long vertical 149/148puts instead of letting them expire? \n\nI had over 9000$ in cash in my account and 11k in position equity, now have less the 5500 in cash and around 7k in position equity. The way they went about liquidating my positions for massive losses in cash and position equity seems like a breach of fiduciary duties, am I wrong to think this? Is there any recourse for disregard of protecting their clients best interests? Do you think I have a decent case for arbitration/mediation or did they just screw me over because they wanted to \"limit risk\"?\n\nAlso  if I  didn't have the cash to cover this would  they have went about things the same way resulting in a larger margin call then taking the max loss on the spread? \n\nI know this is a really long read but any feedback would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance!!!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Call the broker for their rationale. \nThey are open Sunday evening. \n\nIn general, when accounts do not have enough assets or equity to own the underlying stock, options positions are disposed of on expiration day. \n\nYou indicate you had $9,000 of cash.   \nLess than 100 shares of AAPL.   \n\nYou agreed to allow the broker to dispose of your holdings when you signed the margin agreement.   \n\nYour Roth account is an entirely different account.   \nIf you want them to be considered together, then combine the accounts.  \n\nDon't play chicken with the margin risk desk on expiration day.  \n Plan to exit by noon, and, and change up your trading style.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I did call the broker, I was told it was to limit risk and also that I should have called them to tell them not to close them early. I was fully aware of the risk and my Roth is linked with my margin account. I don't have a problem with the logic behind why they would, my issue with them is why would they liquidate for a higher loss then exercising After being assigned. They have exercised options before to close them out prior to market close, so why would they do it this way this time. I had closed some positions earlier locked in profits around 2430$. I was expecting the 2810 loss but that was off set when I closed the 2 148 puts, was going to close the remaining 2 148shorts after had placed stop losses on those as well so I had another 1600 profits locked in on the 148 puts. So I would have only been short 40-150puts and would have been long 44-149 puts. So why wouldn't my longs get exercised to close them out. Even if the underlying went to 149.01 or more it would still be better to exercise them enough to cover the possibility of assignment of the 150puts. If the stock was jumping that much in the last hour then there's a good chance that 150s might not get assigned because the buyer might not want to take the risk of buying the shares at market and selling them for 150. \n\nLike I said I understand the logic as to why they would normally do that but the fact that they didn't consider I have close to 550k in cash in my Roth which is linked to my margin account I could have easily just transferred enough to cover the shares in a same day transaction.( sorry I didn't make that clear at first) To me this is just a formality to them to close positions prior to market close and don't take a look at the individual investors assets across all accounts held with them. Also my margin account I use solely for options don't really like to hold positions in it, I either transfer them out to my Roth or just add cash to my cash account held with them, which I use to generate tax exempt div or interest. I also trade daily so I have a track record of being very active and a 78% win rate this was just one of those losing trades but I took steps to minimize loss/still make a gain on it.\n\nLike I said I called them explained this and their responses were not adequate to the situation. So that's why I was asking if I had a case for arbitration due to failure of  fiduciary duties. Like I said they let people lose everything and still owe them money but liquidate my positions for a higher loss then letting it play out. It's not a big loss for me this year but the practice of just liquidating early should be made aware in a disclosure, stating that they will close positions out early the day of expiry unless they are told not to before noon the day of expiration and that those requests will be processed pending review of individuals account. I could see if I had less in my account the logic of limiting the risk for them but my risk tolerance was adequate enough to handle 4400 shares of apple. \n\nI'm just curious as to how many other people they have done this to based on general practice to close out positions early?

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated chances of a contraction at about 35% over the next two years. Bloomberg Economics’ recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it’ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.\nIn the Deutsche economists’ view, the FOMC’s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won’t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That’s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. \nDeutsche estimated a neutral rate that’s much higher than the Fed’s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just delete the app silly", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Until you sell, it's all imaginary numbers.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "if you ain’t selling keep holding you haven’t lost a dollar, just worth", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Go to walmart, buy a diary, enter your thoughts there.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated chances of a contraction at about 35% over the next two years. Bloomberg Economics’ recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it’ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.\nIn the Deutsche economists’ view, the FOMC’s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won’t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That’s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. \nDeutsche estimated a neutral rate that’s much higher than the Fed’s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Na, no way.

The acronym CANSLIM points to the seven criteria growth investors should look for as they take part in stock picking:\r  \n***The A in the acronym stands for annual earnings growth.***\r  \nThe strategy suggests investors should only invest in stocks that have consistently created significant earnings growth over at least the past five years. Look for at least 20% growth in profitability for five consecutive years.

Then you have big fish holders like Musk (who owns 17 percent) who very rarely sell as they want a peice of the company, and they have all together another 35 percent in total.

{"title": "Theory Sharp Decline in the S&P 500 within 4 Months (TA inside)", "selftext": " \n\nI came across an interesting statement from [u/DaddyDersch](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaddyDersch/) about 5 red candles and the rarity in the last 22 years. This got me thinking, what could this this mean as we are at 5 Red Weekly Candles?\n\nTLDR, 5+ red weekly candles have only happened 8 times in the past 22 years. With 6 red candles being more common than 5. Additionally all 5+ WRC have indicated a drop below the weekly 200 EMA after a small pop.\n\nPositions: Friday next week SPY C443 06/17/2022, In four weeks SPY P345 09/16/2022\n\nThe DotCom Bubble had the majority of the 5+ Weekly Red Candles between 2000 and 2005 with a total of 5 of the 8 total. While 3 indicated a drop below 200 Weekly EMA and 2 happened while below the 200 EMA.\n\nThe Great Recession or the 2008 Financial Crisis had another 5+ WRC. However, we were just recovering from the DotCom Bubble. The 200 EMA was already close and we saw it break 200 EMA during the 3rd candle. Additionally, we saw the largest decline from any 5+ WRC with a push of -49%.\n\nIn May of 2011 we saw, what I would say is the smoking gun of my theory, a 5+ WRC which was the precursor to the August Black Monday (2011) Crisis, we saw a drop to the 200 EMA and a decline of 21% in about 17 weeks from the 5+ WRC.\n\nThe last 5+ WRC was the Covid Crash. I do not see this as a true 5+ WRC point but I have included it as we still hold true all the marks of a 5+ WRC. We saw a 32% drop smashing the 200 EMA during the decline.\n\nI have made a chart below as well as a few pictures to show my results.\n\nRebuttal, now we could experience a quick decline or with how computers have changed the landscape of trading we could never see a drop as low in the 4 months I'm speculating to the 200 EMA.\n\nNow, I also looked into the 4 WRC and the results were quite mixed but also rare with only 13 events in the last 22 years.\n\n05/01/2000 major drop\n\n03/18/2002 major drop\n\n01/13/2003 small drop & then spike up\n\n03/10/2006 small spike up, small drop then big spike up\n\n12/24/2007 small drop into 2nd 4 candle\n\n02/19/2008 small spike up into major drop\n\n01/05/2009 drop into 2nd 4 candle\n\n02/09/2009 spike up\n\n01/11/2010 small spike up, drop, spike up\n\n07/25/2011 post 6 candle spike up, drop, spike up\n\n09/22/2014 spike up\n\n05/31/2016 spike up\n\nAs last week’s red candle was an extremely small red candle, some may say that it shouldn’t qualify. I did not go into a fuller detail as I did the 5+ WRC but as you can see from the list we would still generally see 9 drops of some kind and 7 climbs up.

This is just a function of capitalism, which if you ignore the absolutely horrendously convoluted definitions is actually just a system designed to concentrate capital in the hands of the few. Every time there's a crash and recessions the people with all the money buy up the land. Crashes are a part of their wealth accumulation, the idea that they're a failure of the system is naive, they're a core foundation of the system and the single biggest driver of the wealth transfer from the many to the few. It's not a bug. \n\nWe already went through this is 2008 when ' not banks ' were offering ridiculous introductory rates knowing that the buyer could never afford the actual payments. Everyone involved in that grift made their fortunes and then the cost of fixing it (not just the capital cost but the emotional cost) was passed on to the average person (who is purposefully excluded from participating in this type of grift). This marked the beginning of modern monetary policy, which is to say it was the moment the wealthiest realised they could have their cake, eat it and then shit on the rest of the population. \n\nWe now live in a society where the oligarch class have taken, directly taken, almost all of the species' combined wealth and are using it to expand that wealth gap to the point it can never be reduced. The end goal is pretty clear to me - a landed gentry class who leases land to the peasant class and parcels out the minimum amount of money to pay that lease and not starve to death. When the inevitable happens and the vast majority of jobs have been automated the peasants will quite literally be living under the same circumstances peasants in the middle ages were - you can't own land, you can't decide what you do and you absolutely can't increase your wealth. You will be given a pod to live in, given a stipend, forced to consume the products of half a dozen companies and forced to adhere to social norms (via social credit scores, which are absolutely coming to the west, at first in the form of incentives and then in the Chinese form). \n\nBill gates is a fucking cunt who has sucked up as much money as possible, profiteers from every economic disaster, used his money to gain political influence and used it purely to benefit himself and acts like a god handing out wisdom to his people.

Numbers have been cooked for a long time, might as well make things look good on a midterm year. \n\n\n2) the CPI is a year-over-year number, so in the sliding 12-month window we're going to lose the change from March-April 2021, which was huge ( 1.6 ), and we're gaining the change from March-April 2021 (yet unknown), so as long as the cooked CPI formula reports a Delta smaller than the 1.6 from last March-April, the CPI number they report will go down.  Since the last few months have only gone up by 0.2-0.6 I feel pretty confident that with the 1.6 falling of the 12 month window will dominate the metric and the number will drop slightly\n\nAnother way to think about it is that since it's \"change in the last year\", this month has the advantage that inflation was already pretty bad last April, so they now get to use that already inflated period as the starting point.\n\nhttps://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/inflation/", "id": "ulrv2d", "created_utc": 1652104699.0, "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|13|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ulrv2d)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ulrv2d)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think the pre market sell off this morning was an indicator of bad CPI numbers coming", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "An indicator of the *expectation* of bad CPI numbers.  \n\nClearly most people think the CPI will be bad.
