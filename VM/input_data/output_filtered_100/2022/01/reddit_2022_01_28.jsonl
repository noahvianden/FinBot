{"title": "Anyone else not worried about the markets?", "selftext": "The way I see it the market is reacting emotionally to fears of inflation, the fed, and world politics. But the labor markets are historically well off, GDP growth is high, covid cases are going down - and really can only improve from here, supply chains are slowly unwinding, and inflation is peaking. \n\nImagine covid being a long hike up a mountain with chances of slipping from lockdowns, liquidity drying up , bank runs, tangled supply chains etc etc. We've gone up that mountain and now we can finally start hiking back down. We see unemployment at pre-pandemic levels and our society is learning how to transition from a pandemic response to an endemic response. Of course this descent back down the mountain does require us to keep our footing. I personally have faith in J Powell in taking the safe, conservative approach of predictable, incremental, and slow rate hikes/ quantitative tightening to give a chance to see how improving supply chains decelerate inflation. I personally think Russia is mostly posturing and no real conflict will come of this. I personally think covid has accelerated technological advancement in many ways. And as soon as omicron cases start to dissipate near spring, consumers will begin to use their purchasing power on more industries, specifically hospitality/ travel. As EVs and clean energy continue to come online, less reliance on oil will continue, and not just in the US but globally. \n\nI really don't see much downside risk after this recent correction. You could say any slips and falls going down the mountain have been mostly priced in by now. I mean we have room to breathe. I think now is one of the rare times during a correction where you can feel comfortable about \"buying the dip\". Think about all the other market corrections/ crashes. In '08, when banks were going out of business and houses lost half their price, things were A LOT more uncertain. When unemployment rose at a faster pace than any other time in history and peaked at a figure not seen since the 50s, no one knew how long it would last and many thought this was going to lead to a second Great Depression. Now, markets are almost 10% down on the S&P500 and over 15% down in the NASDAQ. We have to ask ourselves are times really this uncertain? I think many of you may be in for a surprise to see how quickly inflation will taper off and how quickly supply chains will fix themselves.

{"title": "Unlike popular opinion, Tesla's valuation is far from unjustifiable - An analysis based on the numbers", "selftext": "While the overwhelming sentiment around this sub still seems to be that Tesla's valuation is unjustifiable, I have yet to see someone explain that using real data instead of reasoning by analogy (\"but Toyota/VW sell X cars\" and is only worth Y\"). Looking purely at the numbers, it seems to me Tesla is starting to become insanely undervalued.\n\nThis post is largely based on a recent video by Tesla Daily. I believe links to YouTube aren't allowed, but it's his Jan 28th video for anyone who wants to see the detailed version.\n\nSo here are the numbers:\n\nAfter Tesla's Q4 earnings and subsequent 11.5% drop in stock price, its market cap dropped to $833B. Total GAAP earnings for 2021 came in at $5.5B, giving us a PE ratio of 151. \"Ridiculous!\" I hear you say.\n\nWell not so fast. Tesla's earnings in 2021 were up 665%, Q4 earnings was up 760% YoY and earnings in Q1 were just 1/6th of Q4. If we annualize Q4 (basically projecting 0% growth in 2022), we're already at a GAAP net income of $9.3B, or a forward PE of 90.\n\nNow obviously Tesla won't be doing 0% growth in 2022, so let's look at some of the things that seem a given.\n\nFirst of all, Tesla \"paid\" $910M in stock-based compensation to Elon Musk in 2022 for his CEO compensation plan. For 2022, there is only $65M of that plan left. Since this affects GAAP earnings, this will already mean an $845M increase to Tesla's 2022 earnings. Of course there might be a new compensation plan in the future, but this almost definitely won't affect 2022 and it would only come into effect if the stock rise significantly (I'm personally expecting it to be a plan for $2, 3, 4, ..., 10T in market cap)\n\nNext, Tesla had an increase in SG&A of $340M because of Elon exercising his options. This was a one-time expense that will not occur in 2022. Adding these together, that's an added $1,185M to Tesla's bottom line in 2022, all other things equal. This would bring their PE down to 79.\n\nThen we've got growth. In the earnings call, Tesla mentioned how they expect to \"comfortable exceed 50%\" from their two existing factories, meaning they will sell at least 1.4M cars from Fremont and Shanghai alone. While scaling these factories might further improve margins due to economies of scale, let's pretend margin stays flat for these factories. Although this would likely increase GAAP net income by more than 50% (because not all costs would increase 50%, as we could see last year when revenue gross profit grew 135% but GAAP net income grew 760%), let's be super conservative and assume this increases GAAP net income by 50%. This adds up to $2.3B * 4 * 0.5 = $4.6B for the full year.\n\nNow finally, just to appease the bears, let's fully back out regulatory credits even though these are unlikely to go to $0 in 2022. In 2021 this was a total of $314M.\n\nAdding all of these up: 9.3 + 1.2 + 4.6 - 0.3 = $14.8B in net income for the full year 2022. This would give us a forward PE of 56 for a company that's at worst growing earnings 50% per year, or a PEG ratio of around 1.\n\nNow all of this doesn't take into account any of the many catalysts that are coming up for Tesla. Obviously they've just started production in two factories that are each larger than their two current factories combined, they will no longer need to ship (for insanely expensive rates atm) cars to Europe, the new factories will have new technologies like the single-piece casting for rear and front underbodies (which is much faster and cheaper), there's an $8,000 EV incentive that might be coming back and would force Tesla to raise unit prices to prevent demand from getting out of hand, and all of the more speculative stuff like FSD, Tesla bot, Autobidder and energy/solar in general, etc.\n\nFinally, if you still think a forward PE of 56 in the absolute worst case is too expensive, let's have a look at a comparable company in history. In 2016, Amazon also did an EPS of $4.90, after a year of 290% EPS growth. As we stated before, Tesla this year grew 760%, yet Amazon was also right around $830 a share at that time so both traded around the same PE. Looking at the growth in the next years, Amazon grew to $6.15 in 2017 and $20.14 in 2018, whereas we just established Tesla will at worst be growing to ~$15.00 in 2022 and 2023 will see Giga Texas and Berlin starting mass volume production. Just to give you an idea for comparison, Amazon's stock price grew to $1700 based on these earnings.\n\nSo having gone through all these numbers, while you can have doubts about how long Tesla will sustain this growth in car sales and whether their other businesses (energy/software/robotics/AI) will ever become a material part of the business, I think it's safe to say that anyone who says Tesla's valuation is \"nowhere near justified\" simply hasn't done the research.\n\nEDIT: Reupped since I thought the previous title wasn't exactly accurate.", "id": "sep6ud", "created_utc": 1643371202.0, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 597, "comments": [{"body": "The divide on Tesla's valuation is because people tend to fall in one of two camps:\n\n1.

Personally, I think they do have a number of potential headwinds in maintaining those.\n\nThe good news is that their success in 2021 and share price drop means they are nowhere near as overvalued as they were before.  They are also likely to be able to grow nicely for the next couple of years.  But as time goes on they are going to see a lot of issues with competition growing and margins shrinking.

They have specialized die cast machines to do this, but that's not all.  This technique doesn't work reliably on standard alloys.  Tesla developed proprietary alloys that don't warp or require special treatment afterwards.  This will be very difficult for other automakers to easily replicate. \n* While newer EV makers like Rivian and Lucid are moving to a similar 2170-cell based pack architecture as Tesla, Tesla is moving to pack-in-frame architecture based on tabless 4680 cells.  There's a lot of proprietary technology here too, as Tesla developed the cell and the manufacturing process in order to drive down costs far more than anyone thought possible\n* Tesla has attracted much of the best engineering talent, which is a very scarce resource.  Like Apple, they design their own silicon to achieve high performance-per-watt chips (FSD3.0, D1, etc.).  Note that Tesla was able to navigate last year's chip shortage because of their software talent: they could easily substitute chips and recompile their software.  This isn't possible for traditional automakers, who have to make many different systems from different suppliers play well together. \n\nTesla's manufacturing costs are rapidly falling, and their technological iteration process accelerates them more than the competition.\n\nIt's also not just about cars.  Tesla's energy business is small right now, but their Megapack grid balancing hardware and Autobidder management software is working its way into power grids worldwide.  It'll be critical for grid reliability and clean energy buffering as climate change grows worse.  \n\nMuch deeper into the future, their AI training platform could become the \"AWS\" of machine learning, although this is more speculative than their existing businesses. \n\nMuch of the \"conventional wisdom\" about Tesla from analysts and the Mainstream Media has been wrong over the past decade, and continues to be wrong.  People listening to reporters and sell-side analysts about TSLA back in 2012 would probably not have invested, and missed out on one of the greatest wealth growth stories of this century.  \n\nIt is crucial that investors take a much deeper look at companies like Tesla, than what the Mainstream Media can provide in a 2-3 minute segment produced on a tight deadline.  The people who learned about Tesla's technology and roadmap, monitored progress, read the SEC filings, and test drove the cars for themselves ended up seeing enormous gains if they bought TSLA stock.

Nobody can know the future for certain, so pricing in growth assumptions to a stock is, by definition, speculative. It is a speculative bet at its core. Anything that hasn’t yet happened is speculative. \n\nP/E ratios rise when investors expect more earnings in the future—and are willing to pay for them now. \n\nValue investors generally don’t like to pay way far in advance of those earnings actually existing, while speculative investors are more willing to pay in advance. \n\nSo, to buy Tesla at these prices is simply a function of how much you *expect* Tesla to grow its earnings, which may or may not happen at the price investors are paying *right now*.\n\nAny time investors are paying a higher P/E, they’re saying that they’re willing to accept less future return for the potential benefit of locking in their price now.\n\nAs companies mature and slow growth, history has shown on average P/Es decrease over time. This means that investors are pricing in less future earnings growth (*NOT* revenue growth).\n\nI believe it would be reasonable to argue that paying such a high multiple is making a very high conviction bet on whatever growth assumptions you’re using—and paying for growth that is far into the future. \n\nThe further into the future one is trying to predict, the less accurate the predictions are.

This will cause a repricing by itself. \n\nAs such, I believe it’s perfectly reasonable to say that, at a 100-300 P/E, growth that far into the future is fundamentally less certain and it wouldn’t be a good use of capital to pay for all of that growth *now*.\n\nWhat if Musk dies in a year?

I do not believe there are a lot of people who actually have a projected expenditure of $20 a month long term based on their driving style, unless maybe Tesla also starts tracking eye movements along with hard breaking, close following, etc. That would be getting more Orwellian than I think Telsa wants to get, and even then Tesla will only be able to cherry pick the very safest drivers at such high margins as long as rivals can't match.

To make 50% margin, Tesla has to pursue only the \"safe\" drivers because it can't charge \"average\" drivers $150 per month while competitors lump everyone together and charge the average folks $100 per month. That substantially limits Tesla's market share to start.\n\nHowever, if Tesla succeeds at this while others fail, it means more average and above average risk are covered by the others, which means they have to raise the rates in their pool.

So there was talk yesterday about deleveraging.\n\nTo be clear I am not against deleveraging but the time to deleverage is not when we are drilling to the fucking bottom. \n\nThe advice of a non-idiot is to deleverage when we are fly to all time highs. As I famously said when we hit $1200, “the seeds for margin calls are sown today.” If you are using margin (I am) you can deleverage by selling covered calls when we rally. You can do short term to intermediate term covered calls that are very safe for large profits.  It is scary to sell covers on rally just like it is scary to hold long calls as we drill down. \n\nSelling a covered call while heading to rock bottom is stupid unless you are basically getting margin called and can manage it (otherwise just sell high cost basis shares). If you do need to sell covers on a margin call sell short term calls deep otm. Basically the only option. It would be peak stupidity to panic about the stock going down and then sell a $1000 June 2023 call. It will be very hard to recover from that without taking a big loss. \n\nPerhaps I was harsh to a fellow lounger but I don’t want panic to be perceived as ok and normal in the Lounge. \n\nIt is possible to weather these storms and come out on the other side much much better than going in.\n\nThere are positions to take when we drill (long calls, short put (sell puts), buy shares) and when we rally (go short (covered calls) otm calls and buy more shares).  If you do the opposite you will get fucked. Don’t buy calls when we are at ath unless you think we have a major catalyst that is practically guaranteed. Don’t sell covered calls (or sell your long calls) when we are at local mins. \n\nIt is uncomfortable to be short when we rally and to be long when the stock is taking a nose five but if you do it successfully you can add to your share position greatly with relatively little risk.  Also when you do these things you are more prepared for when the extreme events happen.

I’m thinking push to $1500-1800. If I can get 9 month out covers with strike between $2500 and $3000 for $100+ per share that gives me a lot of flexibility to push the strike up. Tbh if I had to sell my entire position at $2500 a share I don’t think that is eo world because my net worth will be over $30M. I felt same way about selling $1600 calls on 75% of position last year. It is all about knowing the risks and knowing how to take advantage of volatility. Even if we rally to $3000 before it expires if it takes a few months to do so you realize a lot of theta and then are in a good position to roll a few more months out at a higher strike.

The prudent level of cash depends on the risks you expect. Tesla might plan to commit to way bigger risks than Wall street expects/is comfortable with. And they don't want to go bankrupt at that even in very unfavorable macro conditions. But with a multi-year projection in the future the cash pile starts becoming way overkill.\n2. Factories are not capital intensive enough and even if you could put all of the cash into them, they are useless when supply chains can't keep up.\n3. Talent is a limiter for Tesla, but throwing huge amounts of cash at that problem will create negative externalities and probably even negative actual value inside of Tesla.\n4. Stock buybacks are an \"easy\" possible option - but that would be a defeat for everyone that hopes for a even bigger future for Tesla.\n5. Big utility bets\n\nI'm torn about the utility bets. On the one hand those are capable of consuming all that \"excess\" cash and are 100% aligned with the mission statement, on the other hand those tend to end with anti-trust problems when they are profitable: \n\n1. The robotaxi bet: stop selling cars and operate all of them as Tesla owned fleet. Maybe in combination with buying back cars. That can consume 1-2 years of cash flow before creating an even bigger cash pile problem.\n2. Offer Tesla-financed boring tunnels to cities\n3.

Theoretically, this means that most people can be expected to \"strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains\", and that they will feel twice the pain from losing $ than they would from gaining the same amount.  \n\nMost shareholders also believe that a company should work to maximize shareholder value.  \n\nI think most TSLA shareholders here and at places like Tesla Motors Club would agree that Elon Musk is focused on maximizing shareholder value in the long run.  Elon will need that wealth to fund a Mars colony in the coming decades. \n\nThe **core dispute** is whether Elon should be supporting TSLA valuation in the short term too.  I don't think this necessarily means sacrificing the long term for the short term.  **I do think it means that many investors don't like it when Elon unnecessarily says things that cause the stock to be volatile**.  The automatic \"loss aversion\" response is painful for most people, and that is a reality which cannot be altered.  The most prominent example is when Elon tweet [Tesla stock price is too high IMO](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184) in May 2020.  The market price of TSLA plummeted in response.  \n\nWhat did this accomplish?  Nothing.  What is to be gained by needlessly inflicting emotional pain on shareholders?  I am a cold blooded fish Pokémon and can handle Elon's comments, but I also know that I'm an outlier.  \n\nWith regards to Wednesday's conference call, I'm not convinced that Elon's statements were the cause of TSLA's market price decline on Thursday.

People are selling for less and less. I guess the question then is - at what point does it reach equilibrium? \n\nI've said before but I'll say it again (if anyone cares) it's just incredibly unlikely that the companies holding short positions below $4 (or $20, $40, $80) didn't hedge their positions as the price rose by going long and creating new short positions/buying puts on the way up and then closing those positions on the way back down. It's just how hedge funds work, it's what they do to alleviate risk. All they needed was time and to not go bankrupt.

{"title": "Boomers cause Stock Market Crash of 2022", "selftext": "Feel free to quote me. \n\nFor the smooth brain PermaBulls saying the rich won’t let this market fail. Guess what?\n\n\nBillionaires are CASH GANG right now or BUYING PUTS. The rich will most certainly be making money in a crash slow or fast. You’ve got U.S. senators buying Puts, you’ve got Burry CASH GANG & buying Lockheed Martin back in Nov. (that man knows we’re going to war) you’ve got Goldman Sachs Partners getting a one time UNUSUAL PAYMENT (reward) for their efforts in 2021 (biggest Bull trap ever) if you can’t see the rich have already exited their positions, there’s no hope for you. YOUR WENDY’S PAYCHECK CAN’T BUY THE DIP FASTER THAN THEY CAN SELL. \n\nThis crap market started Jan. 5th (probably right when the wage slave algo workers came back from their vacations and tweaked the algos).  It’s clear as day the tech sell off and slow rotation to value stocks are an effort to preserve Boomers retirement funds. The media is labeling it a correction because that’s the only label they can say to not spook the boomers. The media and the markets are trying so damn hard to pump the news. Guess who has the most wealth tied up in the market? Boomers. Guess who isn’t buying the dip? Boomers. Guess whose not here on WSB in big numbers? Boomers once again. Most of the people on Reddit are millennials/Gen Z and maybe some Gen X. \n\nThere are so many boomers retiring from 2020-2022 because they don’t want to deal with Covid or the changing workforce. That’s why the labor rates is so high, their is a massive imbalance from Boomers to the rest of the generations and already their are articles shaming Gen X & millennials for not pushing out enough Gen Z children to keep this gravy train rolling.  \n\nSo how will the crash happen? Boomers are going to want to lock-in their profits so they can stay retired. How much longer of a market downturn are they going to be able to stomach? Boomers listen to Boomer Media so they’ll fall for whatever the talking heads on the media are saying. Cramer saying “don’t sell it won’t feel good” (always inverse Cramer, don’t forget 08 Lehman Brother’s is a buy, then very shortly later bankruptcy) Big Media pushing out Bull centric articles saying “be unemotional, don’t look at your portfolio”. It’s all to keep them from noticing. If you’re a millennial or Gen Z go ask your parents right now if they think this is a crash. They’ll just repeat the talking points the media is telling them.\n\n\nAlso I bet there’s a few boomers on this sub reading this. You’ve lived through 2008 and saw older co-workers that were going to retire and then saw the same co-workers back at work because they couldn’t afford retirement because their life savings tanked! You Boomers reading this know that 401ks at the end of the day are still Unrealized gains. Interest rates are going up so it’s not like you  can switch to bonds to try and preserve your net worth either. The only way a boomer can preserve their money right now is going cash like back in Nov. 2021. The 2nd best time is now.  \n\nNow back to the smooth brained permabulls who have only ever known Stonks going up. Ask yourself, do you think Boomers want to ride out a volatile stock market in retirement (media coined it kangaroo market to explain it to them) Boomers have low risk appetite and this market has them spooked. \n\nBut guess what a lot of boomers are going to realize soon if you’re first to sell you’re gonna be alright and make out ok. (The billionaires realized that in Nov. 2021)\n\nNow let use a scenario all of you smooth brains PermaBulls will understand.  Look no further than the whole GME situation. Folks who sold at $300 and locked in the gains were fine and moved on with their lives. Right now there are still bag holders still to this day waiting for whatever their “plan” is. The same way the boomers and their 401k’s are just listening to the media. However the boomers aren’t like the smooth brains holding GME, they’re looking at their LIFE SAVINGS and are going to realize I’m not going to get caught holding bags like people I knew in 2008. \n\n\nTL;DR\nMarket Crash will happen because the talk of it is here and no Boomers are going to continue to hold their investments once they get spooked. Media is keeping things calm because they don’t want a sharp sell off.\n\nDD (Literally everyone’s boomer Mom & Dad) go ask them and watch the same things I just mentioned above come out of their mouths. \n\nDisclaimer I’m holding March puts on anything cheap. Best of luck to everyone’s Boomer parents, I hope they’re able to salvage what they can of their 30 years of gains.

I work in IT now, and I don’t miss it. But I saw the writing on the wall when my company invested an enormous sum of money into a self driving truck company out of California, who is actively driving freight along I-10 as far as Texas. Transportation companies are salivating at the chance of ditching drivers with expensive health coverage, poor work performance (I was also a dispatcher toward the end) costly accidents when drivers fall asleep at the wheel or do dumb stuff. Costly trucks that idle all summer to keep the driver cool in his cab, wasting millions in diesel every day across the fleet. A robot doesn’t eat, sleep, need a DOT required 10 hour break, require air conditioning or paychecks…. Automation will eventually replace us all, and we will eventually have to give up old notions of money and jobs. Jobs won’t exist, the dept of labor already published a study which estimates 52% of the workforce will be automated in the next few decades. Even troubleshooting computer issues can be automated and my new career field isn’t safe.(I write scripts already from Bash and Batch and Python, which automate tasks that used to waste valuable time for me at work.) so I think Universal Income will be an an absolute must because of this. And that when jobs become obsolete we as a species will need to re-think what we value in life. Money will no longer have meaning because the labor aspect is gone. To keep it is to allow the one who has more robots and manufacturing to become our new lords and masters, while the rest of us barely survive in a new feudalistic society. The difference will likely be close to Europe vs Africa.  Where the worlds peasants and common folk have everything taken away and the “1st world-ers” will have all the luxury, land and farms they could dream of, we will work indentured lives in order to have a home, social mobility will die as there is no means to rise above.
