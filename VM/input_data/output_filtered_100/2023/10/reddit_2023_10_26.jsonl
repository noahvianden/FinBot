I made this mistake in 1999 and turned 10k into 40k and then into $400.

First, BMW, MB, etc… are putting out high quality EVs with great range. My BMW iX bests Tesla Model X in real world range all day. Tesla over estimates their range while every other EV manufacturer besides Rivian underestimates. Second, Elon Musk has alienated a big portion of his customer base via his comments about “the left” on Twitter. Third, and most important to the hyped valuation, Elon Musk has over promised to investors growth rates as well as product deliverables in order to hype the stock price. Roadster, cybertruck, full self driving, etc… he will continue to promise unrealistic goals to try and keep share prices up. Smart money has started to leave the stock and retail traders are left holding the bag. Tesla will not hit Elons growth targets over the next few years and I think you will see the valuation continue to come back down to earth. I personally would take the loss and put your money across ETFs that are heavy in small and mid cap value for the 20 year+ run.

Proper definitions: Untangling the concept of inflation from general price increases let's us talk more clearly. We won't confuse supply-demand dynamics with monetary policy driven effects.\n2. Misallocation of resources: Inflation, even if effectually not manifesting as a currency depreciation due to the new units of currency not spreading into society, can - with historical precedence - be an explanation of resource misallocation / malinvestment that may first create overvaluation, eventually causing a correction (eg. real estate or stock market), or even a crisis, to the detriment of everyone, even the ones that never benefitted from the new money in the first place.\n3. Potential CPI effects: In the same vein as point 2, the inflation may have set the stage for future CPI increases.\n4. Public Awareness: Esoteric or not, being informed about the money supply can help the public better understand the actions and limitations of monetary policy. This is especially crucial in democracies where policies can be influenced by public opinion, like the US. It is also therefore important that the public knows how discern supply-demand effects from inflation, or at least know that they are not the same.\n5. Economic Indicators: Only focusing on price increases, we miss important signals of economic health or distress. The money supply serves as an additional indicator that can provide insights into the state of the economy. Don't let it slip your mind that inflation / currency debasement has walked hand in hand with -and contributed greatly to many falling empires that engaged in deficit spending to get resources for wars, public services, etc.\n   1. Ancient Athens: During the Peloponnesian War\r\n   2. Roman Empire: 3rd century Roman Empire experienced rampant inflation due in part to deficit spending on wars and public works. Debasement of the currency led to a loss of faith in Roman coins.\r\n   3. French Revolution: The issuance of \"assignats\" as paper money to resolve France's national debt led to hyperinflation and contributed to the social unrest.\r\n   4.

By the late nine­teenth century, however, the distinction between “currency” and “money” was becoming blurred.\n\n\nAt the turn of the century, economists tended to refer to any circulating medium as money, and any change in the circulat­ing medium relative to trade needs as an inflation of money. But this shift in meaning introduced another problem. Although it is easy to determine the amount of currency relative to the stock of a precious metal, how does one know when the amount of the circulating medium exceeds “trade needs”?\n\nEconomists appear to have reached a definitional crossroads during the first several decades of the twentieth century. Presumably, because they could be cer­tain of the “excessiveness” of the circu­lating medium only by its effect on the price level, the notions of an inflated currency and prices became inextricably linked.\n\n...\n\nConclusion:\n Inflation, a term that first referred to a condition of the currency and later to a condition of money, is now com­monly used to describe prices. This shift in meaning seems to have originated in an unfortunate—but perhaps inevitable —sequence of events. By referring to inflation as a condition of “too much money,” economists were forced to struggle with the operational issue of “how much is too much?” The quantity theory offered a clear answer to that question: Too much money is an in­crease in the money stock that is accom­panied by a rise in the general price level. In other words, an inflated money supply will reveal itself through its effect on the price level. When Keynes­ian economic theory challenged the direct link between money and the price level, inflation lost its association with money and came to be chiefly under­stood as a condition of prices. Without being tied to the money supply, any price increase seems to have an equal claim to the word inflation. In­deed, today we regularly read reports of a seemingly endless variety of “infla­tions.” When the word is used as a description of the price level, an anti-inflation policy can easily be character­ized as being against any price increase, including higher wages! This is simply not the case. An anti-inflation strategy is concerned with a particular type of price increase—a rise in the general price level stemming from excessive money creation. When viewed in this light— the light provided by the word’s original meaning—a zero-inflation objective for the central bank becomes a much more sensible goal.\n\n\n\nNow that you have read it, do you understand better that you cannot just try to lie to me about what the pdf I have actually read says?

Consumer sentiments have been low for 2 years, and yet they keep spending. It's obvious consumers are answering these surveys one way, and their actions are completely opposite.

Clearly the unusual nature of global shutdown has to make everyone think twice about using historical data, regardless of what your beliefs are.\n\nI used weekly initial claims, which is part of LEI. 270k initial claims is equilibrium level, and so anything above that for at least 4-8 weeks before I get worried about an imminent recession. payroll at 100k is actually equilibrium level, not recessionary levels. It has to be negative, and probably for at least 2-3 months, for it to be a recession, so until it goes down to 100k, we're not even close to imminent recession. In fact, even economists who anticipate a soft landing and no recession, still sees monthly payroll temporarily going negative.\n\nEconomy's actually not that fragile. Strong consumer spending is driving the economy. And consumers can spend because they have lots of savings left (roughly 1 trillions still, and they only drew down around 80b/month when real wages were still negative, but it's positive now). They also feel confident about their job security. And companies won't fire people if they feel the economy won't enter a recession, or only enter a short/shallow mild recession. It's quite circular reasoning, but it all depends on excess savings that dictates consumer spending. We previously thought excess savings was dried up by this month, but turns out, updated benchmark revisions were released, and consumers still have like 1 trillions of savings left, in an economy where real wages are now positive, they're earning 5% interest on their excess savings, and they've locked in extremely low mortgages.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yield curve does not agree with your assessment to start.
