Or just spreads.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"max potential value\"? If it is already at \"max potential value,\" it has nowhere to go but down, right?\n\nFor debit trades, you want to buy low and sell high. So obviously you want to be as far from max potential value as possible when you open. Short of being totally worthless.\n\nI'm going to assume that \"max potential value\" is the **max profit at expiration**, but if that's not right, let me know.\n\n> I am confused regarding this, is extrinsic value good or bad when buying a spread? Wouldn't more extrinsic value mean an option is more valuable?\n\nDon't feel bad, that video quote was pretty dumb. Whoever said that probably confused a lot of people.\n\nYes, for long options, more extrinsic value is good, less extrinsic value is bad.\n\nHOWEVER, because a vertical spread combines a long and a short leg, higher extrinsic value benefits you *only* on the long leg. On the short leg, it makes you lose more money, because the buyback cost of the short leg becomes higher.\n\n**Not to mention that the statement is not entirely correct.** You can gain more than the max profit at expiration if the extrinsic value of the long leg goes up a lot more than the extrinsic value of the short leg, or even if the extrinsic value of the short leg stays the same or goes down slightly. This isn't normal, usually extrinsic value of both legs move proportionally, but occasionally there is sufficient volatility skew between strikes for them to move apart enough to generate more than max profit.\n\nThis can also work against you and create a situation where you lose more than max loss at expiration.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for clearing this up for me, it makes sense now.

So in order to sell something you don't own, you have to pay cash collateral up front. This is a kind of \"honest money\" that protects the broker from being left holding the bag should you end up losing money on the short trade. It's a promise to cover the short at some future date, backed up with actual cash.\n\nAs it turns out, the collateral requirement for a vertical spread is *not* the assignment value of the short leg, as you might guess, since that's the collateral for a cash-secured put for comparison. Instead, it is the width of the spread, because in the scenario where the short leg loses money and is at risk of being assigned, the long leg *must* have gained value. It's freakishly unlikely for the long leg not to gain when the short is losing. So since the long leg basically makes up for some of the loss, the collateral requirement is lower for a vertical spread. The broker is less at-risk for being left holding the bag.\n\nIn fact, this interaction between the two legs is why a vertical spread is considered a defined risk structure. Because both the upside and downside are capped with a vertical spread.\n\nFinally, I just gave the $1 wide example, which is typically the narrowest spread. You can go wider. $5 would be $500 collateral, $10 would be $1000, etc.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Right makes sense. So would you typically do a credit spread over a selling an option then?

You're not suddenly going to get assigned the day the share prices rises above 80.  Before expiration, options have extrinsic value.  In order for you to get assigned, someone has to exercise, and it doesn't make sense to exercise an option that still has extrinsic value.\n\nThe one exception is if there is an upcoming dividend.  In that case, if the value of the dividend exceeds the value of the corresponding put (i.e., the put with the same strike and expiration,) you are likely to get assigned the day before the ex-dividend date.\n\nhttps://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000435205-what-is-dividend-risk-", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> I own well over 100 shares of SCHD, so that would mean I am selling a covered call, correct?\n\nIf they are both in the same account, yes.\n\n> if the share price never hits $80, nothing happens on feb 17th correct?\n\nNot exactly. It doesn't matter if it \"hits\" $80. What matters is what the call is worth from one price change of SCHD to the next, and what the price of SCHD is after market close on expiration day. If it is one cent over $80 or higher, your call will be assigned and 100 shares will be sold for $80/share. If it is $80 or less, the call expires worthless and you keep all of the initial opening credit that you received, as well as the shares.\n\n> if the share price reaches $80 or more at anytime between now and feb 17th, they can exercise the option and I receive $80 per share, regardless of what the current share price is?\n\nTechnically, you are correct that your call could get assigned early, but it is extremely unlikely. Whoever exercised early would be throwing money away, and who in their right mind would do that? If the call is worth $1.69 and they only get $1.60 from exercising, why lose $.09 for nothing?\n\nUnfortunately, since SCHD pays dividends quarterly, there is a higher risk of early assignment near the ex-div date, which appears to be on calendar quarter cycles.

I created a throw away here, so I can talk about my assets and portfolio and my strategy for feedback. Im primarily a real estate investor with 30 units owned outright and about 2 million in equity. My cashflow is around 10K a month to play with. I still work a full-time W2 position making 155K per anum. So this 10K a month of REI cashflow I can leverage without any real regard for safety into more capital, hence why im doing options, I dont rely on the money outside of investment.\n\nI picked up a scanner a while back for a few hundred bucks, and run my own through finviz. Generally ive been trading things like spy, qqq, nvda, msft, tsla etc... looking for volatility. Ive been waiting for open, wait for volatility to subside somewhat and find a clear direction. Ive been using MACD, RSI and MA 200 as far as technical indicators. At the start of the move I think its going to make ive been just buying calls or puts trying to keep it simple. I understand the more complicated options strategies and tried them, but honestly I have had way more success in my paper account with calls/puts maybe 3rd on up or down on the options chain in the intended direction.\n\nI keep resetting the account, but I have been starting with 25K, and pushing that to 200K before I reset the balance. Ive done this enough times now I feel comfortable putting my cash in, and going at it. When the trade starts going against me i cut my losses immediately, if its moving fast I do a market order, if its a slow mover i try and get filled with a limit order. So ill take a bunch of small losses, before I hit a big move either up or down with a call or put, and then I close it out around 3/4 of where I think it will hit. Ive only been trading between 930-1030 but generally im done around 10 and restart the next day. I tried trading outside this window and it does not work out. Most of the options Im trading are between 0dte and 1 week dte.\n\nIm fine with the risk reward, luck aspects of this strategy because I am able to lose the cash without any negative consequences, and it can help me drum up more capital for real estate investments that will cashflow. I think once I get the account to 200, I will scoop it into my business account, and then start fresh with 25K and keep doing that.\n\nI do not like option selling or credit spreads, or longer dated options because to me it feels like all of that is subject to way more manipulation by the market makers, then just scalping 0dte options. I tried them on paper, kept spreadsheets and it just seemed like a slower way to lose money tbh. With day trading calls and puts its a way more binary win lose, and ive been able to win more than lose so far. My experience with leaps, wheel strat and some of the others has led me to the conclusion that the reward is not worth the amount of risk with them.

Trading against a computer sim that is designed to show how options and strategies work is easy.  Fills are unrealistic compared to real money trading, so be prepared for this and start small.\n\nMarket orders are almost never recommended as options pricing can vary and this is more true with lower liquidity options where fills can be wildly different than what the market indicates.  Always use a limit order to be sure you know what price you will get.\n\nDay trading with real cash is the wild west and your thoughts of longer duration trades is wrong.  Selling options 30-45 dte will let you open trades farther OTM, collect more premium, and give more time to adjust if needed.  It also mostly avoids early assignment and gamma risk.\n\nOptions are exchange of risk to reward, so the more you risk the more the reward can be, but also the more losses will be.  As a real estate investor (as I was for many years) this is like buying a property and expecting the full cash flow amount on day one.  We both know that this can be possible in unique situations, but it usually requires some fix up and costs to get the right tenants in and then over time the rents can increase while the mortgage stays about the same to increase cash flow.  \n\nTrading farther OTM and longer duration is lower risk for lower, but more consistent less risk returns . . .

If you say \"5 strikes\", that's the worst, since it doesn't tell us anything without looking up the chain, and would usually not be comparable between tickers or different chains.\n\n> Would a dollar move against me equal to a dollar move toward me?\n\nIt depends on how much delta a $1 move would represent. Delta isn't linear. If a $1 move either way is just +/- 1 delta, the gain vs. loss should be pretty close. But if a $1 move is +5 delta/-12 delta, for example, the loss may be larger than the gain.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "On earnings, would a 7 day to expiry have a bigger IV crush than a 14 day to expiry?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You have to say when expiration is relative to the event.

Anyway the stock market never works the way I think it would, and I got assigned @ $25 and have been holding the shares until now.\n\nI started working the Wheel, kept doing Short Calls every month, the worst moment was the stock was down to $14, but my Short Call was doing alright, even when it reached $14 I am still like breakeven in the case if I sell all my shares @ $14. Sometimes I am forced to roll up because I am too close to the strike price, but nothing serious so far so good.\n\nUntil the end of December, the stock market started to rebound, at that time the stock price was around $21, and was seeing a lot of big green days. I also learned this from Reddit, the best time to do Short Call is during the big green day, and I been seeing a lot 5% 10% rebound in a day for this stock, so I tried to be safe, did 35 contracts of Short Call @ $28 expires 30th January for like pennies, hoping there is no way to rebound 33% by end of January.\n\nAgain the stock market never works the way I think it would, this month I didn't have much sleep lol, the only good night sleep I can have is during the weekend where the market won't open in the next morning.

Still got 2 more trading days left before expiration, but I couldn't watch it anymore, and I can't guarantee the stock will close below $28 next Monday, so I closed all my Short Call contracts and am now lining up for next month February with lesser contracts Short Calls.

I never really done that many before, and I learned that I need some sort of security deposit in the account to allow me to do so. And during mid January, when it was very volatile, the trading system helped me close positions automatically due to lack of funds in the account. Sometimes I can react in time and make deposits to avoid closing automatically (back then I still believed there was no way it's gonna reach $28).

It's confusing. For discussions in this sub, it's best to stick to per-share values throughout. We can do any multiplying needed in our heads to get cash values.\n\nSo restating your setup to use all per-share values: **Let's say I bought a call option on stock $ABC for $3. The strike price of the contract is $90, and the stock is currently trading for $95.**\n\nNow to the problem. If a call has a 90 strike and the market price of the underlying is *above* that strike, the value of the call should be *at least* the difference between the stock price and strike price (aka the intrinsic value). So the *minimum* that call price should be is $5. No one would be willing to sell something worth $5 for a 40% discount.\n\nSo let's say the value of the call is $8. That fixes the problem.\n\n> Is it reasonable for me to assume that the value of the contract itself must be ~~300~~ 800 + [$(95 - 90) * 100] - $(Value of Decay)?\n\nNo.\n\nThe value of the call is $8. The market is the sole definer of price. You don't need a fancy equation, all you need to do is look up the current bid in the option chain.\n\nNow, as explained above, a call can have a floor under its price, but the sky is the limit to what the market will pay above intrinsic value.\n\n> As in, the price of the contract must be worth however much I bought it for, minus how much time has passed, plus the value that I would receive if I exercised the contract?\n\nAlso, no. Again, the market is the sole arbiter of the price of a contract. You can use a [pricing model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) (like the equation you came up with, but *much* more complicated) to come up with an estimate of the price the contract ought to be at some future date, but the market doesn't have to abide by that estimate.\n\nUpon expiration, the math gets much simpler. All time value goes to zero and only intrinsic value is left, so your equation simplifies to:\n\nValue = Stock Price - Strike Price (assuming the stock price is above the strike by at least $.01).\n\nIf the stock price is at or below the strike upon expiration, the contract is always worthless.\n\n> If that's not the case, and the contract is still just worth $(300 - Decay), then shouldn't I exercise the contract and then sell the shares for profit? I'd be making $(200 - Decay) profit.\n\nYou paid (adjusted) $8 for the call. You make a profit when you can sell it for more than $8. That's it. That's the whole story for profit/loss trading contracts. It has nothing to do with exercise.\n\nLet's say you buy the call for $8 and decide to immediately exercise. You pay $90/share to receive 100 shares with a market price of $95. If you immediately sell the shares, you net a profit of $5/share. *But you paid $8 for the contract*, so you end up with a *loss of $3/share* upon exercising.

With -68/71p I begin with a debit of 95 in hope to win max 205….\n\nBut -68/71p is better because both legs are OTM and thus reduces the chance of being called early on my -68p leg…\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. A 71P would have costed me 1.90 this noon, which would have made my BEP 68.10. But then I simultaneously sold 68P for 0.94. This gives me 0.95 entry cost, and notice now BEP is at 69.05.

Thus, I dare to play OTM Put. \nWhen I am just \"regular-bearish\" or distrustful of recent rally, I go with OTM call credit spreads. Notice both plays would have been OTM.

I am fighting to get $95 back, whereas with put debit, I give the market $95, with hope to get $205 back (at most).\n\nI cannot justify going ITM put debit, because now you are risking a lot more, just to get a bit of money. That does not make sense. At that point, do call credit (which would be OTM with the same strikes as you would have with ITM Put debit). \n\nYou cannot be too safe either. The conservative move would be to get at least 50% potential return, to close at 25% return... Why is that? Because as I told you, this would not realise full profit, unless AMD moves to $60 or $55 on E+1. It probably will not.

Hosting and streaming to millions of clients isn’t as simple as just putting the files on a server with an endpoint. Spotify has to do a lot of processing as well as a bunch of software and systems which are essential to keeping the platform running.\n\n- Analytics, which are essential for paying artists, checking for licensing issues with labels and regional distribution. \n\n- Advertising and regional advertising alongside targeted advertisements.\n\n- Load balancing and caching systems to prevent unnecessary server load, bug fixes, overall system performance. \n\n- Various ways of interacting (API, Web Browser, Desktop and mobile Apps) as well as their specific requirements such as security and UX. \n\n- User data, library and playlists and suggestions. \n\n- Artist data, for viewing statistics of a song/release.\n\n- In addition to all of the above, take into account the legal requirements of serving multiple regions. HR requirements for different regions. Staffing and general costs, infrastructure costs for hosting and other systems. \n\nNow you could say “There’s still no need for Spotify to be public” but there is. Spotify has never made a profit, it relies on investment. After exhausting VC funding there is no way to keep the company running rather than going public. Once public, the opus is on improving the platform as the entire value of the company lies within the services it offers.\n\nThe majority of these layoffs across the tech industry are 99.9% likely to be people in admin roles and not developers.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "All true except that last part.

If you’ve been there for a while and have your head down, you’re most likely OK. \n\nIt makes zero sense for a __tech__ company to instantly start gutting developers before hitting non-vital roles. There are exceptions such as Twitter sacking a lot of developers but for “normally” run companies, it’s not likely to be the case.  \n\nThe tech industry has been bloated for a long time, I think people forget that Meta/FB hadn’t had a large layoff for years before the 11k announcement.

The main reason is that with the advancements in technology, it has become increasingly easier for virtually anyone to create and distribute music. The proliferation of digital audio workstations, music production software, and online distribution platforms has made it possible for anyone with a computer and internet connection to become a musician.

Sure, you can make bedroom pop on a laptop with a single microphone but if you want to make anything involving recorded instruments then you’ll need a acoustically treated space and special accommodations made to the electrical and heating/cooling in order to record commercially viable recordings. It’s not as simple as “we can record this in my buddy’s basement”, unfortunately. \n\nAlso, for an single/album to have the kind of polish and quality that listeners are accustomed to, a producer will have to spend hundreds of hours with the artist or band to accomplish that. All of this (should) cost money as the investment in all these facets is considerable. \n\nI’ve dedicated the last 15 years of my life to working as a music producer/composer and I have built a 1,500 sq ft studio, so I know what goes into this all too well. I’ve seen business interests decimate the industry and then decimate it again. \n\nStreaming subscribers think that they’re meaningfully contributing to music but in reality, they aren’t.

We may not use horses and buggy whips as much, but we *do* use personal transportation *much* more than we used to. Cars scaled to meet that need in a way that horse-drawn carriages could not.\n\nI'm sure that that's very cold comfort, but it is the reality. Music consumption has shifted away from being ordained by record labels, radio stations, and venue owners to being much more personal and in the control of the customer. Customers have wanted to curate music for themselves for decades and have been doing so in various ways that the recording industry fought every step of the way (mix tapes, CD-Rs, etc.).\n\nIt's not that labels, radio stations, and venue owners don't matter anymore -- clearly they do. But their influence on the total amount of music consumed shrank dramatically. Like horse-drawn carriages, they're still around, but they're kind of a novelty. Listening to a thoughtfully-composed, complete album is a bit romantic. Going to a live show is an occasion. Listening to the radio is a last resort. Day to day, you're listening to a music selection that you have either created for yourself, or allowed some AI somewhere to create for you.\n\nWith the advent of streaming, there was just no fighting it anymore.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%.
