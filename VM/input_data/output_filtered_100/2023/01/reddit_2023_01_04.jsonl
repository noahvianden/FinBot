The reason is simple: other companies will either pay them more, or give SBC as well. Without it, the company does not attract the talent - thus does not grow as well. So you need to discount the SBC out of the earnings, especially when they are 6x their operating earnings.

This could also be interesting since it may allow for more rural deliveries and potential long term cost cutting on labor. Also I doubt the FAA will allow everyone and their mother to have their own drone delivery, so could be some potential high market share in that space in the long term. \n\n\n\nOverall I’m not invested because my wife will be getting a lot of RSU and I don’t want too much weight in Amazon.

The rush to Amazon’s various businesses, from e-commerce to grocery and cloud-computing, pushed forward years of growth for the company. To keep up with demand, Amazon doubled its logistics network and added hundreds of thousands of employees.\n\nWhen demand started to wane with customers moving back to shopping in stores, Amazon initiated a broad cost-cutting review to pare back on units that were unprofitable, the Journal reported.

However, a closer look at the current state of FSD technology suggests that it may be at least a decade before Tesla’s FSD is fully functional.\n\nOne of the primary challenges facing FSD technology is the need for extensive testing and validation. Autonomous vehicles rely on complex algorithms and sensors to navigate roads and make decisions, and these systems must be rigorously tested in a wide range of conditions to ensure safety and reliability. According to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it could take up to 10 years for autonomous vehicles to be fully validated for widespread use (NHTSA, 2019).\n\nAnother challenge is the need for significant infrastructure improvements. Autonomous vehicles rely on high-quality mapping data, real-time traffic information, and robust communication systems to function properly. These systems are currently lacking in many parts of the country, and it will likely take several years to build the necessary infrastructure to support widespread adoption of FSD technology.\n\nAdditionally, there are regulatory and legal hurdles that must be addressed before FSD technology can be deployed on a large scale. The NHTSA has released guidelines for the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles, but these guidelines are still in the early stages of development and may take several years to be fully implemented (NHTSA, 2019). In addition, liability issues related to autonomous vehicles are still being sorted out, with some experts predicting that it could take up to a decade for the legal framework to be established (Bryant, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, while Tesla’s FSD technology may be making progress, there are still significant challenges that need to be overcome before it can be deployed on a widespread basis.

However, a closer examination of the current state of autonomous driving suggests that it may be decades before Waymo’s self-driving technology is fully functional and widely available.\n\nOne reason for this is the complexity of the problem that self-driving technology must solve. Autonomous vehicles must be able to navigate roads, make decisions, and react to unexpected events in real-time. This requires an extensive understanding of the physical world, including the ability to accurately perceive and interpret objects, people, and other vehicles. While Waymo has made significant progress in this area, the company’s self-driving technology is still far from perfect. In 2018, Waymo’s autonomous vehicles were involved in 37 collisions in Arizona, many of which were caused by human error (Kilinc, 2018).\n\nAnother reason for the slow progress of self-driving technology is the need for extensive testing and validation. Autonomous vehicles rely on complex algorithms and sensors to function properly, and these systems must be rigorously tested in a wide range of conditions to ensure safety and reliability. According to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it could take up to 10 years for autonomous vehicles to be fully validated for widespread use (NHTSA, 2019). This suggests that it could be at least 25 years before Waymo’s self-driving technology is ready for widespread adoption.\n\nWaymo is not the only company facing these challenges. Other competitors in the self-driving space, such as Tesla and Uber, have also encountered setbacks and delays in the development of their autonomous driving technology. For example, Uber’s self-driving program was suspended in 2018 after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a fatal collision in Arizona (Kramer, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, while Waymo’s self-driving technology has made significant progress in recent years, there are still significant challenges that need to be overcome before it can be deployed on a widespread basis.

Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such **pledged stock does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%)** of the total value of the pledged stock.\n\n...\n\n>Example: A director pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 25% of 1,000 x $800, or $200,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $200,000 against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $400,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the director must repay $100,000 to maintain compliance with the 25% limit under the pledging policy.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "No, this was discredited and the article was subsequently updated to be titled \"How Elon Musk avoided a margin call using his own advice\"", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "It was retracted, there was no margin call and there is no margin loan held by Elon to find Twitter acquisition.\n\nTwitter purchase was a leveraged buyout and *Twitter* owes the money not Elon", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cliff dive continues!

{"title": "I Suspect ARK Invest and Cathy Wood of Fraud.", "selftext": "To be clear, I am not making any criminal allegations YET, it's just come to my attention that the firm might be outright lying about the sort of growth they expect in the stocks they hold in order to pump up valuations artificially.\n\nCathy Wood **hired** mostly **young** finance professionals, most of which have no direct experience in asset management and some of which have held no other full time job outside ARK Invest. For a time I ascribed many of ARK's faults to inexperience, but note that due to the low bargaining power of most her employees the lion's share of ARK's fat 0.75% expense ratio will being going to her. I cannot stress enough, that most if not all of Cathy's employees are **young enough to be her children**, and I have no idea if she's just an old lady trying to be hip or if she's doing all she can to increase her share of the profits. Their website even has a merch store so maybe a little of both...\n\nProfit margins are definitely a motive for some of ARK's actions. ARKX (Space ETF) has in its top 10 holdings PRNT (3d Printing ETF). There's nothing wrong with that as one of the widely anticipated applications of 3d printing is allowing astronauts to custom make any tools they need while in space. However, by **putting** the **one fund into the other fund** that allows ARK Invest to **double dip in** their **fees.**\n\nThey also are insatiable optimists, apparently. At one point Cathy asserted that breakthroughs in **AI technology** would cause **GDP growth** to reach **30% a year.** She also gave performance **targets** for her fund that would make them **by far** the **highest performing** investment **fund** of all time due to all the allegedly paradigm shifting technology stocks it contained, with second place going to a 3x levered fund that closed long ago She has even gone as far to argue the pre-revenue companies they hold represent \"deep value\" investing. Ordinarily, I ascribe nonsense like this to a poor understanding of science because science is rarely profitable. However, while that appears to be a factor, more recently extremes have made me unsure if they really believe the junk that comes out of their mouths.\n\nWhat convinced me to join Michael Burry in shorting ARK Invest was when Tesla soared and actually met ARK's bizarre target prices, they just raised the target price anticipating faster growth. However, in 2022 with rising interest rates it hasn't made anyone back down over there, and now they're issuing equally **aggressive growth targets** for the physical **Tesla factories**, arguing growth over the next few years will outpace all previous years. This isn't just **insane** autism, this **flatly contradicts** the **facts** on the ground. The previous pace of factory setup was so rushed it caused lawsuits, and Tesla is closing their unprofitable Shanghai factory and slashing prices to compete with other EV companies and has no known plans to build more factories at the moment. The only thing going for them is that other less skilled EV companies are going under in the credit crunch and Mr. Musk told his employees to ignore the market and keep making cars. But in any case, for some time now I and many others have believed most if not all of ARK's investments are bubbles, and we were all at least partially right.\n\nInexperience certainly is a factor because they **threw John Deere** stock **in** the **Space ETF**, with their research officer thinking they were mighty clever finding value in that John Deere does a lot of work with precision GPS mapping for their tractors. While John Deere is a solid stock in its own right (they supply the most essential equipment to the most essential industry), the idea they'd profit any more than marginally from space exploration is silly.\n\nAlso, they invested heavily in everything connected to decentralized finance, and we all know by now that's a [decentralized Ponzi scheme.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zm8q76/decentralized_money_is_unlikely_to_survive_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  However, I have no idea whether ARK Invest knew this at the time or if they were duped like many were for a time.\n\nBut perhaps the most **suspicious** thing ARK Invest does is their **Adjusted Earnings Reports**. There are strict GAAP rules (Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures) about what companies can and cannot report as earnings. Sometimes GAAP compliant books make a company look worse off that it is, so companies also publish adjusted earnings reports to show what they're thinking. Other times, it's just the execs trying to pump their own stock.\n\nARK Invest is almost exclusively in pre-revenue companies since you want to grab the moonshots as early as possible. Near all of them are cash incinerators with leverage hidden via private equity investors, and ARK Invest presents their case with adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortization). However, ARK's adjusted earnings would be considered extremely brazen accounting **fraud if** it were remotely **subject to GAAP rules**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. All **R&D costs are adjusted down** to the      average of the NASDAQ 100. The average NASDAQ company spends 12% of their      revenue on R&D while ARK's portfolio spends an average of 27%. The      idea is this R&D is an investment, not a cost.\n2. **Identical treatment**      for **sales/marketing** as this is too is an investment, not an      expense... Somehow.\n3. **Identical treatment**      for **employee stock** and options. ARK's companies pay an      average of 23% of their employee compensation in stock, many times the      norm. Again, they say this is an investment, not a cost.\n4. **Ignore** all      **non-cash costs**. This includes equipment/buildings breaking down      over time, which by GAAP rules is allowed to show up as a monthly cost as      a portion of the total cost of the asset.\n5. **Recognize deferred revenue**. This is when a customer pays in advance for something      they receive in the future. I.E. By GAAP rules if you buy a plane ticket      now it's not allowed to be counted as revenue until you use the ticket.      ARK's companies are often loaded with preorders for products that are not      fully invented yet, so this is a bigger deal than it looks.\n\nThere's probably more, but I'm not an accountant. However, **by ARK's metrics**, all the **cash incinerators** they own are either **breaking even** or **are wildly profitable**. You can imagine the type of racket there can be cooking the books for companies on your own initiative and getting paid a fee to do so. However, it is not clear if this is the motive, as we may still be dealing with young and stupid investors who don't know a thing about accounting.\n\nBut... ARK owns **10% or greater** position in **17** different **small cap** companies and has large stakes in **dozens** of **OTC stocks** and never backed down from these illiquid investments even when they had record inflows. They can definitely be a **whale** with interest in their own fund driving up the price of the underlying assets. Also, the average investor is chasing fund returns, meaning the bigger year over year returns equals more fund inflows and more fees generated. ARK's **worst performing year** actually **generated** the **most revenue** for the company as that is when AUM (Assets Under Management) reached their highs.\n\nNeedless to say, ARK's portfolio's **behave suspiciously similar** to a **leveraged S&P** fund both in long-term performance and daily volatility. They were likewise demolished by rising interest rates as equity investments behave like leverage even if they're not counted as liabilities. Personally, I pray the Fed keeps interest rates where they are so that we have no more of these fools and frauds we've seen in recent years. Which one is ARK? Well, as Napoleon said: \"Do not ascribe to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence.\"\n\nAnd Cathy if you're reading this don't think I'm just a total amateur anonymously talking trash about stocks I short.
