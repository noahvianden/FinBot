And it's often the same people who want to maim thieves that are *also* against these things, which leads me to believe its less about the morality of stealing and more about \"fuck you\" towards poorer people.\n\n> Shareholders are allowed to be equally as pissed when someone steals from their stores.\n\nI just had to lol at this. \"Their stores\", lmao.

The law favors people. Filled carts with products is another story - very intentional. Regardless of intentions, the impact is the same.. it's not reasonable to expect employees with no training who could be disabled to stop theives. Do we need employees doing biweekly or monthly physical training? Taiser training? That raises employees' training costs and wages which doesnt coincide with \"burger flippers dont deserve higher income.\" We can't expect more from people and keep paying the same. What if they taise someone not stealing or because a customers upsets them 🤣🤣.

If you touch a shoplifter you are fired. If you walk out the door, you are fired.  Managers will call the police and file a report and watch the theft occur. \n\nLabor is so short in the stores that most departments are empty of associates so having a place to steal is easy.

This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said in a statement.\n\nUPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.\n\nUPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It’s the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.\n\nPart-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.\n\nUPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tomé said on an earnings call earlier this month.\n\nThe company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the “volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.”\n\nThe union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.\n\nOn Monday, American Airlines\npilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots’ union.

Every movement you make is recorded (not allowed to back up or turn left) and you have to explain why you did this or that. Packages are up to 150lbs and you'll be alone to deliver (good luck on getting help). You have to come back with an empty truck even if it means working until 22h. You have to take 1h unpaid break but you don't have time to take the whole hour during the day (lots of deadlines to respect) so at the end of the day, drivers would finish their break in the parking lot around 19h or 20h.
