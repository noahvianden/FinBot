Don't get too caught up in the hype. It is giving us a nice set of tools to make people more productive, and it is going to make a lot of money, but the techniques right now are not AGI, and I think we might need a different approach to get to true AGI. Just keep investing and believe that business will benefit from productivity gains due to AI and don't worry.\n\n\\---\n\nYour goal is wrong. \"To make as much money as possible as quickly as possible.\" It is open ended, and you will end up taking risks that will probably hurt you if you don't get your goal straight. At the very least, you need to add \"...while protecting what I have earned from real, permanent losses.\"\n\nIs your goal to be an A-lister or to retire early?\n\nIf you are going for A-lister, you will be taking risks. That gets you to as rich as possible as fast as possible, but there is a high likelihood you will lose everything.\n\nIf you are going for retirement, I will spitball something for you.\n\nSCHD pays 3.5% roughly. SCHY is the non-US version of that fund, and it also pays 3.5%. So if you have a million dollars, you make $35,000 a year in dividends and don't have to sell any shares. \n\nVOO is something like 1.5%. You can create a synthetic version of VOO with SCHG and SCHD in equal amounts that will pay about 2%, or $20,000 per year in dividends.\n\nDividends are taxed as ... let's say long term capital gains. It looks like a lot of your investments will not be in tax advantaged accounts. So buying something you can sit on forever is a good strategy.\n\nYou can make more money with something like JEPQ, which pays 13% currently, but those dividends are taxed mostly as normal income. JEPQ and JEPI are run very differently than most covered call ETFs, so if you are going to use those, know what you are getting in to.\n\nThat would get you $130,000 on a million dollars, with an expectation that the principal value would increase with the market, but not as much as if you had invested in a pure growth fund.\n\n\\---\n\nYou can probably retire on less than $5,000,000.\n\n\\---\n\nSo, how do you get there. What amount do you need invested to retire? \n\nLet's say you need $2M. So you need to do is slightly more than double what you have.\n\nYou don't need to take risks. You can get 15% per year and in 6 years, you are sitting on $200K per year if you go the JEPQ route, with some left over for investing. If your time horizon is really that short, you really want to play things really safe. Reasonably diversified. Protect against losses more than go for broke on gains. Because if you go for broke and lose half, that puts you 11 years out from 2M.\n\nPay attention. That happens a lot. \n\nWhat about instead of investing in individual stocks, how about QQQM? That covers your favorites plus a lot of others you would probably like to own.\n\nIf you mix that with 40% to 50% SCHD, you will get some great down market protection. Maybe a combination of SCHD/SCHY.\n\nConsider adding some small caps. They are super overdue for a run, and it looks like this could be the year. Not too much, but having some actually helps with the diversification.\n\nGoing into this year, you might consider long term bond funds, as they can be expected to appreciate 20% for every 1% the FED ends up dropping interest rates. Note that you will probably want to sell these the following year, once things are stable and long term capital gains are in effect. This is NOT risk free, but has a different set of risks. \n\nI would suggest a little ARKK, but your time horizon is pretty short, and they are super volatile. \n\n\\---\n\nGood luck!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you’re looking to Angel invest, hmu", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy 30% bonds (5y maturity and more), and DCA the rest into VOO on the next 24 months.

It certainly feels like a business, and ultimately, it is one. It is just a publicly owned one that is heavily subsidized by tax revenue.\n\nSo in comparing the rates charged by each company to ship a package, I do think it is appropriate to point out that USPS loses money ((shipping charge - shipping cost) <0)on every item it ships and if the shipping fees were their only source of revenue, they would collapse as a business (if they were one). Therefore, USPS charging a lower rate than FedEx does not indicate that FedEx is overcharging (though it still may be). FedEx just has to cover all its operating cost from shipping charges.\n\nI agree that this does break down into semantics, but ultimately bringing it up in the first place was equally pointless. The poster wasn't commenting on USPSs value as a public service when they said it lost money. They were saying that the prices at USPS are lower sure, but they also don't cover the cost to ship. \n\nThat was a useful comment, and a true one. Jumping in to make an argument about the way we should view federal services from a fiscal perspective was really a non-sequetor.

FedEx earnings were shit so this makes sense", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It could totally be the case that FedEx is losing lots of market share to UPS and Amazon, but I will share this story.\n\nI didn't go to college until I was 28.  Out of highschool (2003), I was a construction laborer / carpenter.  I did that for 3 years.  Each year, I got laid off in the winter and the job I got in the spring paid less than the year before.  Started off at $17/hr cash was making $14 taxed by 2006. By 2006 I couldn't find work anywhere, so I went to UPS.  My first year there I made a surprisingly decent wage.  Although I was technically part-time, I was able to take tons of double shifts to cover for peoples days off, and overtime pay was pretty much double.  I made like $70k my first full year there.  Then after xmas 2007, no overtime was allowed anymore.  Shot down to $26k per year.  We all know what then happened in 2008.\n\nI ended up just being poor and working through the worst of the recession at UPS (at least I had job security and health insurance).  Later in 2010 I started my degree in economics and studied booms and busts.\n\nMy personal experience thus is construction slows first, then logistics, then kaboom.  Construction has definitely already slowed down.  What's different now however is that housing is supply constraint when in 2008 we had a technical over-supply.  I'd expect to see a level of resilience in residential construction regardless of what the economy does this time around.\n\nAnother thing worth noting about shipping is these companies do 30% of their revenue for the year in the last 2 months.  Also, sorting facilities can't scale infinitely, they run out of capacity.  Leading up to the holidays, major retailers are making contracts with UPS/FedEx to ensure there is capacity for their stuff.  Some retailers get turned away because of capacity constraints regionally.  It's almost always all hands on deck.\n\nI cannot even begin to convey how overloaded these facilities during the holidays. Any extra capacity during the holidays is a bad sign.  Even as I worked in a sorting facility through the worst of the 2008 recession, every holiday had the facility at its limits.  Packages literally raining from belts overflowing and jammed up.  \n\nThe comments about FedEx sucking because of high consumer prices are also dumb.  None of the major shippers pay those prices.  For both FedEx and UPS, every major shipper's rates are a custom negotiation.  You see contracts go back and forth between UPS and FedEx all the time, they are competitive with each other at scale.  They just don't particularly care for consumer shippers.\n\nMy last sentiment would be that 2008 was a crash ignited by a catalyst (sub-prime mortgages) and that catalyst was large enough to be systemic.  Likewise we had the dot-com crash before that. I think a lot of people here are waiting for a crash as an indicator of recession, but we don't have a big enough catalyst for that, not one that's been identified yet at least. You can totally have a recession without a sudden crash, even though most redditors have not lived through such a type of recession yet.
