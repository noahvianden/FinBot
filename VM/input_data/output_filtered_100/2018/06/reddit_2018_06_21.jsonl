What the buyer is hoping is that the stock goes up a bunch and then he can buy the stock for a previously agreed price thats cheaper than the stock + the premium you had to pay to get the call.\n\nHe made a vertical call spread that expires tomorrow.  The reason you would do a vertical is to leverage your money.  Because he is selling someone the right to buy the stock (that he probably doesnt have) for $360, he then buys contracts to match the 380, this caps your exposure meaning at most.. you can only lose the 20 bucks between the two strikes where if he didnt buy the 380, if the stock went to 400, he would be out 40 bucks and he would need a LOT more money to cover the position.. However since the lower one is more likely, it is worth more so ideally, the stock goes down and it means you collect your premium (the difference between the price you sold the 360 position (15.63) and the 380 position (5.88)).  He opened the position on 6/18 right before close when TSLA was at about 370.  Meaning he was already 10 bucks in the money when he opened it (aka OP has massive balls of steel and REALLY thought TSLA was going down this week).  1 contract is 100 shares, so he did 500 contracts x 100 shares with 20 bucks exposure.. meaning the premium he collected between the two was 15.63 (for the 360 he sold) and 5.88 (for the 380 he bought).. so he stood to make $487,500 if it cleared (meaning it was under 360 on friday).  However OP saw it tank today and wanted to collect some money.. so since the price of the stock went down to 350, means 360 and 380 were much less likely which reduced the price of the options.. so he was able to buy back his 360 and sell the 380.. the 360 is still worth more, so closing it cost him a fair bit of money.. buying the 360 for 5.74 and selling the 380 for 1.64.. so it cost him 4.1.. times 100 shares times 500 contracts.. so 205k.  Since he the original position gave him 487 and he lost 205k on this.. means he collects 280k.\n\nGiven everything.. if the stock had gone over 380.. he would have lost the full 20 buck difference.. 20x100x500 = 1000000 minus the premium he collected up front, 487.. meaning his max loss was 513k if TSLA went up 10 bucks instead of down today..  Again.. massive balls of steel haha.\n\nThe one thing that surprises me about OP here is that he cashed out all of his positions rather than keeping any of it for tomorrow hoping TSLA didn't rebound.. I can't dispute his logic but if you have the balls to get on this hell of a roller coaster, I kinda expect you to ride it out haha.\n\nI am just now realizing I am in WSB and not Options / Investing but I already typed it up.. fuck you.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "nice save", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "it would be fun, they said", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Do it again pussy", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "May someone explain that to me pls", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "you also lost right before that?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Show us your $280k lost overnight with one TSLA spread", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "They must be killing you with commissions!
