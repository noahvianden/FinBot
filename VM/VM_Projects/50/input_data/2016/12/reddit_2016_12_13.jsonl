{"title": "$AMD to skyrocket. New $AMD GPUs vastly outperform Nvidia GPUs for the same price.", "selftext": "Overclock.net, WCCFTech, HardOCP, etc are all talking about jumping ship from Nvidia ($NVDA)/Intel ($INTC) to $AMD.\nhttp://wccftech.com/amd-vega-performance-8gb-hbm2/\n\nThis is after today's reports from WCCFTech that $AMD's new GPU, the AMD RX490, which uses the new HBM2 3D-stacked DRAM interface manufactured by Samsung/Hynix, vastly outperformed the Nvidia GTX 1080.\n\nThis is actually huge news as most analysts were expecting the RX490 to just match the GTX 1080 in performance or only slightly exceed it. However, it exceeded it by a long shot.\n\n$AMD will regain a huge portion of market share in the coming months, so I really expect $AMD to be at $20+ by end of 2017. Take this from a guy who knows a lot about the graphics card market. \n\nAnd now $AMD is starting to prove itself in the CPU front as well. If $AMD can just match $INTC in CPU performance:price ratio, it will lift $AMD up further, and drag $INTC down. \n\nToday's announcement may lead to high volatility, either up or down 5%. I think the result will be +5% in afterhours/pre-market tomorrow.\n\nI don't see $AMD going below $9, and I think going below $10 will be quite difficult unless they really stuff the conference up.\n\nEDIT: Just looking at $AMD's technical chart, we can see that every time it breaks through the $8~$10 level, it enters a huge bull market and reaches between $30~$40 in the following year/years. So $AMD may even triple or quadruple by the next 1-2 years. Yes, $AMD has increased by 800% over the past 1.5 years, however that does not mean that it can't increase by another 300~400%. Crazier things have happened before (think $AMZN, $NVDA, $TSLA and $NFLX). \n\nPeople tend to think that since $NVDA increased by 300% this year, $AMD should go up by about the same amount, not more. The markets are irrational guys. $AMD is still under $15, and market psychology suggests that companies with lower stock prices tend to have higher momentum. \n\n**EDIT 2: Seems like it wasn't much of a big day for $AMD stock. Looks like this event was fully priced in. \nIt wasn't a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' thing either.**", "id": "5i3ik3", "created_utc": 1481634953.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "I want to believe that Vega will be a great hit, but the fact that it came from wccftech is super sketchy", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "They tested it on Doom.

(So it may have similar performance, but will use significantly more power and generate more heat to do so). This matters much more in laptop and small form factor deployments. \n\nWhile everyone is excited about Vega, AMD's hopes all fall on to Zen in my opinion. Mainly in server/datacenter installs.

If you read the article, it only outperformed by 10%, which at 4k is going to be around 5 FPS or less. In no way does that constitute \"vastly outperforms\". \n\nSecondly, the entire test is rigged in AMD's favor. You'll notice that the only resolution mentioned is 4k? It's because Nvidia still uses an older memory technology, thus it can't keep up as well at 4k. Lower resolutions would most likely see better performance from the 1080.\n\nThird, you'll notice that they used Vulkan. Vulkan is built directly off AMD's own code, so... It's obviously going to work better. There are zero mentions of DirectX 12, even though its more popular than Vulkan. \n\nFinally, the 1080 came out around half a year ago. Nvidia is already getting ready to release a 1080 Ti... So, AMD is still behind.\n\nNow, while I personally use Nvidia cards, I would love to see AMD force competition so that I don't have to get ripped off so much by Nvidia.
