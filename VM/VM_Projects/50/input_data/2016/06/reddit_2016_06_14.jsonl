{"title": "Brexit is legit happening, All our ship is ducked", "selftext": "I live in the UK. This 2nd world Island is about to go full 3rd world. Here is a rant / my DD. TLDR brexit is going to happen, pretty much worst-case scenario style.\n\nThe Ftse100 has just had its 4th straight day in the Big reds, 2% today alone. in the last 4 days lost 375 points or 6%. Other European stockmarkets are bombing: the Cac, Dax, Ibex.   \nMy dudes, the smart money is getting out. Bond yields on record lows, Gold going up, JPY and CHF up. FFS Soros spent $1bn on gold ETFs this year alone. THE SMART RATS ARE LEAVING THE SHIP.\n    \nThis Brexit bullshit is actually going to happen, do you hear me? The polls are bullshit but they all put Leave ahead by 5 to 10% of the vote. the Betting markets are a better indicator, and they're getting tighter, the odds have gone from 70:30 to 60:40 in the last 24 hours. 'The Sun', a bullshit newspaper for chav twats has come out in support of Brexit, AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WRONG ABOUT AN ELECTION OR REFERENDUM SINCE 1974. The prime minister hasn't been seen campaigning or making statements for like 3 days, and I believe he's leaving the leader of the opposition party to do all the campaigning so that they will take more of the fall because he knows that 'Remain' is going to lose.\n  \nWhat's going to happen? Immediate sell-offs. all the analyses from the banks, economists etc are almost certainly correct, because everyone will make them come true. I have half my cash in options shorting the pound against the dollar. I am sure I'm not the only one. Then, People will start worrying about a eurozone collapse. China exports to the EU, a lot, the dominos start to fall etc etc. This is going to spread around the world and we have the british public holding the red button under their finger. Have you met the british public? Do you know what they are like? I do. They are going to push that red button and ruin my fucking day. Instant UK recession, I just hope for everyone else's sake that the eurozone pulls together and fucks the UK so hard that none of the little squit countries in the EU fucking dream about stepping out of line and following the UK otherwise the EU is going to fracture like a frozen lake under your fatass momma.\n    \nGet wise or stay safe YOLOers\n\nEdit: This link: http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/chance-vote-leave-reaches-highest-level-ever/", "id": "4o2tth", "created_utc": 1465928440.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 46, "comments": [{"body": "So.... now it will not happen since you posted here!!!", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "This quim gets it.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "i really hope so, although I do want to actually make a bunch of money on Forex trading for once", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Why would you post this here!
