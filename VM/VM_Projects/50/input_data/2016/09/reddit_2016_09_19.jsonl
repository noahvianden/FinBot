{"title": "The Election.", "selftext": "I've read a couple posts on here about being due for a recession/crash/pullback which we hear about every month and I haven't pulled out of the market for the past five years upon hearing such fear as I believe in my stocks for the long term.  However, I do believe the market is acting as Hillary will definitely be the nominee as sectors react to what she says and not so much to Trump.\n\nHowever if Trump actually does win I do believe there will be a pullback that will continue to pull back over a longer period of time.  With so much uncertainty on how he will deal with trade/economic/foreign relation, I am for the first time seriously thinking about exiting the market.  This is a much different kind of election and many economists are frightened to the repercussions of a Trump presidency. \n\nI don't want to pull out of the market, but I might preemptively do so at the mere chance that Trump could pull it off.  My question is, am I overthinking this, meaning I know there's always a pullback in election cycles but this one could be way more exaggerated based off the level of Trump's incompetence by what he says publicly.  Is there anyone else out there that feels this way?  If you can talk me down from doing so I would love to hear people's thoughts on the matter..\n\nThanks.", "id": "53i2mx", "created_utc": 1474298667.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 46, "comments": [{"body": "Remember brexit?
