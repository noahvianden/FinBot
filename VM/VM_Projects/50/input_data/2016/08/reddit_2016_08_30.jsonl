Not a single one of them will hesitate to make the change, and here are a few reasons why:\n\n* Truck drivers are only allowed to drive for a maximum of 77 hours/week (11 hours per day) if they rest for 34 consecutive hours after their first 70 hours of driving.

Insurance adds another $2.89 per hour.

In 2015, trucks carried 63.8 percent of the total weight and 68.9 percent of the total value of goods transported in the U.S. Additionally, by 2045, the total weight of goods transported is expected to increase in aggregate by 43.6 percent, with trucking estimated at carrying 65.3 percent of that figure in 2045. The total value of goods is expected to increase 84.0 percent by 2045, and trucks are expected to carry 65.9 percent of that value.

If this were to happen, I'd assume the insurance cost would probably halve, which means in 2015 dollars, insurance would only cost around $1.45/hour. \n\n* Assumption 2: Restrictions on the amount of hours you can drive will stay as they are for humans. If you're a competitive company, would you prefer to employ a driver that is required to stop every 11 hours, and only allowed to work a maximum of 70-77 hours per week, or would you rather have a truck that can run nonstop from Point A to Point B, with no change in the driving habits? \n\n  * If we assume the company is rational and makes this switch, in 2015 dollars, the owner of the company will save the $18.46/hour in wages, the $5.15/hour in benefits, and around $1.50 in insurance costs. Mind you, in 2014 the total operating cost per hour of trucks was $68.09/hour (same source as above, the ATRI). \n\n  * Now, not only for the fact of the amount of money saved on not having employees, you also need to consider your individual competitiveness in the market. A significant amount of commercial trucking jobs are put up for bidding, and the lowest bidder will win the contract. If your company has retrofit your trucks, or purchased new ones, with the autopilot technology, you can now significantly undercut the lowest bids from companies that rely on human drivers. \n\nWhen you take those facts and assumptions above into account, it becomes pretty clear that as soon as there is a viable opportunity to make the switch to autopilot-enabled trucks, all trucking companies will do so as soon they possibly can. That's why I would recommend looking at large, established commercial trucking companies that have enough cash floating around to pay dividends. When the time comes, they'll have the cash necessary to either retrofit their trucks, or buy new ones, immediately. Their ability to make an immediate change will improve **both their top and bottom** line significantly.

A full auto detail job takes all day and can cost hundreds.\n\nI think that long-haul trucking does NOT lend itself to early adoption.  A rig driver does a lot more than just drive the rig; light cords have to be attached, dolly legs cranked, fifth wheels locked in, deck plate stuff secured, load integrity verified, doors properly locked and sealed, reefer temps set/verified, flatbed loads tied down, covers secured...the list goes on and on.  The actual act of on-highway driving can be handled by an autopilot, but the fail-safes would have to be extreme.  An #80,000, 110-foot long, 102\" wide semi becomes a missile if guidance goes away; the possible carnage is enormous.  Such a rig at 70 mph could take down a bridge, or destroy an untold number of cars in its way.\n\nSo, I think you would need someone in the cab anyway, though it would be far more relaxing for a driver to not have to be steering the rig all of the time.  As to the roadside logistics centers, it isn't a bad idea, but it would probably eat up the savings you would get from not paying drivers.
