I'm a pro options trader and work at a market maker. There are very few instances where you can say option pricing looks bullish or bearish and those are usually fleeting opportunities that get priced into stock within seconds/minutes. When people buy or sell options, market makers immediately put the impact of the order into the price of stock by delta hedging (buying or selling stock to counteract the deltas they get from the option). You are probably noticing the skew (ratio of put iv to call iv) although that is still near its normal range for NFLX and that normal range is very similar to its peers. There have been times this past week where the skew gets slightly high or slightly low when stock moves around but it went away within a couple hours.
