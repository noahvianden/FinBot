I'll take a crack at it:\n\nIt's a huge multifaceted topic that can't really be explained in the size limit on the comment text box reddit provides, therefore /r/WSB feels as though they can be experts on the subject because nobody can explain it in the context of their forum.  \n\nThere.  Done.\n\nFor a more inadequate explanation consider the following:\n\n- central banks all over the world are buying their own country's / region's bonds to keep interest rate from reflecting risk (which is just a fancy way of saying \"to keep debt from being defaulted upon\"; the thing that everyone forgets about central banks is that their **SINGULAR** purpose in life is to insure the viability of their debt.... nothing more and nothing less... the \"dual mandate\" bullshit of employment/price stability is a smoke screen).  Current central bank policy consists of insuring the viability of existing debt by creating more of it.  At the end of the day, **ALL DEBT** is paid back from the future labor proceeds of the workers (the 99%) and when debt issuance grows to the point that it exceeds all future human labor proceeds, even with barely tolerable levels of inflation factored in, debt in excess of that number must be destroyed.\n\n- sovereign default risk has been on the rise and several full-on defaults have been subject to intervention:  cyprus, spain/greece, several gulf state, china, puerto rico, multiple-US, cities/municipalities, russia; once a sovereign tells the world to fuck off via the IMF/BIS/WB, interest rates could well get out of any one central bank's ability to control them\n\n- the result of this \"easy money/quantitative easing\" is that monetary inflation has flowed into the stock market instead of into wealth redistribution to the 99% via glorious Keynesian stimulus (and the key things to understand here is that stock buy-back are at an all time high and that those buy-backs, funded by QE, are used both to prop-up stock price and to compensate the CEO/board sitters)\n\n- with money scarce amongst the 99%, the result of QE has been both the velocity of money and the money multiplier falling off the face of a cliff, possibly never to be seen again.  Even when you put a couple extra hundred dollars in the hands of the 99%, all they're doing is paying down debt or desperately hanging on to it.  Some of the failure of monetary policy might be due to certain accounting identities having been broken/suspended post 2009, but no Very Serious Person would be caught admitting to such a thing (but something that should worry market participants is how the fuck do you value anything, but particularly an equity, if fundamental accounting identities have been removed?)\n\n- the FedResInk (and other central banks) are unable to pursue policy adjustments because the stock markets have realized that all they have to do to keep that from happen is have an 8% to 12% taper tantrum to get the central bank to back off interest rate increases (this has been happening for the last 2 years).\n\n- circuit breakers and trading halts coded into world stock market rules are preventing a market correction from happening. flash crashes and ETF oddity manifestations are popping up in the markets without a good explanation as to why or how they happened.  volume for certain markets is dropping off the face of a cliff without any good reason.  without a viable way to unwind the world's stock markets, the only place left to adjust is through debt default\n\n- political support for central bank policy is running out.  Brexit happened because the ECB thought it could be insensitive to British expectations about how their society is to be structured; the same thing might happened in the USA, where Donald Trump has said that he might consider making US bond holders take a significant hair cut, compromising, for the first time in recent history, the \"Full Faith and Credit\" of debt issued/created by the USA/FedResInk.  Everyone in the developed world wants a wall (because they're no where near full employment) and the developing world (including those currently experiencing religious/civil wars) all want to come over it.\n\n- wages have not kept up with the cumulative effect of inflation (no matter how low it's reported as being by economists, headline inflation has chipped away at the middle class's stagnated wages) and sure as hell haven't kept up with productivity (which is an outright fabricated number).  \n\n\nThe end result of all of the above is that the magic formula of: \n\n     debt increase < income increase < productivity increase  \n   \nis actually:\n  \n    income (doesn't) increase  < debt increase (and please note that the amount of debt matters even  close to ZIRP)\n    ...and productivity increase doesn't exist without below minimum wage labor due to illegal immigration\n\nThis fact is the failure of Keynesian Economics(tm) and neo-liberalism as currently practiced the various world central banks and will result in a political reality that prevents central banks from enjoying productivity increases as they have become used to them (i.e. illegal immigration)... and ultimately to the failure of what little democracy developed counties might currently enjoy.

That would be fine if the money had been invested in research and development, new equipment, expansion, etc. but instead it was almost entirely spent on share buybacks and dividends. Consider that [total debt has increased $2.81 trillion over the past 5 years to a record $6.64 trillion. In 2015 alone, liabilities increased by $850 billion, 50 times the increase in cash according to S&P](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-31/risky-reprise-of-debt-binge-stars-u-s-companies-not-consumers). So most of the rally over the past 7 years has been a false one, as it's been debt buying shares/paying dividends from the companies rather than shareholders driving returns. This is obviously unsustainable as you now have slowing growth.\n\nEurope: Banks in many countries never really recovered from the financial crisis with ones in Italy and elsewhere having hundreds of billions in loans on their books that are unlikely to be paid back. To give you an idea [Italy's banks are currently trading at 10-20% of book value](http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-07-04/paschi-shows-ecb-must-be-flexible-with-italy-s-bank-crisis). These will need to be bailed out in addition to a number of countries that have unsustainable debt levels (Greece, etc.). \n\nChina: About 80% of corporate profits in China are from financial institutions with the vast majority of companies in almost every other industry (and especially state owned enterprises) posting substantial losses. The problem is that all of the profits from the financial institutions come from loans to the other companies. The loans/bonds cannot be paid by the companies (as they have negative cash flows) except by borrowing more money. It used to take about $1 of borrowed money to create $1 of positive economic impact to the economy - now that's about 7:1. You can see where this is going, with [$3.7 trillion borrowed last year alone](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/china-s-debt-load-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought-goldman-says).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The China scenario undoubtedly sounds like the scariest story out of those three.
