{"title": "Best stocks for 2017 - my predictions", "selftext": "$AKS - The only real profitable steel stock with plenty of room for further growth. It is both a value and growth stock. Better than $X and $STLD. The predicted earnings (and surprise factor) for $AKS is through the roof, much stronger than $X and $STLD. \n\n$RSX - OPEC just cut oil production which will benefit Russia and Iran the most. $RSX is an ETF managed by VanEck which is a US investment management company, and tracks Russia's commodities, industrials and resource-heavy companies. Russia's economy is already forecast to come out of recession in 2017. 1.6%~1.8% is the Russian economy's projected GDP growth rate WITHOUT an OPEC oil production cut, and this will go higher now, maybe even pushing >2% GDP growth rate. The $RSX hit rock-bottom on January 15, 2016 (a level not seen since the 2008/2009 GFC) and has been rising since then. It's still early, so I highly recommend getting in before everyone jumps in (hindsight is always 20/20.. once this ETF rises by 100%+, then all the average Joes will start to get in as always). The $RSX is only just starting to rise, and is still cheap, much better value and has a superior growth prospect compared to the small-cap $RSXJ, which has doubled this year. The $RSX has huge potential to double by end of next year, maybe even triple, seeing how elite investors are so bullish on Russia (you don't see this on the front pages of Bloomberg or MarketWatch). I just made $1200 off of it today. The $RSX is industrials/commodities heavy, an area which Russia struggled with since international sanctions were placed on it due to Crimea and Syria. Now with the Obama/Clinton administration gone, these sanctions will get gradually eased. Republicans may be hawkish on Russia, but much less so than the Obama- and Clinton-led Democrats. And Trump is known to be much more diplomatic towards Russia than Clinton. Plus I don't think there is an Iran ETF, nor would I consider investing in it anyway with Trump's negative stance on Iran. \nNote: I strongly believe that Russia will be the best emerging market to invest in for 2017~2020. This is because Russia has faced a catastrophic economic collapse from 2014~2016 and is only starting to improve. Brazil's economy has been mired by internal problems, not due to sanctions. Therefore, Brazil and other South American/Central American markets pose continual risks as a Trump presidency does not present them with any advantages. Mexico will prove to be very a volatile market to invest in under a US Trump presidency. India is currently experiencing a cash crisis. Peruvian and other small South American ETFs have already soared too much in 2015/2016. $RSX is the best investment among emerging market ETFs with the potential for higher, sustained returns. \n\n$GM - rising oil prices usually don't mean great gasoline car sales. However, $GM is beating $TSLA to the affordable all-electric vehicle race and $GM has increased its profitability in the most recent quarter. This is set to improve dramatically over 2017. Trump, although criticizing $GM over manufacturing cars overseas such as in Mexico, is known to be friendly towards $GM. $GM will perform much better than $TSLA as the new all-electric Chevy Bolt will be delivered to customers in January 2017, whereas $TSLA will most likely delay the release and deliveries of the Tesla Model 3. \n\n$FCX - OPEC just cut oil production and copper is still in booming mode. The stock is still down 75% from its 2010-highs. Enough said. DO NOT BELIEVE analysts who downgrade this stock. Many of them think they have missed the $FCX train and want to bring down the stock. For example, Berenberg attempted to bring down the stock today by downgrading $FCX to \"Sell\", yet the stock rose 3.15% today & after-hours. Absolute nonsense. This is a high growth stock continuing into 2017. \n\n$MU - the semiconductor industry has been booming due to rising DRAM prices. The companies that have benefited the most are Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron ($MU). However, Samsung Electronics is trading at all-time highs and you can't buy SK Hynix except on an ETF or a non-easily-accessible ADR. Therefore, buying $MU makes more sense. $MU is still down 50% from its 2014-highs and will most likely reach this level or surpass that by 2017~2018. DRAM prices will only increase as demand for AI and more complex electronic components in cars increases. And let's not forget Intel's massive drive into 3D XPoint and AI as well. The semiconductor industry will continue to see a boom continuing forwards. \n\n$HUM - the most profitable and bullish private healthcare stock under a Trump presidency.\n\n$BAC - bullish banking stock. Not just this stock, though. There are many many US banking corporations to choose from, some obviously better choices (e.g. $GS) than others. \n\n$LMT, $RTN, $NOC, $HEI, $ESLT - Aerospace and defense stocks will be bullish under a Republican government. Very priced in ATM. \n\nDark horses:\n\n$AMD - up ~300% in 2016. Vega and Zen will be major potential growth drivers. I certainly see $AMD having major upside potential if these are even moderately successful. And $AMD is returning to profitability. We will see what happens. Its partnership with $GOOGL is looking very promising for revenue and profit growth too. \n\n$NVDA - similar to $AMD, up nearly 300% this year. It's range expansion on Nov 10, 2016 to the $80~$90 range was a huge surprise for most investors. Since then, it has lost forward momentum. I think $NVDA will see a moderate increase in its stock price in the short-medium term (a drawback soon is to be expected, though, looking at MACD and RSI), and it can potentially reach $150 by end of 2017. If $TSLA fails to deliver, it could be risky for $NVDA. However, in the long run, AI is still required for all types of driverless vehicle technology as well as other AI applications such as robotics and deep learning, as well as defense projects. So any trouble at $TSLA does not present a high extrapolated risk to $NVDA. Plus strong GPU sales and partnerships in the console space should protect $NVDA from hitting its stock price when uncertainty looms in the AI world. \n\nStocks NOT to buy:\n\n$TSLA - Time after time, $TSLA has disappointed its investors. The SEC is now accusing $TSLA with reporting unrealistic accounting numbers. $TSLA will most likely be late in releasing and delivering its Model 3 vehicles due to the $SCTY merger. There are also rumors that Panasonic may charge Tesla more for its batteries. So this may shift Tesla to seek other ventures with companies such as LG Chem, which may prove to be more expensive than initially thought. \n\n$AAPL - Lack of innovation much? The new Macbook is a complete disaster. $AAPL should be a much better buy before September 2017, though. I do believe that the iPhone 8 will be a form factor upgrade, which should boost sales, although the boost wont be anything like iPhone 5S -> iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 may have a curved AMOLED display similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge/Galaxy Note 7. Competition from Samsung may also be a risk factor as Samsung is heavily investing into AI integration into their phones, and their recent acquisition of Harman may prove to be highly advantageous for their smartphones as well as their auto parts business. It doesn't help that Apple failed to capitalize on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall scandal. Apple is a highly profitable company, however 2016 has seen its debt skyrocket. We shall see what happens with this stock, however it is not a good short-medium term play by any means and is not a good buy now for the long term either. This is because $AAPL stock is cyclical in nature (more so than other stocks) and tends to fall during November-January. Buy now at your own risk. \n\nDisclaimer: These opinions were written with some contributions from a friend, who is a 12-year experienced investment banker and has been trading stocks for more than 15 years.
