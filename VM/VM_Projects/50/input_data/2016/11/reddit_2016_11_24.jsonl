Roll or close the  calls before your underlying get called away then rinse and repeat. \n\nHolding stocks that are inversely correlated lets you maintaim a market neutral position while collecting a steady premium.\n\nOn the flip side, do you want to buy AMD at 8.50 a share? Then you would love to own it at 7.50 a share. Sell the put and collect the premium, if it dips below and you get excersiced then you are still better off then if you bought it at 8.50 AND you collected the premium, once you own it sell calls until it gets called away or close the position before expiration.\n\nAny single option position is no better than gambling on a stock but if you build a theta positive portfolio that is delta neutral you will consistantly make money. Take your winners at 50% max profit and roll or hedge your losers until they become profitable. \n\nJust some food for thought, I'll go back to eating Dicks and drinking bleach now.", "id": "5el01x", "created_utc": 1479949720.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "this is depressingly unfunny.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Sry bby", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Eli5 how do I build a theta positive portafolio thats delta neutral?\n\n\nPs: I only know how to yolo", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Sell options on inversely correlated stocks. In reality, its almost impossible to find stocks with perfect -1:1 correlation, since they are susceptible to a large number of variables, which affect each of them differently. Additionally, you need to rebalance frequently to remain market neutral.\n\nAn example would be, buy NUGT and DUST. The first obstacle is buying an amount of each, such that you have a 1:1 ratio of money invested in nugt and dust, since they trade at different prices. Now, theoretically, after the first day, regardless of what GLD (the underlying of both) does, you should have the same amount of money (we know this is not true, due expense ratios). So now we are delta neutral. In order to become theta positive, we need to write calls against both sides (NUGT/DUST).\n\nIn this case, we would also need to rebalance our portfolio daily, in order to maintain true market neutrality. To demonstrate why this is necessary, take the following example:\n\nYou invest $100 in both NUGT and DUST. GLD moves up 3%. You now have $109 in NUGT, and $91 in DUST. The first day, we were delta neutral (made/lost $9). The next day, GLD moves down 3%. Now, we have $99.19 in NUGT, and $99.19 in DUST. That second day, we were not delta neutral, because we did not re balance to maintain a 1:1 ratio of dollars invested in DUST/NUGT (Lost 9.81 on NUGT, made 8.19 on DUST).   \n", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "What the fuck is this delta, theta bullshit... but can it give me tendies?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "The Theta on an option is how much it will go down in value each day if the stock just stays the same, so it's the time value that you lose each day, delta is how much the options value will go up if the underlying stock's value goes up by $1", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Or gain if you sell options.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or down (delta)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Also, you can approximate what the market thinks the odds are of an option finishing ITM by looking at delta.
