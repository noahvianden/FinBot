If you truly believe in your stock, it will go back up.\n\n2. Starting out invest in ETF‚Äôs- this is probably the thing I wish I could‚Äôve been told. ETF‚Äôs are like and mutual fund but you can buy it anytime during the day. They r a safe way to consistently make money. They won‚Äôt lose you money(if you pick a good one) in the long run. \n\n3. Don‚Äôt buy a stock because someone said to- I have fallen victim to ‚Äúhype‚Äù stocks that I think will be the next GME, but ultimately fall 50%. I‚Äôm down about 20% in my portfolio because I bought into stocks that are sketchy.\n\n4. Stay away from options- some new investors may not know what it is and it should stay that way. It is the equivalent of gambling. \n\n5.crypto- crypto is very volatile and u could lose your whole investment in a day. I wouldn‚Äôt say you shouldn‚Äôt invest in crypto, but be smart. Also don‚Äôt buy DOGE it‚Äôs literally a meme.\n\n6. Don‚Äôt invest money that your aren‚Äôt prepared to lose- the stock market is unpredictable sometimes. A new pandemic could occur or a world war could breakout or another Great Depression could happen.
