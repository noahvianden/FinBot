I imagine that when these kinds of secondary offerings are made, a bunch of investors' eyes turn towards the company's financials to check for a bargain - I hold ASO shares and options and believe it still is a MAJOR bargain around $31.\n\nThey took steps to pay down a bunch of debt with a couple great quarters - seems to me that a buyback is the next best choice for a company that isn't looking to pay a dividend and has excess cashflow over-and-above what is needed for their expansion plans. Most companies held cash through the pandemic, so to me ASO is signaling that the pandemic uncertainty may be behind them.\n\nCouple other retailers that announced buybacks recently are DG and DLTR.

Their 2020 earnings paired with their JPM presentation last month have me bullish considering how low their estimated EPS is for Q1.

Sounds like stores were only closed for a few days and imo that‚Äôs just sales delayed, not lost.
