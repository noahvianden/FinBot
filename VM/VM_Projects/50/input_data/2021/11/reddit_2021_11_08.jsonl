I find this VERY naive, I am not saying FB never does anything wrong, but I think most these tech companies have done something similar, Microsoft has done many bad business moves, but never saw the same amount of hate for Gates etc. There are many companies that are not tech companies that do very bad things directly to people in other countries and I never see so much hate.\n\nI think most of the hate is because of the business itself, but I remember when the \"dot com\" boom was taking off, and many companies had good ideas for services, but never figured out how to actually make money of them, therefore the bust. The ones that lasted changed to making money from advertising, and growing the info on customers etc. I remember this being openly discussed as a business model at the time, and you were basically selling your info for a free service, this is how the service works. If you do not like the terms, do not join the service.\n\nHas FB overstepped? I am SURE THEY HAVE! But the key here is they are the first trending on this business model to this extent and dealing with a ton of questions no one has had to deal with before. Some of the social issue anyway I would say are not as easy to deal with as people make it sound like, and many times it is best to stay neutral in many instances, because once you start playing the gatekeeper in becomes a bigger issue. Generally, I think all the issues FB has dealt with, even the ones people hate them for, are issues that any other company that grew as fast as they did being the first social network with billions of users would have also had. Asking any company to police themselves on new issues like these before the government has dealt with any regulations is always going to have issues.\n\nAs a investor I love what I hear from Zuckerberg, I look for companies that do not sit on their money but innovate, and have a vision of where they want to be, even if they are wrong I would rather them has a clear vision and someone leading the company that will not let the vision get changed.
