Die Mon hands all the way.\n\nIf you answer that question with a No, then you need to consider what a reasonable risk/reward ratio is for your play and how much are you willing to lose on this deal if you're wrong. Then you can immediately set your stop loss after purchasing, and the absolute worst case scenario is that you get stopped out, and take the loss that you already came to terms with.\n\nHere, I will give you a recent example. Take ROKU. I like the stock, but not enough to potentially baghold it for multiple years and also watching it slowly lose half it's value or anything like that. So, I see an opportunity in the stock when it was $271. Now, I decide how much am I willing to lose on this play if it goes wrong? I decided that I was willing to lose $363 on the deal. So I ended up buying it at $271.68 on Thursday. I immediately set my stop loss to $267.56.\n\nOn Friday, the stock started really dropping. It fell all the way to $268.58. I was only $1.02 from being stopped out of the play with a $363 loss. If that happened Friday, I would have been disappointed about it, but not devastated. Also, if the stock just keep sliding and sliding and sliding (like what's happened with Paypal), I'd end up being a long-term bag holder for who knows how long.\n\nBy the way, I actually did buy PYPL on this dip. WAY too early. I bought at like $246! On this stock, I was prepared to baghold for 3 years in a worst case scenario, so I didn't set any stop losses or anything like that. The stock has of course plummeted way below my $246 cost basis, but I'm not too concerned with it. Sure, I'd much rather it was exploding in the other direction, but I don't feel like I'm going to be bagholding PYPL for that long of a time frame. It could be dead money for a few months.
