That's why stocks often go through periods of consolidation, otherwise called basing. Depending on the stock, that can take weeks-months.\n\nSo the key is to first wait for the base to start forming, which you can see very clearly on a chart. It's a period of trading sideways or trading in a narrow range. Once you see the base forming, then you start to watch for the breakout. That means you want to see the stock making a new high (breaking above the base or trading range), ideally on increased volume.\n\nThe other thing to look out for is a trading day when the stock posts a bullish candle on significant volume, even if it doesn't make a new high.

The call is leveraged to the upside and you can realize gains disproportionately higher to your risk. The downside is you have to be directionally correct within the time frame of your position's expiration. The short put is leveraged against you. in that you can realize losses greater than your gains. The upside is you don't have to be correct, you just can't be *too* wrong. The short put is more of a strategic move, given you can evaluate the probability ITM. The long call is more of a 50/50 shot, like buying stock outright.\n\nBoth will have advantages depending on the market circumstances. If options are trading for relatively low prices (low IV), you will have greater upside leverage in a long strategy - like a long call. That is assuming you are bullish. If options are expensive (high IV), a long position is more expensive and you'll have less leverage and therefore less capital efficiency. This is why people say to buy when IV low and sell when IV is high.\n\nIf you're looking to use leverage and maximize your potential, you should look into futures. SPY tracks the S&P. The corresponding futures products, /ES and /MES give you 50x and 5x S&P performance respectively. The nice thing about the futures, is they have static delta.
