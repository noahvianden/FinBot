You then have a group of also-ran stragglers who are there either because a) it‚Äôs good for their wider brand, b) they have a niche, or c) they have their own platform and it‚Äôs part of a bundle. In all cases, the also-rans share something, be it the OS they use or the content they offer, because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to invest so much time, nor frankly are there enough software developers in the world, to waste time developing thousands of operating systems or platforms to the level of maturity needed to compete against the leader. \n\nExamples: iPad - there are other tablets and the iPad isn‚Äôt the god device yet, but nothing else comes close - no other manufacturer has come close to breaking the tablet market in that way because they don‚Äôt make the hardware and software. It took nearly a decade for Microsoft to catch up with the surface and it had to build its own to finally prompt a reaction from Apple.\n\nSpotify - came right in and ate iTunes lunch. Destroyed Apple‚Äôs download music business and they were caught napping. Again it to took 5 years for Apple to finally get its shit together with Apple Music after a bunch of acquisitions for tech and talent. Then you got Tidal, and the other also-rans etc. some with a niche, Amazon music as part of a bigger platform‚Ä¶ \n\nIn most cases the major one or two players command ~20-30% market share each. In all cases, one single leader will dominate more than 50% the profit in the market. \n\nSo if we step back and say that cars are now computers on wheels. Tesla has the first mover advantage, then they‚Äôre 2007 Apple and Model 3 was the iPhone. Model Y is the iPhone 3G, it‚Äôs mass market available internationally and shipping in volume. Arguably the 4680 Y could be the 3GS. And then we get to the $25k car and the iPhone 4 moment. From there on in it‚Äôs world domination. \n\nArguably this is evidenced by the fact Android auto is powering a bunch of cars, it seems Polestar, Lucid, and Mini are going that route. Interestingly they all share a similar UI and cabin layout philosophy‚Ä¶ The vehicles aligned with Honeywell and Bosch, like VW and Daimler where they are the Motorola and Nokias of the world, ordering parts and assembling devices and shipping them with a baby OS, their suppliers build the bits and they build the devices, they‚Äôre fucked! They‚Äôll end up on Android or sharing an OS between them. \n\nSo far I haven‚Äôt seen a better OS on a vehicle, Rivian straight up copied it and it seems Teslas have again now set that UI paradigm for modern EVs of large landscape touchscreens, that upstarts are copying where Android is still doing that vertical screen thing along with Ford, still copying the 2012 model S design‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the industry consolidates significantly from where it is today‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs gonna be brutal.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Perhaps you'd like to join me in getting in on the ground floor of Besla* , Cesla, and Desla.

Are you alive? ü§£", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I am! lol, It has definitely been trying emotionally though, as you might expect.\n\nAs the market dropped, I adopted a \"3 for 2\" approach, where I'd increase my portfolio exposure by 3% for every 2% the market dropped.  So by the time the market hit 10% down, I would have had to payout 30% of my portfolio if all my companies went bankrupt.  The market continued down, but I tried to keep that max loss at 30% of my portfolio's ATH.  What I didn't mention in the comment from 10 mo ago is that my buy-and-hold positions are almost all dividend paying stocks and funds, so I've had income coming in consistently.  I've also sold some covered calls as opportunities arose, such as IRM 52.50 expiring this month.  Having income has been key to my sanity this year lol.\n\nI'll also point out, that since I chose to limit my losses to 30% of the dollar value of my ATH, my Margin Requirement is much lower, roughly 14% as I write this.  If I understand the rules correctly (and I'm banking that I do, but ask a financial advisor lol) I estimate that SPY would have to drop to 1800 before my balance drops so low that I get margin called.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm rolling deep ITM puts out for small amounts of premium, sometimes three months out instead of monthly like I had been.  Where possible, I roll down strikes, because at this point I'm wanting to reduce my exposure, but I still make sure I make at least some money with each transaction.  I've obviously booked substantial losses, but (again, ask a financial advisor) my cash balance has gone up with almost every roll.  Plus, each time I get assigned shares, I have another opportunity to reopen the same or further out position for slight gains.  Margin interest eats into these transactional gains slightly, but not enough to cause a loss each time.\n\nMy life would definitely be easier if I wasn't doing this lol.  But at some point, things will turn around, even if it isn't this or next year.  As long as I can keep rolling puts, collecting even marginal premium in the process, and not getting margin called, it'll be worth it.  Quick side note, I'll likely not be paying income taxes this year given the losses I've booked, even though my income will still be positive.  Whenever things DO turn around though, I need to be prepared to realize A TON of gains as my options go from ITM to ATM/OTM.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "freakin legend...good luck and please stress test where implosion price is relative to sp...take care bro", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!

You have $15k in your account but you are only using $7500 of that money to write puts so you will be able to cover assignment.  Maybe I am still unclear on the strategy but you still have 50% of your capital available to bail you out if needed, which the broker would not define as naked I am pretty sure.  Going naked in my definition would be I am maxed on my shares (I have 15k and I already own 15k of stock on my account), but I have a margin account so I write another $15k in puts that would be on broker loan.\n\nMaybe I have the definition messed up because now I am confused myself.\n\nEDIT:  Okay so I was interested in this and looked it up.  Looks like we are both wrong but also correct at the same time.  A naked put is simply meaning you write a put without an associated short share position.  What you are doing is nothing more than a CSP, which in definition is a naked put.  So, yes, your strategy is sound and nothing more than doing something like the Wheel but with a stricter component of the DCF watchlist.  \n\nSee definition here:  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp\n\nCheck out Markus H on YouTube.  He does the Wheel almost strictly and has a lot of pretty decent guidelines on how to go about trading this.  He uses Interactive Brokers and trades this on margin.  It might be a good place to start and help you frame what you want to do.  His more recent videos are also exceptionally helpful because he is bagged really hard in RIDE right now and is discussing how to get out of that without having to take the loss.  Most of his positions though are what most would consider strong, stable companies.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/rockwelltrading2008", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for clarification.
