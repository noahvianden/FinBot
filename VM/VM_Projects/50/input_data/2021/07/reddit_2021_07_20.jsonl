Their engine is by far and away the best engine on the market, they take a 5% royalty cut instead of a flat fee like most engines so it is better for indie developers and AAA alike (assuming the AAA doesn't have their own engine), and the store cut is 15% vs. Steam's 30% and they waive their royalty cut if you go with their store and engine. Add on all of their cloud services and playerbase management tools that are completely free even if you don't use their engine or their store (though most will use both which they are betting on), and you have a one-stop-shop that is helping developers do a lot more than they could do on their own.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "There's an entire genre of garbage steam games. 50k is without context, there are tons without a dozen downloads I'd imagine.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Nah what I’m saying is that it was used as bait for a poop n scoop", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Apple is still priced higher than its worth.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’m bullish on only 2 companies and Apple is one of them so I’m biased haha", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good for you right now.
