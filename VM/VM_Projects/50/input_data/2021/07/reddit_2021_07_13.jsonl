{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 13, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**\n\nToday was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.\n\nThe Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.\n\nWhile the CPI print is not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n\nThis quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel’s “Black Widow”, which generated $80 million* in theater sales and $60 million* in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. \n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.\n* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. \n* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday’s prices. \n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.\n* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after \"a limited, targeted set of customers.\" The company went on to say the hack was “completely unrelated” to last year’s attack” and that the company was still “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers”. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Mizuho from $335 to $355 at Buy.

{"title": "SPCE Hypersonic plane", "selftext": "Jeff Bezos is trying to down play Sir Richard Branson & Virgin Galactic's outstanding performance traveling into outer space this past weekend. \n\nJeff Bezos is saying \"50 miles up is not outer space, but that 60 miles up is outer space.\" Meanwhile when Bezos goes up (which won't happen because he's afraid to even get an elevator) they'll be going to the same threshold between 50 and 60 miles. The average person traveling into space without proper conditioning, will not be able to handle anything past that. \n\nWhile Sir Richard Branson has always been well ahead in the game. The comments from bezos show he hasn't been able to get over it, with all the excitement and news Virgin Galactic has posted and received. \n\nVirgin Galactic's plane was designed for hypersonic speed. Hypersonic flight is coming. The idea of a nice jaunt into outer space for a joyride sounds fun, nevertheless soon people are going to be able to take hypersonic planes as a means of transportation anywhere in the world within two ~ four hours flight time. That's the goal. \n\nThere's also a big difference in the designs between all three space companies. Virgin Galactic is following the X aircraft design, specifically the Boeing X-20 Dyno. The other space companies are using old Apollo technology with a capsule perched a top a rocket that comes back through the upper atmosphere with parachutes deployed landing wherever the wind takes you. \n\nThe most important part of Virgin Galactic's hypersonic plane design is the feathering braking system that lets the plane float down through the atmosphere like a badminton birdie. The feathering system is based on Rutan's designs. The entire tail structure can rotate upward, giving the plane the ability to slow down and float like a feather as it re-enters the upper atmosphere. The plane then lands on a runway. I'll take the plane and land on a runway.", "id": "ojpr1n", "created_utc": 1626212632.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|22|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Old news as my socks", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "So wen moon?", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Question, is this hypersonic plane still gonna need a ride from a bigger plane.
