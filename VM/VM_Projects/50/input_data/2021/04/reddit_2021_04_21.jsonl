Well for one fund managers are bound by rules, companies interests and possibly wants to attract a lot of investors paying the fees for them to manage it all. For one thing you will never see a fund yolo his entire life savings into GME stock. You will never see a fund believing in Tesla from start to finish with their entire life savings etc. there are also going to be stock picks based on common sense, math, fundimentals more than someone just reading and liking a reddit post, retail traders/investors and finance professionals are living in 2 different worlds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond statistics that goes around endlessly - [80% of day traders lose money](https://www.curiousgnu.com/day-trading)\n\nEspecially on reddit this gets spinned to as ''80% of traders lose money'', but honestly there was nothing said about an average trader/investor. So if someone says that 80% of investors lose money, it is **false**\n\n'' Day trading is a form of speculation in securities in which a trader buys and sells a financial instrument within the same trading day, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. Traders who trade in this capacity are generally classified as speculators. Day trading contrasts with the long-term trades underlying buy and hold and value investing strategies. Day trading can be considered a form of gambling.\\[1\\]\\[2\\] It is made easier using day trading software.\\[3\\] ''\n\nHere is the definition from wiki. So unless you constantly decide to buy and sell the stocks in the same day, you are probably not a day trader.\n\nWhy do day traders lose money though ?

I think the reason people look to day traders is because they’re the easiest to define and find. Not to mention when you hear “stock trader,” the average person thinks of day trading. \n\n\nI think the general sentiment is “the more you trade the worse you do.” Hence day traders do the worst because they do the most amount of trading.

There are a few reasons why that is, and it has mostly to do with investor psychology.

Looking back, I wouldn't recommend it, but read it later when you have a more better grasp of the market. The main concept you need to remember from that book is the margin of safety. Investing is all about risk management. Every year since I've started investing, people predict that this year the market will crash, next year the market will crash but no one really knows. The main important thing you need to remember as an investor, TIME IN THE MARKET NOT TIMING THE MARKET. You'll have to distinguish early on whether you're an investor or a trader and stick with it. I'm not saying you can't be both, but learn the basics of each side first.
