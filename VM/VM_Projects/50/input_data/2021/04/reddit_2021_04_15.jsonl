{"title": "KemPharm ($KMPH) - THE SLEEPING GIANT", "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: I own 515,000 shares of KMPH @ \\~$9.50. Yes, that is \\~$5 million. You can check my profile for proof and I say with full confidence that I intend to hold this position indefinitely. I only ask that you read this report in its entirety before drawing your conclusions because **nothing about this company is as it seems.**\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**PART I - DILUTION, DEBT, DOUBT**\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nOn its surface, KemPharm looks particularly depressing. A casual glance at the KMPH chart will show you their stock price seems to know only one direction. Down.\n\nA deeper dive into their financial history doesn’t improve their outlook either. Dilution, debt, and doubt. The triple-Ds of woe that spell out doom for any company that dares to enter the biotech arena. Their earnings are dismal and their quarterly reports are depressing. Dreary forecasts and dreadful prospects detail a dismal decline of depleted reserves and desperate delusion.\n\nIn a word… dangerous.\n\nSo why would anyone invest in this company? Better yet, why would anyone spend a single moment of their valuable time researching this company when everything they need to know is right out there in the open? Had I looked at this company a few months ago I might have come to that exact conclusion...\n\nBut on March 3, 2021… everything changed.\n\n[**Meet Azstarys**](https://azstarys.com)\n\nAzstarys is KemPharm’s latest FDA-approved medication specifically formulated for the treatment of ADHD. A once daily pill of **serdexmethylphenidate** and **dexmethylphenidate**. This is undoubtably decent news but, despite the medication showing promising potential, this alone wasn’t enough to convince me to make my investment.\n\nThe first glimmer of potential that caught my eye appeared, like most things about this company, in the smallest of details. If you have ADHD as I do, you may have noticed that you’ve never heard of **SER**dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate, the more active isomer of methylphenidate, is in Focalin and Focalin XR but the **SER** is a new development.\n\nLooking deeper into Azstarys, I noted that SERdexmethylphenidate was described as a **prodrug**.\n\nAnd the only other ADHD med with that designation is **Vyvanse**.\n\nI was familiar with Vyvanse because it was my prescription prior to Focalin XR. But I wasn’t familiar of why it was called a prodrug so I decided to dig a little deeper.\n\n…and deeper…\n\n…and deeper…\n\n…and deeper…\n\n...until I found a thread...\n\nA thread that led me all the way back to the year 2006. A year where a man by the name of Dr. Travis Mickle made a rather important discovery.\n\n>“Prior to founding KemPharm, Dr. Mickle served as Director of Drug Discovery and CMC at New River Pharmaceuticals where he was the principal inventor of Vyvanse®, a prodrug of amphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Today, Vyvanse is the branded market share leader in the estimated $17 billion plus ADHD market. The success of Vyvanse along with a robust pipeline of prodrugs targeting ADHD, pain and thyroid dysfunctions, which Dr. Mickle was responsible for creating, led to New River Pharmaceuticals being acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals, PLC for $2.6 billion.”\n\nSource: [https://kempharm.com/team/](https://kempharm.com/team/)\n\nIn 2006, after tendering his resignation to New River Pharmaceuticals, the MickleMeister founded KemPharm with the sole intention of producing a plethora of prodrugs. Shortly after his departure, New River Pharmaceuticals was purchased by Shire for the bargain price of $2.6 billion. I say bargain because Vyvanse now generates around $2 billion dollars in revenue every single year.\n\nSubsequently, Shire was purchased by Takeda in 2019 for the slightly higher price of $62 billion but this information will come into play a little later.\n\n**So this begs the question; how did Vyvanse, a single ADHD medication, create such eye-watering returns on an, at the time, equally eye-watering $2.6 billion dollar investment?**\n\nThe answer, once again, is hidden in the itty bitty details. Vyvanse is a **prodrug** of dextroamphetamine known as **LIS**dexamfetamine. And here is where the pattern finally begins to align (after 800 words of backstory, damn).\n\nBasically, a prodrug is a modified version of a drug that attaches another molecule, a ligand in Azstarys’s case, that renders the active ingredient inert unless cleaved through your body's metabolic processes.\n\nIn summary, **it only work if you eat it.**\n\nThis has quite a few benefits. Not least of which is a longer duration as your body can only metabolize things so quickly due to the limitations of enzymatic action. This \"gating\" effect even has the potential to reduce side effects. **Essentially a prodrug can improve qualities of the base medication.**\n\nBut the more important distinction is that **you can patent it**.\n\nShire already had experience with ADHD medications. They’re flagship product Adderall XR had seen monumental success but was about to go off-patent. This would expose Shire to the profit-decimating world of generics and so they eyeballed Vyvanse, being the novel prodrug lisdexamfetamine, for its brand new patent. Considering Shire’s experienced sales team and established connections, converting Adderall users to Vyvanse would likely be as easy as informing doctor’s and pharmacies of Vyvanse’s improved qualities.\n\n**SO WHAT?!**\n\n“So what?” I hear you ask. Apples and oranges. That’s a different drug with a different company so what does it have to do with KemPharm and Azstarys? I promise you, all of this backstory was necessary to explain exactly why KemPharm has so much potential.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**PART II - CONTRACTS, CORIUM, CAPITAL**\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nAzstarys will be brought to market Summer 2021 through their partner company Corium Inc.\n\n[**Meet Corium**](https://corium.com)\n\nThe sales contract between the companies offers up to $590M in sales and regulatory milestone guarantees in addition to tiered royalty payments ranging from \\~9% to \\~25%. This contract was recently renegotiated from $468M to $590M with a new higher top-level royalty tier and the addition of 4 new sales milestones guarantees in exchange for $28M less on the upfront. All in all, a decent agreement. Not earth-shattering but probably good enough to keep KemPharm afloat for the foreseeable future.\n\n**But this still isn’t enough to warrant an investment.**\n\nGuarantees mean nothing unless the drug can sell. Sure, Azstarys is a prodrug but the performance of Vyvanse can’t guarantee the success of Azstarys especially considering that Corium doesn’t have the sales experience of Shire.\n\n**…but what if they did?**\n\n>“We all know that having the product is key, but you also have to have a team that can effectively ramp up the distribution in order to be a blockbuster. More than a decade ago, Vyvanse was picked up by Shire. Shire had an ‘ace team,’ led by **Perry Sternberg,** that did a superb job in commercialization.”\n\nSource: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera)\n\nThe current CEO of Corium is **Perry Sternberg**. The very same Perry Sternberg that spearheaded the commercialization of Vyvanse during his tenure at Shire. That alone raises an eyebrow but I invite you to go to Corium’s website and look at their “Leadership” page: [https://corium.com/leadership.html](https://corium.com/leadership.html)\n\nTell me if you can spot the pattern:\n\nRobyn Lynch, Head of Corporate Strategy - **Former Chief of Staff for U.S. Commercial Business and Neuroscience Division at Shire.**\n\nJohn Miller, CFO - **Former Head of Finance for Global Commercial at Shire.**\n\nJohn Neeley, Head of Market Access - **Former Head of Market Access at Shire.**\n\nJamie Spaeth, Head of HR - **Former Head of HR at Shire.**\n\nWhen I saw this I couldn't help but ask myself, \"Why the hell are all these former Shire heads now working at Corium?\"\n\nThe answer… **Gurnet Point Capital.**\n\n>Travis Mickle, CEO: \"Why are we co-hosting this event today with our partner Corium? We actually entered into a worldwide license with Gurnet Point Capital that was announced back in September of 2019. Corium is a GPC portfolio company, and they have been assigned the rights to commercialize this product for GPC and for KemPharm. \\[…\\] We're excited about this, because through our license process, to look for the right partner, certainly, at one point Shire would have made a lot of sense. Certainly, Takeda had their own agendas, and we are so fortunate that Perry and much of his team has landed at Corium and they've had the foresight to bring in a product like KP415. Certainly, this is the team that knows how to advance a product like this, and it's a very exciting opportunity.”\n\nSource: [kp415-market-opportunity-and-commercialization-strategy](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-market-opportunity-and-commercialization-strategy)\n\nOk... **so** **who is Gurnet Point Capital?**\n\n[**Meet Gurnet Point Capital**](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com)\n\nGurnet Point Capital (GPC) is a healthcare fund founded by **Ernesto Bertarelli**, former CEO of Serono.\n\n>“The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialization and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies. It is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole.  \n>  \n>Consistent with the amount of capital, time and energy that it dedicates, Gurnet Point Capital will generally seek to be, over time, the majority – or at least principal - investor in each of its companies.”\n\nSource: [https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about)\n\nIn late 2018 Gurnet Point Capital purchased Corium for a flat fee of $500 million. The former CEO, Peter Staple, was replaced with Perry Sternberg in April of 2019. But it wasn’t just Sternyburgy that came along for the ride. GPC made a point to acquire his entire team. **Specifically the team that made Vyvanse a commercial success.** So why did they feel the need to recruit this exact team from Shire?\n\nThe answer… **Azstarys.**\n\nObviously this has been a lot of information so let me try to summarize everything I’ve detailed so far:\n\n1. KemPharm looks ugly.\n2. KemPharm’s drug Azstarys approved on March 3, 2021.\n3. Azstarys is a prodrug.\n4. The only other ADHD prodrug is Vyvanse.\n5. Vyvanse was made by Travis Mickle.\n6. Travis Mickle is the CEO of KemPharm.\n7. Azstarys will be sold through a partnership with Corium.\n8. Corium is has the Shire team that sold Vyvanse.\n9. Corium is owned by Gurnet Point Capital.\n10. Gurnet Point Capital is owned by Ernesto Bertarelli.\n\nThe thread is long and winding but the details are out there in the open. You can look up and verify every single piece of information so far and I encourage you to do so and come to your own conclusions. But I assure you that all of this information was needed to understand this next part.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**PART III - MARKETS, MONEY, MATH**\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE PERSONAL OPINIONS —**\n\nWhat follows from this point on is my investment thesis and represents the reason why I decided to make a substantial investment into KemPharm. I want to be very clear that **this is not financial advice nor a recommendation that you should invest in this company. As always, do your own research.**\n\nWith that warning out of the way, let's talk about **the stock.**\n\nDuring KemPharm’s latest Earnings Call on March 11, 2021, Travis Mickle and team detailed the various changes that have taken place just in the past few months:\n\n1. Stock relisted on NASDAQ effective JAN 8, 2021.\n2. No debt as of FEB 8, 2021.\n3. $77M Cash on Hand as of MAR 10, 2021\n4. 28.3M Shares Outstanding as of MAR 10, 2021\n5. 38.6M Fully diluted shares as of MAR 10, 2021\n\nSource: [https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020)\n\nAll of these events occurred in Q1 and have led to considerable confusion across the internet in regards to the accuracy of information regarding KMPH. But taking these new developments into account, a very different picture begins to form in regards to KemPharm’s future.\n\nThe current stock price as of the very moment I’m writing this is $8.70.\n\nAssuming a full dilution of all 38.6M shares that gives a market cap of \\~$340M. Accounting for Cash on Hand, that means that \\~$260M of this company’s worth is attributed to Azstarys, Apadaz, their pipeline, their technology, and Dr. Mickle’s brain in a jar.\n\nNOTE: This doesn't account for cash due from converted warrants and approval guarantees which could net an additional \\~$80M and bring their CoH to \\~$150M. This will be clarified in the next ER.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, I asked myself 2 questions:\n\n1. What market share MUST Azstarys capture in order to sustain KemPharm’s operations for the foreseeable future?\n2. Will KemPharm be able to innovate with future products?\n\nTo answer the first question, I needed to gain a better understanding of the ADHD market as a whole. The \\~$18B industry currently has 21 existing treatments spread across 3 primary classes:\n\n1. Amphetamines\n2. Methylphenidates\n3. Non-stimulants\n\nThe current largest player in the field is Vyvanse at a whopping **13%** of the TOTAL market and **18%** of the stimulant category (class 1 & 2). Competitors like Focalin XR & Concerta comprise about **1%** each.\n\nSo we have some comparatives for market performance but I still prefer to take the pessimistic approach. My question is, what is the bare minimum performance required to simply **NOT GO BANKRUPT**.\n\nAccording to KemPharm they have a projected **Annual** **Cash Burn of \\~$4M** [**(source)**](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call)\n\nConsidering this and assuming a low-ball **10% royalty rate** (\\~8-25% potential) with only **5% of the potential $550M** in milestone guarantees received over a 10 year period, how much market size would Azstarys have to capture in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt in a **worst case scenario?**\n\n**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE NAPKIN MATH —**\n\n(operating expenses) = (total annual market)(required market share)(royalty rate) + ((milestone payments)(percent received))/(10 year period)\n\nx = required market share\n\n($4,000,000) = ($18,000,000,000)(x)(0.1) + (($550,000,000)(0.05))/(10)\n\n4,000,000 = 1,800,000,000x + 2,750,000\n\n1,250,000 = 1,800,000,000x\n\nx = 0.00069 = **0.069% required market share**\n\nThis obviously relies on guesswork and doesn’t account for things like CAGR, taxes, manufacturing costs, or inflation, so let’s make it even harder for KemPharm and **double the required market share.**\n\nSo in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt, assuming they sit on their ass and do nothing until the end of time, Azstarys needs just **0.14%** of the market or **$25.2M** in average annual sales over a 10 year period to earn an income of $4M. Obviously this ignores the scaling royalty rate and any further sales milestones but I prefer err on the side of caution when making wild, speculative assumptions. Helps to keep things in perspective.\n\nSo that's the bare minimum amount that Azstarys is allowed to suck before KemPharm implodes. Should Azstarys manage to perform on the same level as the lower competitors at around **1%**  you would certainly see a rise in KemPharm's stock price even with a below-average P/E ratio. And given their partner Corium's experience with the commercialization of Vyvanse there's very little reason to believe that this goal couldn't be achieved.\n\n**Furthermore,** **I believe that Azstarys will exceed it.**\n\nSource: [https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call)\n\nAdditional data: [https://kempharm.gcs-web.com/static-files/af3b9f16-a8f5-462d-80be-55266dccab75](https://kempharm.gcs-web.com/static-files/af3b9f16-a8f5-462d-80be-55266dccab75)\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**PART IV - ALL AHEAD AZSTARYS**\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n**It is my personal belief** that KemPharm has crossed the threshold of uncertainty and has secured the financial stability necessary to confidently pursue the development of exponentially more prodrugs.\n\n**I believe** that KemPharm's partner Corium has the ideal combination of experience and financial backing to optimize Azstarys's success.\n\n**I believe** that Azstarys offers unique benefits that will improve the quality of care for patients with ADHD, myself included.\n\n**I believe that KemPharm is** **extremely undervalued**.\n\nTo view KemPharm as a company in peril is simply a matter of outdated information. It seems to me that their value is hidden beneath layers of historical uncertainty and investor pessimism which makes it an excellent buying opportunity for those capable and willing to see its potential.\n\nThe arguments that Azstarys will fail to be competitive against its competitors or generics doesn’t hold water considering the fact that Azstarys **has** **no therapeutic equivalents** [**(source)**](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process) and is patented until 2037.\n\nAn additional point is that Azstarys was approved for all ages 6 and up [**(source)**](https://www.azstarys.com) instead of just 6-17 which was a surprise inclusion upon approval and serves to further expand the potential market.\n\nThe FDA also included a section in the label with clinical data suggesting that Azstarys has **reduced impedance of childhood growth and development** [**(Section 6.1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf). This particular issue is often cited as the primary complaint from parents of children with ADHD.\n\nCritics of Azstarys focus heavily on the obscurity of it’s potential duration **(the often referenced 30/13)** and consider the inclusion of a chart without this specific language on the label as sufficient cause for dismissal. To me, this argument comes from a place of ignorance and a severe lack of perspective. Yes, certain terms of the sales agreement are contingent on this specific language but this point has yet to be confirmed or denied.\n\nFurthermore this language's effect on actual sales is largely overestimated. All extended release products are long lasting by design but the key differentiating factor between Azstarys and its competitors is that it is, in fact, a prodrug. And as a prodrug its primary differentiation between it and other medications is the **smooth downward efficacy ramp** as the body metabolizes the medication at a consistent rate. [**(Section 12.3 Figure 1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf)\n\nTo put it plainly, other extended release products are equivalent to a **caffeine crash**. I know this because I experience it every single day.\n\nThe more interesting takeaway is that this medication’s formula and prodrug status allows it to differentiate from not just Methylphenidate products, **but from Vyvanse itself.**\n\nThe primary criticism for Vyvanse is its slow onset [**(Up to 1.5 Hours)**](https://www.psycom.net/vyvanse-lisdexamfetamine) but Azstarys is formulated with instant release dexmethylphenidate alongside serdexmethylphenidate for faster onset. **This opens up the possibility that Azstarys won’t just be competing for market share on the Methylphenidate side but may be able to cross over to the Amphetamine side and capture market share directly from Vyvanse.**\n\nAnd while I don’t assume that its performance will be equivalent to Vyvanse, it is impossible to ignore the potent combination of product and people at play. **Corium’s recruitment of the former Shire team has given Azstarys the best possible chance to succeed. Who better to have on your product's side than the very same people that made Vyvanse the leading ADHD medication in the business.**\n\nAnd as a final anecdote, I have already spoken to my doctor about Azstarys and we both agree that it will be my next medication. Not because I believe in the company or want to help with sales. But because I've tried just about every medication on the market and want the best treatment possible. **And Azstarys just seems better.**\n\nSo that just leaves one last question: can KemPharm continue to innovate?\n\nThe answer… **Travis Mickle.**\n\nWhile there is no data in the world that can anticipate the future actions of any one person, I have a gut feeling that there might just be some magic left in the old Mickster. I’ll end this overly long DD with a simple quote and leave it to you to decide for yourself:\n\n>“It is akin to the Golden Goose that will just keep laying golden egg after golden egg. Dr. Mickle has stated that ‘given sufficient funds, he doesn’t have enough life left, to develop all of the possibilities.’ This is perhaps the most valuable asset that KemPharm possesses.”\n\nSource: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera/)", "id": "mr4ur3", "created_utc": 1618450563.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "Believe it or not there is far more information about KemPharm that I could have included in this report but I felt that 3000 words was approaching the upper limit of most people's attention spans.

The benefits of a prodrug can be a debated but it’s extended duration, efficacy curve, and potential to reduce abuse IS significant especially in a class of drugs with high levels of abuse, as stimulants often are. \n\nLastly, the world of ADHD and the needs of patients are diverse and even moderate improvements in treatment options are significant.

{"title": "The most logical APHA/TLRY Merger Play that know one is talking about", "selftext": "Okay so long story short, merger date is coming up.  This may sound stupid but it’s actually the most logical play that know one is thinking or talking about. So TLRY is buying out APHA and therefore your APHA shares will convert to TLRY shares. TLRY is the bigger more valuable company. If you have 500 dollars in APHA it will be converted to TLRY regardless of the share price.  \n\nHere’s where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.\n\nIf the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.  \n\nOnce the merger happens those who have 💎👐’s will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.\n\nIf you still don’t get it, imagine TSLA buying out NKLA, you’d want NKLA to be as high as possible at the merger and TSLA as low as possible.\n\nI’ve been buying this APHA dip and ready to watch it rip while hoping to see TLRY plummet🚀🚀🚀🌕💎👐‘s", "id": "mr8al4", "created_utc": 1618464383.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 54, "comments": [{"body": "Wut", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Higher than a kite that one is", "score": 38, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tilray big,  aphria small.
