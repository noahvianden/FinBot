If the student files their taxes independently for 2020, they can use the Recovery Rebate Credit to get up to $1,200. Most students are also not eligible for the second stimulus check, so they can also use the credit next year to get $600.”\n\nMany of you guys, like me, are claimed as a dependent by your parents—even if you’re basically living on your own as a college student and file your taxes independently. This meant that when stimulus checks were sent out, you didn’t receive the $1,200 you so desperately wanted to throw at TSLA weeklies. **There’s a way that you can get what you deserve.**\n\nThe Rebate Recovery credit is a tax credit that you can claim if you were a dependent last season. You can file independently this year and claim up to $1,200. Remember this when you file this tax season. And, ya’ know, get back at Mitch a little.\n\nAlong with the $3,000 in losses you’re gonna claim anyways, you can now also claim the stimmy money this tax season. Now, you won’t be able to pay back that loan your dad gave you; but, throw your tax refund into enough GME calls, and you may be able to return your account to even.\n\n*Bookmark this post and when your W-2s come in, don’t forget the Recovery Rebate Credit when you file.*  \n\n\n**Read more:**\n\n[The Original News Article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wzzm13.com/amp/article/money/first-stimulus-payment-tax-claim/67-c48b059f-0457-4abe-b00d-3748a01cdf1f) \n\n[Stimulus check: How you'll claim missing money with the Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/stimulus-check-how-youll-claim-missing-money-with-the-recovery-rebate-credit/)\n\n[Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit)  \n\n\n**TL;DR** *If you were claimed as a dependent last year on your parents taxes, you can claim up to $1,200 for not getting the stimulus when you file taxes this year, if you file independently.

{"title": "MOVIE THEATERS ON MARS?! (DD) 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "What up you gay nerds. Here's 4 reasons why movie theaters will NOT go bankrupt and why they will rebound by March 2021. (DD)\n\n1) Stock offerings. These are bound to happen. Movie theaters have been among the companies hit the hardest during this global pandemic and raising money through stock offerings are not unique to movie theaters. However, I can tell you, as a veteran of the stock market, stock offerings of this volume are NOT an action taken by companies about to go bankrupt. It is merely to stay afloat. They know that positive news is coming, and those who benefit are those who don't bearishly think bankruptcy is an option for a powerhouse movie theater brands. Don't shell out your hard-earned $5 on RH gold to read bullshit from bear-cuck analysts like Morningstar and buy shares instead. Thank me later.  \n \n\n2) Adaptation. We are adapting to this pandemic. We now understand COVID-19 to be a droplet-transmissible disease that can be prevented by wearing a mask and taking basic precautions like washing your hands before eating/touching your mucous membranes. As a hospital administrator, I work with both friends and family who work intimately with COVID positive patients for HOURS in the ICU and ED and none of them have contracted it... why? Because PPE WORKS! (goddamnit anti-maskers). When Biden steps into office, you will immediately see a rise in movie theater stocks, as they are often the first to rebound because we all understand it's upward potential. In the next month, as the highest at risk (elderly/those with predisposed symptoms) receive their second dose of vaccinations, we will see a declining number of severe cases, leading to a sharp decrease in ICU hospitalizations. This news will be good for movie theaters. As the general public receives the vaccine, we will see public confidence returning and many will return to the theaters (with masks of course).  \n \n\n3) Demand. We've all been stuck inside for almost a year, watching the same Netflix shows as our parents. Fun fact: Movie theaters BOOMED in the 30s post-Spanish flu, because humans have an inherent need to watch flicks on the big screen. Think of all you retard autists and how you're going to try and spit game after a year of staying in. Fuck that. Take your date to the theaters and talk about something relatable besides that you gained 20 pounds ordering from Uber Eats every day for the past year.  \n \n\n4) AM\\*+ (Yes, A\\*C+ is the rebrand of \\_\\_\\_ premier, the streaming service for \\*MC and it is a critical reason for why they will stay in business and thrive.) The Walking Dead Season 10 is out by the way (surprisingly good, considering they killed off most of the OG cast). Subscription goes for $8.99 a month and counts estimate over 1 million new subscribers in 2020. Do the math and expect this to bolster stock price at the next earning report.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Those who buy in now to movie theater stocks should see 100-200% gains by Spring 2021.
