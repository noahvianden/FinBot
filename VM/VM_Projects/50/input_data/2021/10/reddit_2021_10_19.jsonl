{"title": "WSJ: ‘Crazy’ Bets on $200 Oil Invade the Options Market", "selftext": "**Link to Article:**  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/crazy-bets-on-200-oil-invade-the-options-market-11634463002?mod=Searchresults\\_pos2&page=1#comments\\_sector](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crazy-bets-on-200-oil-invade-the-options-market-11634463002?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=1#comments_sector)\n\n# First and Foremost:  With a Wall Street Journal Article that starts with \"Crazy Bets\"... how this hasn't already been opined upon by the WSB community is beyond me.  BUT, here we go!...\n\nBefore I get into the topic of **\"What's the best way to play this?,\"** I'll begin with **The GIF that Keeps on Giving** (**MRO is up over 40%** since I first posted this gif and began writing on MRO and the current state of the Oil & Gas Industry in September 2021...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NIC CAGE is Hammering the NITRO Button on the MRO Shelby Cobra](https://i.redd.it/oad32156qgu71.gif)\n\n[Sex or MRO....Why not both?  Simmer on that. ](https://i.redd.it/0ln2vf1hqgu71.gif)\n\n# Traders are betting on $200 Oil by the end of 2022???\n\nThey must be nuts right?  Maybe they are, but maybe they aren't.  I personally think that $200/barrel oil seems pretty darn high, but as other recent news articles have stated, **\"Current natural gas prices in Europe are equivalent to $200/barrel oil.\"**  Given that the Natural Gas crunch is actually helping fuel Oil demand, paired with disciplined production across the board by OPEC+ and US Oil & Gas, **maybe these \"Crazy Bets\" aren't so crazy.** \n\n# So What's the Best Way to Play the Oil and Gas Price Boom?\n\nSome might argue to invest in a fund/stock that tracks the overall spot price of oil like USO/UCO or a similar natural gas fund like UNL/UNG.  However, I personally feel that a much better, more-profitable AND safer play would be to invest in an efficient and well run US Oil & Gas company, with my personal favorite being (you guessed it)... **MRO.**  I will get to why MRO is my favorite in a minute but I want to focus first on why a solid US Oil & Gas equity would be the best play.\n\nWe are already at $80/barrel which a lot of people thought was practically impossible no less that 6 months ago.  NOW, the majority of traders and industry analysts are predicting $80, $90 or over $100/barrel by the end of the year with very few (if any) calling for any type of sharp decline.  So given that **both Oil and Natural Gas are at multi-year highs**, even if prices stay flat or even retreat a bit, efficient Oil & Gas companies are set to produce mountains of free cash flow.  **Let me repeat that...**\n\n**Well run Oil & Gas Companies don't need any increase in commodity prices to be incredibly profitable. Even though there are numerous indicators for higher oil and gas prices, this would simply be pouring gravy on top of the gravy train.**  Piling on top of what Nic Cage says in the memes above, I will outline why I think MRO is the best way to play the boom.  However, there are other good choices out there including the 800 lb and 1,000 pound gorilla's like Exxon/XOM and Chevron/CVX (MRO has out paced both of them by over 2:1 since I began writing about the changing market conditions in September).  So again, my favorite is MRO is my favorite to outperform a sector that is going to absolutely crush but you can make your own decision. \n\n# So... Why MRO?\n\n **MRO**\n\n* **MRO has a 50/50 oil and gas production split: With both prices at multi-year highs, they are going to make a killing** (and pass the cash to their shareholders, see below)\n* MRO has committed 40% of Free Cash Flow to **Stock Buy-Backs = Over $1 Billion for Q4-2021**  \n\n   * **When they pull the trigger on the buy-backs, the institutional investors will pour in**\n   * That's currently 10% of their Market Cap, this will have a huge impact on the stock price\n* **MRO breakeven is below $35/barrel** (one of the lowest in the industry)  \n\n   * Bank of American and Goldman Sachs are predicting $80-100/barrel by end of 2021\n* MRO paid down $1.4 Billion in long-term debt in Q1/Q2 of 2021\n* MRO is the smallest Oil Company in the S&P 500 (but not a Micro Cap that could be acquired easily)\n* **MRO is up over 300% from October 2020**\n* **Position:** I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase given that there will be volatility in the market over the next few months and the exact timing is difficult to predict. But if you have options that you feel good about, please share in the comments\n* **\\*\\*Bonus** \\- There have been multiple people who've reached out to me to thank me as they've made substantial profits based on my postings and analysis.  Thank you to everyone for their kind words and happy trading.  I'm enjoying the hell out of the ride and I hope that you are too, cheers. \n\n**Here is additional Support/Analysis on why MRO is just getting started:**\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q22m4a/marathon\\_oil\\_stock\\_mro\\_it\\_just\\_keeps\\_getting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q22m4a/marathon_oil_stock_mro_it_just_keeps_getting/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Opinion and Commentary on the Oil and Gas Market:**\n\nI continue to hear \"fake truths\" or opinions that are simply wrong on the current state of Oil & Gas Equities (and the state of the industry in general), so I will address the top ones here before I get into what I think is the best way to play the Oil & Gas Boom:\n\n* **False**: \"This is just another fake energy crisis/supply-crunch\"\n   * **Truth:** This supply crunch is very real, just read look at what's happening already in Europe.\n* **False:** \"Oil is going to plummet once OPEC or the US is pressured into cranking up production.\"\n   * **True (OPEC):** OPEC nations and their economies are almost entirely dependent on oil production and they are currently experiencing record profits and revenue. There is no logical reason for them to want or work towards anything below $80/barrel. They have shown true solidarity throughout 2021 in their discipled production cuts and they are all reaping the rewards now.\n   * **True (US):** Shareholders are holding Oil & Gas company CEOs accountable to provide generous returns and profits which requires disciplined capital expenditures and controlled production.  This has remained true even with multi-year high commodity prices\n* **False:** \"The Biden administration hates oil, so everyone is going to be driving electric vehicles by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (insert magical date here) and oil demand will vanish\".\n   * **Truth:** The President of the United States actually has very little control on the global price of oil. A prime example of this was the recent pleads from the US for OPEC to increase supply. There response was a very swift, \"NO\", and they have not added any additional supply on top of their scheduled monthly increases that were decided on in early summer of 2021.\n* **So if you believe in any or all of the \"false truths\" listed above, by all means, please sit on the sidelines while I and others invest in oil and gas companies (like MRO) who are positioned to straight-up pillage their way through what will surely be a long and painful transition to \"green\"/renewable energy.**\n   * **For the rest of us, there is serious money to be made in Oil & Gas Stocks**\n\n**Final Word:**\n\n**For those WSB folks out there who might think that I'm being redundant in my postings on MRO...**\n\n# MRO is up over 40% since I began posting on MRO (and Oil/Gas in general) in September 2021.\n\n**\\*\\*I will continue to post articles and fact-based analysis that strengthens this thesis because there are still a lot of people who don't understand this fundamental market shift and/or haven't seen any of my other postings or other related news that articulates this.

{"title": "Why you should sell AMD short", "selftext": "AMDs stock has been a hot commodity these last few months with great earnings, even better guidance, and a strong likelihood that their acquisition of Xilinx will be completed by the end of the calendar year. So why should you sell AMD short? I'll tell you why:\n\n* The acquisition deal states that Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share they own. At close today AMD's shareprice was 116.33 and Xilinx was at 170.24. In order for the share prices to be effectively equal at the time of acquisition AMDs shareprice would have to drop to 98.78, or a bit more than 15% lower than the current share price.\n\n* Most shareholders are assuming the acquisition will be successful, and the anticipation of the merger's completion is artifically inflating the stock despite the fact the merger will have no immediate financial gain, especially since short sellers have been unable to properly arbitrate AMD/XLNX shares.\n\n* The chip shortage is not ending soon. It seems like every time I look it is expected to end later than before. Last estimate I heard was June. That's a long time for AMDs sales to remain below what they have the potential to be.\n\n* Finally and most importantly, you should sell AMD short because recent stocks have been doing the opposite of what WSB sentiment and positions currently are, and if you retards help AMD to rocket then that would really help my calls.\n\nPositions: 3 11/19 100C, 2 6/17/22 90C", "id": "qbnf7i", "created_utc": 1634684945.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "Don’t have the balls to sell anything short.", "score": 46, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nice try Citadel", "score": 45, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just buy Xilinx if you betting on acquisition to go through", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sounds like something a 🌈🐻 would say 🤔", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tell everyone to sell short while holding dtm calls clearly doesn’t believe what he’s saying", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Sarcasm doesn’t work when the sub strives on the purest forms of autism", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "I was going for sarcasm but I guess it was too subtle.
