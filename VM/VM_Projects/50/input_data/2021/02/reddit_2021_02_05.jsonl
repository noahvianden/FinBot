High frequency traders (Citadel, Two Sigma, Jane St) have probably made a shit ton of money in the past few weeks even as firms like Melvin have been driven into the ground.  Why?  **Because they frontrun every damn order that gets piped to them,** making prices move against you and they net the profit.  They do it in milliseconds (so unless you can pay millions to park your server next to the NASDAQ order matching engine like they can you're fucked).  There are far better ppl than me to educate you on frontrunning - see Michael Lewis' [Flash Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys) (or this [TLDR](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/ep19-how-high-frequency-trading-works-a-summary-of-michael-lewis-book/) or [read](https://www.nyujlb.org/single-post/2017/11/27/high-frequency-trading-electronic-frontrunning-and-structural-insider-trading-under-the-e) about why this shit is banned in Europe).\n\nThe bottom line is that they make more money when there is more trading volume (and they accelerate price movements).  **It should be ILLEGAL.**  (Another thing the SEC seems to not give a fuck about - especially when HFTs offers former SEC officials jobs where they don't have to do shit except swim around in money).

Let‚Äôs forget all of that though and say it‚Äôs negligible completely as a percent of a trade.  Well then, now you look at the vol that retail traders are blamed for- the true culprit of that are HFTs who make a single order into 2 (or more) orders and cause price swings to accelerate.  Even if they only make the price move a tenth of a cent, if they do that for lots of traders trying to trade around the same time then they create much bigger price movements.  And then you‚Äôre getting fucked not because they frontran (idk if that‚Äôs a word) your specific orders but because they artificially inflated volume making prices move away from you faster.

That‚Äôs a pretty apples and oranges comparison because 1) frontrunning is not trading (because HFTs know how prices will move) and 2) equities revenue is made up of a lot of different things.  Goldman Sachs for example could have just bet a stock goes up over a six month period (that‚Äôs equities revenue too but not really comparable to frontrunning revenue).  \n\nIn fact, Matt Levine doesn‚Äôt even make his own point well- if his point is valid shouldn‚Äôt the money HFTs are making cut into the amounts that the traditional market makers are making?  Instead, JPM and GS are still making 4.8 and 2.6 B and now Knight and Virtu make 600+ million each on top of that- so the Street is making more money in aggregate.  A more thoughtful argument would have been to show that an increase in HFT revenue decreases equities revenues (which would work if that equity revenue is mostly from market making).

In 2019 the 737 MAX was grounded and in 2020 the pandemic saw a massive slowdown in revenue for Boeing. The stock went from $446 to about $350 when the 737 was grounded, to a low of $89 in March because of the pandemic, and is now trading at around $210.\n\nAs the vaccine rolls out, and the 737 being approved for service, I think Boeing is one of the last great covid recovery plays and I think we will definitely see a reversal of their fortune in the long term, with great short term potential as well.\n\nOperating as a duopoly with Airbus, Boeing has an exemplary economic moat and has years of backlog that will provide some good revenue. They have a history of providing military aircraft to the US and abroad. They are not going anywhere, regardless of the potential dropoff in civilian air traffic.\n\nThey've found strong support at this current level, and I think this is the start of the climb back to their pre covid/pre 737 price. Wouldn't be surprised if it is flirting with $500-600 in the next couple of years. \n\nI have no positions, I'm taking a break from the markets and the stresses involved with it.
