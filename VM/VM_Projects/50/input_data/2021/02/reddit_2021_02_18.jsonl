{"title": "UAVS in now a once in a lifetime play", "selftext": "UPDATE: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ageagle-aerial-systems-responds-false-130500072.html\n\n+25% premarket. Still time to enter\n\nMost of you who are reading this have probably never heard of the American drone company AgEagle Aerial Systems (ticker $UAVS) and a few of you probably have. I have been following the company for over a year and will give you the scoop of what’s going on:\n\nBackground on the company: UAVS specializes in agricultural mapping and has recently shifted to the drone package delivery sector (see recent partnership with Valqari , a company which specializes in drone delivery solutions): [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109196/0/en/AgEagle-Aerial-Systems-Partners-with-Valqari-to-Manufacture-Drone-Delivery-Stations.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109196/0/en/AgEagle-Aerial-Systems-Partners-with-Valqari-to-Manufacture-Drone-Delivery-Stations.html)\n\nThis partnership with Valqiri along with a partnership with “major e-commerce” platform that they cannot disclose due to an NDA has led to UAVS running up from $2 to an ATH of $17.68 in the span of 6 months.\n\n**Now for the REALLY juicy part.** Today a ragtag short activist by the name of Bonita Research released a hit piece on the company with some blatantly false information which caused uninformed investors to panic sell **causing $UAVS fall of 40% in an hour**. Here is a link to the hit piece which I will debunk below : [https://www.bonitasresearch.com/](https://www.bonitasresearch.com/)\n\n**background on:** Bonitas Research is a 'short activist' who frequently posts bogus short attack pieces and invokes the first amendment whenever they are sued by the companies they attack for their absurd claims.\n\n**Debunking their report:**\n\nFor starters they begin the report by listing UAVS on the COMPLETELY WRONG EXCHANGE (NASDAQ instead of NYSE). They then go on to accuse the company of being a pump and dump with the catalyst being an unofficial YouTube video that supposedly HINTED at a partnership between UAVS and Amazon. THIS OCCURED 10 MONTHS AGO. Yes you read that correctly. They then go on to say “we have found no evidence of any major e-commerce customer or drone technology credited to AgEagle”. **However you can explicitly find evidence of the major ecommerce partnership in the SEC filings of AgEagle:**\n\n\\*\\*\"\\*\\*In the third quarter of 2019, AgEagle announced that it had begun to actively pursue expansion opportunities within the emerging Drone Logistics and Transportation market and revealed that it had received its first purchase orders from a major ecommerce company to manufacture and assemble UAVs designed to meet the critical specifications for drones that are meant to carry packaged goods in urban and suburban areas\"\n\nSource (From AgEagle's 10-Q filed 11/13/20): [https://sec.report/Document/0001575705-20-000242/](https://sec.report/Document/0001575705-20-000242/)\n\nThis major ecommerce partnership extends well into 2021 for reference and they have seen immense growth since the partnership.\n\nThe Bonitas hit piece reads like it was written by a fifth grader who just discovered WSB but it has caused uninformed investors to panic sell. As soon as these claims are addressed by AgEagle (most likely today) and when others who are privy to the company call out the 'report' (if you can even call it that) for its BS, those who panic sold will get right back in. It is already climbing back up after AH (+**3.57%** at the time of this post) and I don't see it going back down to the extent that it has in the future. I don't post here often but I view this as a literal once in a lifetime opportunity given the nature of the situation. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.
