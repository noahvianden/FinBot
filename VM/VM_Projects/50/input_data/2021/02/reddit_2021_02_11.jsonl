Nevertheless, this is my watchlist for the open today:\n\n1. **$RCMT (RCM Technologies) -** This is the leading gapper and I wasn't particularly interested until very recently when we saw a massive rip up. With setups like this, I'll be looking for a break over the premarket high which is currently $9.16. Catalyst here still seems to be the news of Thermal Kinetics being awarded a clean fuels ethanol project which was announced before market close yesterday.\n2. **$SNDL (Sundial Growers) -** There has been a lot of talk about this stock for a while now and it has moved a lot in AH/PM sessions. That said, the float is too high for me and I suspect it is more a stock for swing trading than day trading right now.\n3. **$CLSN (Celsion Corp) -** Whilst I really like the setup here, there is a huge float here and it is very easily shorted which makes me a little nervous. There appears to be some upwards support here which I like and it is sitting nicely above the VWAP. It's another COVID related catalyst.\n\nOther stocks I'll be watching: ACIU, MNPR, CTRM, RIOT\n\nAs a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.\n\nHave a good day.\n\n\\-Rep", "id": "lhlgl7", "created_utc": 1613052764.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "Ok.

Tesla's cast parts are up to 100 kg (!).\n- The reason Tesla can do this is that they share metallurgy research with SpaceX and invented a new aluminum alloy that enabled such large cast parts.\n- Tesla achieved a quantum leap in this technology. Tesla has patented the new alloy and owns exclusive rights to it.\n- Durability of this new alloy should be better than that of steel frames, due to no rusting of aluminum. It's essentially a corrosion-resistant alloy where a thin oxide layer protects the rest of the metal. (This is generally true of most aluminum alloys.) It wouldn't surprise me if these cast parts were more durable in the long run: no welds, no screws - a single, robust monolithic block.\n- Aluminum frames are harder to repair than steel frames - and this process started in the 90s an German carmakers started using more and more aluminum in the frames of luxury cars due to the weight & corrosion protection advantages.\n- If damage in a crash reaches the frame, aluminum frame cars are likely totaled - but this property of aluminum isn't unique to Tesla and it's not a big issue in practice: the most common damage are fender-benders, which don't reach the frame. In bigger crashes the airbags likely deploy which ruins a lot of the interior and puts the car halfway to getting totaled already.

I can look at the badge on the machine, find the manufacturer and order me one of these machines, right?  So...how is Tesla revolutionary here other then the fact that most people don't see or pay attention to what other manufacturers are doing?  It seems that when Tesla gets a new robot, the place goes wild, watch any other Honda Manufacturing video on youtube, and you'll see that robots run these places, it's not just tesla.  I actually feel tesla is at a disadvantage in this sense because they don't have the experience to make the robot / factory workflow happen quickly compared to a company like Honda, who's been doing it for 30+ years.\n\nIf this casting breaks, do you replace half the car, or how does that work?

{"title": "Thoughts on $CME - potentially undervalued?", "selftext": "I was on clubhouse and someone mentioned $CME as a potentially big opportunity. I did some research and agree that this could be a big win. Here are my thoughts .  \n\n\nThe CME Group ($CME) is a U.S. based global market company whose subsidiaries include; Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, The Commodity Exchange, as well a 24.4% stake in the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.  \n\n\nYesterday the bears had a field day with $CME resulting in nearly a ten-point drop from the previous days high. The 3.5% drop put the price at $185.20 as of the markets close; this is despite a surprise increase in earnings and a marginal decrease in year over year.   \n\n\n$CME is currently trading 40 points below its 225 high last February and has a market cap of $66B. However, the company's total assets exceed $117B ($35B more than the previous year) and shareholder equity is approximately 40% of the current market price at $26B.  \n\n\nThis alone is enough for me to believe that the stock is undervalued. By comparison, $AMZN's asset to market cap comes in at 13.55% and their shareholders equity is a mere 5.6%.  \n\n\nThis analysis is strictly quantitative and doesn't account for some very important qualitative aspects that could be cause the stock to rally. ¬†  \n\n\nAs many of you degenerates already know the CME group has created some exciting new futures and options that I cannot mention here but feel free to google it!  \n\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the massive $1.9T stimulus that is slated to make its way to the people over the coming weeks and months. As we have already seen from the previous covid stimulus payments - there will be a significant increase in retail investment more specifically an increase in options and futures trading and $CBE will probably be a major beneficiary due to it\\&#039;s subsidiaries.  \n\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is a great opportunity for us .
