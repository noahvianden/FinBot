{"title": "A treatise on the decline of western civilization and dollars; why long bonds r fuk.", "selftext": "Tl;dr between inflation, historically low rates, a potentially overheating market, ostensibly a bond bubble, I believe long bonds r fuk, and how to trade this for fun and profit.\n\n**Inflation**:\n\nQE has been going on the better part of the last 12 years, another round of stimmys are set to go out soon, and there is an assload of money pouring into stocks, bonds, 'digital assets', metals, and other asset classes. There is enough money flying around to jack these all up, and I categorically think the 2% inflation number derived from CPI etc are total horse shit. CPI is a lagging indicator, and with half the dollars ever made being in the last like 2 years it‚Äôs all looking pretty inflationary. When the rubber meets the road and the velocity of money actually starts in the real economy, it‚Äôs gonna look far worse. I also believe that QE is trickle down economics by another name, but this isn‚Äôt a dead-kennedysian punk rock manifesto.\n\nThat said, inflation is a pressure on a number of asset classes, one of which is bonds, and their yields, if the gov is selling bonds, and the buyer believes the currency is being debased, they are gonna want more yield.\n\n**Rates**:\n\nRates r low as fuk. They have been really low since 2008, and they got lower in the last year, though they appear to be edging up. Yes, this is to keep the economy going with cheap money, and it‚Äôs MMT, and Japan and ECB did it. But there has been a great deal of criticism of it, and I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs sustainable, and this mixed with inflationary pressure also puts the dollar in a precarious spot where it‚Äôs falling out of favor as being a primary international currency of choice, at least there are rumors, and likely pressures on JPow and Yellen about this.\n\nMany people, far smarter than I (which isn‚Äôt saying much) think that the market is on a melt up, and one way to perhaps contain this fire is to raise rates to get a little money out of the market in a delicate way. They have been doing this gingerly, and so far successfully as the market hasn‚Äôt gone full panic despite what I believe to be a market in the final stages of a melt up due to the cheap money. I think JPow et al realize that things are pretty fucking precarious, and properly adjusting rates is playing with TNT.\n\n**Bond Bubble**:\n\nA bunch of smart people are saying there is bond bubble, I agree. But the point of this section is that I sorta doubt it‚Äôs an explosive pop. I have yet to find any historical precedent that is well researched of a government bond bubble pop (not finding much on the one in the 40‚Äôs of US treasuries), but it may have happened. So basically it exists, but it‚Äôs not, on it‚Äôs own, seemingly likely to be a case where you wake up and things are fucking flying. Not like dot com, 2008, beanie babies, or grey market japanese used panties craze of 2005.\n\nThen again, maybe there aren‚Äôt as many speculators on bonds as there were in the other things. Bonds aren‚Äôt sexy. Maybe the money in bonds isn‚Äôt as stupid and doesn‚Äôt panic and blow shit up the way the others do.\n\n**The concerns for my thesis:**\n\nTiming rates is over my pay grade. I‚Äôm not a bond trader, I never was a bond trader, and aside from econ in college and some study materials for the series 7, I know fuck all about bonds in a practical sense.\n\nIf the equity bubble (maybe there is one, maybe not) pops first, there may be a flight to safety in gov back securities which causes them to be bid up and thus not plummet if there is sufficient demand.\n\nThe Fed may go more ham with QE, and buy more long dated stuff, and also try to go full on yield curve control.\n\nFolks have said there was a bond bubble since at least 2017.\n\nSo, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe QE and Modern Monetary Theory are right, maybe there isn‚Äôt a bubble, and rates can stay low forever, and I really am as handsome as my mom says.\n\n**Profit & Fun**\n\nSo, if I‚Äôm right, and please tell me if I‚Äôm not, cause I appreciate input from the autists, there are different ways to trade this.\n\nThe ways that are resonating with me are TLT puts, and TBT / TMV calls. TBT and ~~TMNT~~ TMV have pretty low internal expense ratios and aren‚Äôt meant to degrade the same way more exotic stuff is , so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the same sort of retardation that comes with people looking backwards at a chart of VXX and thinking it‚Äôll go to 2million a share. Plus with all 3 of these, you can do options, and as a degenerate gambler that‚Äôs appealing to me.\n\nI‚Äôve been in this trade for about 2 weeks now, long dated puts and calls, mostly LEAP calls on TBT at various strike prices under 30, and I have about 60k in it now, so it‚Äôs pretty yolo-esque for a poor like me. So far, it‚Äôs been pretty rad. My contracts are up between 5% and 20%, and have gone up during the last week of what‚Äôs been red for the bulk of my portfolio. ***Position is here***\n\nSorry, no charts cause I‚Äôm colorblind, and I don‚Äôt want to field questions about why the uptrend is purple and the down line is burnt sienna, and it‚Äôs not longer cause my ADHD is kicking in, and wellbutrin that I'm on isn‚Äôt as effective as adderall.\n\n*I realized I left out something important for those even less familiar with bonds than myself. If rates go up, value goes down. So effectively the bet is to short bonds cause rates are gonna go up.\\**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Not that I need footnotes, but I've been reading pretty heavily from Jeremey Grantham, Michael Burry, Cathie Wood, Jeffrey Gundlach, et al.

{"title": "Why \"inflation hawk\" expectations are out to lunch", "selftext": "I've been heavily sighing at a lot of posts and news articles lately. Particularly at people crowing about Burry and inflation. Here's a quick explanation of why they are wrong, and why Powell is right, despite other central bankers worrying right now. \n\nInflation is one of the most misunderstood things in economics. Also, Burry is out to lunch on this one. Inflation is not a problem, and won't be for at least the rest of this year, likely longer. \n\nFor starters, asset prices and bond yields are only tangentially connected to inflation. Yields most directly, because they tend to reflect expectations - which, in the current environment, with yields rising from essentially zero, just means \"not deflation\" as opposed to \"runaway inflation.\" Powell's comments yesterday were 100% correct on that account - the only reason other central banks are a little concerned is that a rebound in US yields will drive up EM borrowing costs, and a rebound in the global economy will drive up capital flows to non-US markets, leading to inflation \\*elsewhere\\* (we are a flight to safe haven, relatively speaking).\n\nEven further - US asset prices have relatively little to do with inflation these days, largely because of the relatively open international economy. Stock prices *right now*, in particular, are purely due to there being relatively few places to park money despite a broadly *deflationary* global economy over the past 12-18 months. The retail trading spike is part of it, too, as is international money being parked in the US to hedge against currency risk - again, because we are the reserve currency and a flight to safety. \n\nWhat we are witnessing is a slightly weird, but fairly predictable rebalancing. Major investors are moving out of US tech sectors that are overvalued and heavily weighted in both QQQ and SPY. They are moving into beaten-down industrials (e.g. Alcoa, Oil stocks, transports), consumer discretionary (e.g. restaurants, beverages, hotels, *actual* casinos), and emerging market stocks. \n\nTL;DR: It's fine to expect some inflationary pressures in non-US markets moving forward, but US markets are relatively insulated due to how the open economy functions given the US Dollar is the reserve currency. \n\nSource: I have extensive graduate training in economic policy.
