Although they might end up delaying it a fair bit now, on the order page it just says \"In 2022\" instead of \"In late 2021\", some articles have said early 2022, but Tesla might have changed priorities with the Cybertruck and Giga Austin. The quotes I've seen on articles is this one from 2020 Q4 earnings they said,\n\n>“If we get lucky, we will be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to begin in 2022,”\n\nAnd this, during the 2021 Q2 call,\n\n>“We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.“\n\nIf Cybertruck changed priority from first vehicle made in Austin to after the Model Y, it might actually push it back to end of 2022, like for Giga Shanghai Model Y was delivered in Jan 2021 while Model 3 started delivers a full year earlier in Jan 2020.\n\nWho knows why they changed it around and put the Model Y first, maybe there's just been huge Model Y demand. Model Y might also be easier to start out with, it's well figured out since it's based on Model 3. A brand new factory making a brand new car must be very difficult, a brand new factory doing the exact same thing as their other factories must be a lot easier. It could also have been a good opportunity to take some more development time on the Cybertruck.\n\nI hadn't seen this, but apparently they're adding rear-wheel steering?\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1411172276188319745?s=20](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1411172276188319745?s=20)\n\nIn addition to no door handles and no side mirrors!\n\nTesla won't be the first to launch a car without side mirrors, which imo is a bit of a relief that they don't have to deal with the regulatory hell. Mercedes-Benz started doing it on trucks last year, and Audi e-Tron also has a virtual mirror option in Europe,\n\n[https://www.caradvice.com.au/890053/the-audi-e-trons-unusual-side-mirrors-could-soon-appear-on-more-cars/](https://www.caradvice.com.au/890053/the-audi-e-trons-unusual-side-mirrors-could-soon-appear-on-more-cars/)\n\nNo side mirrors dramatically improves the aerodynamic shape and improves the range by [2-5%](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321865933_Effect_of_Size_and_Shape_of_Side_Mirrors_on_the_Drag_of_a_Personal_Vehicle), so just removing them can make a 500 mile range 525 miles. They could also just be buying time for the US to allow it, NHTSA is in the middle of doing an investigation and have been looking into it since 2019,\n\n[https://www.freightwaves.com/news/dot-investigating-safety-of-camera-based-rearview-mirrors](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/dot-investigating-safety-of-camera-based-rearview-mirrors)\n\nI think it's a near guarantee it will become allowed because the trucking industry really wants it, not only for improved aerodynamics and efficiency, but apparently lower maintenance as well from that Freightwaves article,\n\n>“Using these figures, a \\[commercial motor vehicle\\] owner may spend $100-$200 twice per year repairing mirror issues (not including the price of parts).”\n\nSo overall Tesla maybe decided to play it safe with Austin and do the Model Y first, while also not rushing the Cybertruck, so they have time to add all the sci-fi features they want to it. It looks like they really want it to be good (which is a good sign imo).", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "We’re expecting better margins for Model Y at first right?  \n\nTesla needs to get the CyberTruck right.

Several comments:\n\n>  it might actually push it back to end of 2022\n\nAt Giga Texas they finished pouring the footings for the Cybertruck Gigapress area around the end of June. Many sources say that the normal time for curing the concrete is 28 days, however they started installing the vertical concrete columns much sooner than the end of July - maybe about 2 weeks earlier or more. The consensus appears to be that they used used special higher strength concrete for these footings that reaches acceptable strength much sooner than the standard concrete. Going to this additional expense appears to indicate that Tesla is pushing the Cybertruck timeline hard, so I would be very surprised if they were not producing Cybertrucks well before the end of 2022, maybe much sooner.\n\n> Who knows why they changed it around and put the Model Y first\n\nEverything I've seen indicates that the plan has been to start producing Model Y first, and then Cybertruck comes along when it's ready. Note that the first two building areas to go up at Giga Texas were the paint shop (not needed by Cybertruck), and the stamping area (the exterior of Cybertruck will be made by a new process, not stamping). And while the exterior of the Gigapress area for Cybertruck is now nearing completion, the Gigapress area for Model Y is much further along, with presses already installed.\n\n> NHTSA is in the middle of doing an investigation [to allow side view cameras in place of mirrors] and have been looking into it since 2019\n\nThe public review process was recently completed, which may indicate that they are well along in the overall process. I expect that Tesla has a backup plan to use mirrors if necessary, but I could see how they might want to wait for the camera approval so that side-mirrorless Cybertrucks will be available right from the start.\n\nA December 2020 [article](https://insideevs.com/news/460243/tesla-cybertruck-steel-supplier-massive-facility-underway/) said that the Steel Dynamics factory in Sinton, Texas (the planned source for the majority of the specialty stainless steel to be used for Cybertruck) is expected to be up and running by Fall 2021. A recent YouTube video of the Steel Dynamics factory interior showed significant progress, but also a significant amount of equipment still in packing cases. It's possible that the availability of significant quantities of stainless steel from that factory will influence the timing of Cybertruck ramp-up. It will be nice if an update on the status of that factory becomes available.\n\nThe very recent spotting of what might be several body in white Cybertrucks adds to the impression that Tesla is pushing hard on the timeline for Cybertruck production capability. On the other hand inside sources appear to be saying that Tesla plans to start the first test production of Model Y within a week, so Model Y is definitely well ahead of Cybertruck.\n\nI'm actually more interested in the capability Giga Texas will add than in the exact timeline. As production ramps up it will add enormously to Tesla's production capacity, and further will likely give some breathing space to allow Tesla to modernize parts of the Fremont factory, further improving Tesla's production.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Cybertruck manufacturing design was reportedly not done.
