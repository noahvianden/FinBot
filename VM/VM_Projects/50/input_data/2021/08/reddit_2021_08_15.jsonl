{"title": "The biggest misconception about investing", "selftext": "## TLDR;\n\n* A lot of everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they‚Äôre really investing in. Most people speculate, don't be most people.\n* Investing is an informed decision on the basis that your shares (or any other asset) will one day earn more money, and therefore be worth more, than what you paid for it; Not the other way around.\n* Invest like a landlord. If you choose to invest in a company, you should follow earnings of your shares as if you were a landlord collecting rent, quarter by quarter I recommend using owner‚Äôs earnings. After all, they are your earnings.\n* Investing in individual companies is well worth it as long as you adopt the right mindset. The earnings automatically come to you, you have extremely capable and smart people literally making money for you, and you are taxed less than your income!\n\n## Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing\n\nThe investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise & misinformation, and can be downright confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. With the proper knowledge and framework, you can accumulate a lifetime of wealth. The information below is basic but important to understand. Many of you already know this, but a few don't and could benefit from it.\n\n## What is investing?\n\nInvesting is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow... plain and simple. It is an informed decision, based on logic and facts, on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset. This applies to all sorts of investments ‚Äî stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, i.e. how much will company earn for the duration of your investment.\n\n## What investing is not\n\nInvesting is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid for. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with how much the price of a stock has gone up or down and trying to sell at it's peak. Banking on someone more¬†[foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT)¬†to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling not investing ‚Äî a recipe for disaster.\n\nLikewise, statements such as ‚Äúthe US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or \"Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy\" are worthless. This is wishful thinking and is lazy. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and therefore earn more.\n\nInvesting in a stock is not buying a piece of paper hoping the sucker goes up nor is it some form of wishful thinking. Most people think like this and lose money. Don't be most people.\n\n## Become a landlord\n\nTo become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don‚Äôt sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rents has also been negatively affected. The same applies for stocks.\n\nAnd the best part? You don‚Äôt have to do any work such as maintaining, marketing and, selling your property as long as you do proper research. Your earnings are reported automatically, you don‚Äôt have to collect them, or worry if people pay late. Why would you not invest if every time Apple sold an iPhone, a percentage of that money goes to you?!\n\n*A few of you might think that you should just track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as owner's earnings and can be calculated relatively easily. More on this next time.*\n\n## Many people speculate, few invest\n\nInvesting is pretty simple to understand, but difficult to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating all together. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp. This, by the way, extends to \"long-term investors\" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the \"future\" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money that you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.\n\nInstead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns... much better returns than most investment vehicles.\n\nHowever, I would really urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this¬†[chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800)¬†says it all\\].) I might make a post on why you should invest in individual companies and how to figure out what companies are worth investing in or not.

In fact, completely new investors can just enable options trading without going through any application process. Robinhood also has, albeit limited, margin enabled by default and allows instant settlement of trades without having to first go through the process of applying for a margin account. Combine this with the \"gamified\" interface and it leads to a certain type of demographic leaning towards Robinhood, and that's younger more inexperienced investors. Combine this with the Gamestop, AMC, Dogecoin, among many other hyped meme stocks, \"squeezes,\" and PND sagas and of course it would result in the average Robinhood account having terrible returns.

Well if Robinhood charged commissions this would still be exactly what they would do, as maximising trading volume is how most brokers make money. The fact that the average Robinhood account has poorer returns is a testiment to the kind of demographic the platform attracts as a result of a combination of factors such as the UI and resulting UX, less strict risk management, and ease of use, at the end of the day.\n\nAnd for your last question, no of course not.

I prefer share buybacks as a form of returning value to the shareholders. What I do care about is owner‚Äôs earnings going up regardless of whether or not they‚Äôre returning 100% as dividends or reinvesting 100% of it into growth.\n\nNow in terms of how do you actually make money. Well if the company always reinvests 100% in the business, then you won‚Äôt be receiving any cold cash‚Ä¶ but as long as the company can achieve a high return on investment then earnings will go up significantly, and therefore the stock price will follow one day. Now if the stock price doesn‚Äôt immediately follow that‚Äôs actually a great thing I would buy as much as I can before it goes up by the same magnitude. These are companies that are the high-growth, winner-takes-all types like Amazon, and Uber. So in this sense yes I will be making money via liquidation value but that capital gains would be a reflection of increased earnings AND I would only be for the amount of money i need to survive for the foreseeable future and maybe spend it on a few other things. I‚Äôd keep the rest invest if this company is still growing its competitive advantage and therefore owner‚Äôs earnings.\n\nHowever a company does not remain high growth forever. As they reinvests into profitable projects, they grow their moats (competitive advantage), and hence lower costs to grow. That excess cash will pile up and since mathematically speaking there are only so many profitable projects out there, some of it will have to be returned to shareholders. I hope that makes sense?
