That corresponds to about **$434** as a *bearish expected move* and **$444** as a *bullish expected move*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** – The VIX pulled spent most of the week between 17 and 20, ending the week just above 18, near its historical average.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **1%** (same as last week)\n* QQQ **1.4%** (same as last week)\n* IWM **2.1%** (0.1% less than last week)\n* DIA **1.2%** (0.1% less than last week)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nLast week saw earnings from some of the largest tech companies in the world including Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon.

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert.
