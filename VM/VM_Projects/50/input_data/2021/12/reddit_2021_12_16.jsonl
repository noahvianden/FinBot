Looks like this announcement may have spooked stocks. But as many of the commenters have explained, you never really know! Thanks guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday the Fed announced 3 interest rate hikes to tackle inflation in 2022. This hawkish move pushed the stock market up after nearly a week of constant decline.\n\nWhy didn't this push the stock market down further? My understanding is that if there are planned interest rate hikes, this tends to decrease equity valuations so the market goes down.

Prices fluctuate not based on the situation today, but on projections of what the situation will be in 3, 6, 12 months (and even farther down the road too).  Uncertainty can drive the market down because it casts larger amounts of doubt into these projections.\n\nInflation (amongst other things) added uncertainty to the market because we didn't know how the FED would react.  This caused people to reduce positions, hedge, etc to protect against that market uncertainty.  Once the decision was announced, even though it is an aggressive taper, it removed that uncertainty.  With the decision being within the range of what was expected, then people felt more comfortable with current prices.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean things will bull run now.  There is constant re-evaluation from big money players and sentiment can change pretty quickly based on a huge number of factors.  \n\n\nI understand that your logic makes sense, but it is a far too simplistic take on price movements.  Think of it like chess - if you're looking 1 move ahead but playing against someone who plans 10 moves ahead - you may not understand why a certain move of theirs makes sense.  \n\nAs retail traders, we are always going to be very far behind.

I guess the best way to view this event's effect on the market is from an uncertainty point of view. The issue of interest rate hikes has become  less uncertain because we now know there will be 3 hikes around a certain period of time in 2022.

If the certainty that comes in paints a worse picture than what is currently being modelled, then the market can react negatively.\n\nI'm going to try (and probably fail) to give an easily understandable example:\n\nIf I had a piece of paper that had a 90% chance of being worth $10, and a 10% change of being worth $5 - then we could calculate what the price of that piece of paper should be because we know the risks.  In this case, the price would be somewhere around $9.50 (0.90 * 10 + 0.10 * 5).\n\nIf I introduced uncertainty and removed those percentages - and just said 'there's a chance it could be worth $10, and a chance it could be worth $5' - then the value of that paper would decrease, but would still fall somewhere between $5 and $10.  A pure average would be in the neighbourhood of $7.50.\n\nIf the news then came out that it was 99% chance of it being $5, then the price would drop again, because the certainty is worse than the range of uncertainty.  If the news said 99% chance of $10, the price would rise because the certainty is better than the range of uncertainty. \n\nIn yesterday's case, the market went up because the certainty that came in was 'better case' than the uncertainty that was being hedged for.  \n\nStock prices are made up of millions of different people, all with different assumptions, models, goals and timeframes - buying and selling to based on those things.
