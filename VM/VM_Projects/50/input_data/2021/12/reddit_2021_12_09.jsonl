{"title": "CHEWY Earnings 12/9/2021 AH - High short interest, low expectations", "selftext": "There were some good DD posted, so I just filed in some gaps and provided another opinion. Not Financial Advice, burn money at your own risk.\n\n**TL;DR - negative sentiments, high short interest, crowd favorite. Probably down, but shrek is still in the vicinity.**\n\n**Ticker - Chewy (CHWY)**\n\n**Price - 57$**\n\n**Earnings - 12/09/2021 AH**\n\n**Category - Digital Retail**\n\n**Macro - Mixed, Logistics (expensive fulfillment)  vs Sentiments (people love pets)**\n\n**Macro + Fundamental**\n\nChewy has been a covid winner due to stay-at-home increasing the rate of pet adoption. However, as a retailer, Chewy faces the same problems of logistical bottlenecks and increased labor costs due to their focus on quality distribution and fulfillment. Chewy is traded on its massive revenue and user growth, rather than a measure of its PE. Chewy’s problem here is twofold: first, despite the massive revenue, Chewy typically loses money per quarter. Second is the stagnating pet-adoption post-peak. Given its slow drain of sub 25 million per quarter and a cash balance of over 500m, I believe there is little risk of dilution. The key metrics to look at are: Gross margins, Customer numbers, and total lifetime-value (LTV)\n\n**Technical**\n\nPC ratio volume is at 1.57 and PC ratio OI is about 1.36 both of which are bearish. RSI is about 30, oversold. Implied movement about 24% or about $15. Short interest is 20% of float, with 3.4 days to cover. Given the magnitude of the last few months for Chewy, I believe a reasonable support lies at 40, or the March 2020 initial buying. Fib retracement at current levels are very difficult to pin and not considered. Given the high short interest, a gap up to 70 is likely on a positive beat and raise, with topside target being 80$.\n\n**Sentimental**\n\nEveryone think its overvalued due to its sky high PE and lack of consistent profitability. While I agree its an optics issue, Amazon was not profitable for a long time though they were growing revenue very quickly. However, there is a high chance of stagnation, as lease for this quarter, on revenue growth due to the stagnation of pet adoptions. Recently, CHWY partnered up with Trupanion for pet insurance that will roll out spring 2022. This is a great move to improve revenue and monetize the user-base while not providing the insurance infrastructure themselves. SA quant rating is 2.62 out of 5. SA Author ratings slightly better at 3.5. Wall Street Ratings at 3.9, with price target average of about 93$, highest being 133 and lowest being 51. This also opens up for downgrades if performance is lackluster. Twitter is mostly negative, as is stockwits and wallstreetbets. (this means retail is predominately bearish)\n\n**Given the high short interest, shorting calls/call spreads feel dangerous. Selling puts at the 40 level feels like the baseline play. IV is high enough to negate a lot of profitability for lesser movements, so net sell is logical. For those that want to play downside, I suggest a 12/17 put debit spread.**\n\nAs best practice - if you're selling options for earnings, wait til 10 minutes before closing to do so to maximize IV and negate intra-day movements. If net buy, set levels and buy at levels.\n\n1:15 edit: thetagang wins again.
