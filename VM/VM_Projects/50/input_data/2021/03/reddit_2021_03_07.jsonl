With things opening back up, all the new homeowners, and people having some savings to play with, we're looking at food, booze, and landscaping/home improvement taking a run between now and August.\n\nI know they say it's impossible to time the market, which why this comment isn't financial advice, but here's how I play the summer months. \n\nI refer to http://www.equityclock.com/seasonality/ to get an idea of which sectors to peek at. Then I head down to my favorite stock screener and dig around in those sectors to put together a current list of who the players are in the given industry. I do my fundamental analysis on them to see which ones are the healthiest plays, and start jotting down a list. I'll hit up TradingView and look at the 1mo and 3mo MACD and RSI to see where the momentum is. \n\nIf I like the momentum, I go to the 1yr, and this is where I lose a lot of friends.\n\nUsing the 1yr, I scroll back one year at a time and take notes of where each one bottoms out and peaks during each year, and look for trends. I lose a lot of friends here because nobody trusts timing the market, but in my experience if you play with looser timelines you can actually be approximately correct and make a decent return. \n\nSo, what are we doing then? I'll determine which month of the year is the most likely to see the peak with a decent run-up, for each stock. Then I look at where the bottom is for each of those runs on each of those stocks. I take the ones who bottom out around the current time of year and cross reference with this year's chart. \n\nIf we're near a bottom, I buy calls for a month or two out at the closest strike price to ATM possible.\n\nAs we let it ride, I'll pay attention to momentum and I'll look at the current premiums and decide what I want to do. If I haven't been crushed by theta decay, I'll sell the call a week out from expiry and take the increased premium. If I have, I'll let it execute and wheel weekly covered calls safely OTM until we're within the month I anticipate the peak, and then I'll write one last set of covered calls for 2 weeks out, barely OTM. If they execute I'll collect what I can; if not, I'll sell it all on the tail end.\n\nIn the past this has worked generally well for me. As a case study for this year I will reference my CALM $42 calls for April 16 that have doubled in value. I bought them a week ago.

That depends on the board’s view of splits.

Looking at their history, they haven’t split since 1999. Prior to that they split often. Some companies have a price they try to stay at and if their stock is at nearly double that or more they split.  For Walmart, it’s up to the board to decide.
