{"title": "Should you follow insider transactions? - I analyzed 4000+ insider trades made over the last 4 years and benchmarked the performance against S&P 500. Here are the results!", "selftext": "There is an old saying on Wall Street.\n\n>There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.\n\nIf you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!\n\nIt’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?\n\nIn this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/61u5ws0wt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=acafc0e339a1258616d0a5b1c9e23986993876a4)\n\n**Data**\n\nThe data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**\n\nit’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \\[1\\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.\n\n* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.\n* A minimum transaction value of 100K\n* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)\n\nThe financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/el8r46gyt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b586f60ddc46621e50579b9aa0133873b628c14)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFor all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months & 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&P500 over the same time period.\n\nMy hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gly3uvhyt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=e92e7f07ffefc2881ae1c885a241b38010c0fa64\n\n **Results** \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8s8832y0u8p71.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba7e1c8ce0873d8c7ceb3e2436f93fee03f1d62)\n\nSurprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.\n\nI have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wrg3zsy1u8p71.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=6616923c8cb041ca2bbe7c2cf7e24f645808f307)\n\nBut the number of trades that made positive returns shows a different story. When compared to trading SPY, a lesser number of trades would have generated profits in the case of following insider purchases. The key here is that while the chances of your trading making a profit is lower, if it does end up making a profit, you would generally have had a better return than the market. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/csp7lsiyt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcfe00b2265ae1c36c2827fc81dd0313f0c932b)\n\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.\n\n* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \\[2\\]\n* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)\n* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\\[3\\]\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0ta3ogjyt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae19ba9725df0300364c775633f4ef6840ac1e6c)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUsually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.\n\nThis analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \\[4\\].\n\nYou may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing all the data used for analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxj5FDxbCikjuS4w14PXnm2QDwIxHGaJANPjjF-R6wA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nUntil next week…\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/yszyuckyt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e767b887b7597b91d2af438d97cda7783a276b0)\n\n**Footnotes and Existing Research**\n\n\\[1\\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.\n\n\\[2\\] [Estimating the Returns to Insider Trading: A Performance-Evaluation Perspective](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprrestat/v_3a85_3ay_3a2003_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a453-471.htm) : The study published by Leslie A. Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%\n\n\\[3\\] Very few people have the ability to keep their emotions away from the trades when a significant chunk of their money is at stake.\n\n\\[4\\] You can filter for the role of the insider (for eg, if you want to track only the CEO purchase/sales), industry, percentage ownership change, the current value of stock owned, etc. There are thousands of permutations in which you can do this analysis to find some alpha.\n\n\\[5\\] Multiple research papers over the last 3-4 decades \\[[eg.1](https://jbepnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_3_September_2017/5.pdf), [eg.2](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/the-insider-trading-anomaly-recent-academic-studies-591/)\\] have shown that insider purchases significantly outperformed the market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pq9pja0zt8p71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a659dd3772d00c2b943071960c474ae8d8d6a79", "id": "pttsoo", "created_utc": 1632398941.0, "score": 674, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent work and interesting analysis.

There's a correct answer. It's Bitcoin. Fucking listen. \n\nNothing else like Bitcoin has ever existed. It's absolutely a revolution in money. Bitcoin makes banks, government monies, stocks, and bonds obsolete. \n\nTo understand this requires you understand how Bitcoin works. \n\nThe Bitcoin network is secured by mining. People use their computers plus electricity to solve cryptographic puzzles that serve as security for the network. The incentive to mine is getting paid in BTC. Bitcoin is the energy money Henry Ford predicted 100 years ago. \n\nThere's 2 rewards for miners: The block reward, and the transaction fees paid from Bitcoin transactions. Every 4 years, the block reward is cut in half. This is huge. This is it right here. \n\nImagine the price of gold if half the world's gold mines all permanently and irrevocably closed at once. This can't physically happen with gold. But it happens every 4 years with Bitcoin. \n\nFurthermore Bitcoin has an automatic biweekly difficulty adjustment. So no matter how much energy mankind invests into Bitcoin, production can never increase. Production can only go down, by half, every 4 years until year 2140 when Bitcoin mining is incentivized by transaction fees alone. \n\nBitcoin is unique in its hardness. If the price of gold doubled in 3 months, every fucking gold mine on Earth would open to full capacity, new mines would open, and the excess of supply would absorb the demand, making prices fall back down. \n\nBitcoin doesn't work like this. No matter how high the price of Bitcoin goes, the entire world cannot (physically cannot no matter what) make new BTC any faster than what the network rules allow. (If you don't play by the rules, you're kicked out). And every 4 years the block reward is cut in half. Think if this as cutting the inflation rate in half, which makes Bitcoin twice as hard every 4 years. This will happen 30 more times. \n\nIn 2009 when Bitcoin launched, the Bitcoin block reward was 50 BTC. Bitcoin was easy to mine. There was basically no competition. Each BTC was under $1. \n\nIn 2012 (iirc) the body reward dropped to 25 BTC. Price went up exponentially. It drew attention, then study, then more investment. \n\nNow the block reward is 6.25 BTC. Bitcoin is mostly mined by special hardware in warehouses. But anyone can mine with almost any computer. 1 BTC = $41,000. Bitcoin hit a market cap of $1 trillion earlier this year. It was the fastest asset to ever do so. \n\nAnd in 2.5 more years, Bitcoin will automatically become twice as hard and about 10-30 times more valuable. \n\nThen again 4 years after that and so on until Bitcoin holds the entire world's wealth. \n\nThis means that every inferior monetary system will probably be destroyed.

{"title": "SPIR Update - Kick in the Nuts", "selftext": "Today was... a cold-cock. Full on assault and blood bath. Hope some of you made profits yesterday because I took a big ol' bat to my little nuggets, -60%.\n\n**New Info**\n\nThe S-1 is filed. This does **not** mean the PIPE can trade. The SEC will review the filing and approve or present comments for amendment. As stated in the DD, this process could move as quickly as 1-2 weeks. Timing is not definitive.\n\n**Let's talk price action** (Do we really have to?)\n\nGapped down slightly from $18.45 to $17.83 with an immediate dump. I was anticipating a bounce at the $16 level based on S-1 sentiment before grinding forward. After all, price didn't fall in premarket on S-1 news. When price failed a rally at 10:30, shit got real. I watched the tape as we were hammered with $15p 11/19 by PHLX. Clearly a maneuver to tank price. \n\nTumbling down, price was further slapped down by call selling particularly around $17.5c 10/15 at 11:00. The two huge volume sticks at 12:30 were also attributable to big sell orders on $17.5c 10/15. Ultimately, today was doomed because... **no long side stepped in**. There was zero conviction in call buying.\n\nThere are a couple of possibilities of what happened today:\n\n1. Shorts selling naked calls in risky move to tank price\n\n2. Long dumping on us (jokes on us)\n\n3. PIPE selling covered calls to their shares\n\n**#1** seems plausible but irrational. The advantage is that it deflates gamma for the calls purchased. The disadvantage is that it's a huge risk and the blowback can be enormous. We will know if this happened based on the OI in the morning. If OI net increases at $17.5, you can bet they short sold. If OI net decreases at $17.5 then **#2** is more plausible. \n\n**#2** would explain why no knight in shining armor came to our rescue to scoop up cheap calls and plow forward. Then again, I'm not sure it would have been capital efficient to spike price against downward pressure. So... if not **#2**, maybe the long pivoted to provide price support at the $14.5 range? Hell if I know.\n\n**#3** is possible but I don't know if its rational. Does the S-1 filing truly change an investors ability to collaterize selling a call (for a covered call)? If not, then why wouldn't PIPE sell calls yesterday at $18. I'm not sure **#3** is what we experienced.\n\nOverall volume today was actually down, 3.7mm. I think mostly because negative option activity was not combated with positive action activity. Price just kinda rolled over.\n\n**Tomorrow**\n\nTomorrow, we look for price support, consolidation, and whale call buying (ffs). Basically any signal that today was an unfortunate battle in a larger strategic war. We look to see option chain OI intact. This is key. This is why I stayed in IRNT after the initial run up.\n\nI tried to throw some cash at $12.5c mid day near the low to attempt to scalp some gains. However, the spread is so stupidly wide that I ended up losing 10%. I never had intention to swing the scalp play; was just hoping for some small morsel of price recovery.\n\nI also decided to exit my (200) $25c because this is a momentum play. With price falling so far, they've melted back to mostly extrinsic value and MMs may decrease IV further tomorrow. I'd rather pocket that cash (at cost basis) to deploy more strategically later. Otherwise, I am swinging the rest of my positions. \n\nAgain this is a momentum play. If price and technicals break down, **disclaimer**, I may choose to fully or partially exit my position without notice. I've tried to outline a few in this writeup but it is possible that I'll tied up and unable to provide live feedback so play as your own risk.\n\n**Positions**\n\nHolding...\n\n(210) $12.5c 10/15 \n\n(50) $15c 10/15 \n\n(50) $20c 10/15 \n\n2,450 shares\n\nI am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\n\n**Edit:** forgot to mention an odd observation.

Also on days like this including AH it bounces the next day.\n\nFloat is still tiny, shorts are fucked for the next few weeks, and it’s gonna cost em a nice war chest to keep this shit up. \n\nFinally nice options support @ 15/16/17.5 puts side is empty up until 15/16p level. And this was using options OI / volume at 1030ish AM\n\nEdit:\n\nI don’t think the play is over, but it’s got quite a few eyes on it now. This needs volume, and soon to pop over 20. My PT was 22\n\nAlso reduced volume since days prior, add in no liquidity between morning and afternoon power hours.
