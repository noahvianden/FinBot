Even if 50% of the population (or more) hates them, there is still a large market for them. Tesla is willing to take on those smaller market niches that conventional automakers bill as \"too risky\" or something the public \"won't go for\". Witness the cybertruck.

To retain efficiency within the robotaxi network, the real demand in the future will be for a 2-seater autonomous \"model 2\" type car. There will still be some demand for 3-5 passenger cars but this will be mostly covered by existing Model Y. Then there will be some demand for vans with 6+ passengers, possibly with both front and rear facing seats.\n\nBut I think there is even a possible future where the 2-seater takes over completely, where cost of production at scale and cost per ride is be so low that even if you're travelling 3+ passengers you just go in multiple 2-seater cars.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with that assessment!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "That’s the image Tesla used in their 2019 autonomy presentation.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I think it is weird they didn't remove the side mirrors.
