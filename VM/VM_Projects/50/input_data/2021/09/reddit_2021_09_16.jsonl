If bad news comes out after hours, as it usually does, your loses on the put side are going not only obliterate the premium you collected on the call but probably take out most if not all of your previous gains. Because you're unable to cap your loss or sell/roll your position after hours you're super exposed to one bad day wiping out months or years of gains as you sit and watch helplessly. \n\nThen there is early assignment risk in the same scenario. You never think it will happen because the odds are low but trust me it will and it will happen at the worst possible time. Especially when a stock crashes. Think about all the people who hedged with puts you sold now getting margin called or excercising them. Its more likely than you think. \n\nYour mitigation plan to roll the winning side will get wrecked if you get assigned on the put side and the atm calls are now way below your assigned strike. Say you get assigned at 100 strike but the stock is now trading at $60, you probably won't be able to get much premium at your break even cost and if you sell those calls near the money you'll get called away for a big loss if the stock moves back up. \n\nA few months in a very favorable market isn't really a good measure of a strategy like this. I would say if you can back test maybe see how it works out when things go bad. If you have TD as a broker thinkorswim thinkBack is awesome for this type of thing. Maybe replay a few years ago when tesla got smoked after Elon threatened to take it private then it bounced back. Unfortunately there isn't a great way to simulate early assignments which are probably your biggest risk.

Short straddles are hoping for limited movement away from the strike, a big move up is just as bad for you as a crash. \n\nFinally you mentioned three tickers which are correlated. I'm not sure if you trade more than one at a time but if so you're essentially doubling or tripling your risk. There are any number of announcements that could launch one ticker and crush the others. NVDA could announce its partnering with Apple to build self driving cars dropping TSLA and popping AAPL and NVDA crushing you on three sides. Or Apple could announce its making gpus now that it's a chip maker again, causing NVDA to drop. There's a lot of ways that can go bad.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "All of the very reasonable concerns you raise sound like they apply to short puts. Wouldn't the extra premium collected and more neutral delta of a straddle reduce the risk in comparison to a short put?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No because that premium comes from selling a naked call which has unlimited loss potential. A short put alone, although considered an unlimited risk position, technically has a limited loss as a stock cannot fall below zero. There is no hard limit on how much a stock can go up.  While you're receive more premium than the short put alone you add the huge upside risk of the call. \n\nSo the only advantage is that the extra premium you collect increases the break even on either side of the strike which gives you a neutral position instead of a bullish one the short put would give you alone. Basically a range between two strikes where you'll be profitable as long as the stock remains between them long enough for you to capture profit off Theta and/or Vega. \n\nHowever because you're selling two ATM options the breakeven is based on the premium collected. Because you have a limited profit/unlimited risk position, once your profit is eaten up as one side moves deeper in the money the OTM delta on the winning side no longer matters as it's not adding any profit to offset the mounting losses.\n\nFor example let's do a simple one and ignore the greeks for now to keep the math easy. But trust me the rising IV when a stock moves only increases the pain when you do factor back in the greeks so this example below doesn't really show the max pain.\n\nSay you sell a 100 Strike Straddle and let's say it's priced at $1 on each leg so you collect $2 immediately by selling 1 ATM call and 1 ATM put.\n\nYour break even is now between $99 and $101. If the stock stays between those strikes you should make at least some money on Theta decay or potentially Vega if IV drops. However once the stock crashes below $99 or shoots above $101 because you can't make any more money than $2 you keep losing more and more until you'll eventually  get assigned or margin called. That forces you to close out early for a loss which you can't if this happens outside of market hours.  \n\nExample (not factoring in gains from Theta or Vega, let's pretend this went bad immediately):\n\nStock @ $100, put = $1 call = $1. If you close here you break totally even paying $2 back to exit.\n\nStock @ $99, put  = $2, call = $0. If you close here you break even, lost on the put but break even on the call paying $2 back to close for $0 gain or loss.\n\nStock @ $101, put = $0, call = $2 If you close here you break even. Lost on the call but break even on the put for $0 gain/loss.\n\nStock @ $102, put = $0, call = $3 Close and you lose $1, collected $2 for the put but lost $3 on the call so you're out a dollar of your own money now. \n\nStock @ $105, put = $0, call = $6 Close and you lose $6 on the call but only have $2 still from the put meaning you're out $4 of your account value. \n\nStock @ $125, put = $0, call = $24 Close and you lose $22\n\nAnd so on, but you see how as soon as you pass your break even the losses are not longer offset by the other side of the spread. \n\nI realized after I posted yesterday I really only highlighted the downside risk but the upside risk is actually worse than the downside, it's just less likely you're going to wake up to a stock up 25% than down 25% historically.
