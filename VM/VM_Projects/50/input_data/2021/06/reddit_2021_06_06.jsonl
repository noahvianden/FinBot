{"title": "Is Tastytrade a Profitable System?", "selftext": "Haven't heard of a single trader, including Tom or Bat, post a long term trading record that shows profits which outpaced the S&P over the time period in question.\n\nPlease no copes. There have been other threads on here and the answers were literally \"Uh I'm pretty sure they're profitable,\" \"Uh don't they post their trades on the network (for which there is no meta-analysis and final conclusion on profitability of the system)?\" and my favorite \"Well their account sizes are different, so it's gonna be different for everyone.\"\n\nGuys, I'll just tell you plainly: I want a link to a statistical analysis of their trades, showing a final conclusion that verifies they are more profitable than DCA buy and hold of the index. It's shocking to me that the whole premise of their system (i.e. active management is better than the index) has not been borne out by a single trader over any appreciable period of time. And no, \"I made 100% in the past year trading iron condors\" does not count. There are plenty of guys making 100s of %s in penny stocks, but very very few that actually survive for the long term, without blowing up, and end up actually beating the index. Coincidentally, the ones that do last see fit to start trading rooms, likely because they're scared as hell that they could blow up at some point and want to diversify their income streams.\n\nSo yeah, irl (not theoretical) statistical analysis or just let this post die. If I see no legit responses, it looks like we have our answer. In the mean time, I'll look at starting to track their trades and develop my own statistical analysis to post here later. Would be happy to eat my words if they can actually manage to outpace the s&p over the coming years, but my general impression from writing options is it's more profitable on a risk-adjusted basis (i.e. less volatile for close to the same gains), but that you have less gains for the same capital committed.\n\nFurthermore, at some point it would be nice to compare writing with IVR >50 against a simple buy+hold technical strategy like longing when the S&P crosses below the 50 day or 30 week or something like that. There's a lot of research yet to be done on this, so if anyone wants to point me to some appropriate data sources to get to work on it, that'd be good too.

{"title": "Lotto Friday Options", "selftext": "I've been meaning to post about Lotto Options for awhile now and just haven't gotten around to it.\n\nThe concept is simple - roughly an hour before trading ends on a Friday you have options that are also an hour away from expiring.   The focus of lotto trades are on the strikes that are just slightly OTM (e.g. if a stock is at 99.70, you would be look at the 100 Calls, or if a stock is at 99.20 you might be looking at the 99 Puts).  Most of the time these trades are done from the long side, so that is what I will focus on - although you can of course do them from the short end if conditions permit (in fact my example below is from the short side).\n\nIt is during this hour that options provide you the most pure leverage you'll find.  So what conditions do you want if you are using Calls (opposite if it is Puts)?\n\n**1) Slight market pullback** \\- best case scenario is you first get a market pullback.  Not significant, I am talking SPY 421.50 goes to SPY 420.50, something along that magnitude.  Fortunately on most Fridays towards the end of the day you generally will see a brief pullback of this nature.\n\n**2) Stocks that hold up during the pullback -** this pullback allows you to see which stocks held up well during that brief drip.  These stocks have Relative Strength vs the market. So in the example above you are looking for that stock at 99.50 to barely budge as SPY dropped.\n\n**3) Confirmation that the market is rebounding** \\- since you will be going long, you want to make sure that the pullback is going to continue, as even the strongest stock most likely won't withstand a significant drop.\n\n**4) Choose a stock that has been strong all day -** your looking for stocks are still have gas in the tank and are looking to make that final push.\n\nAt this point, the options are going to be incredibly cheap, for that 99.50 stock with less than an hour left, the $100 calls would most likely be going for around 5 cents each.  \n\n*Note; These are low probability - high reward trades. As such you should not be using a lot of your money to do them.  They are meant to be fun.*  \n\nLet's say you grab 100 of those calls for 5 cents each ($500), or even 10 of them for $50, and with the market rebounding the stock goes from 99.50 to 99.80 - now those calls will most likely be worth 10 cents.  Right there you just made 100% profit.  That type of play is not uncommon.\n\nHowever, on 5/28 I did my most successful Lotto trade to date and it was from the short side.  After bouncing around for most of the day, I noticed around an hour and half before close that SPY was shooting up, but TSLA wasn't moving.  In fact, the stock was dropping.  For some reason, TSLA became Relatively Weak to the market.  The stock was at $634 a share and the $630 Puts were going for 30 cents.  The moment the SPY began to stall I grabbed A LOT of those Puts (I got them for roughly 40 cents), far too many than I should have (Lotto plays should not be significant in size).  SPY began to drop, and so did TSLA - within 15 minutes, TSLA was now at 627.90 and those calls were worth $3.20.  I made over 830% on that trade.  With only 20 minutes left, I saw the trend continuing, so I jumped back in and bought the 625 Puts for 13 cents, and within 10 minutes flipped them for 67 cents for a 670% return.  \n\nNow these aren't typical returns.  Usually you can find one or two good candidates and try to get a 100-300% return on them.  Once again these are options that are going for less than 50 cents, and you don't need much to get them over the edge.  Best case scenario is the stock goes ITM and you start running at parity with it.  In the original example above, if that stock got over $100, then every penny the stock ticks up, your options are going up the same amount, except now you are controlling thousands of shares for a few hundred dollars.\n\nAnyway, this is not a definitive strategy to depend on, just a fun strategy that if done correctly can net you a nice profit.  You have to pick the right stock, and many times you will wind up either selling the options for a loss or letting them just expire worthless.  But the times you get one that works makes up for it.\n\nAlways remember: *Do not get assigned - close all options before the end of the day.  And also make sure your broker knows you are doing this otherwise they will close these trades for you.*", "id": "ntt9mo", "created_utc": 1623007137.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "From 1 DTE to 1 HTE options.

Shorting and puts are very dangerous if done incorrectly since you can lose a lot of money really quick. Anyways here's my DD:\n\nNext week will be a huge opportunity for puts and shorts since it is basically almost guaranteed that the markets will sell off. \n\nAs you all know next week we will have May CPI data released. The CPI data will show how much inflation has increased since April. When CPI data is higher than expected expect a huge sell off due to inflation FUD. This will hopefully force the FED to taper bonds and hopefully monthly inflation fud will be permanently gone after July.\n\nIn the rare case that magic exist and inflation somehow got lower compared to April we will still see a sell off. Why? Because now Jerome Powell will delay the tapering because \"the economy has yet to recover\". Unless the CPI data gets out of hand I personally don't believe we will see any tapering soon and guess what the most frequently asked question to Powell is? When does the FED start tapering? And everytime he gives the same answer and everytime the market sells off because of that. \n\nIt would be interesting to see what all the meme stocks will do during this period of fud since especially the majority AMC is owned by us retail investors.
