The possibility they may not get the additional funding required to ramp up the production phase of their operations. Worst case scenario: They could go bankrupt and this will result in hundreds of families in Lordstown, Ohio without work. However, the moment they say, ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù, this stock will triple.\n\n2) Lordstown Motors future capital requirements; their ability to execute their business plan, and the risks related to the rollout of their business and the timing of expected release date for the Endurance. The Endurance is their all-electric full-size pick-up truck, the failure of this vehicle to launch successfully by the end of this year will be severely detrimental to the success of the company. **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year.**\n\n3) Lordstown Motors ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in their vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. While companies like Ford and GM have a track record of succeeding in the fleet industry, Lordstown Motors is a new upcomer, and thus, this unknown variable causes a high degree of uncertainty.\n\n4) Competition in the EV industry, from established veterans such as Ford, GM, and newcomers such as Rivian, Lucid, and others can‚Äôt be underestimated and understated. This is a serious threat to Lordstown Motors that cannot be ignored. Again, **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year to get first mover advantage.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n BULL THESIS on LORDSTOWN MOTORS (RIDE) \n\n  MARKET CAP:\n\nLordstown Motors is 2.01 BILLION USD.\n\nNikola Corporation is 6.91 BILLION USD.\n\nLucid is 6.50 BILLION USD.\n\nNio is 57 BILLION USD\n\nTesla is 587 BILLION USD.\n\n$RIDE short interest is $489M\n\n 36.50MM shares shorted \n\n32.85% SI% of Float \n\n24.73% S3 SI% Float\n\n 34% fee rising to over 50% fee \n\nShorts up +$92M in 2021 mark-to-market losses; up +$80M on today's -16.3% move. \n\n(source : [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402377322657992708?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402377322657992708?s=20) )\n\n¬∑ Niche category.
