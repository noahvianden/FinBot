{"title": "Big Lots (BIG): The story of an underdog with strong financials", "selftext": "Searching for companies that have a low price/earnings ratio is the fundamental principle behind value investing. It is in that regard that I bring to you Big Lots (BIG).\n\nHere we have a company that cares about its share holders and delivers year after year. Its financial record is strong as can be seen:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[note increase in revenue & net income, decrease in shares outstanding every year](https://preview.redd.it/j11gf8otq1671.jpg?width=1553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=268d11048e09a2d8ac572f8cdd25bf2abf4c1e59)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[cash on hand increased, 2020 was the company's best year](https://preview.redd.it/mut21up0r1671.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5939f22b8158279987737c5f5818e27b59807e9)\n\nNet income has increased every year and its financial position became even stronger in 2020. The company has been profitable every year since 2006.\n\nNow you would think that a company like Big Lots would see some of its revenue eaten up by the likes of Amazon and other online retailers but this is not the case. This is because big lots offers an alternative shopping experience that other companies without retail shopping centers cannot provide, BOPIS or buy online pick up in store. Unsurprisingly, many people don‚Äôt want to wait for shipping and would rather pick up their item(s) in store.\n\nNow that does not mean that big lots is not aware of the changing dynamic within the customer shopping experience. In 2019 they launched Operation North Star.\n\nThis has three major objectives:\n\n1. Drive profitable long-term growth\n\na. grow e-commerce sales.\n\nb. grow store count.\n\nc. strengthen their home offerings.\n\n2) Fund the journey\n\na. expanding gross margin rate\n\nb. increasing organizational efficiency\n\n3) Create long-term shareholder value\n\na. the first two objectives will increase earnings growth\n\nb. the 2020 share repurchase program which in the fourth quarter of 2020 consisted of buying back 1.6 million of their 39 million outstanding shares.\n\nWhen looking into the financials of Big Lots there is a trend that dates back to 2005. Back in 2005 they had 115 million shares outstanding and as of 2021 they currently only have 39 million shares outstanding. I found this to be of particular interest when considering shareholder value, typically as time goes on the shares outstanding of a company tend to increase but in the case of Big Lots the company has a consistent record of buying back their own shares. This reflects in their earnings per share as it was $0.21 in 2005 and now is a whopping $16.11. Everything in the financial records of the company indicates that Big Lots is undervalued.\n\nLets compare big lots to target to see if the market has priced it accurately:\n\n|**Year 2020**|**Big Lots**|**Target**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Number of stores|1404|1909|\n|Market Capitalization|$2.38 Billion|$115.2 Billion|\n|Net Income|$629 Million|$4.368 Billion|\n|Price/Earnings Ratio|3.99|19.02|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs can be seen the market does not realize the true value of big lots. This is a company that has a proven track record of increased revenue, gross profit and earnings per share year after year.\n\nBig Lots also offers customers incentives to continue shopping at their company through the BIG rewards program. This program provides coupons and incentives for customers and encourages new membership. Through the beginning of 2021 the BIG rewards program had nearly 21 million active members. The value presented in this base of membership cannot be overstated; incentivizing customers to keep coming back by providing discounts for further purchases all but ensures that they will be retaining their core customers.\n\nTLDR: Big Lots (BIG) is an underappreciated company with an impressive balance sheet. Its current shopping experience is only rivaled by companies that are valued at hundreds of billions of dollars while Big Lots‚Äô entire market cap is $2.5 billion.\n\n*Not financial advice, please do your own research.*\n\nedit: current position 1x $72.5c exp 7/16. & 10 shares\n\nEDIT #2: Looking through the financials it appears that a large portion of their net income came from the sale of four distribution centers in 2020. In 2020 revenue increased 16% while their net income increased 260%. This also explains the significant increase in cash on hand.", "id": "o2sl0l", "created_utc": 1624032348.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|81|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2sl0l/big_lots_big_the_story_of_an_underdog_with_strong/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nr21l5/blackberry_a_company_with_enormous_potential/) \n**Account Age**|9 months ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I love this bot.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They're a pretty solid company.
