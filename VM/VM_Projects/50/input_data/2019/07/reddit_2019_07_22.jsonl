This is a super common amateur error of thought I see in this thread and I can't help but try and offer some advice here when I see it. If you're truly looking for those \"potential rockstars,\" share price shouldn't be a metric by which to filter your criteria. What's more important to gauging your ROI here is your cost basis, or the total amount of money invested in an asset that includes any commission and/or maintenance fees.

This is a super fundamental concept you will have to understand if you're going to be investing in equities.\n\nOn the whole \"undeniable psychological effect\" opinion, you're wrong. Most shares of equities are bought and sold by both institutions and individuals who have at least a little bit of know-how.

Valuation looks around ~6.5x EV/Sales, which is well behind most growth SaaS names, though appropriate for CRM's growth. This multiple seems to be a more in-line with slower growing software names held by a more GARP-y investor base. CRM is a good holding even while growth is moderating, but there are better names to own in the SaaS market. \n\nNOW doesn't really address the same market segments as CRM, though there's incrementally more overlap in the customer service marketplace, which CRM investors should watch.

CRM's Service Cloud segment growth declined to 20% Y/Y in FQ1'20, down from 29% Y/Y in FQ1'19.

Platform is growing 46% Y/Y helped by M&A, and Marketing / Commerce is sustaining >30% Y/Y growth, though on a lower revenue base than the other segments. \n\n3. Service Cloud needs to add ~$50mn in revenue next quarter to support ~20% Y/Y growth, which is doable, but if NOW is out there picking off some customers or making sales cycles take longer, this might result in a steeper slow down.\n\n4. CRM has been consistently reducing margin expansion guidance, blaming M&A integration costs.

{"title": "Finding the meaning of YOLO.", "selftext": "Whether or not something is a yolo is dependent on each person. There is no one true definition of a YOLO and there are a few variables that come into play which all need each other. \n\n Position, net worth, volatility.\n\nPosition - Your play, more specifically, how much you put into a play. Important if the play is more volatile, however this means nothing if it isn’t a large percent of your net worth or AT LEAST your investment account.\n\nNet Worth - Total cash value of assets. The YOLOness of your position is dependent on this factor, as well as-\n\nVolatility - How likely your position is to fluctuate up or down.\n\nSome examples:\n\nRoger has a $1,000 WeBull account. Other than his WeBull account, he has $300 sitting in his bank account. Roger has autistically decided to put his entire $1000 into Netflix FD calls. Rogers **Position** is 77% of his **Net Worth** and his position is **Volatile**. Upon losing his entire investment, which he most certainly will, Roger will have effectively wiped out over half of his net worth. Roger has YOLO’d, however nobody cares because Roger is a poor.\n\nJasmine has a $10,000 Think or Swim account. Other than her ToS account, she has only $1,000 saved up in an Ally™️ High-Yield™️ Savings™️ account earning 2%™️ interest. Jasmine has high functioning autistically decided to put her entire ToS account into a mix of long dated Microsoft calls, and shares. Jasmine’s **Position** is 91% of her ***Net Worth**, however her position has little **Volatility**. Jasmine may have YOLO’d on terms looser than her taco, but her investment is relatively safe, so nobody cares.\n\nChad B. Turner (the B stands for big long swinging retarded dick) has $5,000,000 of his parents allowance in an eTrade account. And his dad said if he can turn that $5,000,000 into $5,000,000.01 he’ll buy him a new Lambo. Other than his eTrade, he has some play money and a Ferrari, and is sure to inherit his parents multi-million dollar fortune, along with his fathers penthouse full of whores frothing at the mouth for his cock. And I’m telling you, these girls will do ~anything~. Like, you don’t understand, if you tell her to get on her knees and shove a live snake...ah I’m getting off track. Anyway, Chad decides making this money in a smart effective manner isn’t worth his time and dumps $500,000 into Netflix calls before earnings, because he watched Netflix one time while your girlfriend was giving him sloptop and while the head wasn’t very good, he could at least focus on Jennifer Aniston’s nipples on Friends, eventually bringing him to orgasm. Chad B. Turner’s **Position** has a high **Volatility**, however it is only .2% of his **Net Worth** which means this is indeed not a YOLO for Chad. Chad takes a screenshot of his positions and posts to WSB.\n\nLast but not least, we have you. You have $20,000 in a Robinhood account, and besides that you only have your last paycheck sitting in a .01% interest checking account. You’ve just logged onto WSB and saw Chad B. Turners post. “HOLY SHIT WHAT A YOLO”, you exclaim and get to thinking. For this man to put 500k on Netflix uppies, he’s gotta know what he’s doing, or has some kind of insider info, right? I mean, hey, he has more money than I do I better get in on this! So you log into your Robinhood, sell your $MU and $USO FD’s for a small loss and go all in on Netflix greens. Your dick instantly gets hard thinking about how you and your new WSB partner will share in glorious tenderloins. You leave a comment, “I’m all in as well!See you on the other side.” You, the chosen one, have hit the trifecta. You’ve got the position, you don’t have the Net Worth but god damnit do you have the volatility. \n\nThe time has come. Netflix reports their earnings, and you get a nice little notification at the top of your screen. “NFLX announced quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share, beating expectations by 7%.” “Fuck yeah, beat earnings holy shit I’m gonna be so rich.” You log in, fumbling to type in your password several times in excitement before telling yourself to calm down. You slowly type, 1-2-3-4-5-6....“Yo what the FUCK?!?” Netflix is down 10%...11%, you tell yourself it’s just a fat finger and it’ll come up with guidance. A CNN news snippet appears, “Netflix stock plummets after massive subscriber miss.” It’s still going down, you realize this is it and panic sell to save the last scraps of your investment.\n\nMeanwhile Chad B. Turner has just recently returned from his trip to the Bahamas with some of the girls his father lent him. \n\n“So, son, how’s that investment coming?” \n\nHe’s completely forgotten from all the sex. He logs in and hangs his head in shame. \n\n“Sorry, dad, looks like I lost $450,000.”\n\nHis father smiles. “Cheer up, son. Hey, the important thing is that you did your due diligence and you went with your gut and took a chance. That shows courage. But sometimes, things don’t work out the way we plan and we have to deal with the consequences.”\n\n“I understand, dad.” he says solemnly. \n\n“So, hey, we’ll table the Lamborghini for now but how does that new corvette sound?”\n\n“Gee whiz no foolin? Thanks dad!”\n\nChecking back in with you now, it seems like you’ve decided to spend the last of your investment on $ROPE. But, rest assured, your girlfriend is in good hands.", "id": "cghywj", "created_utc": 1563824681.0, "score": 385, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "Roger has a $1,000 WeBull account.
