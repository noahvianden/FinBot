Right now corn is by far the most profitable crop in my area.  Farmers (including my family) have tried several different types of crops in an effort to diversify, the results of those trials have been universally disastrous from an economic perspective.  \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for being locked in, but economies of scale are the most important.  Farmers who make the most money then have the ability to grow the operations and increasing scale of the operation, further increases margins for a positive feedback loop.  \n\nEquipment is specific to crop type and it is very expensive to switch to a different crop.

Can we plant corn each and every year? Yes.  Should we?

Crop rotation is ecologically beneficial but in today’s society it’s too important to chase the most profitable crop.  \n\nIn my area something like Soybeans followed by Wheat followed by Corn works well. \n\nSwitching crops is harder and more expensive but with good Farm Co-ops or neighbours equipment can be shared.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The problem is some crops are just way more profitable then others.\n\nEver wonder why history books talk so much about cotton being king in the South pre-Civil War?

Even if 100% of cars sold in the US are EVs by 2025, which would be amazing, there's still the legacy fleet buying gas.
