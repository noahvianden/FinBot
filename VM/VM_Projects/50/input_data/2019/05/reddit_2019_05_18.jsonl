Tesla is not like Enron; if anything Enron pretended to be like a company similar to Tesla. Fundamentally, Elon has delivered on his promises at every level; he hasn't always been able to achieve his goals on time, but that's just something that happens when you're the disruptive innovator. When nobody has ever done what you've done before (and breakdowns of the car show they're clear leaders in cost and technology in motors, batteries, closed-loop heat recycling for efficiency, and likely autonomy), you cannot properly forecast exactly how long it will take to accomplish these things. Enron could lie to and cheat investors for a very long time, but Tesla has no means of hiding anything from the public. Every week, I see more and more Tesla cars out on the street, and the financials are almost always in line with realistic expectations based off of public knowledge. \n\n Q1 was worse that Q4 of last year  mostly due to expiring tax credits, retooling of Model S and X lines, payment of debt, inventory stuck mid-delivery to overseas customers, and seasonality. Shortsellers and the mainstream media destroyed the company's performance—a growth company, mind you—for a significant change between a Q1 and Q4, when everyone knows that this is misleading and dishonest. That investors can look at Uber or Lyft and still be somewhat excited about the prospects of these vastly unprofitable companies that can be overtaken by a company with either autonomous vehicles or significant access to capital shows that investors just like to be negative on Tesla. \n\nI initially thought that Elon Musk was a little too paranoid about short-sellers. But it's become extremely clear within the last few months that there is a highly organized disiniformation campaign against the company, which is doing vast harm to Tesla.

The fact that you even compared Elon to Trump suggests you don't know what you're talking about. AP1 wasn't allowed to get anywhere because MobileEye didn't want to continue the partnership.

And now they are on the verge of fulfilling that promise.\n\nBattery swapping became unnecessary because of supercharging. Tesla has a fairly good environmental record, but they don't have the capital to immediately make all the superchargers solar without compromising profitability. Shifting priorities as a company evolves to be beneficial to customers, shareholders, and the company is not \"lying\". And Tesla is making \"profits\" and reinvesting them.
