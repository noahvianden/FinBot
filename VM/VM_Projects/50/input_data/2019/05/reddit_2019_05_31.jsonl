In Newton's gravity there's no black holes, speed of light ect but it's overall it's a very good model because it works for what we need it to.

Of course the model is probably built to match their expectation of Tesla's performance, so it's a circular model that just does what they want it to do. They have a starting point and a end point and just built a model to connect them based on some assumptions.

Somehow they just add on gross PPE multiplied by depreciation to EBITDA R&D, so 100 million more in Gross PPE with 10% depreciation is 10 million in earnings? I don't really know what assumptions they make to do that but maybe you can justify it. \n\nIn the new version, they added Capital consumed per vehicle which takes total cars divided by PPE multiplied by depreciation. Capital per vehicle gets included in Total COGs per vehicle. Then total capital per vehicle divided by average selling price to get gross margin. \n\nIn the old version gross margin was just set to 30%. If you leave everything on default gross margin is still 30% so nothing in the model has changed but if you start fucking around with net PPE then capital per vehicle will increase, cost per vehicle goes up, gross margin goes down, gross profit goes down. They added on a incremental capex required which looks at net PPE and then adds together it to incremental capital required and assumes a 5.5% interest on the total capital required. \n\nReally, this whole thing is a mess. They made net PPE decrease stock price now but the model also gets way more complex. I'm sure most of the assumptions they make are resonable but throw it all together into this soup of a spreadsheet it's just gonna spit out a random number that may or may not reflect reality. \n\nBut hey, if you have a model with 100 different variables and you can perfectly predict the value of all 100 variables then you may be able to calculate the exact stock price but if you can accurately predict all 100 variables then what's the differences between that and just predicting the future?

People buying them are large institutions or sovereign funds. For them 2.24% is gold.\n\n3. People making money of those bonds play with duration. Duration is something you should read upon. If the yields on a bond drop by 1% with a duration of 10, the bond will appreciate 10% in value. \n\n4. Institutions also buy bonds when they foresee a recession or bear market as bonds appreciate more in value due to duration. \n\n5. Bonds are also traded by hedge funds to do something called a carry trade. And when the yields are this low carry trade becomes far more attractive. A carry trade is where you borrow in a country with low yields and lend in a country with higher yields. \n\n6. If bond is high quality, despite the duration risk (yields moving higher), it is sort of risk free if held till maturity. \n\n7. Pension need to continuously buy bonds (both investment grade and sovereign ) to hedge against their liabilities (these liabilities are the pensions promised).

The other way is to restrict monetary supply (which is deflationary in nature, but thats pulling a Japan). Raising rates will combat inflation. The question is what is the fallout effect? So traditionally, when an economy gets superheated, it will have the risk of inflation, then the fed steps in an declares rate hikes. This effect of raising rate hikes will cause small businesses and corporations to default on their business loans first. That leads to unemployment and fewer people buying things and so on. This is the deflationary part of raising rates. Now the Gov't is having trouble servicing this debt, so they too have to start cutting back. This leads to further unemployment until inflation pressure subsides. When inflation subsides, rates will start being cut to restimulate the economy.
