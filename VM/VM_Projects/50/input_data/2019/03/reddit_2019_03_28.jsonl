A lot of parents have Netflix strictly for their kids. If Disney pulls their content off the site (and there’s a lot) in order for exclusivity, there will be a great migration of users to Disney+ or people will have both services. Given Disney owns FOX now, they will be able to cuck Netflix out of business and/or extort them for huge amounts of $$$ for their content.
