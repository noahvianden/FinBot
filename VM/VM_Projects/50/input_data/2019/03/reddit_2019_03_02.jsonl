Turning the $1600 into $4,800 then I bought SPY, AMD, AAPL calls turning that into that $4800 into $9421 as all 3 soared. Then the next day Bush died and when the market opened on the 6th SPY/AMD/AAPL all fell down hard. Spy fell from 282 to 262, AMD from 21.26 down to 19.2 , AAPL from 181 to 171. All my tendies vanished before my eyes( for months I was pissed at myself for losing all that money as I had been working 40hrs/wk for $11 at the time). \\[BTW: this all took 2 wks to do so I guess I kinda lied. but a month before I had turned $76 to $1309\\]\n\nThen I stopped trading for a while since I didn't have the funds to go on. then on Jan.19th RH lifted my Daytrader Status and I gave my two jobs( at this point I was working for 40hr-$11+monthly bonus/ 30hr-$10.5+biwkly bonus) my 2 wk notice and I started to trade full time. But, alas I did ONE stupid trade that wiped me out by wk2 of being unemployed. So I got my last check from work  1 and my tax return and put it into the stock market bringing me to today.
