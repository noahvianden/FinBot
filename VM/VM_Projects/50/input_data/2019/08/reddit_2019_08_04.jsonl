People say recession started late 2007 early 2008 but the fed actually started cuting rates during September 2007 cuz of issues with subprimes and/or rising credit default rates in anticipation/ last desperate act of preventing economic tumble. What happened after the cut? The market demanded more cuts and the fed gave and like a domino effect the economy went into chaos.
