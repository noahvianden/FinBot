I‚Äôve been following Charlie McElligot‚Äôs work and he seems to focus solely on SPX to calculate gamma risk in the market.

I noticed on Friday expiration, there was a few stocks that made good moves higher around their flip zones (TSLA, BA). Is it typically to move higher once gamma flips from negative to positive? Or was that an expiration Friday thing? I noticed the flip zone changed again for some stocks- I guess it changes weekly (daily) due to opening and closing positions? How do you trade stocks around their flip zone? Should I be avoiding long trades in stocks with large amounts of negative gamma (and vice versa for shorts)? \n\nThanks again for your time and any insights!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "To a certain degree the numbers are pretty accurate. I think the numbers on the website are calculated once per day and are not real time though, which is one reason why my numbers differ. The biggest factor on the difference in numbers is the model for calculating options price & Greeks, ie, Multinomial, Black-Scholes, Bjerksund-Stendsland, or in house crafted models.  \n\n\nThe discrepancy between SPX and SPY is IMO, because options writers love SPX. It is cash settled and so has inherently less rick. Since market making options writers are not particularly interested in profiting from underlying shares it makes sense that they would be interested in writing on SPX over SPY.  \n\n\nIf you only had time to analyze the greeks of one of those tickers yes I would focus on SPX, but like everything in the market, the connection and analysis on SPY could also be helpful, as well as /ES and really any correlated index.  \n\n\nSometimes it is important to look closely at Gamma for individual stocks, especially if you are writing options for it. For example, AMD has a pretty steep Gamma drop-off as you pass the $40 mark. This has been a contributing factor to the very strong resistance found at the $40 price point for $AMD.  \n\n\nSwing and Day traders can use Gamma exposure to add to their toolbox of useful items, however it is not a golden ticket as I'm sure you know. Brownian Walk models suggest that short term price movements are very random indeed, and knowing how brokers randomize big block orders via time sliced randomization in +/-55% order sizes, I can generally agree with this, however Gamma exposure in a given stock can show at what point resistance and support levels are more than merely coincidence. Suggesting where there may actually be strong supply and demand metrics at play.  \n\n\nGamma changes on a continuous basis because it is calculated using the total gamma of all outstanding options for whatever ticker you are looking at, so yes it not only changes daily, but constantly.  \n\n\nYes, when Gamma flips from negative to positive it may contribute to rising prices. A positive Gamma will support higher and higher price points generally until an event reverses it.  \n\n\nI would say not to avoid or go into a trade solely on gamma exposure, however when nearing a flip zone or when GEX is pinched be wary of increased volatility in that ticker.
