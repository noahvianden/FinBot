{"title": "5 reasons why I sold TSLA", "selftext": "These are just my opinions. Not investment advice. Just happy with my gains and decided to look for less stressful investments for now. Maybe I’ll be wrong, but at least I didn’t sell at $180 and nearly doubled my small investment from accumulation starting in 2018. I wanted to hold to avoid tax payments but just didn’t want to deal with the risk for now. Edit: I could always go back in and probably will if the sell off continues and remains strong. \n\n\n1. Blow off top rally / too much hype \nWith the sheer amount of volume lately, it seems like a blow off top rally that could go much higher or retract dramatically. (Given today’s 4% decline this could be more evidence of this) \n\nAlso, I’m hearing a lot of people over leveraged in the stock IMO, such as putting most of not all of their net worth into a single stock.  I’m also hearing many people asking if it’s too late to jump in... as well as people comparing buying $2k acceleration boost vs stock. That sounds like greed. \n\n It reminds me of Netflix at 400, Amazon at 2000, and Nvdia at 290 in September 2018. Analysts were all raising their prices to $500, $3,000, etc. but all pulled back dramatically. Still recovered due to strong fundamentals and record market but below ATH.\n\n2. Valuation\nEarlier this year, Tesla market cap was worth less than GM but is now nearly GM+Ford combined while selling less than 3% the volume of cars. Even if Tesla doubles sales in 2020 due to GF3+increased efficiency from Fremont and Model Y that’s 720k. If they double again due to GF4 that’s 1.4m at the end of 2022. If they double again in 2023 that’s 2.8m. Still just 25% the sales volume of GM+Ford combined. By then, I think VW and their $33b dedicated towards EVs as well as LG+GM battery factory will at least put them within striking distance of Tesla and at least slow the growth. \n\nBefore you say Tesla is a technology company or growth company, at the end of the day what are we most concerned about in a few days? Car deliveries. What will we be concerned with on earnings? Car gross margins. Can the other businesses displace the car business? Sure, but it will take time and thinking it’s not a car company today is simply hoping it isn’t just a car company next year. I don’t want to hope that I can keep my 100% gain. So I kept it. Cars are hard to build, hard to ship, hard to service. Last quarter, Ford’s revenue was greater than its market cap. Finally, comparing it to Apple right now is a bit much. Apple grew unbelievably fast. They can also put more dollar amount in inventory in a plane than Tesla can put on a ship or trailer.\n\n3. Competition\nWe all like laughing at the competition but the products hitting the roads today are the result of their seriousness three years ago (hint: they weren’t serious). The next generation of fully dedicated EVs might at least appear to be a threat. It only needs to appear to be a threat from the perspective of investors  to make investors feel uneasy and bail. Take for example all of Netflix’s competition invoking fear. Of course, Tesla isn’t slowing down and is acquiring talent but the competition is spending more than Tesla ever has and could acquire any talent they want. \n\nIn the near term, The ID3 will be available for around $35k minus $7500 credit US and $10,000 in California. I’ll pick a Tesla any day but that’s $23-$25k versus Tesla’s $40k.  The same will be for Mercedes EQC (which I think will be a competitor to Model Y and X due to luxury qualities and brand). What we see from the competition isn’t even the top of the ice berg given their investments ($33b from VW in just BEVs, GM+LG battery factory, etc)\n\n4. Autonomy\n\nI think Tesla’s autopilot system is incredible and am very impressed by their ability to render things like cones on the screen. However, I remain skeptical of things like Robotaxis and fully autonomous cars for two reasons:\n\na) I think a geo-fence approach is faster for regulatory approval. A lot of people make fun of Waymo and their 50sq mile geofence but if you’re a regulator and you notice that Waymo has a nearly impeccable track record in suburban Arizona ... aren’t you going to be more open to letting Waymo operate in your city? In fact, if Waymo masters Phoenix... the next city will be asking Waymo to join pick their city due to the economic benefits. \n\nb) I’m just not convinced that a vision-based system is the correct one at this stage. Yes, we have just two eyes - Tesla’s have 8 eyes, radars, and ultrasonics. However, we have a far more advanced CPU that can analyze objects instantly and make decisions and predictions that are relevant. \n\nTake for example this video by Scott Kubo. The reflection of the bridge appeared to fool the Autopilot system to be a lane line markings. The interesting part is that this is an extremely rare occurrence. Once per day and only during the winter (when the contra flow zipper lane is moved after/during  sunsets; during summer the sun is further up in the sky at this time of day)\n\nThe last reason why I’m not into autonomy is because too many people are. this is the source of multi-thousand-dollar price points. I think if Tesla is severely late or surpassed, some investors are going to bail. \n\n\n5. The future is unknown\nWe don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. Recession? Autonomy? Electric? Q1 sales? Model Y demand/Canibalization? It’s really hard to tell. \n\nThere’s a strong case for hybrids for the next few years, because they can be made below $20k and be fairly reliable. Also don’t tell me Tesla is recession proof. The company may be but the stock will likely not given its valuation. People sell stocks out of fear during a recession. Apple stock halved in 08/09 even though sales of iPhone exploded. \n\nAnyway, just my thoughts for now. I love Tesla but just want to take the gains for now. No I’m not a short seller.

That's how it works, otherwise we would have tons of billionaires.\n\nI don't agree with the 5 points you mentioned. For example, you said this is like Netflix at 400, Amazon at 2000, and Nvidia at 290, but NFLX rallied 1000 fold from 2002 low. It might still rally much higher. Amazon rallied more than 1000 fold before reaching $2000, and AMZN is highly likely to go up a lot in the next few years. Nvidia rallied 200 fold before reaching $290. Meanwhile, TSLA only rallied 24 fold since IPO. Just in this comparison, TSLA should get another 10\\~ 40 fold to be similar to the other three.\n\nNo other company has an addressable market like TSLA, it's literally 10 trillion dollars addressable market, Tesla is the leader by far. It's positioned to continue to lead.\n\nTesla is at a turning point to have sustained profitability. It's going to join S&P index soon. Upside is enormous both short term and long term, downside is very limited. I personally plan to add more shares even though my investment is already very large.\n\nYou said \"The last reason why I’m not into autonomy is because too many people are.\" In reality almost nobody thinks Tesla will achieve autonomy soon, if Tesla does achieve FSD, it's stock would go up 5 fold overnight. In longer term, I think Tesla's FSD approach makes the most sense. \n\nRegarding your point #5 \"5. The future is unknown We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. Recession? Autonomy? Electric? Q1 sales? Model Y demand/Canibalization? It’s really hard to tell.\"\n\nYou worry about Model Y cannibalize Model 3, but why not worry about Model Y/3 cannibalize BMW, Toyota, VW, GM etc? Those companies sell 80 million gasoline cars a year, Model Y/3 are way better. Why shorts think those companies can keep getting demand for gasoline cars?\n\nTesla said they can sell 500k Model 3 during recession, 750k during normal times. Model Y demand will be more than 1 million a year, simply because it's way better than any SUV/CUV on the market. SUV/CUV is a 30 million per year market.\n\nLong story short, for someone day trading a stock, a trader could get in and out many times in a day. Short term move is anybody's guess.

Unless you are super long-term holders, there's no point to worry too much about full autonomy right now. As long as tesla can realize part of the revenue, it's all good and all margin. The competition is not to the task and as an EV, tesla's brand and tech is superior than anyone. No competition, I am honestly confused by your investment thesis regarding this. There are several perfectly viable evs on the market right now and none of them sells well even though their prices are lower than Tesla. This is a fact and has been proven.
