I can only imagine them growing even more in that department.\n\nAlso, Intel is starting to jump into the GPU market, so Nvidia will have another competitor. \n\nWith AMD leading the CPU segment, and another competitor entering the GPU arena, I see more upside for AMD business-wise.\n\nNow if you're talking about the stock, even if AMD might have a better chance for better growth as a business, you could argue that that growth is already priced in the stock (which is what I believe). Intel is the one with the lowest PE ratio, and frankly the only one with a dividend (I don't count Nvidia's low yield lol), but again growth is much more important than dividend in that segment of the market. AMD is the one with the highest PE ratio, and Nvidia is in the middle.\n\nIf I had to bet on one of them for the next 5 years, I'll put my money on Intel because they are the one with the lowest PE ratio by far, plus they are entering in the GPU area, plus they have the cash to catch back to AMD.
