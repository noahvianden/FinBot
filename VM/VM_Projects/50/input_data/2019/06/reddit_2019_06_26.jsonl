The deal will be exclusive for five years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNBC announced the decision to remove “The Office” in [a statement](http://www.nbcuniversal.com/press-release/%E2%80%9C-office%E2%80%9D-returns-nbcuniversal-2021) on Tuesday. The hit comedy was the [most-watched Netflix show](https://www.vox.com/2018/12/21/18139817/netflix-most-popular-shows-friends-office-greys-anatomy-parks-recreation-streaming-tv) in 2018, according to data analytics firm Jumpshot. The move bolsters the potential appeal of NBC’s ad-supported streaming service, which is set to launch in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations said Netflix made an offer to keep it, but the offer was rejected. Netflix was willing to pay up to $90 million a year for the rights, but NBC topped that offer and will pay $100 million. ( “The Office” was produced by Universal Television, a different division of NBCUniversal, in association with Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions.) One idea under consideration was to split the rights, with Netflix being the home for ad-free watching, and NBC’s service being the ad-supported option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/nbc-to-remove-the-office-from-netflix.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/nbc-to-remove-the-office-from-netflix.html)", "id": "c5ikyd", "created_utc": 1561510585.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 47, "comments": [{"body": "They're being retarded and ppl will go back to illegal free streams if this fragmentation continues.", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Already started this again.
