In 2001 one of the Google founders, Page, was asked about using AI/ML to improve search results.\n\nHe responded they were doing search to create AI.    Which made total sense to me.\n\nSearch is the perfect tool to use to get there.  It can make you a zillion dollars to fund the effort.

Versus programmers doing it by hand like it was in MS Office at the time.\n\nThe singularity is also the perfect distant goal to strive for.

We are hitting that limit.\n\nBut what is happening is the organization of those transistors is changing to optimize for the type of work that is being done.\n\nSo for example for AI/ML we only need 8 bits, only integers for inference, and really mostly only the MAC instructions.  Which is multiply and accumulate.\n\nSo we create chips that are structured for this type of work and why we are getting well over a doubling of chip performance per year.\n\nThis will continue to happen. It is how Google TPU Pods are able to do over 100 peta FLOPs for example.  Or their client PVC chip can do over 3 Tflops.\n\nThe problem right now is NOT ALU.

Even for part of a company.\n\nThey spent $1.1 billion for people (acqui hire) at HTC to help with the Pixel for example.\n\nI suspect here there just was not something they could buy.  There was a not a piece of a company with the right skills that they could acquire.\n\nThe other issue is chip design skills is getting a lot more expensive as we transition the chips from the third parties like Intel and Nvidia and others to the big companies.   Amazon for example has purchased a company that had the skills and now has their own chips.     It is server chips but still chips.   Amazon did it first with hiring but then an acquisition.   They purchased Annapurna but had \"poached\" a bunch of people from Calxeda that was the small Austin based startup.   Including their CTO.  Since, I believe, shutdown.\n\nIn a weird way it is like content.    We have so many companies right now in the market to buy content that it inflates the value of the content until it settles down.  So we are hearing Apple has now entered the market for content for example.  But we already had Netflix purchasing over $13 billion dollars of content in 2019.  Yes billion.\n \n\nThis happens when we have fundamental changes in a market and it usually is not sustainable.  But will settle down eventually.   I do not think this is good for Intel and similar.\n\nI believe more and more chips will come from the big companies as part of something else and not sold.  I doubt we would ever see Google selling the chips for example.\n\nHow much business was lost by Intel not getting the iPhone for example?    \n\nBTW, Apple did it by acquiring P.A. Semi in 2008.   Which was lead by the lead for my most favorite chip in history.  The 21064.   Just a work of art.   Compaq acquired when purchased DEC and had no idea the team they had.\n\nThe lead left formed P.A Semi and was later acquired by Apple for $278 million.  Yes million.  Less than a billion dollars.    P.A. Semi was lead by Dobberpuhl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}
