INTC sucks, can't do 10nm and are calling upgraded 14nm as 10nm but dominates oem market by lock ins. AMD undercutting the prices of GPUs will likely only incrementally add to their market share. NVDA is a big competitor in data centers obviously. \n\nAMD is not about to steal a huge % of market share (goal is 15% but only at 5% with slow rise) although the overall market is growing so that should help them. This story is totally overblown though. Guidance was very poor, barely met earnings, 80 pe.\n\nIn semis I see way better value in XLNX CY & QCOM right now.
