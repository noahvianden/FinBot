{"title": "Went long QQQ calls today. I feel very dirty.", "selftext": "I had to hold my nose and buy some QQQ calls.  The world cental banks injected $1 Trillion in liquidity and if I have learned something over the decades of trading, do not fight the Fed.  While I am confidant that the world is not saved, as is evident from my CRE post, I also remember 2008 when Bear Stearns went belly up in March but it took the summer and part of the Fall until Lehman went under.  Of course, the DOJ also sued two of Bear's hedge funds in August so that helped.  The chance of the DOJ suing any investment bank or bank this time around is 1%.  I mean, they just backstopped them, again.\n\n**Other contributing factors to my QQQ long position:**\n\n1. Hedge Funds and CTA's are still overwhelmingly bearish according to multiple reports from Government Sachs, the devil (JPM) and others.\n2. QQQ is in a technical bull market now.  I don't argue with charts.\n3. There's still that $1 trillion I mentioned up above that is supposed to stabilize deposit bases.  And after 2008 the largest banks who received their bailouts, promised to lend that money out.  They didn't - they put it in risk assets - stocks.  But sure, this time they will do as they say.\n4. Hedgies are short overwhelmingly, to the tune of $28 billion SPX futures that they need to cover in April.\n5. Seasonality as shown by the attached graphic.\n6. Perfect conditions for a short squeeze on the NDX which is nowhere near overbought.\n\n**HOWEVER, there are just as many worrisome data points:**\n\n1. Since Dec 28, 50% of the gain in NDX has been from 5 stocks NVDA, AAPL, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA META.  Sorry, that's very.  See #2\n2. From the graphic, earnings are now expected to drop 12% yoy from last year.  Not good if you are a fundamental investor.\n3. There WILL be more bad news from the banking sector.  Might be a private HF or private REIT, but this is a no brainer.\n4. The Fed apparently only really wanted to get the market through the end of this quarter bc how much news have you heard from them about regulatory enforcement?  NONE.  Why? Because if they hadn't, can you freaking imagine what some of these large banks would be reporting.\n5. EOQ is the time for mutual funds and all to \"paint the tape.\"  They sell the stocks that have rec'd bad press (banks) and buy the stocks that have rec'd good press (NVDA et al.)  Translation: HF chasing over the last 3 weeks has led to the NDX advance which has held the SPX up.\n6. If the tech sector is so hot, then why have so many LARGE layoffs been announced?  And the layoffs are broad: META  -11,000; GOOGL - 12,0000; AMZN-distribution labor - 9000; Indeed - 2200 - uhm, job search site, WMT-layoffs from warehouse to distribution.  And then the one I think is hilarious are the 1400 from McKinsey and Co -who are usually the ones doing the layoffs.\n\nBTW, perhaps the easiest metric to use to know if the NDX run is over?  AAPL.  Pull up a chart.  Lately its been leading the market.\n\nFinally, despite being \"forced\" into a long QQQ position, I also put on a long VIX position today.  I mean, cmon - look at the daily chart.\n\nI hate it, I think its a joke, but I will not fight the Fed.  I hope the market elevates so I can get short at higher levels. I remain short CMBS, COIN, and CLX.
