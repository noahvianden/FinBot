{"title": "I think ISRG Intuitive Surgical, will start tanking and so buying puts is my play. Please read. There are only 2 FDA apprvd Surgical Robots", "selftext": "Put's Timeline: Late Mid 2024-2026 I am correlating this with Competitors release of their 2.0 version called Luna, more at very end of post, pics and timeline.\n\nMy Initial Position: Starting slow, looking for good deals. But I bought Jan 17th 2025 expiry PT of 95.00 for 1.20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fif9thw38ftb1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c49874b8f839a630131f038ed9730af1523df0b\n\nIm Buying/Bought $ISRG PUTS. Only Two Surgical Robots approved by the FDA. Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG enjoyed a literal monopoly for over two decades and just two years before pandemic worldwide pause, a second ever contender was FDA approved. Now it's post pandemic and it's on like Donkey Kong.\n\nIntuitive and another one that is super low market cap, wsb bot won't let me post name without deleting my post, due to it's market cap. But it's interesting to note, that despite it's small market cap, it is completely DEBT FREE, and has powerful investors / board seat members, like Andrea Biffi, from SOFAR, an Italian pharma heavy weight, now MA'd(Merger Aquisitioned) by an even larger Pharma: Alfasigma, THE LARGEST Pharmaceutical company in Italy. So I wont name it. But I believe this small Market Cap contender will eventually cause ISRG to tumble and thus making ISRG a juicy short within the next year. It's close to 300 bucks right now. So I'm buying puts on ISRG.\n\nIntuitive has super crappy technology vs recently FDA approved competitor. Competitor of Intuitive is less expensive. And has Re usable tools. Haptic Feedback for Surgeon. Eyetracking Camera. Google Cloud Healthcare AI and Nvidia partnership.\n\n1. More on Google Health Care AI Cloud Colab, Competitor has had a formal collab since February of this year: Note what Ashima Gupta Global Director of Healthcare For Google AI Cloud said back then:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dipy098l2atb1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ceb8cc19072ffb131bdf3dc9bdbb578598fb2b2\n\n2. Note what Director Said in Today's (10-9-23) Press Release to CNBC :\n\n“These are the workflows that the physicians and nurses live by day in and day out. You can’t be adding friction to it,” Gupta told CNBC in an interview. “We are very cautious of that — that we are respecting the surface they use, that the workflow doesn’t change, but yet they get the power of this technology.” Link to today's press release: where quote is from:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html)\n\nOther press release links that have GOOGL up today:\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hackensack-meridian-healths-cloud-and-data-modernization-with-google-cloud-enhances-patient-care-and-drives-innovation-301950222.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hackensack-meridian-healths-cloud-and-data-modernization-with-google-cloud-enhances-patient-care-and-drives-innovation-301950222.html)\n\n[https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708295/google-vertex-ai-search-updated-with-healthcare-and-life-sciences-capabilities.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708295/google-vertex-ai-search-updated-with-healthcare-and-life-sciences-capabilities.html)\n\nNOTE: The Hospitals that are part of Googles First Release for beta release ARE THE SAME HOSPITALS WITH SENHANCES Surgical Robots. Mayo Clinic and Hackensak. Please note that the Competitor is working to UPLOAD live video and picures and all kinds of DATASETS for AI and AI search for HEALTHCARE FIELD. Competitor has Senhances worldwide with over 10,000 procedures and like Tesla's record driver data and add it to Nueralink, the same happens with each Senhance that EACH SURGEON DRIVES, and Google / NVIDIA / Competitor are getting all Surgical Dataset gold. Very likely Google will pay Senhance creators a royalty to Competitor of ISRG. The fact is ISRG is flatfooted and will get rocked by this collab. When you see videos, links below, you will see Hackensack. And you will also see pic of Mayo Clinic Pediatrics anouncement a little over two weeks ago. See below for pics and links for further info/research/dd.\n\nIntuitive Surgical / $ISRG eye gauges the poor hospitals and surgeons by requiring them to buy new tools every 5th, 10th, 12th, or MAX: 18th surgical procedure-depending on the tool robotic tip.  Yes you read that correct. EVERY 18th SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The bulk of their revenues comes from this obvious and  unsustainable eye gauging. Vs Competitor, whose tools are able to be re used indefinitely for life of tool. One Surgical Robot Surgeon mentioned they had been using the same tools from the Competitor for over 3 years!!Please google-I have links below-but you can google for yourselves also if you like:  Carlos Mendoza Herrera Master Surgeon from Cedar Sinai in Chicago. Also google = Amit Travedi , Hackensack Medical Hospital, Carlos Mendoza Herrera / Sinai Chicago, links below.\n\nNotice picture=Also notice the open cockpit design of Competitor vs ISRG. ISRG surgical Robot Da  Vinci kills your peripheral view and forces you to hunch over, and you lose your clear line of sight of operating table and staff. Your head needs to go inside a hole in the machine.  Then you need to stare through two more holes. While on Senhance from Competitor, you keep a clear line of sight, sit comfortably upright and maintain a clear line of sight on operating table and staff. And stare a beautiful screen that's in front of you.\n\nCompetitor to ISRG currently has a formal Google Healthcare Cloud Agreement since February. And another formal agreement with juggernaut Nvidia, anounced much more recently-see pics below.\n\nMayo Clinic recently added the Competitors Surgical robot over Da Vinci becuase of all the aformentioned PLUS ISRG DOES NOT HAVE 3mm ports. In other words, 3mm is the literal size the robotic arms can cut to enter the thoracic cavity in order to operate. And so after surgical procedure, you don't have a foot long gaping wound stitched from which to heal from, but literally a 3mm cut. maybe like three 3mm cuts from which to heal from. An Inch is 25mm. To give you an idea of how small that is and how fast post operative healing can be especially for tiny infants that are a month old that can't handle 8mm or 12mm cuts the smallest ISRG has.\n\nISRG will take years to get FDA approval for a complete refresh to compete with an open cockpit design where the surgeon is upright looking at a screen. Also ISRG will take years to get 3mm approved and field pre clinically tested. Things the competitor ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVED AND IN THE MARKET AS THE MAYO CLINIC RECENTLY SHOWED. ISRG in their monopolistic comfort rested on it's laurels technology never bothered or cared to refresh their tech and upgrade, because they were the only game in town and never had to for over two decades so hospitals and doctors had to deal with what they ( $ISRG) gave them. Now they're caught flat footed.\n\n\\*A little deviation on what is Laparoscopy -and why Robotic Surgery is an evolution to that:\n\nSo the question I keep asking myself is WHY hasn't ISRG come up with 3mm port and a better open cockpit design in 23 years of their monopoly? Because they've never really needed to improve their lower tier tech, because there literally was NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAN THEM. This led to massive abuse on their part, more on that below, lawsuits and unhappy Hospitals and medical centers.\n\nAll robotic surgery crux is a minimally invasive surgery from smaller wounds you can heal from. so your up and running faster, with less pain, and can return to work, family, your routine in a much shorter time span than from an open surgery that leaves a massive wound maybe a foot long, that cuts through muscle, tendons, perhaps bones. Please see video links below for more explanation on this. They are short videos, like 2-5 minutes long. Laparoscopy was the MANUAL way of minimally invasive surgery, meaning an endoscopic camera gets placed inside your body, through a small incision and two tiny arms that are controlled manually, obviously this is a challenging form of surgery, but under skilled surgeons, extremely successful. With robotic surgery you have the steady hand, tremor free, you're able to sit down through out the process, and lessen the fatigue of hours long surgeries, ergo more successful, and safer surgeries, perhaps one after the other. Plus Software like no fly zones where the robot arm cannot extend and injure or maim a certain organ accidentally-something not avail with manual Laparascopy. Something ISRG does NOT have but Senhance does. See Lawsuits link below. Also measuring distances between organs, etc, can be done with software. VS inserting a phsyical sterilized ruler which was the way it was done before manually without the robotics-but still done with ISRG. Also articulated instruments inside the abdomen, add more dexterity with robotic surgical systems.  These are the advantages of Robotic Surgeriy over manual minimally invasive Laparoscopic surgeries. So robotic surgery is a level above manual laparascopy. Manaual Laparascopy was a level up from traditional open surgery.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1imbfz7u9tb1.jpg?width=2254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e5bd9cdb7b6baa35464216d31b101a3ffa99126\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xci95rxfu9tb1.jpg?width=2527&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4464f9f8789bc2122e3761c24946b6b14f21ff9d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nnbxodau9tb1.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7e8e43a9e14ecaf2407a6c9a17162446e22cdef\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpx4m6aju9tb1.jpg?width=2205&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e273bb0eb0b38ab8bb3c360ad9b7f0bcb77adc6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9goamytpu9tb1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a885341ead73d490af5307a68b79d86011d7b1a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ll0j2zfsu9tb1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=7652bc0b1541771be87a2020bef95d65eb68dda7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuhxkrj85atb1.jpg?width=1044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4be72bc25d696747823e2aa8708942b7666dd202\n\nISRG tries to scrub their lawsuits on the internet but no die.

For example, in 2021, a 56-year-year old man received a $700,000 settlement after he sued his surgeon for cutting a hepatic duct during a da Vinci-assisted gallbladder procedure.\" (Looks like this surgeon could have benefited from the No Fly Zone software Senhance has to AVOID robot arms accidentally harming interior organs during operation, that ISRG lacks)\n\n[https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/new-concerns-on-robotic-surgeries/](https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/new-concerns-on-robotic-surgeries/)\n\nHospitals in Japan and Germany, and USA(Now the Mayo Clinic as of last week), using Senhance over Da Vinci.

Go to competitors website, and click on Investors and then Presentations and Events. It will be the latest top event: Date: Sept 26, 2023 : Cantor Global Healthcare Conference. Watch timestamp: 22:37 , entire video is like 24 minutes long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Timeline for Luna Commercial Availability under an assured 510K from FDA:](https://preview.redd.it/xlof1a9ky9tb1.jpg?width=1561&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7cfb1ee8fae82ca7a50e8b68614a63059a06fc76)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggbc754my9tb1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee6f4899399b4ddb3fe5a050e6bf2d6528f397e2\n\nI do think it ( $ISRG ) will tank, so that's why I'm posting on why I believe ISRG will bite the dust soon enough. And letting you guys know about it. It's a big thick juicy short, over 200 hundred bucks, close to 300 bucks a share. And short puts are relatively inexpensive right now. Not too inexpensive but still inexpensive in my book, very manageable price. My view is it took Tesla 17 years to become profitable in a multi competitor arena, there were several cars people could choose from. Here? there's ONLY TWO in the ENTIRE VAST MARKET of Surgeries, which all will be moving in some way shape or form to digitized, robotics. So either ISRG stops resting on it's monopolistic laurels or gets taken to the barn out back and shot, like Ford, GM, Chrysler/Stellantis has, by Tesla. Another fun fact: Toyota: It took them 26 years to become profitable. My point, This is LITERALLY a two man market. Competitor and ISRG. And one is lagging with tech and customer satisfaction and treatment, while the other is excelling.\n\nI'll be editing the post as time goes by, with any further news or updates. I hope you guys pitch in too in the comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10,000 plus procedures have been performed worldwide by Senhances.\n\ngoogle it, link has bot term, but here is the pic:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcc8x1u09ftb1.png?width=1131&format=png&auto=webp&s=6418b61da525e8036f489b4707de62ebc575ff42\n\nUpdate to Post:\n\nNEWS TODAY\\*: 10-11-23 FOR CALIFORNIA STATE: RIGHT TO REPARI YOUR OWN EQUIPMENT: Seems pretty broad, and looking like it could cover DA VINCI Machines, meaning ISRG CANNOT force OUT a THIRD PARTY MAINTENANCE/ REPAIR which is more hits to their monopolistic bottom line: more here: [https://www.theverge.com/23910066/right-to-repair-law-newsom-california-sb-244](https://www.theverge.com/23910066/right-to-repair-law-newsom-california-sb-244)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot having Haptics is truly becoming an issue with ISRG:\n\nDr. Kanayama says Da Vinci HAS NO BUSINESS promoting, or putting themselves out there as an Endometriosis Surgical Treatment Alternative: [https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/procedures/gynecology/endometriosis-resection](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/patients/procedures/gynecology/endometriosis-resection)\n\nNote an excerpt from their website, note how they mention they are NOT qualified Medically, they just make a machine Doctors use. And yet they negate precisely a Doctor and specialist on Endometriosis. An excerpt from Intuitives Website:\n\n\" There are two minimally invasive approaches: laparoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted surgery (possibly with da Vinci technology). Both are performed through a few small incisions in the abdomen. To perform a laparoscopic endometriosis procedure, surgeons use special long-handled tools while viewing magnified images from the laparoscope (camera) on a video screen. \"\n\nContrast this with what Dr. Nakayama says about Endometriosis:\n\nLook at his Highlight Stories, totally trashing and ripping into Da Vinci:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/newyorkendometriosis/](https://www.instagram.com/newyorkendometriosis/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso it looks liek Nvidia, is REALLY REALLY after Live Real World Surgical Data Sets, and had invested in Moon Surgical Surgical Robot barely in concept phase 55mil.

Quite an enjoyable read. I’m curious of 2 things which you may have already stated but I suck at reading. \n1) Why puts on ISRG instead of shares or calls (if possible) on the alternative?\n2) I’m not sure I followed the timeline. What is the time frame on the puts and why do you think they are going to go down during that timeframe. Alternately stated, why do you think the market is going to react to the competition now?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Oh why puts on ISRG? because it will go down, in my estimation and view. Within a year or two it will start to tank. It's too prideful and likely will not try to buy or MA with Competitor. And likely Competitor will likely not allow themselves to be bought out by them, when pedal hits the metal. Besides, WSB won't allow me to post bully on a penny stock, so the next best thing is to place puts on the monopoly I personally think will fall. And I do think it will tank, so that's why I'm posting on why I believe ISRG will bite the dust soon enough. And letting you guys know about it. It's a big thick juicy short, over 200 hundred bucks, close to 300 bucks a share. And short puts are relatively inexpensive right now. Not too inexpensive but still inexpensive in my book, very manageable price. My view is it took Tesla 17 years to become profitable in a multi competitor arena, there were several cars people could choose from. Here? there's ONLY TWO in the ENTIRE VAST MARKET of Surgeries, which all will be moving in some way shape or form to digitized, robotics. So either ISRG stops resting on it's monopolistic laurels or gets taken to the barn out back and shot, like Ford, GM, Chrysler/Stylantis has, by Tesla. Another fun fact: Toyota: It took them 26 years to become profitable. My point, This is LITERALLY a two man market. Competitor and ISRG.
