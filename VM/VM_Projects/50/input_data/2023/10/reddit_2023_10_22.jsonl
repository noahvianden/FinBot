Affording the fundamentals like food and rent is getting harder and harder for middle class families, and I believe that even if people don't transition out of the Apple ecosystem they may decide to wait an extra year or two before buying a new phone.\n\nThe advancement in phone technology has become largely meaningless over the last 5 years and I personally haven't seen any major performance improvements in my every day life.
