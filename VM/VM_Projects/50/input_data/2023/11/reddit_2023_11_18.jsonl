By encouraging customers to top-up their accounts, the coffee chain has overtaken most banks in terms of assets. 85% of US banks have less than $1 billion in total assets, illustrating the major player Starbucks has become in this space. \n*  Unlike mainstream banks, Starbucks does not have to abide by regulations around storing customer funds in either a segregated bank account or investing in low-risk government bonds. As Starbucks card balances cannot be directly exchanged for regular currency, but rather to buy in-store items, Starbucks is free to use these funds however they like. In practice, this allows them to use these funds to seek out opportunities in areas such as expansion and operations. \n*  Customers can never convert the money they deposit back to cash, while the company uses the collective amount as it pleases without any fault in the country's financial regulations.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I found a $15 gift card yesterday in a welcome package for a resort wedding back in 2014.
