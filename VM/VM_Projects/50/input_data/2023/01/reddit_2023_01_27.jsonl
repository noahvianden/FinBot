This change will boost the company's earnings by decreasing the amount of depreciation expense it reports each year.  \n\nWhile Intel may argue that this change aligns with industry standards and is in line with the useful life of its assets, the timing of the move is suspect.

But this is an undercount.\n\n>“We’re seeing right now the highest death rates we’ve ever seen in the history of this business....**COVID deaths are greatly understated**\"\n\n>https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/insurance-death-rates-working-age-people-up-40-percent\n\n>COVID-19 deaths in the US continue to be undercounted, research shows, despite claims of ‘overcounts’ \n\n>https://theconversation.com/covid-19-deaths-in-the-us-continue-to-be-undercounted-research-shows-despite-claims-of-overcounts-198266\n\nLet's do some analysis with a state of the art AI on how this plays out.\n\nHow bad would a disease be if it killed 1.1 million people in 3 years in the United States? Assume this is a significant undercount. \n\n>Such a disease outbreak would be devastating, resulting in a significant loss of life and likely causing widespread panic and disruption to daily life. It would likely lead to a significant strain on healthcare systems, and could potentially result in economic and societal consequences as well. Additionally, the undercounting of deaths suggests that the true impact of the disease may be even greater than the reported number.\n\nWould this scenario lead to social unrest or revolution?\n\n>It is possible that a disease outbreak that killed 1.1 million people in 3 years in the United States could lead to social unrest or even revolution, depending on a variety of factors such as the government's response, the public's perception of the crisis, and the availability of resources to help those affected.\n\n>If the outbreak is perceived as being mishandled by the government, or if there is a lack of resources and support for those affected, it could lead to widespread dissatisfaction and protests. If the situation continues to deteriorate, it could potentially lead to more extreme forms of social unrest such as riots or revolution.\n\nWhat would happen to stock prices in this scenario\n\n>In a scenario where a disease outbreak kills 1.1 million people in 3 years in the United States, it's likely that stock prices would decrease. This is because the outbreak would likely lead to a decrease in economic activity, which would negatively impact companies' earnings and revenue. Additionally, the widespread panic and disruption to daily life caused by the outbreak could also lead to a decrease in consumer and business confidence, which can further decrease stock prices.\n\nWhat would happen to interest rates in the scenario\n\n>In a scenario where a disease outbreak kills 1.1 million people in 3 years in the United States, it's likely that interest rates would decrease. This is because in times of economic uncertainty and recession, central banks often lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which can help stimulate the economy.\n\nWhat would happen to gold prices in the scenario\n\n>In a scenario where a disease outbreak kills 1.1 million people in 3 years in the United States, it's likely that gold prices would increase. This is because gold is often considered a safe-haven asset, which means that during times of economic and political uncertainty, investors tend to flock to gold as a way to protect their wealth.\n\nSpy. 110. Bank runs. Riots. Protests. Stocks to dump. Gold to soar. Physical gold. Not that GLD shit. It dumps when there is no liquidity.\n\nThe WHO will declare the pandemic major issues again on Friday.

{"title": "Why did Tesla cut prices on all its vehicles: A Business Analysis POV", "selftext": "The recent price cuts to all of Tesla's vehicles have caused a lot of speculation as to why they decided to do this in such a haste manner. People have discussed possible reasons from increased competition, losing revenue, or poor customer demand. I dove into Tesla's latest financial documents to try and understand precisely what's behind some of these changes. The first place I go is the latest 10K and 10Q. I use an application called the Account Value Mapping platform, which breaks down any organization's business strategy into five parts: their goals or drivers, the investments objectives they're trying to achieve, the benefits or outcomes they're trying to produce, the business changes or campaigns they're running, and lastly, the enabling changes or projects. This will give us a deep insight into what's going on within Tesla and help us understand why they decided to cut those prices the way they did at the beginning of this year.   \n\n\nTesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, and electric vehicles are a means to an end in that respect. They're making heavy investments in their storage business, building proprietary batteries and how they're developed. Tesla's goal is not just about building cars, it's about helping the entire world transition to sustainable energy, and the vehicles are just a means to an end. They also note that their future growth and success depend on customer demand for electric vehicles, and the automotive industry is generally competitive, cyclical, and volatile. Specifically, they call out the importance of the Model 3 and Model Y, as they are in the subcompact and smaller SUV market, where they are trying to gain the most market share and competition.   \n\n\nTo achieve this goal, Tesla is focused on increasing vehicle production capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing their battery technologies, improving their full self-driving capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of their vehicles, bringing new products to market, and expanding their global infrastructure. Tesla is betting big on efficiency and how quickly they can build their factories, as well as making their existing factories as efficient as possible, to ultimately produce vehicles that are affordable for people and take the same budget that they would for an ICE vehicle and apply it towards an electric car. Additionally, they focus on designing, developing, manufacturing, leasing, and selling high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products.   \n\n\nThe Price Cuts have been something Tesla has been planning to do; however, given the current competitive environment, the improvements and operational milestones they've reached with their giga factories and government incentives now available accelerated those timelines. This was a calculated move and not just an impulsive decision made by Elon Musk or its executive members.", "id": "10ms851", "created_utc": 1674844451.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|21 hours ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|13 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes.
