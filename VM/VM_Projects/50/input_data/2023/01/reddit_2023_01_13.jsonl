{"title": "AMC and APE Serious DD... It is all gambling anyways so probably best not to read…", "selftext": "My last serious DD I posted on a stock was about Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) and why they were headed to zero. While my timing might have been off their finances pretty much followed what I thought it would. Time to do the same for AMC.\n\nJust a clarification… When I say “AMC” I refer to the company. When referring to the specific tickers will use $AMC and $APE.\n\nAlso, a warning… This is going to be long and detailed. Only read if you are interested in serious DD analyzing the fundamentals here. I try to minimize any speculation in my comments here and try to stock to factual points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$APE vs $AMC**\n\n***What is $APE and $AMC***\n\nTo start with a brief discussion on the difference between $AMC and $APE shares is helpful.\n\nIn August 2022 AMC issued a ‘stock dividend’ of 1 unit of $APE for each share of $AMC owned, accordingly at that time for every share of $AMC there was a unit of $APE outstanding. The number of outstanding $AMC shares at the time was around 500,000,000 so there would also be about 500,000,000 million $APE units outstanding then.\n\nThe $APE units (you can call them shares instead of units) when created had contractual rights to be converted to $AMC shares, ***IF*** *at some point there are enough $AMC shares to allow conversion of all the $APE units*. In order for this to happen it would require a board resolution and shareholder vote to increase the number of $AMC shares. The conversion ratio (before factoring in any splits, reverse-splits, or future stock dividends) was 1 $APE unit = 1 $AMC share. Any splits or the like would require adjusting the conversion ratio accordingly.\n\nThe $APE units have participation rights in AMC equivalent to $AMC shares. This means if the company were to ever issue a dividend, each unit $APE gets the same dividend as each share $AMC does. The $APE units also have equivalent voting rights to $AMC.\n\nIf following; from a strict investment standpoint, $APE and $AMC are the exact same thing and you should buy the lower priced of the two. If you are looking at this from a squeeze potential you may have other considerations that determine why you may want to buy one or the other.\n\n***Why did AMC create $APE if it is the same as $AMC?***\n\nIf $APE effectively is the same as $AMC a question arises as to WHY the company did this.\n\nThe purpose of creating the $APE units was to help with raising funds. In addition to the 500M $APE units issued in the stock dividend there were approximately another 500M $APE units created and retained by AMC that could be sold to raise needed cash.\n\nAn alterative option to raising funds would have been to increase the number of $AMC shares and sell those, however the company believed attempting a shareholder vote to increase the number of $AMC shares would fail and accordingly that was not a viable solution.\n\nWith $APE, the Board of Directors found a “loophole” that they determined allowed them without a shareholder vote to create the $APE units and accomplish fundraising via that. The end result of all this is that assuming the $APE units are all sold there would be about 1 billion $APE units vs 500 million $AMC units outstanding. In any future shareholder vote, in such a scenario, the owners of the $APE units would easily outvote owners of the $AMC shares. This was by design as they wanted the $APE units to be an attractive way of investing in the company. Naturally, as evidenced by the price discrepancy between $AMC and $APE this failed spectacularly and the company raised far less funds for the $APE shares sold than it should have.\n\n***$APE Endgame – Conversion***\n\nIn the end we have this overly complex scheme to create $APE units in order to get around the roadblocks preventing them from raising additional capital. Perhaps AMC hoped to sell the $APE units based on a price of $15+ a share (*look at what $AMC was trading at in August 2022 when $APE was issued*) and raise $7.5 billion ($15 x 500M shares), unfortunately through 12/21/2022 they raised only about $162.4 million on sales of about 110 million $APE unit due to the share price decline. The end result is that the amount raised was clearly far less than what was hoped here.\n\nOn 12/22/2022 the company entered into an agreement with Antara to effectively buy 257 million $APE units for $210 million. This agreement limited further sales of $APE units to $40M worth (*assume Antara would have wanted this to prevent dilution and decline in value of $APE prior to conversion*). The agreement also required a shareholder vote within 90 days to increase the number of $AMC shares allowing for conversion. When that vote happens, Antara’s 257M shares are agreed to be voted in favor of that resolution. *It is important to understand that the company cannot raise additional funds via APE at this time and accordingly their only viable option is to increase the number of $AMC shares which also allows for conversion, hence it was in the company’s interest to ensure Antara will vote yes.*\n\nThe number of outstanding shares that can vote are summarized as follows:\n\n||$AMC|$APE|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Est. shares outstanding 12/21/2022|516,820,595|642,750,982|\n|Shares sold to Antara|0|257,137,472|\n|Est. shares outstanding when vote happens|516,820,595|899,888,454|\n\n*\\[The SEC filings on 12/22/2022 specify the number of $APE shares. The SEC filings on 11/8/2022 specify the number of $AMC shares. There is no known way the actual numbers could be significantly different than the final totals above as limits on number of shares issued for $AMC or rights of the company to sell $APE limit any difference here\\]*\n\nWhen the vote happens (must happen within 90 days of 12/22/2022), based on the current price discrepancy between $AMC and $APE it is clearly in the $APE unit holders interest to vote for conversion and with the number of votes they can muster as compared to $AMC it seems inevitable that this resolution will pass. Before factoring the impact of any splits or the like in, post-conversion there will be about 1.4 Billion $AMC shares outstanding (899,888,454 + 516,820,595).\n\nI think it is a reasonable assumption that post-conversion we will see shareholders like Antara and others who formerly held $APE sell their shares of $AMC driving down the share price accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$AMC Squeeze?**\n\nWell of course there is a possibility of a squeeze in $AMC in the two months or so before that vote happens and conversion happens. However, every day we get closer to that vote the risk of shorting should decline.\n\nAlso, if a squeeze does happen it may result in the price discrepancy between $AMC and $APE increasing which could drive 2 behaviors that would limit the extent of a squeeze.\n\n1. Shareholders of $AMC would be tempted to sell $AMC and buy $APE. For example, if $AMC, reaches a share price of $14 vs $APE being at $1.40 for each $AMC you sell, you can buy 10X the amount of $APE shares and post-conversion you have 10X the amount of shares.2.\n2. It creates an increasingly profitable arbitrage opportunity where for those willing and having sufficient collateral, you can short an equal number of shares of $AMC and go long $APE. At conversion such a position will be cancelled out. At $14 a share $AMC and $1.40 a unit $APE such an opportunity would result in $12.6 in profit per matched share.\n\nGiven the above I think the possibility of a squeeze becomes more remote each day we get closer to the deadline for that conversion vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Financial State of AMC and Why Continued Dilution Should be Expected**\n\nPer Box Office Mojo, Quarter 4 of 2022 Domestic box office gross is $1.775 Billion vs $2.068 Billion for Quarter 4 of 2021, roughly a 14% decline. Of course, if you compare Q3’ 2022 to Q3’ 2021 or other earlier quarters against each other there are substantial increases in revenue, but for Q4 there is not. For 2023, various projections have box office gross increasing about 12%.\n\nWhile analyzing what is the minimum revenue AMC needs to be profitable is challenging, I did come up with an aggressive minimum of $750 million in Admission revenue per quarter (so about $3 billion in admission revenue per year). This is assuming various costs remain relatively low.\n\nThe following shows the Admission Revenue vs Income Before Taxes (in millions):\n\n||Q3' 2022|Q2' 2022|Q1' 2022|Q4' 2021|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Admissions Revenue|545.3|651.0|443.8|666.6|\n|Income Pre-tax|\\-225.1|\\-121.0|\\-337.3|\\-130.7|\n\nIf we add-back depreciation and instead deduct CAPEX it is roughly a $40-60 million improvement in pre-tax income, so still all losses.\n\nBased on the Q4’ 2022 decline in box office receipts as compared to 2021, I think reasonable to assume results will be closer to Q3’ 2022 and we may see a pre-tax loss of somewhere around $200 million.\n\nIf Q4’ 2022 revenue is $575 million, then the total 2022 admission revenue will be about $2.2 billion. Assuming for 2023 the revenue grows 12% that brings us to about $2.5 billion in revenue, still short of the $3 billion I believe is required to be minimally profitable.\n\nA brief look at the 9/30/2022 financials shows that there is a stockholder’s deficit of about $2.6 billion. Without having to get into the details of what the assets and liabilities here are, based on continuing losses foreseeable for 2023 there is no clear path via operating results to pay down that debt. Perhaps in 2024 or 2025 the situation may change but currently their current assets continue to decline and without remedial action their liquidity is declining.\n\nIn terms of 2023 they have $471 million in long-term debt coming due so offset that with $370 million raised via sales of $APE and add the $200 million loss for Q4’ 2022 to that and we have a year-end decline in liquidity of about $100 million. In terms cash… They had $685 million in cash at 9/30/2022 and should be obvious that this is headed the wrong way.\n\nTheir most substantial debt (about $3.4 billion) is due in 2026. This means that unless the company can turn things around between 2023 and 2024 it is almost certain that by 2025 they would be out of luck as their ability to refinance the debt then would be materially impaired. Practically speaking the company can decide to watch its finances continue to erode this year and hope 2024 is a great year that turns things around or they can just bite the bullet now and raise whatever cash they possibly can.\n\nA look back at 2019 before the pandemic shows that they were losing money even then. Basically, the assumption that they can rely on a return to theaters to power past their debt issues is not supported by past results. The obvious conclusion is that raising funds NOW before people are more keenly aware of their disastrous financials is necessary. Waiting to 2024, when who knows whether we will see a recession or even worse stock market, does not seem viable here.\n\nIn light of the above, I think the actions the Board took with issuing $APE and now moving forward with the process to allow for conversion is all clearly necessary as part of their overall plan to continue raising funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, What Happens?**\n\nObviously, the key question is what happens now? \n\nBefore I share my thoughts, here is some market cap history for $AMC… In Sep 2018 it was worth about $2.2 billion, in Aug 2019 it was worth about $1.2 billion. In Feb 2020 in the midst of dilution it was worth $778 million. At the current share price for $AMC of $4.94 a share, assuming post-conversion there are 1.4 billion shares that is a market cap of $6.92 billion, but using the current share price of $APE of $1.58 that is a market cap of $2.21 billion. Obviously, there is a price mismatch here, but consider BBBY and how it fell apart the moment big money walked away from it. It fell apart very quick. With the upcoming conversion here and the fallout from that we will possibly see an even more significant event than what happened with BBBY.\n\nSo, my thoughts as to what happens are as follows:\n\n1. End of Feb 2023 they announce year end 2022 earnings. The results as I expect show continued weakness (perhaps even a going concern). Projections for 2023 don’t offer much hope of seeing a profit either. This dampens “investor” confidence in the continued outlook for the company or at least will cause people to think twice before buying additional shares. I would think this, combined with the upcoming vote may drop $AMC to under $1 a share, perhaps $0.75 a share. \n2. End of Mar 2023 the vote to increase $AMC shares passes and all the $APE convert, resulting in 1.4 billion $AMC shares outstanding. This is followed rapidly by hundreds of millions of shares of $AMC sold by former $APE holders dropping the price as few are willing to buy (might already drop before as a result of substantially increased shorting of $AMC offset by long $APE positions if the price mismatch continues). If I had to guess, I would not be surprised if $AMC declines to about $0.50 a share as a result.\n3. A reverse split is also affected reducing the outstanding shares 1:10 so to about 140 million and adjusting the price 10X to $5.00 a share (market cap about $700 million).\n4. Company attempts to sell as many $AMC shares as they can, based on whatever resolutions would have passed in the end of March meeting in order to raise as much funds as possible. My guess is this will drop the share price further to say $2.50 a share (pre-reverse-split $0.25 a share) before 2023 is over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So How Do I Make Money Here?**\n\nCongrats on making it this far… If you don’t make money at least you are better educated.\n\nJust a warning, the following make timing and value judgements and while I am very certain of the inevitable decline of AMC as described to some extent above, I am a terrible trader who no matter how smart I think I am, manages to bungle timing.\n\n1. If you have the collateral and are comfortable sitting through a possible squeeze (more likely a mini-squeeze) then shorting $AMC and going long a matching amount of $APE should be profitable. Of course, carries the risk of a squeeze and seeing a large loss, pre-conversion, so not for everyone.\n2. Look to 3/17/2023 Puts that pay off if the price is $1.00, with potential for further profit if the price declines to $0.75.\n3. Look to 4/21/2023 Puts that pay off if the price is $0.75 with potential for further profit if the price declines to $0.50.\n4. Look to 1/19/2024 Puts that pay off if the price is $0.50 with potential for further profit if the price declines to $0.25.\n5. I would be very cautious with Jan 2025 puts and likely stay away… What happens if the company manages to sell 1.5 billion shares for $0.50 each raising $750 million and in 2024 improvement in the industry results in some profit. Suddenly a market cap of $1.5B+ might be justified, which would be a share price of at least $0.50. Very difficult to find interesting options for then. If anything, if holding Jan 2025 puts would look to sell them well before Jan 2025.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References for anyone wanting to see sources for the info presented:**\n\n$APE unit registration statement - describes rights, number issued and conditions for conversion\n\n[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/3f3ec8db-88e0-4c69-8bfb-11ee45ab6932.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/3f3ec8db-88e0-4c69-8bfb-11ee45ab6932.pdf)\n\nAntara agreement - specifies when vote must happen, number of $APE shares outstanding, and other related matters\n\n[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0e0d4471-14e0-44b9-8469-8943748268d7.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0e0d4471-14e0-44b9-8469-8943748268d7.pdf)\n\nQ3' 2022 10-Q report - outstanding share counts as of 11/8/2022 can be found here as well as most recent financial data for AMC\n\n[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/7c0aba5e-4ef5-4c8c-8098-08ab92d22722.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/7c0aba5e-4ef5-4c8c-8098-08ab92d22722.pdf)\n\nBox Office Mojo link - you can see gross box office proceeds\n\n[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/month/by-year/2022/?grossesOption=calendarGrosses](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/month/by-year/2022/?grossesOption=calendarGrosses)", "id": "10ap1nz", "created_utc": 1673597260.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "You're not wrong, it's just that smart money already knows this, and puts etc. are already pricing in AMC's slow bleed out. \n\nSo they'd have to fail harder than the fail that is already priced in for you to make money.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "True...
