{"title": "Silvergate Bank $SI most heavily shorted financial company", "selftext": "I follow Bitcoin stuff and noticed Silvergate bank $SI --small bank in California that's been pioneering business with crypto companies-- is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the whole market (61% sold short), and is down 94% from ATH.\n\nGoing long seems attractive when you consider that while BTC has been rallying from $15k to $23k, $SI is still suppressed. SI's position should be strengthening over time as it becomes clearer the crypto market may be in recovery...\n\nThe market is worried SI is embroiled in the FTX scandal because they banked FTX and facilitated many of their funds transfers. But what SI was doing was legal. If there was any impropriety then they could face a fine, but there's no indication of that and that wouldn't likely be an existential threat. SI =/= FTX.\n\nSI had massive outflows of deposits last quarter (70%), but that was actually pretty normal for the crypto industry thanks to the scammer SBF. All of the crypto exchanges had huge outflows.\n\nBig clients of SI came out in support of them making statements about how they're still using the service (they have a service offering for crypto companies called the SEN network), so while they might've been on life support, that 30% of remaining deposits seems solid.\n\nThey pulled off getting a massive $4.3b loan from FHLB, not even the lender of last resort for a regulated bank like SI. They also downsized staff to cut costs. The market should like news like this but in this case the stock remained suppressed...\n\nIMO hedge funds enjoy shorting crypto stocks (esp. SI rn) for a few reasons:\n\n- They're liquid and volatile\n- Their moves are a veiled or even subconscious attempt to justify a deep faith in the fiat money paradigm that fuels their frivolous industry\n- Their education and experience is normie finance: macro, TA, MTT, FX, central banking, and they don't give the right weight to cryptocurrency (they think it's going to zero which would = huge payday for them)\n\nIf you believe in BTC as an investment at this time in history, then it's easy enough to see SI as a short term trade while we shake out the hedge funds. That's what I've done and I'm about even so far (entered $14).\n\nUPDATE FEB 2:\n\nFor the record I dumped on the way up from $15.50 to $22 for an average price of $19-20. Maybe one of my kids can go to college afterall.\n\nThe move from $14 to $24 was so abrupt that I question whether the bid will now dry up and the shorts will come back to whack it down to $17-19. Definitely still looking at the stock and considering going long again and potentially holding $SI long term.\n\nFEB 8\n\nSI still heavily shorted. Price came back to $17.50 so I reinvested 25% of my previous gain, into at the money calls this time. Why the fuck not?\n\nFEB 13/14\n\nSignificantly increased my position size buying Feb 17 $15 & $17 calls.\n\nFEB 16\n\nI dumped all of my options on the way down from $21 to $20. Looking to get back in when smoke clears.\n\nFEB 27\n\nGrabbed a few MAR 17 calls. Price is back down to $14 and it's still as heavily shorted (~71-76% sold short). Seems like a good time to get in looking for another rip to $20+.\n\nMAR 2 \n\nBought moar options when price tanked to ~$6. I think bad news about SI viability beyond 12 months was mostly priced in already ie market overreacted taking it so low. Looking for bounce into $8-10 range.\n\nMAR 8 \n\nSI winding down... I was wrong about viability and got rekt. I knew the risks. Maybe SOL but it's not over. My trades overall went very well but if it goes to zero I'll have given half my gains back -_-\n\nMar 27\n\nStill trading $SI. In at $1.60 out at $1.90 last week. Today in at $2.30... Still holding $5.00 long term options as well. Thesis: Equity value likely higher than $4-5 forecast with crypto ripping (assumed they have positive crypto exposure on balance sheet) + MicroStrategy paying back $205m loan, potential for short squeeze as tons of open shorts.\n\nMar 30\n\nAveraged down to $2. Dip on low volume, should mean *many* shorts in delicate position and needing exit while getting is good for them.\n\n--\n\n*What's a good way to view short interest on a stock?\n\nRecommendations:\n\ngumps101 - https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SI&p=d\n\ntrollerroller - https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest", "id": "10lz2t0", "created_utc": 1674758598.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|14 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: I think SI is worth considering for a long term trade, esp. if you're bullish on BTC, and also for a short term trade to shake out hedge fund shorts from the market.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Incorrect, bot.
