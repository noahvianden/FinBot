Should I continue at close to purchase price for higher premium or try to price otm more. \n\n3. Protection, how much is worth it. I don’t mind holding stocks till they come back up to sell (any premium is a gain in my mind). I know the names and read about some but never tried do to uncertainty. \n\n4. Should I stay the path of multiple individual stocks or aim for a single ETF. (TSLA is becoming more of a red flag to me, even if the premiums look so tempting).\n\n5. what else should I be keeping record of (I was thinking about capital gains tax due to short ownership of stocks)\n\nI know what I do is as basic as option trading gets, and fine with that… but I should know more about what is around me in the market and not just premium chasing.

The purpose of this account is to create an income stream from premiums (not growth, that I do in another account). I trade weekly expirations, well, weekly. So for example on Monday morning I'll set up my trades with an expiration of that Friday. I'll usually pick 3-5 equities per week. I've been doing CSPs, not CCs, but the basics hold. If, in theory, I was put a stock and it went to zero immediately, it wouldn't affect my lifestyle now or in the future. If it happened to all 5 simultaneously, it wouldn't be fun, but tolerable. Further objective is to achieve a return of the S&P 500 index + 600 basis points in the account on an annual basis (600 basis points being a half-percent per month).\n\nWith that background, you may be able to pick out some ideas. But to further address your concerns in particular...\n\nRe: #1 -- as addressed, I do weekly expirations\n\nRe: #2 -- I generally do mine setting the strike at/near market\n\nRe: #4 -- I do individual stocks\n\nThings really boil down to a) your objectives and b) your risk tolerance.\n\nIs your goal to achieve a certain level of income from premium, or are you looking at growing your stocks and enhancing the return by using options, or something else? Sounds like the 2nd to me. If that's the case, then what you're doing may be fine (broadly speaking) -- it may be more a matter of stock picking. \n\nWhile comparing to a more passive approach (e.g., S&P index) is fine and useful overall, you may wish to compare how you did to the stocks you own as well. That way you can break out the difference between stock performance and premium accumulation. If you're happy owning XYZ stock and it went down, well, it sucks, but okay. But don't confuse that with how your options performed. \n\nTake a look at your premium divided by the stock price. Based on my objectives, I'm getting around 2%+. Let's look at your first line -- March 6, expiring March 31, with a strike of $172.50 for a premium of $0.17. On March 6, AAPL closed around $153/$154, so the $172.50 strike was quite a bit OTM. Getting back to what I said earlier, if your purpose it to enhance your holdings, that's an okay approach, but if I applied my objectives, that premium would be far too low to trade. \n\nTo be more direct: if your objective is closer to mine, I wouldn't have traded options on most of those equities because they aren't rich enough in premiums.\n\nAlmost didn't put this here, but why not. My rolling 13 week (quarter) has me up 18.25% (S&P 500 up \\~8.5%). The market has been kind to me. Having said that, there's a big gap between your returns and mine -- and I'm not \"boasting\" -- it's simply to show that there probably are a number of things you could do to improve your results if your objectives/risk profile support it. Options give you so much flexibility with their numerous strategies, underlying equites, strike prices, and expiration dates.\n\nAs an aside, I used to trade CCs on my growth stocks in my growth portfolio, but I've essentially stopped as those occasional times when something was called away was inevitably when there was a big run up that I left money on the table. The low premiums I made when not called weren't large enough to offset the money left on the table. I'm a simple person, so I like simplicity. That's why I have a growth portfolio, a dividend portfolio, and an options portfolio, and never the twain shall meet <g>. Different objectives and helps keep me focused.\n\nSelling CSPs is not much different than selling CCs. If instead of selling CSPs I wanted to do CCs, I'd look for stocks to do a \"buy/write\" and set the weekly expiration strike close to the market price. For example, if a stock was at $108.43, I'd set a strike of either $108 or $109 (presuming no $108.50). If the stock got called away...great!! If not, I'd look at the next week's premiums and make some determination whether to continue playing it with CCs or take the loss and move on.\n\nIf you wanted to discuss more you own personal objectives and risk profile, we could take it from there.

Absolutely everywhere in a society with these two tools you can ascribe risk to a projected outcome. That risk means volatility means cost. Which you get and we all pay as a society in the higher prices of products. But don't worry, I will stick to the point.\n\nNothing has a buyer that doesn't add perceived value to some human. In the case of options, its \"value\" is to give the market and coporations an instrument for price stability to fit forecasts which are even mandated i.e. regulated these days.\n\nThe value from options is hedging not a casino. The casino is only on top. We all love to gamble. The value of the stock market is to provide the greatest amounts of cash to corporations in order to spend the most, get the most minds and built cool stuff in the shortest amounts of time.

I haven't met a human yet who doesn't go unconcious for a 1/3 of his life for instance. Yet I've met a lot of humans who go into long discussions that intelligence and conciousness must go together, like bees and honey.\n\nIt's just that our culture doesn't value humility as much anymore.

The whole instrument of an option isn't the casino here but an instrument against radical loss.\n\nSo it is all about hedging and learning to really stand out in the market which is honored.

You make a really good case for wheels with your table, where it is not about holding the stocks but only about wheels.\n\nIt's also safer than just buying the stock outright and hold short-term if you want to enter the market. It also alleviates you from timing the market when to enter and when to exit because this is \"done for you\" by chance.\n\nI give you an example. I analyzed Rivian as dirt cheap and also called that they would most likely jump on the NCAS adapter standard and soon announce it. Because it is a win-win. Yet I didn't buy a single stock. And I still wouldn't.  With RIVIAN alone you would be up > 100%.  I have no regrets.  It is so important to understand that your investment strategy has to match your personality. There is no other way. You won't wake up another person tomorrow.\n\nAs long as you understand that your short-term returns are as arbitrary as the market itself then you are fine.

I still stand by what Raiddinn1 said and my first post.\n\n**You are using the wheels strategy.** A mention in your post could have helped. This isn't a obscure strategy. It is one of the most dicussed and perhaps with most repos on github about options.\n\nIn addiiton to wheels, you also started with a few naked bets like KO (Earnings July 26), which judging from the moderate gains where 90% probability bets. Those likely still scared you enough to give up on that alltogether. Which is a good decision.\n\nYour trades are likely not due to skill, nor is not-overleveraging, but is inherent to the wheels strategy. **A plus for the strategy.**\n\nYou bought in with some of the biggest gainers of the AI-train and got extremely lucky. You bought in when the companies stock was still increasing and made good Wheel's returns when it moved up and sideways for a month now. You can already see the WHEELS coming off for you on TESLA, which is what prompted you to ask for guidance, I suppose.\n\nWheels could be fully automated, and in that particular case it makes sense.  Then you are at liberty to do with the time as you please. But if you enjoy trading wheels that works too, and **you could teach your grandchildren about the stock market and discipline and sticking to proven strategies that do away with emotions.**\n\nPersonally, there is a lot available in regard to wheels-automation but nothing super-userfriendly or through third party portals that trade on your behalf. I just don't trust these systems yet for a hands-off approach.  IMHO wheels also would make more sense along with cost averaged buying. **It rose to popularity during low or no interest rates.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are two thing though.\n\n1. It caps your profits, which you cannot time but move with Mergers&Acqu. and other big company events like earnings. Or simply, stock price can increase with more buyers due to hype as is the case with Nvidia. I doubt many will wake up next year and think, oh AI is just such a hype, when the same people that heavily invest are also using GPT4 on a daily basis. That's wishful thinking of the mayority that missed out on NVIDIA, which includes me.\n2. You could get better returns by listening to Buffet & Co. Invest in companies you understand and buy low, then from thereon out DCA and hold. **You cannot time the market but you can gauge sentiment**. When say for example 90% of people in finance think that the market is now \"low\" well then the sentiment is that the market is now low. Makes sense?\n\nBuy when headlines are splattered with sentiment that the market is low. The market is psychogram anyways. Then make an estimate on the time horizon the market could go lower and start Dollar Cost Averaged Buying of the stocks you want to hold. I haven't done that, but that's my strategy.\n\nKeep in mind, markets have very little to do with fundamental reality. The only thing you can be sure of is that stocks are determined by demand and offer of participants that predominantly want to get wealth or secure it.\n\n**If all of a sudden you have 20 Million more customers i.e. participants worldwide participating in the casino then the price dynamics will inherently reflect that too.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I wouldn't want to use the wheels strategy right now, because I like 5+% on cash and I don't want to own any stocks right now. But to be clear it doesn't mean that I am right and it is a bad time to buy stocks. I explained my thinking before.\n\nI've never done it because I had the same conclusion as Raiddin1 in my mind.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "u/Rule_Alert  \n\n\nSent a chat PM.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
