{"title": "11 Month Wheel Update", "selftext": "What's up everyone. This is the update for August 2023.\n\nIf you'd like to see last months update, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/15kazu6/monthly_wheel_update/).\n\nIn August I closed 19 positions with an average hold time of 21 days for a gain of $5,410. I chose to roll a couple of positions which I usually don't do but felt it would be wise because I didn't want to be assigned on too many tickers at once. I'm already carrying a few assignments from previous months so I chose to roll TSLA, META, and SHOP puts this month to keep my capital free. (Turns out I didn't need to roll as the market ended up recovering by the end of the month anyway.)\n\nBelow are the trades closed in August.\n\n[Closed Aug Trades](https://preview.redd.it/6u17zx86wilb1.jpg?width=924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bf50dc2cc4d3bcfadd9c25b8bf43206856fefd4)\n\nMy total premium profits since Sept 2022 are now at $79,400, but my unrealized gain has switched back to an unrealized loss because of a couple of assignments that I'm holding (and August wasn't a very positive month for the market). My unrealized loss is at $6,200. \n\nThis brings my net profit to $73,200 on a 300k account giving me a 24.3% gain in 11 months. SPY in the same timeframe is up 12.7% and QQQ is up 25.9%.\n\nBelow is a running log of all my trades.\n\n[August running log](https://preview.redd.it/hn3xo92pxilb1.jpg?width=923&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66e5d193f2dab76b3c20231d321f76aafc80c37d)\n\nI was assigned ENPH and PYPL this month and am selling CC against them. I also still hold some RVLV, NKE, CRWD, and TTD. I sell CC against them and am fine holding these companies as I believe in them all long term.\n\nThanks for reading and hope you all find value from these posts!", "id": "166po1o", "created_utc": 1693522042.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Sheesh", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "What’s your general strategy here?
