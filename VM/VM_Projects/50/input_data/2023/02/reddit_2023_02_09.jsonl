Now, in 2022 they had gross profits in the automotive segment of $20.354 billion. So to get to that same amount of gross profit in 2023 they would need to generate revenue of $101.77 billion ($20.354B/.2). In 2022 they had automotive revenue of $71.462 billion, or $54,391.25 per vehicle delivered. Lets assume their price cuts amount to 10% on average, so in 2023 they have revenue per delivery of $48,952.13. That would mean to get to the $101.77 billion of revenue they need in 2023 to match 2022's gross profit, they would need to deliver 2,078,970 vehicles.\n\nTesla could do that, but they guided for 1.8 to 2.0 million vehicles. Maybe their margins will be higher than 20%. Certainly possible. But at any rate, it doesn't look like the automotive segment is going to be making much more money in 2023 than it did in 2023 based on what the company has said.  Every additional billion of profit with 20% margins means selling an additional 100k vehicles.  If they have to cut prices further that number goes up very quickly. \n\nIn 2022 the other segments of the business were basically a rounding error in terms of profitability, particularly when you assign some SG&A and R&D to them.  \n\nSo basically per the company's guidance the red line is going to go very flat in 2023.

No they didn't just design some new reaction wheel for the fuck of it or to enter a market (they already sell some of the highest grade reaction wheels). These reaction wheels are fucking huge are tailored for 600-650KG mega constellations (KEEP THIS NUMBER IN MIND, ITS IMPORTANT, ROCKETLAB SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THIS SIZE AS THE REACTION WHEELS ARE TALORED TOO)...........
