BMW had 327,929 new registrations, a 5.3-percent drop, and Mercedes-Benz had 269,511 — nearly identical to its 2021 number.\n\nBecause Tesla does not break out its U.S. sales results, new vehicle registration data serves as the closest thing to an apples-to-apples market comparison. Previous 2022 estimates had suggested Tesla had won the sales crown, but the Experian data provides greater detail of the gulf between Tesla and its legacy rivals.\n\nTotal new vehicle registrations among 15 luxury brands fell 3.5 percent in the U.S. last year to 2.18 million, the data showed. Excluding Tesla, luxury registrations slumped 11 percent.\n\nTesla's results represent the first time it has topped the luxury segment, and it did so without the benefit of any gasoline-engine products. Its German, Asian and American rivals are far behind in EV adoption, with BMW tallying 14,159 new EV registrations last year and Mercedes-Benz totaling 11,444, Experian said.\n\nMost of the U.S. luxury market activity is still in internal combustion engine models.\n\nLexus, which had no electric models, was in fourth place in the luxury race with 260,668 registrations last year, for a 16 percent drop. Audi was in fifth place with 184,279 registrations, an 8.7 percent decrease from 2021. Audi's EV registrations numbered 16,186 last year, Experian data showed.\n\nCadillac had 133,521 total new registrations, a 6.5-percent increase, for sixth place. The brand's first EV, the Lyriq crossover, had only 157 registrations before the year ended.\n\nAcura, which also had no electric models, suffered the biggest year-on-year decline among the luxe brands, falling 36 percent to 101,345 new registrations. Volvo was in eighth place with 97,744 for a 21 percent decline. Volvo's EV registrations were 6,917 last year, Experian said.\n\nLincoln was in ninth place with 81,813 registrations, none of them EVs, for a 10 percent year-on-year decline. Porsche was No. 10 on the luxury list, with 64,610 registrations for a 5.4 percent decline. The performance brand had 6,803 registrations of its battery-electric Taycan sedan.\n\nThe bottom five brands were: Land Rover, Genesis, Infiniti, Alfa Romeo and Jaguar.\n\nTesla, with its sparse interiors and limited feature set, is considered a luxury brand by dint of its sticker prices, its performance capabilities and its advanced software.

{"title": "$SI - Silvergate Capital- Could The Beaten Up Crypto Stock Actually Squeeze?", "selftext": "I know this stock has already ran, but I think there are many reasons to think this squeeze could take off and be a big opportunity to join in. It's definitely risky, as any \"squeeze\" opportunity is, but there are more reasons for this than any stock in a long time.\n\n1. Most Shorted Stock on the Market \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzr51rpe0hia1.png?width=2938&format=png&auto=webp&s=c02117413fa043e044df43e00fbd8693c93c69b7\n\nThe most obvious thing, but SI has been the most shorted stock for 2 months in a row, sitting at 72.8% after the most recent update. This type of sustained short interest has just been waiting to get squeezed.\n\n2. Billionaire George Soros is one of the main shorts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zbp60p452hia1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e02f811094d627385c83cfe67f004879eae6f2\n\nI don't really know much about George Soros, but I know that he is one of the most hated people around. No idea if that's fair or not, but any Google search will tell you that this man is very, very disliked. A lot of the rallying could be be trying to squeeze out the billionaire shorts, similar to the momentum for other large recent squeezes. \n\n3. Reputable Funds have purchased Silvergate Recently\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ta2eixcc3hia1.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ffa6444bb633d665e663613a57dee3bd6dfdd7c\n\nMultiple funds have purchased the stock recently, and while I don't think that has anything to do with the short, I believe it could actually be beneficial. I could see them buying more to join the short squeeze and help their position, which will trigger the shorts to have to buy to cover their positions. This isn't a meme stock, its a $500 million company, I don't see this being some sort of \"rug pull\" scenario.\n\n4. The company is likely undervalued anyway\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7ssjmls5hia1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=f049be9ecd17e798982fd1d7e2acac02ff2dbb5a\n\nSI got pummeled this year, largely due to the FTX collapse. While that was definitely a huge issue, other stocks affected by FTX have been able to largely recover, while SI has not yet. This stock was once valued at $164, and while it likely won't get back to those levels without the squeeze, this company is in recovery and has become overvalued. It is partially due to concerns about their involvement with FTX and possible prosecution, but no charges have been brought against them. I strongly believe this is just the market overreacting.\n\n5. Crypto is on the Rise Right Now\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dtrljxu6hia1.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa1285cd72bdc81d9804247e912e6bdc86504822\n\nBitcoin and other cryptos are on a steady rise right now, and with that this stock follows. This is another of many catalysts for SI to continue it's rise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Momentum is building, SI is getting attention\n\nSI rose 28% today, but unlike most quick daily risers, the momentum continued after hours for another +3%. The chart looks very steady, and momentum is building. Also, SI today is getting attention on various subreddits and through various media outlets. I am guessing that tonight/tomorrow morning many traders will see this stock on TV/internet/reddit/lists of \"short squeezes\" and want to join in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that being said, this is not financial advice and just my opinions, but I am very bullish on SI.
