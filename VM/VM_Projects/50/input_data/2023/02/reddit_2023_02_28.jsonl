Activision shares currently go for around $76. \n That’s roughly give or take a 20% gain on your investment. \n\nI hear the Microsoft Activision deal should be settled by summer 2023. I feel like this may be a good opportunity to load up on Activision shares however, I am relatively new to the stock market so some of your views on this topic would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nI’m assuming however, the downside of this opportunity may be that the deal does not execute and you are stuck holding on to crappy Activision shares which may potentially drop in value according to some analysis I came across on google.", "id": "11dz4n9", "created_utc": 1677566157.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 55, "comments": [{"body": "I won’t and can’t go into details, because I cover this specifically.\n\nBut here are some points. You can easily find out more info online as it’s widely available data and info. \n\n- upside case obviously is a 24ish % at current prices, and best part is you get it all back in cold hard cash, not MSFT shares. That is big upside considering the market environment and recessionary fears impacting sentiment this year\n\n- downside case is a failure of the deal to go through, but then MSFT has to pay ATVI a breakup fee of 2-3bn in cash, which ATVI can use to buyback shares or conduct a special dividend. \n\nOf course most people would be concerned w the question: how far will ATVI fall if the deal falls through? \n\n- assuming that ATVI would return to trading at the multiples of its closest peers (Nintendo, Sony, EA, take two), a reasonable estimate would be ~$65-69 range EXCLUDING the impact of the break up fee, which is just about its price range before the acquisition announcement. \n\n- if (AND A BIG IF) you include the cash breakup fee and assume that ATVI decides to return part of that to shareholders, one could see an additional $0.50 to $2 per share added on top of the range above. \n\n- So actually the downside doesn’t seem all too bad, at around ~15% (assuming it really does fall to $65). This puts risk-reward ratio at 1.6 (24%/15%), which ain’t too bad at all. Morgan Stanley has also done it’s own downside analysis as well and predicted a price floor of $65 as well, and currently rates it a buy. \n\n- to top it off it’s a fundamentally strong company as well, with game IPs and brands that are globally recognised and successful. It generates good cash flow and still has decent growth runway at least for the next 5 years, given that the gaming industry is still considered “mid to high growth”. Active user base continues to grow in the single digits and even the pandemic did not slow the business down as much as others. \n\n- It’s latest call of duty release was it’s most successful ever as the company continues to be able to execute strongly on how to capture more gamers yet retain its existing one and monetise them well. It has a proven track record of developing, marketing and maintaining triple AAA titles. Balance sheet is healthy and there really aren’t much complaints with its fundamentals other than some controversies here and there. \n\n- there are really only 3 regulators the deal needs to clear, FTC, EU and UK CMA. All 3 are seemingly on the side of not letting this pass. FTC has alr filed a lawsuit against ATVI, while both EU and UK CMA have raised concerns and papers of their own. Perhaps they are all playing the waiting game - if one regulator opposes it as the first mover, its much easier to “rationalize” opposing it as well, but the question is who would want to be that first mover? On the flip side, If one regulator approves it first, the chances of the deal going through would jump significantly as the others might just follow suit. Perhaps if you don’t like the uncertainty now, you could wait for some positive news (like a first major approval) and sacrifice some upside potential for more certainty. Prices could easily jump up to 83-86 by then. \n\nPersonally I hold q a significant amount of ATVI (~12% of my pf), because I hold conviction that MSFT has the right people in place to recognise how impt this deal is to them and to negotiate a concession agreement that makes everyone happy. MSFT has never failed an acquisition in its entire history and it lends some confidence that it has the right people, strategy and relationships in place to see this out. It’s unlikely the deal will settle so soon, a more realistic timeline would be Q3 or even early Q4 due to complexity and size of this deal and the amount of stakeholders involved. \n\nInterestingly enough, as the price has been so flat since the announcement of the acquisition I had the extra benefit of this position buffering my portfolio from some of the market downside (reducing volatility) and actually I somehow (luckily) outperformed many indexes last year. The price action is lowly correlated to the market at this point but rather to developments on the deal.\n\nPeople saying that “this deal is too big to fail” know nothing, don’t listen to them.

They are not deploying this into an acquisition of their own or to purchase IP because of the looming Microsoft acquisition. Moreover, there is an immense amount of personal and corporate financial planning that consumes the time of the C suite of the acquired party. All of this encumbrance to the acquired party is mitigated by the break-up fee. Since Microsoft is proposing the acquisition, they are offering the break-up fee as a show of good faith that their acquisitions team believes it will be approved. Without a break-up fee, Activision may be reluctant to come to the negotiating table if they think the governing bodies may block the acquisition.

Same catch as with Activision. If the deal doesn't go through Black knight's stock price will fall. Personally though, I'd rather have Black knight shares than Activision shares (their last quarterly report wasn't great due to the high interest rates, but as a general company I prefere them over Activision). \nThe shareprice of Black knight dropped quite harshly today as it was announced that the FTC is likely to issue a lawsuit against the deal (or so it has been reported). I still think it will go through and as such i bought more shares today. \n\nI would propose the pros and contras of taking the Black knight merger over the Microsoft one like so:\n\n**Pro:**\n\n * ~34,5% vs 24% gain (not sure on the exact number)\n\n * PE of Black Knight is almost half of Activision. I am unaware of any scandels on the side of Black Knight. Their income is less cyclical (games) compared to Activision.\n\n * No EU and UK to overcome.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Smaller compensation (750 M vs 3B) if the deal should fall through, even when considering market cap (for special dividend or share buyback). Additionally, either Black Knight as well as ICE (the buyer) can terminate the deal before May afaik and then ICE wouldn't have to pay the 750 M termination fee. Microsoft is beyond this point and has to fork over the 3B if the deal doesn't come to pass. The 750 M and 3B is 2% and 5% of Black Knights and Activisions Market cap, respectively. So Activision wins here.\n\n* High interest rates are bad for Black Knight's business\n\n* ICE's CEO is a major GOP donor. Not sure if this would have any influence, it's just something I read and this is at-best neutral when going up against the FTC under Biden.\n\nIt has to be clear that both are far from free and include risk. But 34,5 % is a tremendous upside and I'd be fine in owning either shares of Black knight or ICE even if the deal falls through. The  dip in stockprice will suck, but since I like the company I might just use that dip to buy more shares (depending on how steep the dip is).

That level coincidentally enough was MAJOR support almost all day long. \n\nThe biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50/200ema for the first time in over a month. Not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn’t even touch it. Despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that. \n\nI still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until SPY closes back over 400. We also have an established supply level at 396.42 that we did break back and close under today. This level could turn itself into nice resistance here. We have a large gap on supply back down to 383.81 and upside to 414/415.23. After establishing demand at 400.6 on 2/23 we retested that yesterday and rejected there. We should with that rejection seek on next demand at 388.66 unless we can establish a new demand this week first. \n\nSupply- 396.42 -> 383.81\n\nDemand- 400.62 -> 388.66\n\nKey SPY Support- 396.3 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.44\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 397.3 -> 398.5 -> 400 -> 400.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ohf9z2u10la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e90448d650681c9cb9b19fa5f2471a0296e2b90\n\nTaking a look at ES futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than Spy. I said I was worried that we COULD see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind. However, bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection, crossing the daily 8ema below the 50/200ema and closing under the daily 100ema. Now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here. \n\nDemand was established at 3975 on Friday which could have provided a bigger push up. However, we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here. With a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand. \n\nHowever, Supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988. With a rejection off supply and also losing demand here I am very much so bearish on futures and I am looking for that 3915/3920 area to be touched. I remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020. \n\nSupply- 3988 -> 4020 \n\nDemand- 3975 -> 3915 \n\nKey Futures Support- 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 3975 -> 3990 -> 4000 -> 4008 -> 4020\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spzy5dpu10la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=efb38748f29da0da80d41f2f9439fd91f71b3e8f\n\nTesla had a surprisingly weak showing today. I would have expected more strength today leading into investor day. However, after establishing a supply zone at 207.7 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 214.24 and was unable to. With that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 196.3. However, with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way. \n\nSupply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75\n\nDemand- 196.29 -> 164.18\n\nKey Tesla Support- 205.6 -> 202.1 -> 197.8\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 210.7 -> 214.2 -> 219.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00jhhvov10la1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=420d3971ad03b09d8f51fd0dd18396d9f469023e\n\nKinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema… but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there.
