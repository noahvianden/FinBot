{"title": "Some thoughts on why the market is holding up", "selftext": "There are so many confused as to why the stock market isn’t selling off on hot cpi with a yield curve with the deepest inversion since the early 80’s. And now fed funds futures and the yield curve are no longer pricing in rate cuts by end of year which so many figured would have been bullish.\n\nSince I haven’t heard anyone offer up an explanation that makes sense of the current situation, let me offer up my theory of what’s going on that I’ve held for several weeks now and why stocks are not likely to sell off anytime soon.\n\nIt’s actually fairly simple but requires an explanation. You see most market pundits have this long held view that the bond market “knows” things the stock market doesn’t and when an inversion hits it’s a sure fire harbinger of a recession because, well, the bond market is so smart. This ideology is a relic from the past when the bond market *was* smarter, or rather, better informed about liquidity factors that drove the economy. Ie, the fed. In those days most stock market investors were more focused on earnings, the deficit and individual stock stories.\n\nBut, the world has changed a lot over the past decade. First, the average investor is far better informed and is fully aware of how fed policy drives liquidity and how that drives markets (and arguably less informed about single stock fundamentals). Mostly this is due to 24/7 real time coverage of everything related to markets and the fed.\n\nSecond you have fresh in the memory of everyone how fed policy caused the dot com crash and ensuing recession as well as the GFC. You also had the reverse play out with QE and ZIRP driving the bull market of the past decade and especially throughout 2020-21. The result has been a market that is laser focused on the fed and its impact on the market. Rather than the stock market being ignorant of liquidity drivers, on the contrary it’s all anyone talks about!\n\nAnd this brings me to my final factor that has changed and which is probably the most important. The fed has become hyper self aware and terrified of being viewed as making a policy error. Because of that they are very careful to telegraph every move way in advance and now it’s gotten to the point where they are basically on autopilot, doing whatever fed funds futures predict they will do.\n\nIn short, the information advantage the bond market and only very clever investors held in past cycles has completely broken down. The stock market and bond market are in lock step because they are basically looking at the same factors.\n\nSo why is the yield curve inverted and what is that telling us?\n\nNothing, really. You see it’s precisely because the fed is so ridiculously transparent with its policy plans that the bond market can price in rates based on certain assumptions and adjust as new data comes in.\n\nWhat are those assumptions? That inflation has peaked, the fed will hike rates to around 5%, a recession will ensue, and the fed will be forced to pivot and cut rates. That has been the bond market’s position for months and it has basically been all in on it. Why? Because that is what everyone expects to happen when the fed is tightening! The bond market reflects the same idea everyone expecting a sell off in equities has. It’s really no more complicated than that.\n\n6 months yields rise to reflect rate hikes while investors fearing a recession seek to protect capital and lock in a safe return and so long bonds yielding 4% look pretty great and they are bid and long rates drop. \n\nTHIS DOES NOT MEAN THE BOND MARKET IS PREDICTING A RECESSION. IT MEANS THE BOND MARKET IS REFLECTIVE OF A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT A RECESSION BASED ON CURRENT FED POLICY. THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON NEW EVIDENCE.\n\nSomething very interesting happened when the January jobs report was released and came in screaming hot a couple of weeks ago. Many people expected this to cause the fed to take notice and hike rates much higher than previously thought. But if that were the case shouldn’t six month rates shoot up way beyond 5-6%? You would think so, but actually the bond market didn’t reflect that at all. Instead, short term rates basically yawned, suggesting the bond market wasn’t expecting any real change to fed policy.\n\nLong bonds on the other hand sold off hard, causing yields to spike higher, lessening the curve inversion. In the days after, those yields continued to climb and climbed more today on the back of this CPI number.\n\nWhat message can we glean from this? That the bond market is falling out of love with the so called hard landing, serious recession, followed by rate cuts narrative. It seems to me the bond market is in the process of pricing in a soft landing and either a slight recession or none at all.\n\nThe fed not needing to pivot and investors selling long bonds reflects an economy that is stronger than expected with recession fears lifting.\n\nTL;DR Everyone thinks inverted curve means recession coming. All it means is there are a lot of people worried about one. Higher moving long rates is indicative of a healthier than expected economy as investors move money out of risk off assets. The process of pricing in a potential soft landing will take time but would look an awful lot like what we have been seeing for the past few weeks since the jobs report was released.", "id": "112oush", "created_utc": 1676433414.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|5 years ago\n**Total Comments**|2305|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|12 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Something very interesting happened when the January jobs report was released and came in screaming hot a couple of weeks ago.

Happens every year, January data is out of whack most of the times due to seasonal adjustment. \n\n> That the bond market is falling out of love with the so called hard landing, serious recession, followed by rate cuts narrative. It seems to me the bond market is in the process of pricing in a soft landing and either a slight recession or none at all. \n\nBut what if the bond market (who had been right, calling the Fed that they need to raise rates when Powell said \"inflation is transitory) realizes that the Fed no longer needs to hike rates? Because inflation is falling like a rock, and \\~4.5\\~4.75% is sufficient enough to meet their goal of 2% inflation, WITHOUT causing a recession (soft landing). That causes an inversion in the yield curve too you know, even though there is no recession (because shorter terms give higher yields than long yields after a pivot). This was my thesis back in \\~december ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/zxm6j6/comment/j220k2b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) and why I bought the dip.\n\nBut look at the yields now (looking at 1 year/2 year rn). It's soaring. Basically with the hot inflation data (wage-driven services not going down due to very tight labor market - which is what the fed looks for btw in core PCE which is the fed's preferred measurement), the bond market is realizing that the fed will have to raise rates \"higher for longer\" - which in my opinion will definitely cause a recession in the future\n\nIn order to make money, you need to look for discrepancies/inefficiencies in the market. Soft landing is highly likely to be priced in right now. But now my bull thesis has changed to a bear thesis. This \"higher for longer\" will definitely cause a HARD landing, WHICH is not priced in. \n\nWhy do I know this?

The 2 year yield roughly tracks interest rates ( or vice versa depending on what u believe) so an inverted yield where the 2 year is trading more than the 10 year means that bondsman see higher interest rates incoming or remaining. At some point some yields will become less inverted and eventually will revert and this is usually when the markets bottoms because the fed has cut rates and bonds traders start to return to long term treasuries. To understand why this is bad though you have to understand under what circumstances the fed usually cuts rates and historically it’s only when the market is in really bad shape and needs liquidity to start again.
