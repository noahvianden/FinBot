Long options have more ways to lose money just as short options conversely have more ways to profit. If options are efficiently priced, the premium-seller will profit more often.\n\nThe seller accepts the risk trade-off of a low probability of asymmetric loss, the same as the buyer accepts the low probability of asymmetric gains.

There is no arbitrage opportunity because there is no inefficiency - at least not available to retail traders.\n\nYou don't \"enjoy an edge,\" you're just not understanding the risk/reward of this type of trading.\n\nEdit: I just reread this comment and it comes off as really negative, which was not my intention.
