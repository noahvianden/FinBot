Decent, but definitely not monopolistic margins. \n\nI think you're spot on with the data. I think the other underappreciated aspect is how an enormous charging network can be tied in with the energy business to make $. Tesla can vary supercharger prices at different times of day to induce/curtail demand and use that to play in energy markets that they're already in with solar, VPPs, and Megapack/autobidder.

Essentially, Tesla conformed to Europe, rather than the other OEMs conforming to Tesla. It also means that Tesla deals directly with the consumer, not the OEMs.\n\nWhereas in North America, Tesla had to convince the other OEMs to use NACS. If they don't build cars with NACS charging ports, the utilization of superchargers by Ford/GM customers would be low. In order to convince the other OEMs to switch to NACS (which has real costs to them), Tesla agreed to open up access with no membership fee and put non-Tesla customers on equal footing with respect to prices, etc. If they didn't agree to do that, odds are that the rest of industry would've stuck with CCS in North America, which is not a good outcome for NACS/Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "10% net profit, if that is even the exact quote ( I remember it being more ambiguous) isn’t written in a contract anywhere.

I doubt that is what Tesla is doing here though.
