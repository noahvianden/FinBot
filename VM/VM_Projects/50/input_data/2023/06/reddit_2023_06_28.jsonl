Not enough showed up to vote so the vote to strike got over ruled by union leadership under Hoffa and a terrible contract that forced 6 day work weeks on union members among various other compromises to the company like two tiered drivers, “22.4s” happened. UPS drivers are rightfully pissed and ready to burn the company to the ground come august 1st. \n\nThis strike threat is real and being backed by new leadership. There will be no compromise come August 1st 12 am we will be on strike if demands are not met. \n\nThe chances of UPS allowing workers to steamroll all of their gains under Hoffa jr and give concessions at the same time seem very low, I have complete faith that SOB aims to make a high profile move of leading labor against corporate greed.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’ll be honest it’s pretty suspect that Teamsters’s press release doesn’t actually identify any of the specific points of objection and relies on broad and generic comments about the behavior of UPS executives.
