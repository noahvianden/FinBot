It kept falling, I got emotional and bailed. \n\nTo be honest, I just don't see how PayPal is going to stay competitive going forward. At one point in time prior to Zelle, Cash app, Venmo, etc., they were pretty much the ONLY way to send money to someone unless you wanted to mail an envelope with cash or go walk to a Western Union somewhere. You want to buy something on eBay? Oooh yeah gonna need a PayPal for that. (This is pre Amazon era). \n\nI just got a notification a week or two ago that they're offering their equivalent of a debit card to people who have accounts with them. Dude it's 2023, EVERYONE already started doing that like half a decade ago and now we're at the point where debit cards are practically ancient sumerian technology and companies are trying to eliminate them, everyone's started using Apple pay and Google pay. \n\nSo I know it's not great news to hear since you're long on PYPL, but did you buy it because you saw how cheap it was in comparison to how it's been priced historically, and thought \"wow, that's such a huge successful company\"? Because if so, my next question would be: is your perception of them in any way perhaps skewed by your memories of what they WERE, or are you up to date with what they're doing now? If it's the former, and it likely is, I'd say abandon ship. \n\nTL;DR: PYPL is ancient sumerian technology", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "The \"PayPal button\" is what they started as,now it's just one of the things - Braintree, Venmo, Hyperwallet being the (main) others.
