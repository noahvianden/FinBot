{"title": "Year End Recap", "selftext": "Hey Theta Gangers,\nI posted mid year asking if my performance thus far was deemed good enough to be part of the community. As the year end nears just wanted to show you some of my summary stats. I’ve found that undefined risk strategies like naked puts/calls, strangles/straddles are much easier to reposition. Keeping BPR in control and being patient were the most beneficial to my trading. Still love the wheel on high quality names, and with the right environment they can be quite profitable. I will acknowledge the fact that missed two huge rallies in META and COIN but at least I caught NVDA. Hopefully 2024 is just as good for everyone! I’ll be here to continue discussion and if there’s additional formulas feel free to post since I’d love to optimize my sheet some more.", "id": "18cj866", "created_utc": 1701910291.0, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Because I’m a stickler for redundant information haha.

How much and when?\n\nDo you close early at a particular % gain or DTE? Do you cut your losses?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Strangles are interesting you can take all kinds of approaches. To take the trade there is alot to consider. Once it’s open I like to roll untested down a few strike and out maybe 15ish days. Typical opening is 30-35 days. I love closing early as it takes risk off and allows more flexibility. Cut losses if I believe it may be to lost or money is better spent elsewhere", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "If you roll out (longer DTE) the untested side, does that mean each leg of the Strangle now has a different expiry date?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Potentially yes, there are some instances where they have differing DTE, and sometimes they might be depreciated enough for me to close them both green!
