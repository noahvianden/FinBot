What I would say though is that it doesn't carry as badly as rolling VIX futures because typically the further out you go, the higher the premium that VIX futures trade relative to their fair value as calculated by their replicating strip of options.\n\nSo in short, you can replicate VIX spot more closely, and probably more cheaply by using a proxy for the options in the calculation, but it requires a LOT of trading, and unless you have a good set up for risk management and VIX theoretical value calculations, you're probably better off trading the futures.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the info", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "In my opinion the best way is to take a long position on the vx futures.
