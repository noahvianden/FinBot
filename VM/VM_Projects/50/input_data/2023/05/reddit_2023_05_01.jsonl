What matters is what JPOW has to say… Will he hint at a pause next meeting (June 14th), will be confirm rate hikes by EOY, what does he have to say about the banking crisis and FRC? There is a lot of things that we are going to get some clarity on…\n\nWhat else matters? How the market reacts… IF they finally actually listen to what JPOW has to say…\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccs4x40k6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=134671466385651d79baaa32b5811756e7976c63\n\nNo real movement here from a supply and demand stand point.. However, a red day tomorrow almost certainly will turn 415.55 into a new supply (resistance) which will allow us to target 412.62 and eventually 404.3 again. \n\nWe did again attempt a break through of 417.03 supply, however, that became a major resistance.\n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4p7nhhk6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3aa88a9c485c6263667729836701f295cf159c5f\n\nThis is a fairly textbook bearish reversal set up… I actually was EXTREMLY tempted to swing puts overnight but im not sure if I will make opening hour or not. \n\nHowever, what we have here is a massive blue rising wedge with our extremely tight 4 day long red bull channel. Not only that but we put in a really nice evening doji star reversal pattern… in doing sowe should almost certainly target 411.44 to 412.6 for tomorrow. \n\n415.29 is the red support line for the bull channel tomorrow… which means bulls have to open green and hold green all day in order to hold that. \n\nI still will be looking for a downside move tomorrow. Tomorrow is pre-FOMC so we should expect some more ranging but also could see some risk off into the meeting. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 412.6 -> 415.3 -> 417  \n Demand- 404.3  \n Support- 412.6 -> 411.4 -> 409.2  \n Resistance- 416 -> 416.9 -> 419.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmg3yoyk6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe7c14d5c8ce36bb03ac5d4a8b10ac4b27a38cb\n\nThe bulls once again attempted to breach 4198 supply on futures and found themselves with a very strong rejection much like back on 4/18.\n\nWe did not establish any new supply or demand levels but much like SPY a red day tomorrow should turn 4190 into a new supply (resistance) which allows us to come down and take out 4178 -> 4158 and eventually retest 4085. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6boasel6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb0cd66d4a8898ba5241b9d425735d5402bd149f\n\nI actually believe that futures daily is far more bearish looking than SPY. You can see the large blue rising wedge we are trading within… you can also see the really nice 4190 double top and rejection off 4200. \n\nWith this daily double top and evening doji star reversal pattern… there is downside to be expected tomorrow. \n\nI would target 4178 as a major support area to watch and then we can start looking at that key 4150-4158 support area. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4158 -> 4178 -> 4198  \n Demand- 4085  \n Support- 4178 -> 4150 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4190 -> 4225\n\n**VIX, DXY and 10YR YIELD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xciwhbvl6axa1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=c239266f6a9ef7307754db348f5b1436fe4c96ac\n\nNow I generally prefer to show these all on tradingview but I wanted to show you the three daily charts all right next to eachother and compared right next to SPY…\n\nNow these are all the daily time frame and what I want to point out here is the huge rising wedge on SPY with a downside potential target of 395-400… this rising wedge perfectly aligns with the VIXs current falling wedge with upside target of 20-25, DXY falling wedge (which it just broke out of) with upside target of 103-104, and the 10YR yield that also just broke out today with an upside target of 3.75-3.85%.\n\nIf we are seeing the strength return to the dollar finally and 10Yr yield then we could be in store for some more SPY downside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4eruyadm6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4b5a7ad85b29ef1370d9d625686c4e1c85bc6c3\n\nThe VIX  itself is in two separate falling wedges… a short term falling wedge which goes with the short term bull channel on SPY/ futures… expecting outside of a pretty heavily red gap down on VIX that VIX breaks through its 15.76 resistance for tomorrow we should see a push back to the 17-18 range on the VIX. \n\nThe VIX amazingly put in yet another 52 week low today touching 15.53. \n\nI would be fairly surprised to see the VIX not have at least a little rise going into FOMC… especially sitting at 52 week low and the lowest level going into FOMC in well over 1.5 years…\n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v64woum6axa1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f0b3bf26220935aebb6bb95b2e7b4164d64ef9\n\nToday ended up being a great day… I actually struggled early morning during power hour. I was on the wrong end of that 10am dump and then was on the wrong end of the recovery. Honestly I think for the next week or so I am going to start sitting out opening hour like I used to as the last 1-2 weeks my opening hour trades have not been that great. \n\nAfter that honestly had a great day and honestly as a technical based trader the setups were really good. I did get stop loss hunted one time mid day but other than that everything played out pretty well today… much better trading than Thursday and Friday. \n\nI was able to secure almost my full weeks profit today… \n\nToday was a heavy lesson and good reminder of using proper risk management and when you have a successful strategy that in the end you have to trust it… I got stopped out 3 plays in a row and took pretty decent loss to start the day… but I didn’t get frustrated and revenge trade… I stuck to my strategy and my take profit targets and in the end had an amazing day.", "id": "1350jsi", "created_utc": 1682973460.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4853|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/132f1re/sell_in_may_and_go_away_banking_crisis_take_two/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: - SPY bearish reversal set up going into FOMC tomorrow… downside target of 411.44 to 412.6 for tomorrow.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's not about what JPow will do.
