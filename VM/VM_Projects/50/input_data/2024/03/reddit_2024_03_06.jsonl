As a longterm TSLA shareholder, what are the headwinds and do you think they are just temporary?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You asked so I'll answer :)\n\nYeah mostly temporary. But temporary means 2024 and into 2025. There are a few issues, let me start with them\n\nInterest rates. Most people finance their EVs and high rates hurt that. Tesla has reduced prices on the whole line to help but they can't reduce them enough to make up for it, and obviously lower prices means lower margins. We need rates to come down, maybe late 2024?\n\nThe lineup is stale. 3+Y are selling like crazy still but have reached nearly their peak. There are just only so many people who want 50k luxury vehicles, even if overall they're quite affordable to operate. They need a subcompact car to grow the market. I think this will be announced the end of this year and available early next year. Probably a van too\n\nThis means 2024 is just not going to be great. It will be fine, but you can't be a growth company (and a high PE stock) without a clear path for growth. TSLA can't announce those new vehicles until they're mostly ready, because obviously a cheaper model will hurt existing sales somewhat. So theyr'e stuck developing in silence, trimming costs here and there, and mostly waiting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good:\n\nFSD (full self driving) Elon claimed it will be complete every year since maybe 1947. I kid I kid, but its a while. So people are frustrated. BUT, if you have never seen it in action its absolutely mind blowing. The car drives itself quite well, although it will make a mistake the driver needs to correct. It's not a robotaxi or anything, but its at least as good at my teenager daughter who's learning to drive. Once its actually capable of mostly driving people without intervention (even if they're legally considered the driver) TSLA can recognize a ton of deferred revenue from years of FSD sales, and much more revenue going forward. When? who knows\n\nTheir entire ecosystem is simply the best. You can argue all you like about subjective things like is the stark interior for you, but overall no one beats them. They just don't. The software in the car is phenomenal. The charging system (while being opened up to others) is second to none. The car knows where the chargers are, how long you need to charge, etc, all perfectly.\n\nNo dealerships, no unions, so lower costs. honestly going to a car dealership now after buying my Tesla online is painful. Think about how easy buying from Amazon is and compare that to used car dealership. It's huge\n\nTheir energy business is growing massively. batteries are coming down so much in cost it makes a lot of sense for people to replace gas power plants with solar+batteries. This change over is happening now, and when you look at the largest companies in the world most of them are energy (or software, and Tesla is both)\n\nCharging network being opened up to others makes all EV adoption better. It's like apple finally moving to USB C. Except yeah Tesla loses an exclusive advantage (best chargers) but they get to be the largest \"gas station\" in the world. They get to pump more customers and therefore money out of the already existing asset of 50,000 chargers.\n\nI could go on, but that's probably enough. If you ignore Elon's stupid Tweets and focus on the business its amazing. Just not for 2024, so definitely not call options. I cut my shares down in half and am buying Nvidia instead. Probably Nvidia will outperform TSLA but I just can't quit them, not entirely.

My daughter is awesome at these things. \n\nThe car is capable of looking in all directions at once and reacting with an almost preternatural response.
