Now, they fired most everyone good because either they made too much money, were on the same job too long, or the good people all quit in disgust. My best friend growing up was I think a principal software architect. She got fired for not getting a promotion before a deadline. There literally was no higher level job she could qualify for so basically their system is designed to fail, like their stack ranking system was. All of my friends that worked there that were competent either retired under Gates after making good money or quit under Ballmer because they weren't making enough money to survive since the stock price had stagnated. Even today, their pay, while it has improved, is a still rip-off, but even the crappy small company I work for now pays about 50% more in salary than Microsoft. Last year with the stock  going up, the total pay would probably be about the same, but years like 2022 would have sucked since their pay is so low.\n\nNow it seems like they don't hire at all for competency, but instead it's just incompetent people hiring their friends. Get to know someone at Microsoft. That's your best way in. Sadly competency no longer is. Also, most managers usually hire from the same ethnicity and region as themselves. For example, my friend that got a job there as a director fired all of his staff from northern India and hired his friends from Chenai(a city in the south of India).

Two very different problems, but both make them sucky places to work.\n\nAmazon is so bad now that the average employee for the job title I was offered lasted less than 9 months. That's average. The mode must be much lower and exaggerated to the high side by guys that survived for years. The guy who would have been my boss tried to talk me into it since he said it would probably only be a three month job before I quit. Four rounds of interviews and many more conversations over a five month period for a job the guy hiring expects to last for only three months is just ridiculously inefficient, especially since the onboarding process there is a bit confused, takes a long time, and is pretty much unsupervised which doesn't help get it done quickly.
