{"title": "Barclay upgrades Disney expecting streamer profitability sooner than guided & to achieve 25-30% margins. DIS is up 3% today; up 30% YTD", "selftext": " Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and boosted his price target on shares to **$135 from the prior $95**. The move implies roughly 15% upside based on current trading levels of about **$120** a share.\n\nVenkateshwar argued better-than-expected free cash flow and earnings guidance, coupled with \"tactical tailwinds\" such as the Hollywood strikes, Hulu's consolidation, and cost cuts, have helped buoy investor confidence. \n\nMeanwhile, \"*the propensity among media investors to be long Disney, has resulted in the stock outperforming broader markets meaningfully thus far this year, at a pace faster than we anticipated*.\"\n\nThe stock has been on a tear since the start of the year, up more than **30%** compared to the S&P 500's 10% rise over that same time period.\n\nIt's a significant turnaround for the company after its stock price hit multiyear lows last year. The media giant has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in its streaming business. A heated proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz has also clouded the company's outlook.\n\nBut Venkateshwar argued Disney's next phase \"*may be more impactful as a number of turnaround elements still remain work in progress and may manifest more in numbers starting next year*.\"\n\nIn his bull case, the analyst said **sooner-than-expected streaming profitability** could serve as a boon to the stock price.\n\n*\"We expect Disney streaming to break even potentially a quarter or two earlier than company guidance of Q4 2024*,\" he explained. \"*This is in part driven by the tailwinds from cost cuts over the last few quarters and recent price increases*.\"\n\nVenkateshwar said he believes Disney will likely achieve streaming margins \"*that are better than Netflix*,\" estimating potential margins in the **25% to 30% range**, \"*which is not too different from where linear margins today are*.\"\n\nOther \"*upside narrative surprises*\" could include **ESPN's** yet-to-be-announced streaming partners for its over-the-top service, set to debut sometime in fall 2025, in addition to a refocused attention on long-term **succession** plans post-proxy battle.\n\nConversely, the analyst's bear case calls out declining non-sports TV viewership as linear network revenue falls amid increased cord cutting. Streaming, although a potential positive, could also be a net negative if subscriber growth does not pick up and pricing headwinds hit revenue growth.\n\n*Source:* [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-stock-upgraded-by-barclays-as-turnaround-plan-takes-shape-155209507.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-stock-upgraded-by-barclays-as-turnaround-plan-takes-shape-155209507.html)", "id": "1bnmvzo", "created_utc": 1711395833.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": "I was bullish Disney and told folks on this board about its breakout if it can fix the streaming margins and steady it out.
