{"title": "Some thoughts on GTC Analyst Q&A", "selftext": "With a back ground in high tech, and as a long term NVDA investor (16 yrs), the most important thing to me about where Nvidia stands at the moment is the competitive landscape.   If something is going to put a stick in their spokes at this point it’s another more solid, or more performant, or more novel, solution.\n\nThe Nvidia side of the ledger is rich with software, hardware, solutions, IP, partnerships, supply chain relationships, and an incredibly eager customer base.  I have never seen anything like it (for example every CEO of every meaningful high tech company except AAPL giving a quote in Nvidia’s Blackwell press release).  The product portfolio was enhanced over the last day with Blackwell and with technology upgrades (like NVLink V5).   \n\nIntel has Gaudi3 and AMD has MI300, these are the closest competitors, and **neither has shipped THEIR CHIP** in production.\n\nWhat put the whole picture together for me was this analyst Q&A.  Unfortunately sometimes Jensen takes a little bit of wind up to get in the groove.  Yesterday he didn’t have it.   This morning he did.   \n\nA few years ago I started checking in about this crazy return on NVDA, shouldn’t the run be coming to an end, and how can they sustain, and what about the competition?  I mean come, on the conventional wisdom was the margins are too rich, Nvidia can’t just hold off the competition forever and continue earning these obscene returns generation after generation, can they?\n\nFor insight into that question, I recall something Jensen said after they failed in cell phone chip segment (\\~2014):  *“I only want to enter markets where we have an advantage/can dominate.”*\n\nWhat was clear from this Blackwell presentation is Nvidia is innovating faster than anyone else.   This is exactly how they chased 50+ other chip companies out of the PC Gaming business between 1997-2007:  More new products faster!!!    And that's exactly how they are going to keep the competition at bay in the ML space.  At another point a few years later he said, \"*by the time the competitors are getting out of the starting blocks, we'll already be running at full speed*.\"   It was true then and it remains true today.\n\nNvidia has built the default platform for ML/AI.  While everyone else is trying to build a chip, Nvidia are building a platform.  While everyone else is struggling with software, Nvidia are building data centers, while competitors are pondering networking and memory interfaces, Nvidia is teaching customers how to be successful with their products.   They are and remain -- literally, many steps and figuratively, many years -- ahead of the competition.   Nvidia is going to be a much bigger company than they are today.  Their lead just stretched a ton, and everyone else's chip in development needs to go back to the drawing board.   And while they're at it, if they're not building a platform to compete with Nvidia, why even bother?\n\nThe only thing that is going to unseat Nvidia at this point is a new technology, and there isn't a hint of something like that on the horizon for as far as we can see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1biypyn", "created_utc": 1710890563.0, "score": 136, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "This is the quality content I come to this subreddit for!

Hi, Jensen. It's Brett Simpson here at Arete Research, and thanks for hosting a great event this last couple of days. **My question was on Inference.** I wanted to get your perspective on -- you put up some good performance numbers with the B100 in terms of how Inference compares with H100. How -- what's the message you're giving to customers on cost of ownership around this new platform? And how do you think it's going to compare with ASICs or other Inference platforms in the industry? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nI think **for** . . . **large language models** Blackwell with the new transformer engine and NVLink is going to be very, very, very hard to overcome. And the reason for that is **the dimensionality of the problem is so large**. And TensorRT-LLM this exploration tool, this optimization compiler that I talked about. The architecture underneath the Tensor Cores are programmable. NVLink allows you to connect up whole bunch of GPUs working in tandem with very, very low overhead, basically no overhead. Okay. And so **as a result, 64 GPUs is the same as one programmatically**. It is incredible. And so when you have 64 GPUs without overhead without this NVLink overhead, if you have to go over the network like Ethernet, it's over. You can't do it. You just wasted everything. And because **they all have to communicate with each other, it's called all2all. Whenever all have to communicate each other the slowest link is the bottleneck**, right. It's no different than having a city on one side of the river having a city on the other side of the river that bridge that's it. That's the throughput doing -- that defines the throughput. Okay. And that bridge will be Ethernet. On one side is NVLink, on the other side is NVLink Ethernet in the middle makes no sense. So we have to turn that into NVLink. And ***now we have all of the GPUs working together generating tokens one at a time*****.** Remember the tokens cannot be -- it's not as if you splat out a token because tokens ***the transformer has to generate the tokens one at a time in sequence*****. And so this is a very complicated parallel computing problem,** okay. And so I think the -- I think Blackwell has raised the bar a lot. Just mountains. Utterly mountains, ASIC or otherwise.\n\n\"What are you saying\"\n\nI don't care one guy has the most or not.  GPUs continue to drive the lowest TCO and provide a better solution than DIY.  I don't have a quote to justify this, just industry experience, but you have to factor in the cost of development, Google is sucking up that expense for their entire TPU development front to back, it's likely a similar cost to what Nvidia has in developing their GPUs.  But Nvidia amortizes that over every GPU sold. \n\nIf you just look at FLops as the metric, then put up the total cost of what Goog has invested in TPUs over the last 8-10 years compared to what they could have purchased similarly in GPUs over the last 8 years, I guarantee GPUs would have been a lesser investment for the same flops.   And TPUs are less performant.  And less flexible, and have less software support ergo less capability.    \n\nYour \"security\" analogy has merit, but it raises TCO a lot for whoever goes down that path.

One problem Nvidia has is, as the CEO characterized yesterday, they are **market maker, not a market taker**.   They are building products for market that don't exist yet, or that are barely established.   So how do you size that?   The CEO reiterated he believes the existing data center is \\~$1T, and that infrastructure will be upgraded.   Initially he said that was $100B/yr, now that's been updated to $250B/yr, and his view is they will be the beneficiary of a high percentage of that.  That's just existing, sort of built in business for accelerated computing.  Then he said on top of that add the Generative AI market, all the training and inferencing that goes with that function, LLMs.   I believe it's easily the size of the earlier group, $250B/yr in a few years.  GenAI will be used for many many things beyond language.   So there you go, TAM of $500B within (?) 4-5 years.\n\nAs far as the potential, I've been evaluating it for 15+ years.  Every year I have to reset and raise the bar.

So if a given model needs 32 H200s to inference, you need roughly 9000 Groq boards (list price: $20,000) to service the same model.

We expect revenue to be approximately $5.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment revenue to be flat, with the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp.\n\nFrom AMD Q4 ER Q&A:\n\n>**Aaron Rakers** -- *Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst*\n\n>Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of framing the outlook and the guidance for this calendar first quarter. I guess the first question is, can you help us on a relative basis the $400 million of Data Center GPU revenue that you expected in Q4.\n\n>What did that ultimately kind of fell off to be? And then, on the guidance into 1Q, can you help us appreciate what seasonal is defined as, as we think about the server business into the 1Q guide?\n\n>**Lisa Su** -- *President and Chief Executive Officer*\n\n>Sure, Aaron. Let me start and then see if Jean has something to add. So, relative to the Data Center GPU business, we were very pleased with performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. It was always going to be a very sort of back-end quarter weighted as we were ramping the product and we saw MI300A, our HPC product actually ramped very well.\n\n>And then, we saw MI300X. The AI product actually exceed our expectations based on strong customer demand, the way the qualifications went and then the ramp -- manufacturing ramp. So, we were over $400 million for that business in the fourth quarter. And then, going into the first quarter, as we look at the business, server seasonality, call it, something around, let's call it, high-single-digit, low-double-digit.\n\n>There are also some other pieces of the Data Center business. I think, the key piece of it is we had originally expected the ramp to be a little bit more shallow of our MI300X and what we're seeing now is the supply chain is operating really well, and the customer demand is strong. And so, we will see MI300X increase as we go into the first quarter, and things are going relatively well so..\n\nSo seasonal decline in EPYC is somewhere around 150-200 million From Q4 to Q1, and MI300x is going to offset that. She noted that Mi300 exceeded 400m. So . . . . 450m + 175m = 625m . . . Roughly. and i expect AMD will beat. So in my estimate i have 700m sales for Q1 Mi300x sales.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}
