The bottom line imo is that It has come a very long way and still has a ways to go. I use it every few days and personally am of two minds on this as it still makes boneheaded mistakes (wrong or late turns being a big one) but also wildly intelligent decisions that made me go WOW.

No other ADAS does that except for probably Waymo.\n\nTheir robot runs on the same platform, time will tell if that thesis plays out but if it does, the upside is insane.
