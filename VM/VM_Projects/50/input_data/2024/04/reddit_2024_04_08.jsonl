This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2024-04-12.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.\n\n- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have \"weeklies\", the underlying is \"too cheap\", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.", "id": "1byypyk", "created_utc": 1712585110.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "DWAC is DJT now \n\nnice list thank you", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah data provider is a step behind.

Do your own DD.\n\nTL;DR Buy Novo Nordisk because it‚Äôs undervalued with huge forward looking potential.\n\nFour main points:\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly\n2. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses\n3. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue\n4. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume\n\nNovo Nordisk has a great business model. Help people lose weight & live longer. And you need to stay on on their drugs to keep weight off (so you stay on it forever). And the longer people live, the longer they‚Äôll buy GLP-1 drugs, the more money Novo Nordisk makes. But who cares if you can‚Äôt make money? I‚Äôll tell you how degens\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly\n\nNovo Nordisk:\n\n\n\n* Market cap: 436 B\n* Net Sales Growth: +31%\n   * Earnings Per Share Growth: +52%\n   * Net Profit Growth: +51%\n* 2023 Revenue: $33.7 billion\n* Net Profit Margin: 36%\n\nEli Lilly:\n\n\n\n* Market cap: 745 B\n* Net sales growth: +20%\n   * Earnings per share: -16%\n   * Net profit Change: -16%\n* 2023 Revenue: $34.1 billion\n* Net Income Margin: 15.3%\n\nComparing Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly (their closest competitor), you can see Eli Lilly has a much higher market cap with MUCH worse financials. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean Eli Lilly is a bad business (pls don‚Äôt short). But it means that Novo Nordisk, in my opinion, is UNDERVALUED. All their financial metrics BLOW Eli Lilly‚Äôs out of the water.\n\nHell, Eli Lilly literally decreasd their net profits by 16% YoY whereas Novo Nordisk increased their net profits by 51% YoY.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves.\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses\n\nIn their latest financial report, Novo Nordisk says an FDA decision for Wegovy to become the first ‚Äúapproved weight management medicine \\[that\\] has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death‚Äù is expected in 2024 (aka this year). And the FDA is doing a ‚Äúpriority review‚Äù.\n\nWhy is this a big deal?\n\nBecause according to the CDC, heart disease and stroke are literally the biggest disease and biggest economic opportunity.\n\nThat means Wegovy has now just opened itself up to the largest $$$ opportunity.\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue\n\nDemand is there. In fact, they literally say in their financial report they have to ration their drugs and prioritize certain populations.\n\nThe biggest bottleneck is manufacturing. Which is what they‚Äôre heavily investing in. Long term, if half the world is on these drugs, manufacturing and supply chain become a moat because getting drugs out the door at scale becomes the problem.\n\n‚ÄúIf you produce it, they will come‚Äù\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume\n\nToday, you have to get a once a week injection. No one likes that.\n\nBut Novo Nordisk will (hopefully) solve that with a pill that you take.\n\nNow if you‚Äôre too lazy to workout and get an injection, you can just get a pill delivered to your door and lose weight.\n\nThere are some risks. Like competition from Eli Lilly. But my opinion is the market is very unsaturated. All glp-1 companies can grow because there's still so many people who have never used a glp-1 drug. Many companies will win. A rising tide will lift all ships.\n\nThe other big risk factor is a bad side effect. But glp-1 drugs have been around for a while so while there is a risk, the research feels relatively de-risked.\n\nSo yeah, go all in on Novo Nordisk.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbky7tdz2btc1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa5c86207f4ff364b409f709c6255f6c1f42868b", "id": "1bz6n69", "created_utc": 1712604018.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 4 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 12 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Already went all in on NVO, at the top ofc, down like 30% so far on my calls lol", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Hopefully their 5/2 earnings is good!", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why is that?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Same ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, I'm late.

{"title": "Delta Airlines ($DAL) ER DD", "selftext": "Hi Regards,\n\nI will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).\n\nI may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.\n\nMy position: $48.5C\n\nThe other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.\n\n  \nHere is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \\~8% to 12% post earnings:\n\n1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%\n\n2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share\n\n3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.\n\n4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).\n\n5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:\n\nBonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):\n\n***\"So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.\"***\n\n***\"Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***\n\n***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***\n\n***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***\n\n***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.\"***\n\nThis is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.\n\nThis is NOT financial advice.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBaymax\n\n*How Would You Rate Your Pain?*", "id": "1bzabys", "created_utc": 1712612422.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 5 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 465 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Calls for sure all the atl homeboys still flying delta", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "ATL homeboys can‚Äôt afford to fly delta lol", "score": 17, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What‚Äôs your exp on that call", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "0dte", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just got call for 48.5 inshallah you right", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks fam, however I learned my lesson and will say tomorrow before closing. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Delta just changed their loyalty program from miles flown to dollars spent on the Amex, that‚Äôs why I bought calls.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like a reason for AMEX calls.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly it prob is.
