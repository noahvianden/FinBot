There are not as many moving parts associated with their design (no rods, no cooling pumps, etc) just natural flow through expansion and contraction and cooling from naturally generated convection currents. Molten salt is perfectly fine being at the required operating temperature. These facts all differ from the other SMRs.\n\nOklo's biggest hurdle will be regulatory. The NRC has a long precedent in reviewing light water pressurized reactors such as those brought forth by NuScale, but not so much time reviewing molten salt reactors for approval.
