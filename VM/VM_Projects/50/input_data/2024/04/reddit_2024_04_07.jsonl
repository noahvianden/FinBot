{"title": "Seeking advice on diversification : All in on NVDA or... not ?", "selftext": "Until recently, I had hung onto a sizeable chunk of AAPL for 15 years, snagged back in 2008 at the right moment. For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the \"recent\" buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  \n\nConsequently, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Came January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to look at the market more closely, sell off the remaining half of my AAPL and shop around.  \n\nToday, here's where I stand:  \n\n\\- 61% NVDA \n\n\\- 11% SMTC \n\n\\- 9% MSFT \n\n\\- 6% ORCL \n\n\\- 6% MU \n\n\\- 3% MRVL \n\n\\- 2.5% AMD \n\n\\- 2.5% PLTR  \n\nFirst off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  Bottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?", "id": "1bxuxei", "created_utc": 1712462050.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 55, "comments": [{"body": "You are asking in nvda sub Reddit.

{"title": "134 S&P 500 index stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 index", "selftext": "I wanted to identify stocks that are in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index whose total return (with dividends reinvested) has beaten the S&P 500 index either since 1993 or since the stock's IPO (Initial Public Offering) if it was after 1993. I used the ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) SPY as my benchmark for the S&P 500 index because the web site I used to make comparisons [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY) needed an S&P 500 index ETF for comparison, and since SPY - which started in 1993 - is the oldest S&P 500 index, I used SPY and that's why the cutoff is 1993.\n\nI used a stock screener to make a first pass filter, looking for the following criteria:\n\n* Included in the S&P 500 index. This limited the cohort to large. profitable US companies that meet the requirements to be included in the S&P 500 index [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/) S&P 500 stocks are available as fractional shares at my brokerage Charles Schwab and at other major brokerages.\n*  Pays a dividend and has a non-negative 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Companies that pay a dividend - and particularly companies that initiated paying a dividend or have been increasing their dividend - have outperformed the S&P 500 index and experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973‚Äîwith significantly less volatility.  [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html)\n* 5 year total return (with dividends reinvested) close to or better than the 5 year total return of the S&P 500 index. This was to help narrow down the cohort to stocks that have continued good performance in recent years, and to exclude stocks that perhaps were outperforming the S&P 500 many years ago but have been lagging the past 5 years. The 5 year total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69% so I used a minimum of +90% 5 year total return as a cutoff.\n\nI then compared the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the filtered stocks and eliminated any that had a total return less than that of the S&P 500 since 1993, or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993. Each stock was compared head-to-head against the S&P 500 index (SPY) during equal time frames. For example, this is the comparison of SPY vs MSFT [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT) which had its IPO in 1986, and the comparison of SPY vs NVDA [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA) which had its IPO in 1999.\n\nI made a spreadsheet of the 134 stocks that meet the criteria. I did this at the end of last month so the results are current as of the end of March 2024. The spreadsheet has the following columns:\n\n* Symbol: self explanatory\n* Company: self explanatory\n* Total Return: the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the stock since 1993, or since the stock's  IPO if it was after 1993\n* S&P 500 TR: the total return of the S&P 500 index (with dividends reinvested) during the exact same time frame displayed for the total return of the stock being compared to the S&P 500 index\n* Ratio: the total return of the stock divided by the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time frame. A Ratio of 2 means the stock had 2x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period. A Ratio of 10 means the stock had 10x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period, and so on. Even a Ratio of 2 is significant because it means the stock had double the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period.\n* 5 Yr Total Return: the total return of the stock the past 5 years. For comparison, the total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69%\n* 3 Yr Div Growth Rate: the 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the stock.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) represents the year over year rate at which dividends would have grown annually if they had grown at a steady rate over the time period. Steady dividend growth - growth in dividend per share, *not* the dividend yield - is associated with company vitality and is a positive. If a stock has not been paying dividends for at least 3 years the value is blank, but that isn't a negative because it means the stock recently initiated paying a dividend, and that is associated with outperformance.

I colored the highest values in each column in varying shades of green. The darker the shade of green the higher the value range. I did not use rigid criteria for coloring different value ranges, but looked for natural separation points or certain arbitrary values, such as >3 or >200%, etc.\n\nLooking for stocks that are some shade of green in the Ratio AND 5 Yr Total Return AND 3 Yr Div Growth Rate columns can help identify strong performers. For example, familiar stocks like AVGO, AMAT, MSFT, and LLY are green in three columns, but so are lesser known stocks like KLAC, MPWR, PCAR and others.\n\nThe spreadsheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe\\_pA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe_pA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYes, past performance is not a *guarantee* of future results, but a stock that has a documented track record of beating the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time is more likely to continue doing so than a stock that has been unable to beat the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time.\n\nI hope this is helpful to people, especially young people looking to explore the universe of individual stocks that exists beyond ETFs.", "id": "1byeabm", "created_utc": 1712521305.0, "score": 549, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "I like to talk about how, if you just bought shares in Apple after seeing Forest Gump in theaters (1994), where a significant plot point was that they didn't have to worry about money anymore because they had invested in apple, you would be extraordinarily wealthy.

I am not saying just blindly pick them, just suggesting the likelihood of a blind pick working out is likely much higher in the top 10 than the bottom 10, at least in the near term (2-3 years).\n\n\nWhat I go on to suggest in my other comments is that people get comfortable with judging balance sheets/valuation AFTER judging management, because management is precursor to results, not the other way around.\n\nBut due to the nature of stock picking and the common suggestions you will read, most will only focus on the former and consider the latter(management) only in passing.\n\n\nYou are right, the big fall. But I say in the other comment that they don't fall without reason and with no warning/ability to foresee. And that if you want to predict such things, don't go looking at earnings reports, listen to earnings calls and find CEO and other leadership interviews.\n\n\nAnd, of course, they are pitching a sale. So you also can't take them at face value. What I then suggest is that people study management and innovation - the success of the largest companies is not because one guy had a lucky guess from his gut (although that is somewhat a factor) - it is more that there are, frankly, good and bad strategies. \n\nDrucker and Christensen have great books that give you the perspective necessary to judge a company better - and you'll note none of them are finance books. Effective Exectuive is about management, Innovators Dillemma and Competeing Againat luck are about technology and innovation. None of them purpose there work for stock picking, which is good, because they are focusing on their respective problems. What you can do as an individual is leverage their knowledge *for* stock picking, which I think is completely not talked about enough.\n\n\nAnd I think this is part of the changing of the times - Buffet, Munger, Graham, and others from their time were very successful in using balance sheets and formulas and cash flow analysis to spot diamonds in the rough and make fortunes. But Graham kind of shows how things changed; he had to keep updating his formulas because as soon as they were disseminated, the opportunities they highlighted vanished as people could use those predictions to price things \"better\", ruining the bread and butter of the value investor.\n\n\nWhat I suggest is that it *is* different - it always is. I don't know who to read about who came before them, but I wager their success came from something even more primitive, perhaps just understanding stocks exist and what they can do for you.\n\n\nAnd so now, in present day, the quants and their billion dollar algos (eg Jim Simmons) have effectively destroyed any opportunity the common person might think to achieve through through raw balance sheet analysis - you will not get wealthy the same way they did. \n\n\nWhat is unique in our time though, the same way dissemination of earnings reports under common standards might have been in Buffets time, is the amount of visibility we have into the individuals that actually run these companies. You can find dozens of hours of Jensen, Satya, Cook, Sundar, Zuck talking about all sorts of intricacies about their respective companies. You can even find dozens of hours of their top researchers and scientists, and others in the scientific community, like Yann LeCun, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey Hinton, and Andrej Karpathy. And remember, these are the people whose work directly impacts all the future earnings we struggle to correctly discount.\n\nSo I wager the way to choose amongst those top 10 (likely a worthy list), in a way that can predictably produce returns (like graham's formulas), is to judge management and their decisions/vision/execution. You have to personally decide if you believe they have the right ideas or not, the right methods of achieving them, and the right character to confront the inevitable challenges they will face. I believe books like those from Christensen and Drucker are the type that actually give you the correct perspectives for such a task - and that since we are in a time where we haven't yet developed a rigid formula for parsing and predicting these things, that means there is opportunity to be ahead of the curve, stand in a room of people who laugh at your decision, and still walk out the most correct when all is said and done.\n\nOnly after you have done all that do I think it is worth considering their current valuation and earnings, inferring what you believe the market has priced, and deciding if you have been beaten to the punch or not.\n\n\nI'm very impressed if anyone reads this ramble but I appreciate it if you do.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "This was a great read, thank you.

While comparing a founder-CEO to an appointed CEO is a little unfair, that's just the game. Zuck in his latest interview with Dwarkesh is also quite good.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I do think it's appropriate to take the time to try to understand as much of the technology as possible.

Does it have a world model or not? Can you really just do this with pure language comprehension, or has it understood some regions of the implied world behind the corpus? Also, what does it mean to understand or be intelligent? If Penrose is right about quantum effects/microtubules being key for consciousness, we might be screwed using non-quantum methods. Or maybe we can just emulate the important bits, capture it in some new algorithm, and the same ship can keep leading the way.\n\nSo I'm still big on NVDA as my high-conviction bet. I also own their competition and most other large tech names at my own weightings, and then I own indices and some slow growth/dividend names for income. \n\nIn terms of \"how could you have known\" for NVDA, you could have known nothing starting at the day chatGPT dropped. From playing with it, you could have seen it represented something fundamentally different/new in terms of capabilities. You then could have learned that OpenAI got the first H100 supercomputer hand-delevered from Jensen. Then you could have learned why Jensen and not cousin Lisa at AMD, and you would have learned that it was because of a specific way Jensen chooses to run his company. From there, an entry under 200 could have been made, and that's a 4 bagger on a megacap company in a little over a year - a generational return.  \n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n*Psychology of Money* is a good read too, to understand yourself and what you want out of your investments. What is right for me could be wrong for you. \n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we try to predict the future and do a good job at it, it's probably because of some theory that had been devised that happened to tap into a fundamental law of the universe. F=ma, e=mc^2, etc..\n\nBut what about businesses and technology? Even if (good CEO/managemnt) + (well-priced shares) = profit was the right equation, both of those terms are not objectively quantifiable like 2 Kg or 5 J. Even the P/E is filtered through subjective speculation and unknowable future, despite being an objective calculation. \n\n\nSo those books and interviews, along with everything else you injest about the world, is all you get for trying to develop a theory.

One other thing I wanted to mention is that owning shares outright is a more bullish position than selling a put. If you‚Äôre more bullish on a stock, you stand to gain more if it goes up in the short term than you would selling the put. Synthetically speaking, selling a put at a certain delta can be considered equivalent to buying the underlying and selling closer delta covered call (in terms of both upside and downside risk)\n\nLeaps are obviously more bullish than stocks alone, as you have a time constraint and you‚Äôre also forgoing dividends.\n\nThe important thing to consider with all of these things is that they all have different risk profiles, timelines, and different ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù of bullishness. It‚Äôs a very good idea to get acquainted with the math involved and run the risk calculations yourself for all scenarios (e.g. buying outright, selling a put, or doing a buy-write selling an immediate covered call) because there is no panacea: selling puts excels in different environments than owning outright stock - there is no right answer.

If the stock market rolls over massively then it's going to bleed into crypto which I believe this is the \"final top\". I do follow the DXY as a 3rd tool.
