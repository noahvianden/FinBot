{"title": "This week's game - buy to win this earnings season", "selftext": "My thoughts on coming week:\n\n* Iran/ Israel Tensions: Iran made a move that seemed to satisfy their domestic audience without causing any real damage. It played out about how I expected, with the markets reacting skittishly and dipping a bit, but also providing some good buying opportunities.\n* Earnings Season: Earnings reports were spectacular, but banks got caught up in Iran's saber rattling\n* Inflation and Rate Cuts: The volatility is likely to persist over the next several weeks as the inflation picture becomes clearer (it appears to be coming down) and the timing of rate cuts by the Fed (potentially June or July) becomes more certain.\n* Overall Outlook: Despite the recent choppiness, this remains a fundamentally strong market backed by a robust economy. My advice would be to take advantage of the volatility and Buy! There seem to be some solid opportunities emerging.\n\nWe are in the third innings of a bull market that's just started.  Buy!\n\n  \nPS - there's always some commentary on market having run up too fast, etc.  Just remember it took a big dump the prior year.  Those looking for a big correction also need to look at the history: we haven't seen strengthening economy and weakening markets.  There's a wall of worry to climb, which this market will climb.", "id": "1c46nh0", "created_utc": 1713134962.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 124 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 10 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "TSM to $180 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Ah yes the very stable and well established foundational foundry that has already ran 40% this year will surely run another 25% because‚Ä¶\n\n_checks notes_ you bought $10 lotto tickets", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "‚Ä¶because demand for AI chips is off the hook", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Let‚Äôs price in the future and Skybet, I mean skynet too", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "200", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Trust the dip ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Y'all still thinking you're getting those June rate cuts?
