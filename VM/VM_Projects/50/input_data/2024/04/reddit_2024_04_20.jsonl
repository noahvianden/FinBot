{"title": "Selling Puts Gone Wrong", "selftext": "I got assigned on my puts, I did not roll because I wanted to own the stocks and then sell calls. However, while it was going good for a few months on AAPL, AMD, and TSLA, the stock market has took a huge crap (understandably) but now I am down a lot and currently holding some very far gone puts which are getting hard to roll so far down. Anyone have any tips? Do I bite the bullet and sell shares for a big loss or buy back the puts for a big loss and start over? Seems like a great time to buy or start again with everything getting so low but my cash locked up at the moment. Also, selling calls once assigned would not be too lucrative since it is far below my avg price per share. Lastly, should I stick with the individual stocks or move to SPY, IWM, and QQQ?

AAPL and AMD are tech, but TSLA also fits into the tech sector as well. TSLA often makes wild moves up and down, so this should not be a surprise (I never traded puts on TSLA because it is very unpredictable).\n\nOne last rule is that AMD and AAPL have been on a downward trend for 3ish months. TSLA has been in a downward bearish trend since September of 2023! Why trade these dropping stocks?\n\nYou don't list position details, including total premiums to determine net stock cost, but the 27 dte AAPL 180 strike has a .93 premium if the net stock cost is at or below that amount. AMD also has some decent premium out a month or so meaning these positions do not seem to be that far gone. You may not get much selling CCs at or above your net stock cost, but every little bit will help, and it may take some weeks or months to see them move back up if your analysis is still that these are good stocks to hold.\n\nClosing and taking a loss looks to be unnecessary as you should be able to see AMD and AAPL come back over time. TSLA is unpredictable and continues its drop so may be one to close and take the loss as a stock one may no longer which to trade or hold, but this must be your determination.\n\nYou may want to read my wheel trading plan post as it might help you understand how to diversify across market sectors and making smaller trades can help manage and help avoid getting into this position in the future - [The Wheel (aka Triple Income) Strategy Explained : r/options (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/)", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t know when OP sold CSP but if he started 45 days ago, AMD was not in a downtrend yet.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah it was not.

There is an emotional benefit to getting rid of red marks, but I have to remind myself my goal is to make money, not get rid of temporary red marks.\n\nYou can ALWAYS roll a short put into an OTM expiration eventually, if you have patience.  With short calls you might never catch up to an otm strike, but short puts always get there, closer with each roll down, unless the stock goes to zero. \n\nAlso selling puts does not impact your cash (aside from the commission). Buying them back?  Bye bye cash. Reduction of available margin (to cover puts) might matter to you, but a $5 premium, for a $1 commission is a darn good monthly return. \n\nThis next part may not be for you, but for any newbies reading this: \n\nONCE YOU ROLL, the P/L or Gain column becomes MEANINGLESS (unless you do a lot of math). Why?  \n\nBecause Mr. Gain Column (P/L) thinks you gained the whole price that you sold it for.   EXAMPLE: Sell a put for $100. It turns against you and you buy it back for $500 but in that same trade you go forward a few weeks and sell a second put with a lower strike price for $550, earning a net $50 in premium. But tomorrow, Mr. Gain Column thinks you made $550 so buying back for $500 is a $50 win. \nNope. You took in $100 on put 1, plus $550 on put 2 (so + $650). But you also *spent* $500 to close put 1 and will spend $500 to close put 2 (so -$1,000).  Mr. Gain lied, you lose $350.  You can always keep up with the math yourself.   \n\nHad you waited and let it EXPIRE OTM, your gain would be the original $100 + the $50 profit  every time you rolled. \n\nAlso, if you roll often don’t be freaked out when your balance shows a loss. Every time you roll, you are closing the previous option for a loss, and that goes in the “realized loss” total. Someday, when it expires OTM, that entire realized loss gets erased by the realized gain.
