The blue-chip Dow (DJI) added 0.24% to conclude at 40,843.06 points.\n\n\nU.S. Treasury yields moved lower after Powell's comments, as traders snapped up bonds. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) fell to its lowest level since March, dropping 7 basis points to 4.032%.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, a largely given outcome.\n\n\nThe attention was on Powell's post-decision press conference, amid hopes that the central bank chief would talk about interest rate cuts in September. And Powell did not disappoint.\n\n\nHe signaled that policymakers could be considering an interest rate cut as soon as September if they continued to see inflation moving quickly or in line with their expectations, growth remaining reasonably strong and the labor market staying consistent with its current conditions.\n\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut in September climbed after Powell's comments, underscoring the market's confidence that the monetary policy easing cycle was imminent. There is now a 90.5% chance of a 25 bp cut, a 9.5% chance of a 50 bp cut, and a 0.0% chance of a 0 bp cut.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) surged 17%, after Morgan Stanley re-added the chip giant to its top picks list following the stock's recent selloff. In addition, Microsoft and Meta reiterated and increased their capital expenditure investments, signaling further revenue upside for Nvidia.
