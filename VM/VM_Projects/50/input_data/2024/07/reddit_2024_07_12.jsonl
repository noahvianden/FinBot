{"title": "How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investmentüí∏", "selftext": "Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes.\n\nIf you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more.\n\nHowever, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well.\n\nOne thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyt5r3kmn3cd1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe179e72d777caf49e6d8c0e66ec800f6f39d34a\n\nSounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors?\n\nEither you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow.\n\nThis might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.\n\nJames Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get.\n\nNeedless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport.\n\nI believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does).\n\nI've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla.\n\nTesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnc5gnmsn3cd1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba5c2e8b2be1dcdd27e20bc81f604e2f627b7beb\n\nWhen I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government.\n\nSeeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now.\n\nWhat do you think?", "id": "1e1jd6k", "created_utc": 1720795327.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "Never ever invest in Chinese stock.

Employers have to cut jobs when sales decline.  Then maybe both housing prices and rates would be lowered. Most buyers would still be afraid to buy because of job insecurity.

{"title": "This Soda is About to Pop / $PEP Pepsico", "selftext": "A bunch of household defensive names are at 52-week lows. This includes things like Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers and Pepsico.\n\nThe AI hype has relegated defensive stocks to the dustbin, but this is about to change in a big way.\n\nJuly is historically the strongest month in the summer for tech and it also has the highest statistical odds for the NASDAQ to form a multi-month market top.\n\nToday's big sell-off in tech, in reaction to better than expected inflation report, may seem illogical but it actually was predictable. This AI led tech rally flew too close to the sun and it's getting a little crispy here.\n\nThis is by no means the end of the tech rally, but it's a clear signal that big money is rotating money out of tech and into these beaten down defensives. Especially as we enter the seasonally bearish time of the year in any year, but particularly bearish in election years. The fall.\n\nThis is no secret, hedge funds have been [dumping tech stocks at a record rate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/hedge-funds-are-selling-tech-stocks-aggressively-goldman-says) in recent weeks ahead of this CPI read, and who's been buying? Retail.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3v4d0u9zzbd1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe83c62d4f343f2f6d5d5dd3a4a6fcac8718b083\n\nSo what's the deal with $PEP, why is it a good deal here?  \n1- The stock is at 52-week lows, but fundamentally the company is still growing and beating estimates.  \n2- There's a defensive rotation starting right now, that happens every year but is especially pronounced in election years and if you catch it early you can make so much money.  \n3- The stock has flashed a couple of very strong technical buy signals. It is now at a major supporting trendline, where the stock bottomed twice before. In the late 2018 market correction and in the COVID crash.  \nIt's at this support trendline again right now.\n\nJust trading at a trendline is not enough on its own to trigger a buy signal. This is where you have to look for other clues that big money is buying and we have plenty of those here.  Sector rotation trackers have been showing that big money has been selling tech and buying staples in anticipation of bearish end of summer into fall seasonality. The stock also formed a double bottom with a bullish divergence. A historically powerful bottoming signal. That indicates stronger conviction by investors at these levels.\n\nA simple mean reversion, to the middle of $PEP's historical uptrend would mean a rally to $190+ before the end of the year. And because $PEP is a low volatility name, options are cheap. Meaning the stock doesn't have to move up much for you to make money hand over first with calls.\n\nPosition :  \n$180 January 2025 call x 120 contracts", "id": "1e16f05", "created_utc": 1720751115.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 348 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsk34m/woof_woof_this_dog_is_about_bark_up_a_tree_a_big/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u446bu/long_amd_my_next_potential_10x_amd_trade/) \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I got a better thesis.
