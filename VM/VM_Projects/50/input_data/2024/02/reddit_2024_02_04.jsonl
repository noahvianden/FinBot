{"title": "AAPL will be in the IA game soon", "selftext": "Sorry for title. Obviously I mean AI\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.\n\nWhile Cook‚Äôs remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.\n\nADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n‚ÄúAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,‚Äù Cook said during a call with analysts. ‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.‚Äù\n\nGenerative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.\n\nApple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer‚Äôs conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù during the presentation, preferring the more academic term ‚Äúmachine learning.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet me just say that I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,‚Äù Cook said.\n\nSource\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-teases-apple-ai-announcement-later-this-year.html", "id": "1aijums", "created_utc": 1707037934.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|112|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Intelligence Artificial?", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Yes I mean AI, but in my language we say IA.

{"title": "CVS Fundamentals & Technical analysis. There is a big divergence between the numbers that CVS is producing and the news.", "selftext": "1. Death, taxes, and pharmacies. Everyone will have to deal with pharmacies & healthcare providers as they get older.\n2. CVS revenue is stably going up 10% QoQ and YoY. Stably is the keyword here, it will be important later in my technical analysis part.\n3. Newly acquired Oakstreet & Signify healthcare businesses are growing at 44% and 21% YoY. CVS is cross-selling Oakstreet and Signify Health with 39 million members at Aetna and 90 million at the pharmacy counters.\n4. Oakstreet is greatly out-performing expectations and CVS is ramping up the opening of Oakstreet offices.\n5. The creation of Cordavis. CVS works directly with manufacturers to commercialize and produce bio-similar products that greatly lower drug costs. The bio-similar market in the U.S. is estimated to grow from $10 B in 2023 to $100 B by 2029.  Example: Cordavis biosimilar Hyrimoz is priced 80% lower than Humira\n6. Enterprise value(Market cap+debt-cash). Cash and debt mean something on the balance sheet so we need to account for it. Example: Apple stock would be at a different price now if they had $3 Trillion in cash or $3 Trillion in debt.\n7. CVS FCF(free cash flow) /EV(enterprise value) yield is 12%. I use EV value because that‚Äôs how much the business is truly worth if you bought it with net 0 Debt and cash. (If you want to be 100% technically correct add interest expense to FCF to get a slightly different ratio)\n8. Before buying a stock( partial partnership of a business), imagine that you are going to buy the whole business and go private with it, then ask yourself how many years it will take to get your money back if you bought the whole business with net 0 debt and cash. For CVS you would need $139 B in cash(EV=95+60-16). The business is generating $16.5 B yearly in FCF. 139/16.5= 8.4 So if you bought the whole business, it would take you 8.4 years to get your money back. This disregards the current 10% growth. $16.5 B FCF is the value creation of CVS, if this was your private company, you can have this cash to be paid out in dividends.\n9. I cannot stress enough that we need to account for Debt and cash on the balance sheet when valuing companies because debt leeches cash from the business. FCF will flow straight to the equity holders through dividends, stock BB, etc. if the business doesn't have to pay down debt every year, the same as if we paid off our mortgages. This is why P/E is a poor metric to use on high-debt companies as it doesn‚Äôt account for cash and debt on the balance sheet.\n10. Disregarding the stock price, for a growing, FCF-positive business, the business is worth more today than yesterday as they have more cash today than yesterday. So CVS in 2024 is worth more than CVS in 2023 because their business generated $16.5 billion of cash in 2023\n11. So what happens if after all of the analysis CVS stock price falls another 25% from here? I think this is what separates an average investor from a great investor. An average investor would see 25% red and sell based on fear. A great investor would buy more because if CVS falls 25% from here, the business would be generating 14% in value a year with 10% growth.\n12. From my experience of analyzing many businesses, the stock price will often bottom out at around 6.5% (high growth tech) to 15% FCF/EV yield, depending on the quality and growth of the underlying business.\n\nTechnical analysis. If you don‚Äôt believe in technical analysis then just focus on the fundamental part. This is my specialty, I spent more than 10 years drawing Fibonacci & trendlines until I was able to make the connection between fundamentals & technical. I‚Äôm putting many years of self-taught experience in a few sentences so it could just be gibberish for some. I‚Äôm doing this because I wish I found something like this years earlier so I didn‚Äôt waste so much of my time trying to figure it out alone.\n\n1. We all have heard of ‚Äúbe fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful‚Äù but how? Technical analysis is about human psychology, and I have learned that growth trendlines & Fibonacci layering can help measure extreme fear and greed. Have you ever sold a stock simply because the stock price is falling or bought because the stock price is going up? The answer is probably yes. For my technical analysis to make sense, imagine every red bar is fear, and every green bar is greed. I found that emotions buying and selling can be measured with Fibonacci and they are better presented on the weekly candlestick bars.\n2. CVS weekly channel https://imgur.com/a/QKgIPH9.  To explain the red trendline in terms of fundamentals, it‚Äôs simply the growth trajectory of the underlying business. I notice that the more stable the business growth, the more stable the trendline.\n3. If you look at the monthly/weekly trendlines of stably growing companies like KO (https://imgur.com/a/FI6txaK) , MCD (https://imgur.com/a/PC6dhXB) , you can see their YoY growth on a trendline. You can also clearly see the growth of the US economy on the SPY monthly trend line from 2009 to 2020 (https://imgur.com/a/jbIebzJ) , until covid and the liquidity injections messed it up. The trendline for high-growing businesses will be steeper until the growth slows and the stock price will fall like a rock, breaking the trend. Slower-growing businesses will have a more gradual trendline. The trendline will break the moment the growth slows or declines.\n4. Short-term, stock price is just a perception of a business, it has nothing to do with the fundamentals. If a business is fast growing, people will want to pay more for it, and when the masses see price appreciation, they will continuously keep buying, pushing the stock higher, creating hype and extreme stock prices, and vice versa for when a stock falls. Example: for INTC, their revenue grew massively since 2000, even at their peak revenue of $79B, their stock never made a new high. (I'm seeing this in NVDA atm). This is why trendlines on stably growing business work, growth is known and we can use this to our advantage.\n5. Fibonacci retracement, you can think of this as a % discount on the stock price. There are 5 retracements that I look at 38, 50, 61, 78 and 87%. What I noticed is that the higher the quality of the business the less retracement that the stock price will retrace(around 38-50% for higher quality, growing, FCF positive businesses). For simplicity, focus on the 50% as it is the most popular.\n6. The importance of 50% retracement(50% discount). CVS revenue grew every year from 2015 and 2019, so the underlying business was doing fine but the stock retraced about 50% from $113 in 2015 to $53 in 2019 (https://imgur.com/a/EsxVV15) . There was nothing wrong with the business, it was just greed that pushed the stock price way past its true value from $30 in 2011 to $113 in 2015.\n7. Warren Buffet has unknowingly talked about the 50% Fibonacci retracement in one of his videos, saying that Berkshire has lost about 50% in value 3 times throughout his lifetime. Link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeCAAAbbgmg&t=27s)\n8. There are many ways to use Fib retracement from different perspectives. I have used another perspective to get a price target of $87 on CVS the next 6-9 months.  It‚Äôs the 50% retracement from the top at $111 in 2022 to the bottom at $64 in 2023. (https://imgur.com/a/eHN7ZRm)\n9. Fib extension 261% . The 2 main levels that I focus on are 161% and 261%. Imagine every red bar is fear and every green bar is greed. Using CVS as an example. For the weekly red bar on August 14, 2023, I am extending the fear bar upward and I also get a $87 price target at 261%. (https://imgur.com/a/hTJWzwA)\n10. Fib ext 161%. Combining the above fib ext(261%) with another fib ext(161% this time) from the weekly red bars on Jan 8, 2024 to Jan 22, 2024. I also get $87. (https://imgur.com/a/oFfvOby)\n11. In my final screenshot, you can see that I have increased my probability of being right by investing in a 12% FCF-yielding business that has 10% growth. Combining that with 50% fib retracement, 261% + 161% fib extension, upper channel as resistance. CVS has a very high probability of reaching $87 in the next 6-9 months. (https://imgur.com/a/gjN61rk)\n12. It took me many years to truly understand the connection between fundamentals and technical analysis. If you are new to investing I doubt that you will get much from this. But if it was me, I would save this and take a look at it again a few years from now. With more experience from working in the real world ,managing your own business, failing with your own investments and doing your own technical analysis, you will have a clearer view of my presentation above.\n\nTLDR: CVS to $87 in 6-9 months.
