{"title": "$2T NVDA is fairly valued for 2024 (w/ no upside)", "selftext": "I’m sure you’re probably hearing this from 100 other idiots out there but here’s what no one seems to mention.  \n\nA stock being over or undervalued is always tied to time.  From the perspective of February 2024, NVDA is now fairly to over valued and high risk.  \n\nDoes it deserve to be $2T company.  F-yes it does.  No question about it. \n\nThe question isn’t whether the company ought to have a $2T valuation, it’s a question of timing and a question future investment opportunity/returns.  \n\nAnd right now, from a pure risk-reward perspective, it is most definitely not worth investing in NVDA at $2T in Feb 2024.  \n\nHere’s why.  Let’s consider a company like Apple. \n\nApple today, sits at a $2.8T valuation,  produces $115B in quarterly revenues and ungodly amounts of net income and cash.  That’s nearly 5x what Nvidia is currently producing in quarterly revenues.  Now obviously Apple isn’t growing anymore and Nivida just grew 500% with high expectation of further explosive growth ahead.  \n\nAnd yes NVDA’s installed base may double to over  $2T and yes NVDA is expected to grab a big piece of that pie.  \n\nThe problem here is that NVDA is already trading at $2T.  It is trading on the current expectation of revenues growing to $300B per year  Profits growing to at least $100B.  \n\nNotice if NVDA produces $70B in net income this year, it would trade at a 28 P/E ratio.  The same P/E ratio Apple trades at today but without the several hundred billion of cash Apple has.  Nvidia has to more than double its revenues and earnings over the next four quarters just to be fairly valued at $800 today.  \n\nNow before anyone says, $70B in net income annually is totally accomplishable this year, that is based on TODAY’s valuation.  \n\nThe question isn’t whether today’s price is justifiable.  The question here is what exactly is the upside for someone buying at $800?  If NVDA needs to produce $70B in net income in order justify today’s valuation, what exactly is the upside at $800 a share right now in Feb 2024?  \n\nThe point here is that NVDA is already priced to perfection. \n\nA 25% move up in the stock puts it at a $2.5T valuation and places it right next to Apple.  Nvidia has nowhere near Apple’s Cash (justifying the 28 P/E) and has yet to sustainably produced those extremely high levels of revenue to justify a $2.5T valuation.  Apple has been doing it for years.  \n\nMore things can go wrong at this point, than right.   \n\nWhat happens if NVDA’s growth stalls in Q3 or Q4 and it doesn’t reach that $70B net income number this year?  The stock will collapse on ANY signs of a slowdown.  Because at $2T, it is already priced on the expectation of $70B in net income for 2024.  \n\nStocks that reach fair value don’t have a lot of opportunity remaining.  Nvidia was a better investment when the price traded far below its earnings at $5-$600.  Now it’s trading more inline with future earnings.  You don’t want that.  You want a stock that is perpetually undervalued.  It creates prepetual upside pressure.   At $800, NVDA is just another TSLA type stock that is going to be highly volatile from here on out.  \n\nDon’t expect this to be an easy ride to $1000.  There’s going to be a lot of risk from $800 to $1000 and a lot of volatility.  \n\nOn the flip side, if NVDA falls back under $700 — which it might in a correction — it becomes undervalued.   \n\n$800 = fairly value (low opportunity) \n$700 = under valued \n$900 = overvalued in 2024\n\n\n", "id": "1ayelp7", "created_utc": 1708729361.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "And that’s the measure of how revolutionary people expect AI to be.

It’s whether it’s worth buying now that it’s at $800.  I’m saying the answer to that is probably no. That’s because the expectations are now sky high and anything less than flawless performance will crash the stock.  And even if the performances is flawless, there isn’t a lot of upside left.  \n\nDue to those dynamics, the stock is entering a high risk phase.  \n\nThink about it.  At $500, the upside potential was 100% returns up to $1000 with almost no downside risk.  That’s because it was trading far under its earnings.  That’s a good investment.  \n\nAt $800, the upside is now only 25% which would make the stock close to the most valuable company in the world.   And the downside risk is now very high.  If it doesn’t end up doubling from here and if AI isn’t as profitable as future expectations suggests, then it’s back down to $500.  Because today’s price is based on $70-80B in net income.

The point is, this IS how stock price works fundamentally.\n\nEven with a mind blowing revenue in the past quarter, if only the guidance is not strong enough, the price would have tanked, immediately.

I invest in the NASDAQ 100 which has Nvidia as its third largest holding now..  so I’m essentially about 7% long NVDA.   I don’t buy individual stocks, but I might decide to buy Nvidia.  The last individual stock I was heavily invested in was Apple.  Since then it’s been NASDAQ 100.  \n\nYou can judge for yourself whether a stock is under or overvalued.  Just compare its earnings to its stock price and future growth expectations.  It’s not rocket science.  \n\nIt would be insane to consider nvda overvalued at $400.  It’s not even overvalued now.  \n\nThink about it.  Nvidia will very easily reach 70 billion in income within the next 18 months.  That puts it at under a 30 PE ratio.  All the other trillion dollar companies are trading at those valuations (25-35).  \n\nAt $400 it would be trading at 15 p/e.  No one in their right mind would say that NVDA deserves to trade at a 15 p/e.  \n\nNow if Nvidia ends up earning more than 70 billion then it will have to be revalued again.  But it will eventually run up against the law of large numbers. Eventually, its growth rate percentage will stall as a result.  For example, it’s not gonna grow 400% from a $100 billion base of net income.  That’s just not going to happen.  \n\nSo once it earns that $70B number next year, the p/e will contract down to that 28-30 level and then it will turn into an apple.

But some investors have urged caution, suggesting that high tech valuations could put the rally at risk.*\n\n*Oliver Bäte, CEO of wealth manager Allianz, which has around $1.85 trillion in assets under management, said it looks “very dangerous out there.”*\n\n*“We are very cautious about some of the valuations in the tech sector,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Friday.*\n\n*European markets extended gains Friday after the Stoxx 600 index closed at an all-time high in the previous session.*\n\n*Fresh earnings out of Europe and spillover from Nvidia’s bumper revenue report in the U.S. helped push the pan-European benchmark to 495.1 on Thursday — surpassing its previous record of 494.35 in January 2022, according to data from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

The surge boosted Nvidia’s market cap by $276 billion — the biggest one-day gain for any company on record.*\n\n*Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told CNBC on Friday that the recent rallies pointed to AI “innovation in action on every front,” and said his company had benefited “enormously” from the tech. The comments came shortly after the bank posted an 18% increase in pretax profit and announced a $1 billion share buyback program in its full-year earnings Friday.*\n\n*However, Philippe Ferreira, deputy head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, raised questions about how long the AI hype will continue to drive markets higher.*\n\n*“Over the course of the year, it is likely that the overall AI theme will get a reality check at the companies’ level,” he said in notes to CNBC earlier this week. “The AI trade as we have seen it might have a little more to go, but it seems to be approaching important technical levels where some profit taking could occur.”*\n\n*In the U.S. this week, investors piled into growth and technology stocks pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also recorded its best session since February 2023, popping 2.96% to close at 16,041 on Thursday.*\n\n*For Ferreira, “18,300 on NDX and early March could be key exit levels ahead of some material consolidation.”*\n\n*“There is no shortage of fundamental catalysts and important reckonings could be up ahead,” he added.*\n\n*For Allianz’ Bäte, there remain still-present pockets of risk in tech and beyond. “If I was individually investing \\[in tech\\], great idea.

Perhaps so that the ultimate developed AI workload can run on the META hyperscale worldwide redundant server network - thus explaining the massive H100 infrastructure build currently being deployed.  Proprietary language models like ChatGTP must be rented as a service and cannot be used for custom AI development instances.  Most large entities and governments will want custom AI compute, and in many cases multiple instances of AI compute for different tasks (defense, crime fighting, tax collections, etc).\n\nRemember AWS is worth, by many estimates, more than Amazon's retail e-commerce division.    What will META be worth when they are the primary provider of AI hosted infrastructure to start-ups, consumers, small and large businesses and world governments?  Probably well over $3000 per share - and this increase in share price will occur rapidly within the next 3 years should it become evident META is becoming the AWS of AI.   META remains, despite its recent massive run up, the cheapest of the mega-cap tech stocks (and in an election year advertising environment also....).\n\nSo this is still a largely secret program at META (why let potential competitors like AWS know their strategy ahead of time).  But, once announced, expect further gains in META's equity valuation - perhaps very substantial gains.\n\nInterested in others thoughts on this.
