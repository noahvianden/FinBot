I'm a long term holder of NVDA, and here's some bad news:    And end is coming for NVDA trading in these types of nose bleed ranges.\n\nToday is a fun time as a shareholder, new ATHs coming one after the other.  But look a the **history of this stock is it exhibits big peaks and big valleys in the share price** over time.   So don't get caught up in FOMO if you want to own this company long term.\n\nSo when you ask is it passed a transformative buy?  At this moment?  Sure anything over 2-3x in the next 5 years is going to be hard from $700+.    But in two years in the future it could be trading for 50% of the current price.   It's happened before (I saw an 80% decline at one point), and I think some >20% downs going to happen again.   One should **view that as an opportunity**, rather than a *disaster,* as I'm certain the the FOMO/YOLO crowd would.   This would be in accord with Warren Buffet's idea to  [be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012116/warren-buffett-be-fearful-when-others-are-greedy.asp)\n\nThe second thing is the **opportunities** in front of this company, and the way management is approaching.   I remain in awe over strategy, execution and  potential.  Beyond AI, there are public initiatives on Automotive, Omnivers/Digital Twins, Quantum, Digital Biology, Agriculture, Physics, Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Robotics and dozens of others -- many I'm sure are not even public -- that GPUs and ML can take to the next level.    Not all of these will pay out, but some will for sure.  Nvidia are also investing heavily in AI startups, 1000s of them, through their Inception Program.    [Nvidia believes they are working towards a $1T TAM.](https://imgur.com/a/4Jv2syl)\n\nSo if you really want to hitch your wagon to Nvidia for the long term, my advice is to **take your time and be discriminating about choosing your entry point**.   That's not a good answer for the crowd who demands instant gratification, but it worked for me.

His effort is going to be on Twitter and SpaceX where he is more invested.\n\n\nAnd even personally, EVs aren’t something he has the most passion for. He is far right leaning and is fine with gas as an energy source. He truly believes saving the planet is getting to Mars. That’s why he pumped Tesla to hit milestones. It was for funding his dream of getting to Mars. There are emails where he admits this.\n\nAnd with him unlikely to get his pay package he has less incentive. Because legally they can’t offer him anything close or it can be held up in court and likely nullified.\n\nAnd with the board loyal to him he’s not going anywhere as the de facto leader. So he’s holding it hostage without a good person that really cares being the top of the totem pole.\n\nNot to mention he is a negative on the brand. You don’t want a figure of such controversy as your mascot as it cuts down who you can sell to.\n\nPlus, he’s done all he can do in terms of hyping the stock. He’s told too many fibs for him to pump it higher with more promises.\n\nAnd he really doesn’t give a shit. He has been disastrous on earning calls. “We dug our own grave with CyberTruck”…\n\nLike that is just not something you say to your investors. You can spin that in a much better way if you’re competent. It’s not something 2019 Elon would have said.\n\nNot to mention, he has the unique ability to steal tech or promise from Tesla and instead funnel it to one of his other companies that are private. And he has admitted that he might do this. Even being able to threaten that will drive away investors long term.\n\nWhat positives does he bring long term?\n\nThe dude is an investor and hype man. And he is more part time than a part time employee. \n\nHe also is a lighting rod for scandal.\n\nLook at Uber and what happened with their controversial CEO. I think it’s the same thing here Elon was needed to grow the company to where it is. But, he’s focused elsewhere and has no purpose in it as a mature company.\n\nAnd Uber replacing their founder was needed for it to truly succeed.\n\nThe longer he stays… the longer it lacks clear leadership.\n\nThe longer it’s ok with not bringing out new products to excite people.\n\nCyberTruck is still an unfinished product almost 5 years later. It’s not yet at the point where it can be sold reliably with good quality control (see the examples of awful paneling) or scaled.
