Just ask the following question and you’ll get insight from how you think about the answer—are current shareholders (big banks and institutions) more likely to take profit and rotate out into other areas that may have lagged the market and now present an opportunity for catching up, or is there a greater probability that new cash (in the form of money market withdrawals that have been sitting on the side) will come in and support current price? It’s always about buyers and sellers at the end of the day, especially in a trillion dollar market cap company. It’s probably going to take a surprise move that will catch sellers and bystanders off guard for a move higher to break the structure that’s been established since June.\n\nPersonally, I believe the latter—I think there is a lot of money market cash that’s going to lose its appeal with rates coming down and it’s going to have to find a new home. The problem will be that it most likely will come in November when everyone feels safe after the election is decided, and the move will already be over by then, so I’m bullish. But I’m going to wait to have some sort of confirmation before I commit. Bought heavily down in the 103 area when it came down a few Fridays ago and sold into the recent top. I almost sold puts Wednesday night but I feel like there’s going to be an opportunity to enter again before it breaks the downward trend for the upside. Probably we’ll get it with a jobs number or October CPI, we’ll see. \n\nI think it’s fair to say that the comments are right about it being coiled.. there’s a market forming on either side that’s much more “balanced” than in recent history, so it leaves room for a gamma squeeze if things breakout one way or the other. Someone has been buying heavily into the Oct. 80 puts for quite a while. I think the biggest call trade Friday was a bear vertical, but I’d have to go back and check it.
