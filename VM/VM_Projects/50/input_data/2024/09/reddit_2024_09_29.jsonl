{"title": "Nvidia, AMD, and Intel", "selftext": "I keep hearing people say to buy Intel or AMD instead of Nvidia.  I just wanted to share my thoughts, as somewhat of an industry insider (a software engineer who worked at Nvidia for several years).\n\nNvidia is doing laps around AMD and Intel, and they probably always will.  Every month that goes by, they just get further ahead.  They've always been the smartest kid in the class, and this is late stage capitalism where that one kid is about to own the whole town.  \n\nDon't put your biggest bet on AMD or Intel.  Diversify if you want, but put more in nvidia.  AMD and Intel will hopefully do fine, but nvda will do better.  (To go further... the fact that Intel amd AMD are not wildly profitable even in this windfall AI-friendly climate is somewhat shameful.  And they're overpriced... look at their P/E ratios: 100 and 200!)\n\nNvidia's p/e ratio is 55.  And it's been there for the last 2 years.  All of the srock price increase over the last 2 years was from pure, real earnings growth.  That's not hype.  And 55 isn't even that high - far below tesla's hype days (400!) - and especially when Nvidia is *the* key player sitting at the front of the 4th (and biggest) industrial revolution.  AI agents that can do real jobs (at much lower cost) are coming, probably in the next few years (IMO), and they'll displace a lot of the work on earth (...some % of $100 trillion GDP).\n\nNvidia has had their eye on this (evolving) ball since gpgpu in 2006 and has executed flawlessly the whole time.  Don't doubt them.  Buy, hold, and benefit.  \n\nOthers may compete on inference, but Nvidia has a moat around training that'll take many years to penetrate.  But by the time someone breaks through, they'll probably have dug another one, because they're just freaking rock stars on every axis: strategic vision, business relationships, chip design, high bandwidth networking, cuda, their huge and ultra-skilled developer relations teams, they put out 25% of the great AI research papers themselves... and they basically have the best CEO in history, Jensen.\n\nDon't sell it until most of your random customer service phone calls are handled by an AI agent and *you're thrilled with it* because they are vastly superior to working with humans.\n\nI told my friends and family in 2016 that someday, Nvidia would be the most valuable company on earth, by a massive margin.  And now it is (just) at the top.  But it has so much farther still to go.  We don't even have agents yet.  Where the stock is at today is nothing.  The Gen ai wave is neat, but the agentic AI wave will be right behind it, and will be 100x bigger.  Nvidia will probably peak at 10-100x its current value, depending on how that moat holds up.  \n\nAnd it'll be hilarious if it does so with a low P/E ratio the whole time, just because the market doesn't understand it.\n\nNo matter what you do, though, best of luck out there!  :)", "id": "1fry4mi", "created_utc": 1727591335.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "Long term Nvidia share holder here (15+ years).  Big fan and proponent, however\n\n>Nvidia has a moat around training that'll take many years to penetrate.\n\nGoogle TPU trained their own (Gemini) and client's models.   While Nvidia has developed a more user friendly, flexible, portable and diversified development environment, the idea training is going to be *hard to penetrate* is already in the past.   Others are working on that goal as well (AWS trainium).   Nvidia's strategy here is that they do it more efficiently and offer a quicker time to market, and they have to run fast in hardware to maintain that lead.   I don't really have doubt they can continue on the HW side.\n\nFrom the SW perspective, it seems the primary advantage Nvidia has is first mover with a new architecture.  So CUDA the default choice for ML operations.  But the market is young and there are a lot of forces working against.\n\nSince they've already established a new processor architecture, the objective should be getting it as broadly adopted as possible.  From an insider perspective, what do you think are the key differentiators in the software space working for Nvidia, and what do you think their potential weaknesses are in achieving that goal?\n\nLike you, I don't believe any near term threats are coming from AMD/Intel/Qcom types, they all seem inept in this regard.

But Google has also been building and refining those for a very long time now, working out the kinks.  In general, training is a much harder space to pop up and quickly compete in (vs inference).\n\nOne interesting difference is that Nvidia *sells* their hardware to the world, whereas Google only *rents* their tpus to the world (I believe) via cloud compute.  And that could be an important factor for big players who want to make sure they secure lots of AI computing power for the future, at a known cost.\n\nTangent: One huge advantage that Nvidia *stock* has over all these other AI stocks is that creating datacenter GPUs is now the bulk of their business - so if they double their data center business, their stock doubles.  But if broadcom doubles their TPU sales to Google, that's only a little piece of their overall revenue, so their stock only goes up a little bit.  Or if Microsoft or Google or Amazon start selling more AI agent time through the cloud, it'll have to be a really big amount of revenue before it starts to significantly move their stock prices.

I am not a tech guy, but I do know that almost all LLMs are run on the CUDA language, which is the only language that allows you to operate on GPUs. That is a moat that Nvidia has.

Besides serving as the API (application programming interface) to the GPU, the most amazing feature of CUDA (to me) is it's ability to retain inter-generational compatibility between chips.   That means you can run the same program on Tegra (hand held) and DGX (supercomputer) virtually unchanged.   It's been this way since the beginning, purpose built.  The value as a developer (or CS major for example) is you can program on on your Nvidia laptop one day and run your code on your work/school's machine learning supercomputer the next day.\n\nSo what do you want open sourced?   The programming interface, like here's the registers that control memory management or calls a multiply-add function, or do you want the inter-generational compatibility?  And then there are all the tools and support services that Nvidia has developed over the years, performance profilers and frame counters and so on.  Should one expect all that sweet goodness open source too?\n\nHere is why I think Nvidia doesn't open it up:  Because if they do, a) customers will have a \"less than\" experience than on Nvidia's products and b) folks using it will complain that Nvidia isn't going \"all in\" and giving all the special sauce to make for example, AMD's MI300 just work on Nvidia developed applications.  Either way *Nvidia gets a bad rap*.  Architecturally it's complex, and to ensure a level playing field just brings on loads of support problems.\n\nWill they ever?   Maybe.  They are taking some steps: [NVIDIA contributes to many open-source projects, including the Linux Kernel, PyTorch, Universal Scene Description (USD), Kubernetes, TensorFlow, Docker, and JAX. NVIDIA is also proud of our support and contributions to open-source foundations and open-standards bodies.

You might want to ask yourself, does reaching a certain market cap fundamentally incur some kind of resistance?  Well, it seems to, for the other huge companies.\n\nTo make more money, you have to sell more product, more often, to more customers, at higher prices.  But looking at the other high-market-cap companies (Apple, etc), their business is mature, and their growth is at the flattish end of a sigmoid curve.  They've nearly maxed out all 4 of these angles to make more money, and saturated their market, and they have to work super hard to find/sustain new growth.\n\nWith AI, though, it's a very different story.  We are at the very beginning of demand for (Agentic) AI hardware -- we're at the very very bottom of the sigmoid curve (which will completely transform earth's economy).  Over the next decade, Nvidia (and other AI hardware companies) will easily sell 100x more product, or more.  AI hardware companies have growth potential ahead of them that is fundamentally, qualitatively different from any other industry, and the resistance at 3 trillion is only in investor's minds, because they've never seen this happen before.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, fab production capacity will be a bottleneck, from here on out.  But the smart players see that Agentic AI is coming (and will transform the economy), and are ramping up fab capacity early and as fast as possible.  And once Agentic AI lands, well, companies are greedy for profits, and if they can replace humans with cheaper/better machines, they'll do it in a heartbeat -- so once it lands, demand will be insane, and the economic transformation more or less inevitable.\n\nAnother point I should make is that Nvidia's profit will be tied more to the overall demand for AI hardware, than to the limited fab production supply capacity.  As demand exceeds supply, companies bid higher to get the product they desperately want.  So for every bit of unmet demand, Nvidia (and like companies) will still make more money (per item sold), even if they're not selling more product.\n\nBasically, as soon as Agentic AI exists, and the cost to use it drops below the cost of paying a human (with similar output quality), half of the money on earth is going to flood into this sector almost overnight, and (at least as far as we can see today), Nvidia looks well-poised to take the biggest piece of that pie.\n\nBut note that Intel, AMD, and Nvidia are all at the same place on this new sigmoid curve.  So I think their market cap limits, or how fast they grow, will be driven mainly by how well they execute, not by any theoretical limits.

Their stocks should react slowly at first, since cloud compute is a small percentage of their overall revenue (10-40% for google, Amazon, Microsoft), but eventually they should take off too. \n\nGood robotics software and agentic AI are both waiting on similar breakthroughs.  Llms were the easy path to intelligence because the data and training are easy.  For real-time systems, it's a little harder to train them, but all the fundamental ingredients are there, the deep learning works, and it's just a matter of time until someone cracks the real-time approach and all of this comes to life.  \n\nChatgpt's advanced voice mode Is the closest thing I've seen yet, to the real-time AI approach we need to unblock most of this, and it makes me confident that openAI is moving in the right direction.

The incentive is that it is cheaper, so it'll result in less than $1 flowing into the AI companies.\n\nWhen I say 10-100x, I'm looking 10 years ahead, thinking about what the world will look like when two things have happened: (1) A significant portion of world GDP (20-50%) has been displaced by AI.  And (2) GDP has risen quite a bit, because a whole new layer on top of the old economy has been unlocked, with tons of new jobs, markets, and possibilities that didn't exist before - which happens with each big economic revolution (see below), but this time, it should be more dramatic, because you have the transformative power of (a) ultra cheap and easy-to-replicate cognition (you no longer have to grow/feed/house/educate a human for 18 years to get another productive worker), and (b) superintelligence unlocking new technologies, medicines, materials, etc.\n\nThere were 3 prior significant revolutions to the economy: the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution (electricity + steam engines), and computers.  (Some people add the internet as a 4th.).  Each of these completely changed the structure of the economy and 10x'd world GDP.  Why wouldn't you think this one would do the same?\n\nNow, I get your point that it might not be Nvidia.  10 years is a long way out.  And I agree, who knows where Nvidia will be in 5 years.  But 2-3 years out, they look pretty good.  We have a 20-year history of them spanking AMD and Intel, the other giants, so the competition won't come from them.  And there certainly will be upstarts, and at some point, Nvidia might find themselves in trouble.  But they also are a very well-run company and will probably see the changes and adapt quickly.  But regardless, to me, at least the next 2-3 years look pretty safe for Nvidia, and I'm expecting them to keep growing at 50-100% per year for a while.

Nvidia manage it with a monopoly and because we are in the initial investment period.\n\nSo even if AI will be 50% of the stock market long term, there no reason for AI hardware to be more than 10-20% of that or 5-10% of the stock market overall.\n\nAnd the problem for the moment is actually making money with AI. Microsoft, Google, Apple all invest heavily but they are not really making money out of it. They just compete for who use their search engine and to grow its integration into smartphone/computers. Will most people on earth agree to pay for that usage while google/Microsoft/apple will offer it for free, is doubtful.\n\nRemains to be seen what professional will pay for. From what I see, it is mostly slightly modified version of the big public model to adapt to one business or another and is basically a few dozen bucks per professional per month.
