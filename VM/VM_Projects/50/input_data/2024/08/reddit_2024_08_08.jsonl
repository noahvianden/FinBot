They just made their APIs super expensive so its not viable to scrap them. That's why lately whenever you go on Instagram for a post or to watch a video on facebook, even seeing tweets, you need to be logged in. Tracks your activity and makes scraping impossible without making a billion bot accounts.\n\nLately the news is just misleading. They are adding pressure on Nvidia because they grew so fast and made a critical mistake, they dont have enough lobbysts in washington to help them out. I think they have like 7 while google and facebook have 100+ each.\n\nIt's a bigger play, I think they want to drive the price down as much as possible then buy back at once at some random time in the future because they know all this negative news isn't affecting the fundementals and most of it is just stalling and dragging the giant down. You just wait, the next spike is going to be bigger than the first half of this year :)\n\n\nLook here https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20240808003744:0/\nThose articles are just a small scale propaganda to change people's perception on Nvidia.\n\n\"While Nvidia's stock skyrocketed over the past year, it's dropped 22% over the past month amid worries about higher capital spending by some of its Big Tech rivals.\"\n\nWe saw in the last 2 weeks that five magnificent 7 companies said they used up their capex to buy more AI infrastructure (aka GPUs). This article twisted this into bearish news?\n\nSimilar with the delays, first it was 'limited delays up to 3 months' Then it started changing to 'ATLEAST 3 months'.\nAlso the antitrust probs, similar to the first statement, they dont have enough presence in washington to let such issues slip through, so now they need to spend money getting more lobbysts.\n\nAll in all, it's market manipulation AND people manipulation. \n\nIn conclusion, Nvidia is fine. Fundementals are solid, they are still growing. Maybe not at an exponential rate as investors thought, but steadily up. My reserved expectation is that it will test all time high second half next year.

Doing it with your house is more difficult. It's where you live, and it's a huge asset. That's a lot more risk to factor in.\n\nAnd bear in mind that the real estate market moves slowly.

I made a kind of ethnocentric assumption that you're in the U.S. I can't speak directly to your housing market.\n\nI do think we have a strong possibility of a global recession but, again, I'm reluctant to offer an opinion without specific research on  your region.\n\nAs I said, if prices go up or down and you are talking about selling a house to buy a new one, the price doesn't really matter. If the market is pricey, your house and the new house will be equally inflated in price. If they drop, your house drops but the new house drops.\n\nThings to consider are:\n\n1) Do you have the option to stay where you are and make an addition to the property to increase its appeal for you as a living space and increas your equity?\n\n2) Can you find a new property that is at a discount because it's a foreclosure or needs work (work that you can do)? If so, you can sell your place and buy the new one and feel confident you can increase the value.\n\n3) What is your mortgage rate? Mortgage rates are high, that means higher costs and lower buying power. Do you want to lose a low rate mortgage and take on a higher rate one?\n\n4) If you believe there is a recession, it's best to shore up cash, cut costs, keep your job and find a side job. Then you can use those cash reserves when the economy is a mess and that money will do more for you.
