{"title": "Why I bought Puts on MNST (Monster) ", "selftext": "Since Monster releases its earnings report after market, it’s time for some puts… or calls if you are based and want to inverse me \n\nReason 1: High expectations - Current expectations for this quarterly are quite high.. Expected earnings per share are $0.452 as opposed to the $0.400 of a year ago . In this same light the market expects (has already priced in) a nearly 200 million dollar increase in revenue from the year prior.. Put quite simply these massive increases are already expected and priced in, and it’s much easier to fall short when expectations are this high \n\n Reason 2: Competition - PepsiCo is fighting hard for market share of the energy drink market and threw $550 million dollars for an 8.5% share of Celsius in 2022. Monster has already struggled to maintain market share versus Red Bull, which owns the largest portion of the energy drink market.. Now on top of this already stiff competition they have to deal with a whale like PepsiCo flooding the market with products like Rockstar and Celsius over time\n\nReason 3: regulation- As more health focused initiatives take place in Europe and America, products like monster will face increased scrutiny, both from consumers and governments alike (regulations on certain contents).\n\nReason 4: Even those who hit their goals have been getting smashed… AMD and Reddit- Now I get what you are thinking “what the heck do these companies have to do with monster”… and yea they have no direct relationship.. But even after surpassing their goals for this last quarter these companies have seen their value get smashed.. The market is being mad weird and bearish right now when it comes to earnings. So in essence this combined with reason 1 (the high goals they already have), means that I feel that the odds favor the Put/bear side \n\n\nHope you enjoyed my presentation!!

{"title": "How to make money on today's HOOD Earnings", "selftext": "Last week, I told you guys what to do for both [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) and [AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehnhtp/amazons_earnings_are_today_what_are_we_doing/). This week we have more earnings, specifically today I wanted to look at HOOD. Let's just first take a quick glance at the company, Robinhood Markets. They've been expanding beyond stock trading into credit cards, retirement accounts, and other financial services. When the brokerage firm reports second-quarter earnings after the market close today, we'll finally get the chance to get an idea on how those new efforts are doing.\n\nAnalysts are guessing the company will report pretty strong second quarter earnings growth, looking for earnings per share of 16 cents on revenue of $640 million. That compares with earnings of just 3 cents and revenue of $486 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nWe need to keep in mind that this earnings report lands at a very volatile moment right now in markets, with a sharp sell-off in equities earlier this week. Shares of Robinhood have dropped like a rock - 24% over the past month. This has erased quite a bit of the stock’s substantial run-up earlier this year. Still tho, the stock is still up 37% year to date compared with a 9.8% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nI don't know if anyone's noticed but they've also expanded into credit cards and retirement accounts recently. HOOD currently has a budding subscription service and signaled that they might just move into wealth management. They also doubled down on cryptocurrency with its [June acquisition of Bitstamp](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/06/06/robinhood-to-buy-crypto-exchange-bitstamp-in-effort-to-expand-outside-the-us/), a leading cryptocurrency exchange, for $200 million in cash.\n\nA lot of people think that these efforts are the key to the firm’s future. Especially now that regulators have forced the company to dial back on some stupid features, [such as digital confetti](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/robinhood-gets-rid-of-confetti-feature-amid-scrutiny-over-gamification.html), that helped initially make it popular with regards like us. But from what I've read, analysts are pretty split on the stock. Many have it rated as a buy Buy, some as a Hold, and quite a few rating the stock as a Sell. At least, according to [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/). \n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities analyst [Kenneth B. Worthington](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/kenneth-worthington/) wrote in a research note just a few days ago that the second-quarter environment was favorable for Robinhood, and monthly metrics through May signal higher equity, options, and crypto trading volumes. As Robinhood has leaned deeper in crypto, this guy actually thinks the stock is increasingly correlated with the price of Bitcoin in daily movements. He has given the stock a December 2024 price target of $16 a share, a little less than what it's currently at.\n\nI don't believe Robinhood really has the innovation to climb higher this year, and with poor guidance, they might not do well with their earnings report today. And with that, I'm getting 8/9 16p for 0.61 a pop. When it comes to earnings, the stock moves on average about 10%, so with a drop this size, I expect 16p to do well. We can reduce the cost of this earning play by making a spread. Buying the 15p at the same exp cuts the price of the play by more than half but limits max gains.", "id": "1emkfgg", "created_utc": 1723057660.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 92 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cr7i8c/how_to_profit_off_this_meme_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e6j6uv/ok_so_this_is_what_you_need_to_know_before/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eah1be/why_goog_calls_are_in_the_bag_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehnhtp/amazons_earnings_are_today_what_are_we_doing/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1elqhik/why_im_getting_puts_for_smci_earnings_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1emkfgg/how_to_make_money_on_todays_hood_earnings/) \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "$HOOD price said it’s fine where it is.", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "I inversed you yesterday on smci and lost it all.

{"title": "$500-$505 on SPY still on deck and why one could have seen what was going to happen today.", "selftext": "Hello:\n\n4 Days ago on Saturday, I posted we were possibly headed down to fill a gap at around $505 and Monday morning premarket, we hit a low of $507.90 because of the Yen Carry Trade Unwind. Wall Street is going to get us down here whether we like it or not. This would imply an approx. 12% correction if we hit $500, fairly normal for a bull market. Coincidently, the 200 Day MA is currently at $500.80 as shown by the red line. It is acting as a magnet in my personal opinion.\n\nToday, lot of people were taken by surprise but if you saw it, there was a bear flag that was setup and have enclosed that chart as well. The high of today was $531.59 around 10am and barely on top of the flag pattern. For the next 45min, we tried to get above the bear flag but could not push through and the breakdown officially started around 11:10ish and well, the rest is history and momentum was significantly to the downside.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? Honestly, SPY/QQQ Puts will print or sitting on cash, being patient and waiting for the bottoming process before jumping back in. If you caught the breakdown today with Puts, well done and I don't see it being over. We will continue getting some relief bounces and rallies, only to be sold off later in the day or the following day so have to be agile with playing Calls and take profits when presented to you.\n\nWe may get the gift of a lifetime for example on Nvidia at $86 where there is a potential for a gap fill. Have to remember the correction took approx. 3 months last year and we haven't even been in this for a month. Being an election year, might be looking at volatility a little less than 2023's timeframe but still omnipresent upon us.\n\nGood luck.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pmvkojskbhd1.png?width=3423&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54c7b9da928dddafa8995da4da46a7cd18c2030", "id": "1emppt5", "created_utc": 1723070536.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 13 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m going to act like I understood everything and buy calls", "score": 36, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "I like to dip mine in a Wendy’s frosty.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Fries in a milkshake are a major key", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wendys frosty and McDonald’s fries 🤙", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yo pltr organizing all of wendies now so they won't allow any behind the dumpster stuff anymore sorry.
