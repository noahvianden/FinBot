There are all *sorts* of applications.  \n\n\nLet me give you a right now example of what the public thinks of when I say AI.\n\n ChatGPT (and others) is capable of writing code based on a prompt.  I use this feature DAILY; with one sentence I can generate 50-200 lines of *good* code for a project that I'm working on saving me a few hours of actual work (writing the code and looking up code structure).  In that sense it saves me time allowing me to produce more.\n\nBut it's more than that, I'm able to ask GPT to write code using functions that I'm unfamiliar with or even in a language that I don't know ( Java for instance since I'm mostly a Python coder ). This *allows me to do work that I wouldn't normally be able to do*. \n\nNow this isn't a golden bullet.  First, the code only works with standard, commonly used code (because there are enough examples for it the AI to learn that).  Also, I have to know enough programming to be able to spot errors and check results - this makes knowing the foundations of computer science more important that knowing developer skills (this is a switch from the previous decade in that devs were in demand because little CS progress was being made).  Lastly, AI seems to be bad at designing a system and creating interfaces (between systems or even other blocks of code).\n\nFor the next 5-10 years you'll see this parallel in other fields.  Doctors will be able to speak their notes during an exam and an AI will translate it, document it, recommend a treatment plan, and set up a visit/billing cycle.   No need for physician assistants or medical scribes to follow them around.  \n\nAI will be able to listen to a law client, ask questions then do a document search on relevant facts, search for precedent, and write up lawsuits or briefing.  No need for legal secretaris of junior associates.  \n\nAI will be able to take over driving (at least buses and trains) removing the need for Uber drivers, bus drivers, and airline pilots.\n\n\nThis is all about replacing human labor, but it can actually do superhuman tasks.  Think optimizing part design for better performance or longer life.  Creating a cyber security AI that looks for threats on millisecond scale. Robotics work in areas that are too hazardous for humans (think mines and under water).\n\n\n\nWhen I say we haven't even started yet what I mean is most companies don't have anyone with the title of AI engineer, no compute resources, and not even the knowledge to know what AI can do for them.\nI work at a major aerospace company and we are just this year setting up our AI department and talking about how we get compute resources and unify the different adhok AI projects around.\nYou have 5-10 years of experiential growth in AI assuming no advanced in software (oh and there will be).", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, thank you for taking the time to provide such a detailed response.
