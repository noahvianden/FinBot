Despite the safety issues and incidents they've faced, I find it puzzling that their stock value remains significantly lower than its pre-pandemic levels, especially given the current surge in travel and vacationing among Americans. The demand for air travel is hitting record numbers.\n\nWith the public scrutiny over safety issues and the recent leadership shakeup, I'm hopeful that these problems will be resolved and Boeing's stock will return to pre-pandemic levels, offering a substantial gain.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

During the MAX grounding and COVID, the company let the top end of its work force (mechanics and engineers) walk with early retirement instead of hitting the bottom seniority with big layoffs, as would have been typical. However, the company didn't bother to capture and transfer that knowledge and experience, and has been begging many of those people to return temporarily ever since.
