{"title": "Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results", "selftext": "Results for the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, as compared to the prior year as applicable, included the following:\n\nComparable restaurant sales increased 8.5% at company restaurants and increased 7.2% at domestic franchise restaurants\n\nAverage weekly sales at company restaurants were $149,176 of which $18,914 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $138,668 of which $17,058 were to-go sales in the prior year\n\nRestaurant margin dollars increased 24.1% to $202.1 million from $162.8 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0% from 14.6% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7% and commodity inflation of 1.3%\n\nDiluted earnings per share increased 32.5% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses\n\nSeven company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened\n\nCapital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $91.1 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $9.6 million.\n\nJerry Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased in such a competitive environment to report another quarter of continued traffic growth at each of our brands. This is a credit to the hard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”\n\nMorgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already have 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with our planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value.”\n\nThe Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due diligence.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-roadhouse-inc-announces-third-200300244.html", "id": "1gc7yhd", "created_utc": 1729899454.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "I don’t think you can get a better steak at that price point.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "I can make it better at home easy for half the cost.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Downvotes?\n\n1.

The ups and downs have been brutal and I am tired of watching my money go down after a big run up. Everyone says, don't time the market because it is impossible. Well, this time I gave in and I pulled out of the Tesla this morning after the big run it made this week. Now at an ATH it feels nice, but I am also terrified of Tesla going up further. I am a Tesla bull and believe the stock will be worth around $2,000 in the years to come. I also feel like the stock is currently at a local maximum. I am hoping that the stock drops so I can buy more tesla stock at a lower price and basically \"steal\" more shares. The weird thing about all of this is that you will never find a bigger Tesla bull then me, but at this very moment in time, I am actually hoping the stock drops so I can buy more shares. Has anyone else felt like this? It is a very awkward place to be.
