{"title": "I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks", "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I‚Äôve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.\n\n - NVDA $237K\n\n - SCHG $121K\n\n - MSFT $105K\n\n - GOOGL $78K\n\n - AAPL $74K\n\n - ISRG $64K\n\n - SOXX $61K\n\n - BRK-B $47K\n\nHere‚Äôs why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can‚Äôt fully imagine yet. We‚Äôre talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.\n\nBut look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù phase‚Äîpeople can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn‚Äôt been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we‚Äôll see another major surge in stock prices. What‚Äôs priced in now is just the beginning‚Äîthe real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.\n\nBefore ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‚Äòjust‚Äô that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn‚Äôt think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn‚Äôt price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that‚Äôs why, despite what‚Äôs already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead.

If you think that AI will have that kind of a benefit in medical diagnosis, why not the largest (I think? If not, certainly top 3) imaging company? You can even ponder things like if you think that AI will have a factor in pricing and things like inventory decisions at your local store, VusionGroup in France (there's a foreign ordinary in the US but a lot of brokers charge absurd fees for that + there's next to no volume for the foreign ord) makes electronic shelf tags and WMT is a large customer last I looked.

Yes maybe it will do a lot of great things but \"it's going to do everything great\" feels \"all the disruptive growth themes are going to the moon\" from 2020/21.

That has been the case for a long time now. Tesla isn‚Äôt traded based on fundamentals but more as a bet on the future. However, when it comes to autonomous driving, for example, they are far behind the competition (see Google subsidiary Waymo, which already conducts 100,000 rides per week and thus has a competitive advantage, while actively collecting data). You only need to look at the visual difference between a Waymo autonomous car and Tesla‚Äôs Robotaxi. Autonomous cars must function under extreme conditions, such as complex traffic scenarios and bad weather ‚Äî this requires expensive technology and data processing. It‚Äôs hard to believe that this could be available for $30,000. Anyone stepping into an autonomous vehicle must trust that it will get them safely to their destination and the Robotaxi doesn‚Äôt look trustworthy at all.\n\nAt the Robotaxi event, expectations were very high, but it was marked by theatrics and did not convince many people, leaving a lot of questions. For example, the remote control of the door opener and the Robotaxi driving off as Elon Musk got in, or robots that were being controlled by people behind the scenes. Generally, it was unclear what was real and what was part of the show ‚Äî and the Hollywood location didn‚Äôt exactly help either.\n\nThe big question is when Tesla will deliver on autonomous driving, and trust in their ability to make this happen in the next few years seems to be diminishing. This is also because Elon Musk has often failed to keep his promises or delayed timelines.\n\nIn addition, Tesla‚Äôs sales are below expectations, and there are many used Teslas on the market. Increasing competition from China, which is state-subsidized (for example, there are subsidies in China specifically for electric vehicles from Chinese manufacturers). BMW, for instance, has caught up and is now selling more electric cars in Europe than Tesla in some cases.\n\nThe build quality of the Cybertruck also leaves much to be desired in several areas (suspension, grounding when charging, sealing of the ‚Äòfrunk,‚Äô etc.).\n\nThen there‚Äôs also the fact that Elon Musk is heavily supporting Trump‚Äôs election campaign, and his image is sometimes counterproductive for Tesla. This has also affected the decline in Tesla sales, for instance, in California. He‚Äôs also getting involved in political matters instead of focusing on Tesla, which many people criticize.\n\nFrom my perspective, there are more problems than opportunities at Tesla at the moment.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "More than a few stocks trade on momentum rather than legitimate fundamentals.

A stock that went sub $2 (split adjusted) to $400+, and this sub always recommended against it. This sub is not one to ask about growth companies, especially a disruptive one.\n\nNow, in the short term, there's a bunch of stuff stacked against Tesla. But, also, there's a lot to be excited about in the coming months and years. This sub will talk about P/E and other valuation metrics as if that's the only investment story. But again, they would have said the same thing at every point from $2 to $400+, and they would be right at times. But the problem is then, are you a trader or an investor?\n\nAnd it is pretty clear your news gathering is very specifically against Tesla, which is pretty common amongst traditional news and business news outlets. Again, for most of Tesla's history, the news media has been against it. Very few times it gets acknowledged, and usually those are sell signals.\n\nSince China is the world's largest auto market and Tesla is one of the few non-Chinese companies that is managed to compete well head to head as everyone else is suffering, then that should tell you something.\n\nFor example, Cybertruck is not a horror. It is the 3rd highest selling EV in the US, according to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates. It was the highest volume > $100k vehicle in the US recently.\n\nIt will do just fine in the North American market, as they just started deliveries in Canada and Mexico too.\n\nThe Cybercab event was actually pretty good, and most astute observers know that it would be pretty light on details. Gone are the days that Tesla can avoid the Osborne effect. The immediate stock price action isn't nearly as telling.\n\nFSD will always be investigated. And it's 1 pedestrian in a difficult visibility environment. The safety statistics for FSD is very impressive. Much better than manual driving. There is an agenda to that coverage.\n\nTesla is nearing the end of a growth stair step and about to take the next big step up. Don't know when that will be reflected in the stock price, but since there are a lot of very close observers including big Wall Street firms, it can move well before news breaks to standard media.\n\nIn particular, here are the upcoming catalysts:\n\n1) Cybertruck lowering of sales price with much higher volume production and sales, as well as new cells that provide both lower cost of manufacturing. Hopefully achieve gross margin positive this coming quarter or the next.\n\n2) As referenced above, if the 4680 DBE cathode is successfully production scaled, that will provide for a competitive advantage going forward from both lowered capex, lower production costs, and scale that doesn't compete with others. It would also allow Tesla to meet the increasingly stringent IRA sourcing requirements that will be difficult for many others. Tesla's lithium processing facility is also nearing completion, which would further lower their costs in the medium to long term.\n\n3) Energy storage division continues impressive growth with solid margins. The percentage of revenue continues to grow with this division.\n\n4) Tesla Model 3 Highland refresh is making traction worldwide.\n\n5) Model Y refresh is on deck for 1H 2025. The Model Y contends for the highest volume vehicle in the world. There is some Osborne effect going on with it already, and its refresh would push new volume records.\n\n6) Tesla Semi production is ramping at the pilot facility and trials are going well at Pepsi, DHL, and others. The volume production facility is finally having its shell under construction and is on track for volume production in 2025. This is a huge market for which they have a significant lead. Winrose's entry is also pretty good, but everyone else pales in comparison.\n\n7) FSD releases continue to make solid gains. Actual Smart Summon just shipped. End to End neural nets for highway use is making public beta rounds. FSD 13 used at the Cybercab event should ship soon.\n\n8) Interest rates dropping will have an effect on consumers (not just in the US).\n\n9) Possibly two new models or refreshes shipping in 2025, or one in 2025 and another in 2026. Neither of which is Cybercab.\n\n10) Cybercab public testing as a robotaxi is possible in 2025, and likely in 2026. \n\nTesla is likely looking to push to their 3 million vehicle production capacity in 2025 or early 2026 - and that is without Cybercab factoring into the picture. It seems that Tesla is looking for buyers to help finance their robotaxi fleet, which means vehicle sales is still something they are looking for in the short to medium term.
