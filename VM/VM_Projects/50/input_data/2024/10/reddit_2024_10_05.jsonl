The gains in an IC are capped, just like covered calls. CCs are basically neutral plays as opposed to covered calls that can be more bullish based on your choice of strike.

The question is if I only buy shares if I am assigned after selling a put and the answer is no. I am buying some outright and some via LEAPS that I choose to exercise for the shares. If I am more bullish on a ticker, a CSP, might not be the best bet if it just goes up and I never own the shares. In that case, a LEAPS might be the better play so that you can profit as it goes up and collect premiums off conservative covered calls as it rises. There are also times with stocks under $10 where purchasing the shares outright makes the most sense with the lack of premium on CSPs. Even if I was bullish, sometimes the LEAPS does not make sense either as the premium is too expensive and it just makes more sense to buy the 100 shares outright. Options are tools and as you get more comfortable with the tools, you will start to develop an understanding of the best time to use each tool. \n\nI did use some margin in the beginning when I first started and then learned to use it more sparingly, when necessary. With interest rates a lot higher than a few years back, I don't use margin at all, for now. I would rather collect interest on my uninvested funds. If there is a margin amount where you are not paying interest in the $1k to $2k area, it may be worth it. With investing, you have to have the mindset that you can lose a significant amount, even if you are conservative.

At that time, CSPs and CCs were more even as far as premiums go. \n\nDuring the bull market, many tickers have increased in value and I was able to sell covered calls to collect premiums on top of the gains. My CSP sells have slowed down due to the fact that I am a bit weary of a sudden drop or correction. When selling covered calls and rolling out far into the future, drops are not a concern, in fact, they (open CCs) actually do better in a down turn. For CSPs, I could end up owning shares at an unfavorable price in a sudden downturn. So, it is not that I favor covered calls in general, it is just that I'm being a bit cautious at the moment. \n\nI have tried out spreads in a few different periods and although they were a better bang for the buck, I felt they were too directional and I took more losses on plays that did not go my way than I felt comfortable with. I may take another look at them at a later date, but for now, I don't use them.

The PMCC works very similarly to the covered call. The difference is that the collateral is the LEAPS, instead of the 100 shares. When the underlying increases, the LEAPS also increases. As long as you sell covered calls against your 100 shares at a higher price than the price you bought the 100 shares for, you will be in a profit situation. \n\nMuch like the 100 shares, the LEAPS is similar. As long as you sell your covered calls against the LEAPS so that you are in a profit situation, you should not have to worry about the covered call being exercised, because you would profit as a result of closing the covered call and selling the LEAPS.\n\nWhen I sell covered calls with a LEAPS as collateral, PMCC, I am a bit more cautious than when I am selling with 100 shares as collateral. Even though, they mostly work the same, I have already paid a premium on the LEAPS and want to ride it out until expiration so I can get the most covered call sales. Also, my strategy is to eventually own the LEAPS shares, by exercising the LEAPS and buying the shares for the original strike price. \n\nIf the LEAPS does not work out as expected, and the underlying does not perform over the 2 years,I simply let it expire worthless. So, when you are purchasing the LEAPS, you may not want to buy the 100 shares upfront, but maybe think the ticker has potential. Or maybe the shares suddenly dropped like the recent case of CRWD.

{"title": "It's time for the regular \"what low cost stocks should I wheel?\" Post of the day... but I'm seeking to diversify my wheel strategy so hopefully this can be a little different...", "selftext": "Yeah I know everyone hates these posts. I hope I can make it a little more palatable by sharing more than I get.\n\n\n\nI currently have a basket of stocks I wheel.  I run my wheel slightly different than u/scottishtrader initially explained (where i learned about it). \n\n\n\nFirst,  I use naked puts, not cash secured puts.  I rarely get assigned as i sell delta .20 or less, and on my losses I usually take it until I can roll the wheel or liquidate the position for a loss. I'm still learning but this has worked well for me so far.\n\n\n\nI like wheeling ETFs over stocks as ETFs are better diversified against a single stock dropping at the expense of sector risk and usually reduced premiums.  But the larger reason is \"wheel stocks you don't mind owning\" and I usually like ETFs over single stock picking.  \n\n\n\nI try to diversify based on rolling expiry dates,  so if the stock drops in the money i have time to manage. But usually I don't close and let the puts expire otm. So this is one reason I'm looking at new targets - i don't like keeping multiple wheels open at a time on same ticker.  Feels like  I'm not diversified. \n\n\n\nI try to diversify across market sectors so a drop in one thing or a general market trend doesn't wipe all my positions. \n\n\n\nHappy to discuss any particulars but would like to share my current wheelhouse and see if anyone has any stocks or ETF recommendations that might fit in.  \n\n\n\nSOXL: this is my favorite. as a 3x etf the premiums are good and not too expensive.  I've been assigned a few times but usually exit fairly quick. \n\n\n\nTQQQ: as above,  3x etf means higher premium and this represents my exposure to the market at large. I like the concept of HFEA, so i use this with TMF (below) as a way to obtain shares as its cheaper than UPRO for a similar mega cap exposure. The wheel means I might miss on the large pumps that HFEA is supposed to capture, but that's OK with me as this has still been profitable. I started this when TQQQ was much cheaper than UPRO, but now that it is getting more in parity I may switch back\n\n\n\nTMF: the bond part of HFEA. Concept is more likely to be negatively correlated with the stock market as a whole. Premiums tend to variable so I don't play this often. \n\n\n\nMSOS: US etf based on a gamble that eventually pot will get legalized at the federal level.  It's cheap so i milk it for a few bucks a month as assignment risk is easy to deal with if I'm assigned.\n\n\n\nGME: nice premium due to all the apes over at wsb. I'm not a big believer in the short squeeze hypothesis,  but I do like the premiums for the low price of the stock. Other meme stocks don't really fit the \"stocks I don't mind owning\" part of the wheel, but this one I'm OK with.\n\n\n\nINTC: this is one I've taken recent losses on,  but I still turn a few wheels a month. There is a lot of debate on this stock but to me it's essentially a bet on is their turnaround plan will work. If not,  it will probably slowly continue to decline and I'll take the loss,  but as a low price stock I'm OK with the position as a gamble on the turnaround. \n\n\n\nPFE: cheap and variable premium. I will wheel this a few times a year. They don't have many new blockbusters in the drug pipeline but I consider it a blue chip stock that isn't likely to drop dramatically. \n\n\n\nZION: small banking company in the Intermountain west. Stable Financials but they are part of the Mormons' investment portfolio.  It's a moat as i have great faith in the corruption of the Mormon church to not let their investments fail.  \n\n\n\nRKLB: cheap stock with good relative premium based on a unique business niche. \n\n\n\nUUUU: read a good due diligence post on this somewhere.  I think it was r/valueinvesting. Basically its a uranium mining company with lots of good future expansion options and no debt. It's dirt cheap so I figured what the hell?\n\n\n\nHUT: this is my crypto diversifyer. They are a bitcoin mining company,  and that tends to track the market as a whole.  Cheap,  usually not good premium anymore though.  I still look at it every few weeks but haven't opened a position in a while.  \n\n\n\nAnyway,  that's my current wheeling bucket.  Looking at TNA but haven't decided yet on if I'd like to own that.  \n\n\n\nIf you have any stocks or ETFs you like to harvest premium on,  let me know.
