I'm happy to say that my concerns are unfounded based on the results from the past 35 years. Here's a summary:\n\nNote: The metrics below (max, stdev upper, avg, stdev lower, min) are exclusive of the YTD values.\n\n\nFrom an overall top 20 market cap change year over year perspective:\n\n* Max: 53.90% (1998: GE)\n* Stdev upper: 34.56%\n* Average: 13.10%\n* Stdev lower: -8.36%\n* Min: -31.88% (2009: Exxon)\n* YTD: 32.10% (Currently just within the upper stdev)\n\n\nThe growth of the top ranked market cap stock each year:\n\n* Max: 86.05% (1999: MSFT)\n* Stdev upper: 45.61%\n* Average: 15.71%\n* Stdev lower: -14.19%\n* Min: -38.67% (2001: GE)\n* YTD: 15.53% (Right at the average)\n\n\nThe % difference between the #1 company market cap and the average of #2 through #20 companies:\n\n* Max: 288.29% (2021: Apple)\n* Stdev upper: 210.38%\n* Average: 152.58%\n* Stdev lower: 94.78%\n* Min: 84.11% (2004: MSFT)\n* YTD: 223.13% (Slightly outside the upper stdev)\n\n\nThe % difference between the #1 company market cap and the #2 company market cap:\n\n* Max: 84.66% (2009: Exxon to Walmart)\n* Stdev upper: 40.54%\n* Average: 21.79%\n* Stdev lower: 3.04%\n* Min: 3.22% (1993: Exxon to Walmart)\n* YTD: 4.63% (Near the minimum.
