{"title": "Window closing for Pepsi to buy Celsius (CELH)", "selftext": "Time is running out for Pepsi to buy Celsius (CELH) \n\nThe bottom is in on Celsius.  The news has been positive and todayâ€™s move up broke a pretty long downward trend.  They are down 70% off their ATH.  Everyone also saw Pepsiâ€™s recent earnings results which were not terrible but not great either.  \n\nPepsi owns Rockstar which tastes like carbonated piss with 8 drops of black licorice and 2 drops of patchouli essential oil.  Monster is owned by Coke and drank by hillbillies at monster truck rallies with un-neutered dogs.  Red Bull is for our exact opposites who work at Goldman Sachs until 1 in the morning everyday because Cramer says thats what they should be doing.\n\nCelsius actually tastes delicious and doesnâ€™t give you the shakes.  It is in every convenience store and grocery store, Walmart and Amazon, and the best store of allâ€¦.Costco.  They are very popular with the younger generation which is what you want to build on.  Most importantly, they have a ton of international expansion still to do.  \n\nPepsi already owns 8.5% of Celsius.  It is unlikely it will ever be this cheap again.  Itâ€™s the Black Friday sale for Celsiusâ€¦.Hopefully Pepsi steps up to drink a six pack of Kiwi-Strawberry and make an offer they canâ€™t refuse.\n\nPositions:  3k shares and $35 C 10/11/24", "id": "1g0zj8o", "created_utc": 1728613286.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 709 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pq6a5p/dnathe_new_mrna_stock/) \n**Account Age** | 6 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Idunno I just moved to the powder, its cheaper and you can snort it \n\n\n\nâ€¦â€¦.only half that statement is /s, do with that what you can", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "The powder is kinda expensiveðŸ™ƒ", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Just buy meth.Â  You can get a lifetime supply off the dark web for like a thousand bucks.Â  Of course, with doing all that meth your life time will only be like a month... so its a win/win!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "But it's been up some latino guy's ass at some point!

But due to higher competition CELH can't ever growth, they are cornered, will decline further, they are not actively engaged in hedging (anything!) - so this is a ploy as old as methusaleh where the big boy (Pepsi et al) will wait and butcher and blobber them up and throw group board of CELH out the window.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Can we get a source on the accounting rules they broke?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm proud Pepsi will own CELH soon.
