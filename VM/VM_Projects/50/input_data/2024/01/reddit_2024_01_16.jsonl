Solar panels are more efficient when cold.  \n\nHowever, charging a battery is using electricity to generate a chemical reaction. Most chemical reactions are slowed when cold.\n\nAdditionally, different battery chemistries charge and discharge optimally at different temperatures. Too hot or too cold, and you can damage the cells by adding or removing power too quickly. Most EVs have an elaborate thermal regulation system that uses a heater, radiator, and even an air-conditioning heat exchanger to regulate the coolant temperature. Even plus in hybrids like a Prius prime will use the air-conditioning to manage battery temps when charging.\n\nSo, outside of optimal temperature, the charging rate is intentionally reduced, and a high consumer like a PTC heater, or an ac compressor is used to regulate coolant temps.\n\nIf you live in a place with extreme temperatures, you generally have a garage, because any vehicle will suffer. In extreme cold temps you even need fuel and engine block heaters on normal internal combustion vehicles.  Many EVs will run the heater and coolant pumps while parked if the temps get to a critically low level to prevent coolant from freezing. Coolant just lowers freezing point, not eliminates it!\n\nJust like with many ICE heating systems, many EVs can prep a car for driving while on a charger in your garage, where they preheat the battery and drive units before you drive, maximizing potential change and range. \n\nNow, are EVs for everyone?
