{"title": "You should be careful about “Recovery Stocks”", "selftext": "I see a lot of posts about investing in airlines, hotels, and all this stuff. It’s not a bad idea, to be clear. Obviously as the pandemic winds down people will resume old travel habits for the most part. But just because the industry will recover doesn’t mean the companies will. A lot of people seem to be taking that for granted.\n\nThe US (and most of the world) entered the peak (not the beginning) of the financial crisis in September, 2008. By January, I’m sure plenty of people had the awesome idea to invest in some recovery picks. 5 months after that, in June 2009, GM filed for bankruptcy protection. That’s a 9 month lag time. The peak of the COVID outbreak was March and April, so a similar 9 month timeline runs through January. We aren’t there yet.\n\nRemember 9/11? That was in 2001. Everyone knew air travel would eventually recover. It wasn’t at all crazy to invest in recovery plays after a year or so. But not everyone recovered, as Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy 4 years later, in September of 2005.\n\n“Are You Ready for the Technological Revolution?” is an omniscient article that was written in February of 2015. Tech had already taken off and the sectors dominance was inevitable. RadioShack (a tech specialty store) missed the memo, they filed for bankruptcy that exact same month. \n\nThe point of all this, **and the tl;dr**, is that it’s not as simple as recovery = profits. No matter how amazingly the travel industry rebounds in 2021, it’s a certainty that there will be casualties and money will be lost. Please, choose carefully. \n\nLinks:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_crisis_in_September_2008#Developing_global_financial_crisis\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delta_Air_Lines#Bankruptcy\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/02/are-you-ready-for-the-technological-revolution/\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081315/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp", "id": "k0xtry", "created_utc": 1606329173.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "Well since the pandemic started i have seen countless posts advising against investing in airlines cruise lines etc etc, But still i jumped in and i’m 40% up on all airline stocks.
