{"title": "Housing is fucked - Big Short part 2", "selftext": "Theoretically, mass unemployment would cause housing defaults on a large scale. Unless the gov allows forbearance on mortgage payments for up to a year on FHA loans, uhhh which they are currently doing. With little to no proof of hardship to qualify. Back in '08 the gov allowed forbearance as well but the banks required a high standard of proof so they wouldn't get stuck bag holding like you retards out shopping with your wife and her boyfriend(s). This time around due to the speed in which the stimulus needs to be executed, the proof is subjective which is rife with moral hazard. Insert end of the big short where the new form of CDOs have been created called bespoke tranche opportunities. Perhaps a Burry style BUBBLE?

FOUR-TWENTY!  It's destiny!!\n\nFACT:  2,792 is a 50% retracement level.  I'm not saying retracement working is a fact.  I'm saying 2,792 is the 50% retracement level.\n\nWe're basically at 2,792 now so it seems like a great time to switch to puts expecting a retest of 220 on or around 4/20/20.  So what do we buy?\n\nWell, we don't want theta decaying us in the ass so when we sell these puts since we're not holding to expiration, we want 30-45 DTE.  45 days from 04/20/20 is 06/04/20.  That means 06/19/20 expiration or 06/30/20 expiration.  \n\nPersonally, I'm taking the 06/30/20 because I want extra time for this to happen just in case the market isn't so easy that some random guy can make money this easily.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**. 240p 6/30 with the intention of selling once SPY hits 220 or maybe 228 because the retest would come within 4%.    I could do a 230p but I'm worried full retest won't happen because of Powell doing Powell things so I want my strike closer to being ITM right now.\n\nThey're selling for ~$9.00 each now and I'm hoping to sell ~$27.00.\n\nA sudden test of the low may help drive IV back up so the time premium when I sell could be higher than it is now even though the VIX is pretty high already lol\n\n**EDIT:**  The market is forward looking.  Right now, the next thing is \"The virus has peaked and we can start thinking about when the economy opens again\".
