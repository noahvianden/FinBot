{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 30, 2020. What a crazy day, hope this helps a bit :)", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**\n\nThe stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday‚Äôs gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.\n\nYesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday‚Äôs issue of the daily recap. \n\nToday, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that ‚Äúfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans‚Äù. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.\n\nEurope is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by ‚Äúabout a third‚Äù and daily deaths by ‚Äúclose to 40%‚Äù this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\n\nToday is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an announcement Friday that it will allow U.S. cruise ships to begin a phased approach to resume sailing in U.S. waters starting this Sunday. ‚ÄúAfter expiration of CDC‚Äôs No Sail Order (NSO) on October 31, 2020, CDC will take a phased approach to resume cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters,‚Äù according to the CDC‚Äôs newly published ‚ÄúFramework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships.‚Äù Cruise stocks spiked immediately following the announcement.\n* Electric automaker Fisker completed its merger and debuted at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \n* Alphabet's Google must tell a district court how it will respond to a federal antitrust lawsuit by mid-November, with the two sides making initial disclosures later in the month, U.S. Judge Amit Mehta said in a brief order on Friday.\n* Netflix (NFLX) on Thursday announced a price increase for U.S. subscribers. The price of a standard Netflix plan climbs by $1 a month to $13.99, from $12.99. The price for premium plans jumps by $2 a month to $17.99 from $15.99. The single-stream, non-HD basic plan remains $8.99.\n* LG Chem, Ltd, a company that supplies battery materials to Tesla, announced it was given the go-ahead to the company‚Äôs management to spin-off its battery business into a new entity,\n* Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday at the company's quarterly earnings call that private messaging continues to be the fastest-growing form of communication ‚Äî with WhatsApp alone seeing the exchange of 100 billion messages each day.

{"title": "E.L Paso Just Announced Lockdown of Non-Essential Businesses, Rest Of COuntry May Soon Follow?", "selftext": "Here's the link:\n\n[https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/10/29/texas-county-shutdown-coronavirus-surge/](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/10/29/texas-county-shutdown-coronavirus-surge/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith E.L Paso just announcing a two week lockdown of non-essential businesses due to a surge of Covid and the strains its causing on its healthcare system, I honestly believe that this is a precursor for the rest of the U.S as Covid infections continue to rise at an exponential rate with hospitalizations and deaths just lagging behind the curve by about a few weeks to a month. \n\nWhat this means is that chances are, the US is in for a tough fall and winter and its most likely that this wave will be far more severe than the first wave because the first infections didn't reach the US until well past the new year. \n\nNow during the first lockdown, the FED put a backstop on virtually everything. They dropped interest rates to 0%, started infinite QE, and got lending facilities set up to cover virtually every part of the credit market whether its car loans or credit card debt. They actually got the market to believe that the FED is bailing them out on all fronts. Meanwhile, the federal government went trillions into debt subsidizing business expenses and giving everyone those stimmy checks to cover them over the summer. \n\nNow, since those actions by the FED and the government have already been spent, its most likely the market already priced them in since March. With this new wave of lockdowns, what else can the FED really do to boost confidence in stocks when its already at all-time high? Can Powell really do infinity QE x 2? \n\nProbably not. \n\nTl;dr: Get VIX", "id": "jkw8b1", "created_utc": 1604062590.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Yes the rest of the United States follows what El Paso does closely its basically second in command behind D.C", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "In El Paso we trust", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Pass the ol' El Paso", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "El Paso is ran by some of the fucking dumbest people to suck oxygen out of the air, I lived there for 4 years and quickly realized why Texas doesn‚Äôt claim El Paso", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "The fact this dude wrote out a well thought out educated and articulate op ed about how el paso may impact the whole us and the fed is staggering.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "It reopens a discussion.

The sick and elderly should take his approach and there should be a sliding scale approach to the rest of the people. Its very clear the disease is not a death sentence for everyone.

The man should have gone out there, balls swinging, and shamed every single person (especially in public office or in the media) by exerting his position of authority and unilaterally doing everything in his power to start viral campaigns and public-private and local government partnerships to that effect.\n\n2) He's a doctor who's willing to allow a perfectly viable vaccine, based on an established scientific platform with a known safety profile for many conditions, be placed on hold while we instead first approve two mRNA candidates, a promising new technology that has never been used or meaningfully tested in humans. I've spent hours scouring every medical journal I could find that covers safety of mRNA vaccines, to no avail, and in fact some questions remain about how certain forms of mRNA delivery could cause unexpected effects like increased clotting or unusual autoimmune responses -- especially since some very effective mRNA vaccines never made it to market for reasons we don't know -- and even those are just educated guesses based on the effects on rats or in very limited trials for Zika and a few other emergency experiments. This type of technology is extremely promising, and as a researcher I'm ecstatic for the implications because it'll revolutionize how we produce vaccines by forcing the FDA to authorize a vaccine of this kind for the first time, but this whole \"we care so much about safety\" thing while playing everyone for a low risk guinea pig is, even to assume the best, a great deal of naivety or ignorance.\n\n3) He's also allowing tens of thousands more people to get sick and die as we wait for a few more weeks of largely meaningless data. If the safety of AZD1222 isn't known after all these months of international testing, a few more thousand case reports aren't going to change that at all. (And if it means that much, why not call out the FDA to go get the data from other countries instead of waiting?)\n\n4) What took six weeks for Astrazeneca's trial to be resumed as every single other country did? Sure, that's on the FDA, but at some point as a doctor and researcher in his position you need to step up and say \"ok, we know transverse myelitis is a risk of virtually all vaccines in a very miniscule percentage of people, so we really don't need to put trials of volunteers on hold to prevent 1 more statistical occurrence of a non-fatal potentially recoverable condition while thousands of others wait and develop permanent heart scarring or die\".\n\nAgain, no hard feelings for the guy and he's pretty likable overall, and it's easy for me to say because everyone fucks up from time to time especially under the kind of political pressure he's subjected to daily, but it pisses me off at the situation more that he didn't do more.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with you sir its unfortunate this has turned into a political play and we have American'ed the f out of this situation.
