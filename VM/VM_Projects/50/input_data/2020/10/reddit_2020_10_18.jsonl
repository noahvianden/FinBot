Which means 12*95€ per car sold and FCA seems to sell about a million car per year in Europe. So that means about a billion in fines for FCA. \n\nEach gram saved is €95M saved in fines from FCA. If my computation is correct, every ~10K extra car sold reduces the gap by 1 gram. If FCA goes 50/50 with Tesla and give them €50M for every 10K car sold, that means an additional margin of €5K per car.\n\nA MIC Model 3 brings €34K in revenue if sold in China and about €41K if sold in Europe. So each car will bring €8K more in revenue + €5K more from FCA. So that's €13K per car from which you need to substract the transportation fee (no idea) and the import fee (I guess 10% so €4K).
