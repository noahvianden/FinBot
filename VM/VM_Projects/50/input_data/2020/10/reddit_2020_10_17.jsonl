That's really what slack is too.\n\nThe winner is this space is doing to be someone who builds a suite of products that makes collaboration easy.  My money's on Zoom.  The partnership with slack is just the first step.  Either they acquire them or they build a better version themselves.  This whole idea that chat, video conferencing, sharing documents, and making presentations are done with different products is just silly.  There is going to be one thing that people use to collaborate when they are not in the same room.  Google understands this, and they have for a very long time.  They would love for it to be them but as usual, the products that they released to solve these products are years ahead of their time but in the end people will use other things.\n\nGoogle had Android watches long before Apple did.  But the apple ones are the ones that people use.  Remember Google glass?  That was so far ahead of its time.  The AR revolution is coming in the next year or two, and Facebook and Apple (and maybe Snap) are going to absolutely dominate that space.\n\nGoogle is really good at identifying problems that need to be solved, and really good at coming up with the technical solutions, and absolutely terrible at putting it all together into a customer-facing product and marketing it.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "What's interesting about winning this space is that those that control the user collaboration control the entire solution. Microsoft understands that, and I'm sure they will do anything to destroy Slack. \n\nGoogle, as you said, has many things against them, but they offer an alternative suite of apps to Microsoft and know that this piece is missing. What has not been discussed is that there are many large software providers that offer financial, accounting, design and engineering applications that power all enterprises. They also have realized that selling point solutions can't take them to the next level. That's why the rise of Product Lifecycle Management software and other proprietary platform solutions. \n\nCollaboration is at the core and Slack has created a nice product/platform. They can still screw up badly, Stewart doesn't seem to be an aggressive CEO, but they also have great things going for them.

IMO this is key to winning the video conferencing space, and they all need to go together I think.\n\nI really think that zoom has the inside track on this whole space, if they can build out the other collab tools before someone else wins.  That's why the partnership with slack is sick a big deal -- it gives them time to solve this problem.\n\nRE: slack, I question their tech.  They seem to be down (or so slow as to be unusable) a bit too often (it should be never).  They basically lie about their downtime on their web page too, which means that they know it's a problem and they can't fix it.   Overall the product is fine, I guess, but it seems that they have kind of hit a wall.  It's like they are just waiting for someone to crush them.  You are probably right about the CEO.
