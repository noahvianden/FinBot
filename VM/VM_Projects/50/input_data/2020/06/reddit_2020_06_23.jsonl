The construction and assembly of cars is not the massive value driver of this stock and you (I hope) know that very well. My point is that making the cars is a means to an end. One could argue they sell cars as way to spread electric/renewable adoption.  Moreover the car sales give them the funding to build more cars which then gives them a fleet to collect the data necessary for their ultimate goal: autonomy.  It’s not inconceivable to think their goal is to not have to sell cars and just build their own fleet for a world\nthat largely no longer values individual car ownership.  Of course they need the auto sales now but it’s a means to a much larger end and the folks who understand that will be proven right.  That’s why everyone ranting about needing to show profitability selling cars isn’t seeing the bigger picture and has their heads too stuck in their excel models and auto company comp sheets.  Tesla doesn’t want to be an auto OEM, so they don’t truly care about showing the world they can do so incredibly profitably when they can be using the money to accelerate towards their true goals.
