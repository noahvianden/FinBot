The U.S. Federal Reserve has established [nine new lending facilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/meet-fed-s-nine-new-offspring-each-with-different-market-role) in its efforts to supply the entire world with dollar liquidity. Buying all manner of private and public debt has expanded the Fed’s [balance sheet](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) from $4.1 trillion in late February to over $6.5 trillion by mid-April. Analysts [have predicted](https://www.ft.com/content/ec10b41a-84af-4e44-ad3f-5bb86b6e1eaa) its balance sheet is on course to reach $9 trillion by the end of the year. Suffice it to say, at its present pace, the Fed is injecting about $1 million into the financial system *every second*, with a declared upper bound of [infinity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/23/fed-unlimited-credit-coronavirus/).\n\nSailing in uncharted waters invites speculation about what sort of dangers might sink the ship. One common failure scenario for the Fed’s new monetary policies is the fear that $1 million per second for the indefinite future will cause an inflationary disaster. That fear is intuitive, widely held, and influential. It is also completely misplaced. Economic history suggests that deflation, not inflation, is by far the more likely—and in some ways the more dangerous—destination of the Fed’s current trajectory without yet more unprecedented action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe world has been enduring deflationary pressures since at least the 2008 crisis. In August 2008, the Fed’s balance sheet was less than $1 trillion. By November, it had doubled, even before the Fed began its first round of quantitative easing. Four rounds later, in late 2014, it stood around $4.5 trillion.\n\n[As the historian Adam Tooze](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/301357/crashed-by-adam-tooze/) has shown, this monetary expansion was the true bailout; further, it was paired with another $2.3 trillion in quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, plus close to a combined $2 trillion from the [Bank of Japan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj-idUSBRE93216U20130404) and the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing). This sustained and concerted monetary expansion was among the most astonishing feats in the history of central banking and had prompted a wave of [scholarly](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501732720/financial-citizenship/#bookTabs=1) and [policy thinking](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176734/unelected-power) about the new role of central banks in managing the global economy. They already pale in comparison to the monetary efforts since this March.\n\nBut the results from the last financial crisis are instructive. All those trillions kept banking systems functioning and stock markets rising, but they produced rates of inflation that ran the gamut all the way from “nonexistent” to “anemic.” The Fed undershot its 2 percent inflation target [every month for several years](https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/04/30/u-s-inflation-undershoots-the-feds-2-target-for-the-35th-straight-month/). The eurozone was also [consistently below](https://voxeu.org/article/why-euro-inflation-so-low) the European Central Bank’s target, usually falling below 1 percent. Japan had been locked in [a deflationary trap](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2012/data/wp12e06.pdf) for most of the latter half of the 1990s, and it returned again after 2008, with only a few moments of very weak inflation in between.\n\nThe fall in oil prices has been even more spectacular: On April 20, oil futures for May deliveries [crashed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-25/the-20-minutes-that-broke-the-u-s-oil-market) to *negative* $37.63 per barrel. Most importantly, at least 26 million people have lost their jobs, while millions more have had their pay or hours cut. Economists say that wages are “sticky,” meaning they are usually set in contracts for long periods, so the way deflation happens to workers mostly isn’t through a falling price of labor but through a falling quantity of jobs. And the quantity of jobs has never fallen as far, as fast, as it has since mid-March.\n\nThe danger of deflation means that the Fed’s gargantuan interventions may well save the financial system but not avert a grinding decade of unemployment, inequality, and instability, which is exactly what happened after 2008. Those trillions of dollars in quantitative easing saved the banks, but they did not help underwater homeowners or unemployed construction workers or teachers laid off due to state budget cuts. To be sure, by the end of 2019, it looked like the economy had recovered, ending a lost decade of misery and dislocation. But even the low unemployment rate and decent GDP growth masked persistent damage to the labor market.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Longer term, it is conceivable that structural forces could drive inflation rates higher, but this year we see deflation as the main risk.\n\nHere are some reasons why:\n\n* Oil prices have collapsed. Diesel and petrol represent 3.5% of the basket of goods and services that make up the US consumer price index (CPI). Low prices for oil – and for commodities more generally – following the shutting down of a significant part of the global economy will likely keep consumer price inflation very low for at least the next year.\n* Data is already showing falls in prices of goods at the factory gate – producer price inflation (PPI) – as prices of input materials fall. Lower costs for producers will result in lower prices of goods.\n* Many companies are heavily discounting prices to sell off inventory and raise cash to cover their running costs. We expect this to continue as restrictions are lifted because businesses will need to tempt consumers back into their stores using lower prices.\n* Rising prices in sectors such as groceries and medical goods and services will be outweighed by falling prices in other sectors facing a collapse in demand.\n* Lastly, 30 million jobs – an entire decade’s worth of gains – have been lost in the US over the last six weeks. Wage disinflation is now a concern. There is already anecdotal evidence of companies seeking to reduce costs by lowering wages. Lower wages means lower production prices and ultimately lower retail prices. This is another example of the sort of [negative feedback loop ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-feedback.asp)that adversely impacts inflation psychology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nOver the long term, there are structural reasons that could lead to a rise in the rate of inflation. Central banks have monetised an enormous part of countries' national debt and with a major expansion of government spending programmes coming up, they will probably have to continue printing money for the foreseeable future. Further ahead, this money will end up either in higher asset prices, or rising consumer prices, or even both.\n\nIn addition, we expect some de-globalisation as key industries are repatriated, supply chains no longer route through China, and national champions are protected. All that will reduce competition, raise production costs and lead to higher prices.\n\nIn conclusion, longer term (i.e. 18 months from now), we could see some inflationary pressures, but near term, it’s deflation, in our view, that will be the main risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/investing/deflation-not-inflation-is-the-main-risk-now/](https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/investing/deflation-not-inflation-is-the-main-risk-now/)", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Very interesting read, thank you!

Now my bearish thesis is \"at what point do 12 year olds stop FOMOing into an overvalued 10 year bull market\". \n\nMoney printer go brrrr is great for a short term trade congrats to call holders, although there are good reasons this will not last. \n\nA lot of players are not providing a bid for this market to continue. The only ones who are confidently buying are RH traders. Top of book depth in notional value has declined to alarming levels. Since most of you have only been trading for two weeks, this basically means that there is nothing but air on the upside and downside of the market. This is why the market goes down 6% in a day, and then up 3% the next. It takes less money to move the market because there are less participants willing to take on the risk. \n\nThink of the depth of book as the amount of chairs in a game of musical chairs. In 2019 there were a lot of chairs for people to take a seat. Now, the only players left are RH traders while the world watches. Carl Icahn took a chair, Warren Buffet took a chair, the god damn algos who provide the bid and ask on the book took a chair. \n\nAgain, congrats to the euphoric call holders who are printing money like JPow. However, people are becoming suicidal on this sub reddit and it is hard for me to watch. \n\nThe daily percentage moves in the futures market are getting larger, so please take that into account. Do not go all in and please do not trade away all your life savings if you have been doing this for less than a year. If you have been trading for less than one year, keep 90% of your savings in a bank account. Use 10% for YOLOs. If you lose that 10% allocated for YOLOing, take a 6 month break from trading at least. This is simple risk management. \n\nI am not telling anyone to buy puts or calls, who the fuck knows where the market is going to be next week. I am just trying to say the market is beyond fucked right now. People are gambling their life savings and killing themselves over it. It has to stop. \n\nTLDR; Stop gambling ALL of your life savings. There is no more liquidity on the book. Market can move very quick up or down without any news.
