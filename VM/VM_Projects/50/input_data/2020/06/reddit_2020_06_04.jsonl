This year has been very interesting, but overall is welcomed after the never ending bull market. There is a lot of opportunity.\n\nI've had several mentors help me along my journey. I really enjoy helping others develop their investing skill-set. I‚Äôve taught friends I served with for years but never on a broader scale. With COVID going on, I took the suggestion to start a YouTube channel so I can share more complex explanations. It‚Äôs completely free, I don‚Äôt sell anything whatsoever and have no affiliates. I started this because I think now is a great time for new investors to get going but with so much crappy information, everyone trying to sell something, I fear many may get discouraged. I also wanted to connect with our more tenured traders and learn from one another, hopefully to allow others to learn from us. \n\nIf there's anything I can do a video on that would help folks out let me know, it's the entire purpose of the channel. I started the first week of May and have over 100 videos because people have had a lot of great questions or concepts they wanted to discuss.
