{"title": "Developing a new strategy, can I please get some opinions from people familiar with VIX hedges", "selftext": "**Intro:**\n\nI trade CFDs on a MM model, as proof I am not a CFD noob that will destroy my account here is my equity graph with X as trade number and Y as performance in %. The period of obvious change is when I developed my current strategy. I was leveraged 8X long in the March crash and 2X in this weeks one, so my risk control has worked so far, although I took a massive hit to unrealised profits. I have never used a VIX hedge so if anyone has experience with them any help would be great.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xvoGXtJ](https://imgur.com/a/xvoGXtJ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My new plan:**\n\nThe whole idea is based upon keeping it as simple as possible, whats more simple than S&P longs. In essence the trade is a pyramiding BTFD on SPY with max leverage set at 20X and a VIX hedge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Products:**\n\n\\-CFD on the S&P spot price, there is no expiry or rollover. There is however a holding cost of 2.69%PA paid at 1700h NY time.\n\n\\-CFD on VIX futures contract, furthest out. No holding cost, but expiry will be between 1-2 months depending on entry point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position Sizing:**\n\n**-Entry 1**: Long S&P at 1X account value, Long VIX at 1/4 S&P trade value.\n\nThe 1/4 comes from this information I found \"According to the CBOE Website, on average, the VIX rise 16.8% on days when the S&P 500 index drops 3% or more. This means that if the SPX move down by 10%, the VIX can potentially shoot up by 56%. To play it safe, the fund manager assumes that the VIX will rise by only 40% when the SPX drops by 10%.\"\n\n[https://www.theoptionsguide.com/portfolio-hedging-using-vix-calls.aspx#:\\~:text=To%20implement%20such%20a%20hedge,known%20as%20the%20reverse%20collar.](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/portfolio-hedging-using-vix-calls.aspx#:~:text=To%20implement%20such%20a%20hedge,known%20as%20the%20reverse%20collar.)\n\n**-Entry 2:** Repeat of entry 1 which is pyramided on top of it. This makes the trade 2X, all subsequent entries will add 1 the leverage amount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Risk Management:**\n\n\\-Upon entry 2 the 'take profit stop' of entry 1 and the 'stop loss' of entry 2 will be set to a position slightly above break even for the trade, including interest and VIX roll over losses.\n\n\\-Profit off VIX will be taken in event of a major crash that shuts down the main position.\n\n*- In the event of VIX spike >50 VIX may be shorted at an equal level to the long that is open* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Entry 1 Rules:**\n\n\\-VIX >28\n\n\\-S&P retracing\n\n\\-S&P in uptrend as defined by HHHL in 4h chart\n\n\\-MACD has convergence between indicator line and price action (shows continued momentum)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Subsequent Entry Rules:**\n\n\\-As per entry 1 rules\n\n\\-Current position profit >5% of position base value, increasing by 2% for every extra entry\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exit Rules:**\n\n\\-If I hold a strong conviction the market will drop severely\n\n\\-If max leverage has been reached, close down some profitable positions to increase cash balance which in turn lowers leverage value. This will allow the strategy to continue to grow further.\n\n\\-Profit on VIX may be taken if: VIX is in profit, has a declining price, and contract expiry >2weeks.
