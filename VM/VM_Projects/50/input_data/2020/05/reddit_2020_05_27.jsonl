Yes, ok, my advice in CNK may be a bit early, but I'm still accumulating positions as it rises.  I am considering exiting this position as people are turning out to be more irrational than I expected and it'll just take too long for this bet to pay off.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjdx10/hot\\_tip\\_for\\_my\\_wsb\\_buddies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjdx10/hot_tip_for_my_wsb_buddies/)  Where I give a great link which is a leading indicator of pandemic surges.

Not just because they are overvalued, but blow back is coming from the trump base / peons.  This is an election year and people are getting a hate on for well employed techies making out like bandits.   Trump / GOP will leverage this:\n\n[https://www.axios.com/tech-summer-antitrust-24cffcc6-8afc-41f8-9b91-5be6d8269202.html](https://www.axios.com/tech-summer-antitrust-24cffcc6-8afc-41f8-9b91-5be6d8269202.html)\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/donald-trump-twitter-threat-regulate/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/donald-trump-twitter-threat-regulate/index.html)\n\nIn particular, this spike will come down:  [https://i.redd.it/xwsciuzx5ov41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/xwsciuzx5ov41.jpg)\n\nYou can do this via puts on XLK or some of tech stocks you don't like.  FB looks good, for sure.  ZM, SHOP, etc.  Anything that is irrationally over valued.   Do calls on stocks you do like and think will do well.  Airlines seem a bit undervalued.\n\nSafest would probably be PUTs on QQQ and calls on Russell 2000 IWM.\n\nSuggestions on how better to arb these are welcomed.  It's why we post, to spark ideas from the community.\n\nIf the economy craters, your trade will be mitigated via the PUTs on QQQ and will soften the loss.   If reopening improves, there will be further sector rotation out of tech and into more mainstreet based stocks.\n\nIf China decoupling occurs, they could hit back on tech like Aapl and others.  Online shopping reliant on importing from China could be hit.\n\nTLDR - I've been right all along.  Now I'm suggesting to follow the sector rotation out of tech that is currently happening with puts on tech / calls on mainstreet, it will mute any potential crashes that may occur via China decoupling or massive pullbacks.\n\nWill add positions to post, but would like to hear first from the crowd for ideas.\n\nEdit:\n\nOne possibility is buy calls on VDC, consumer staples - October 16th, 155.  XLP might have more volume,  Sept 18/59\n\nQQQ options are rather expensive with high IV, you could sell calls and minimize your downside with buying calls at a higher strike price.\n\nMaybe October 16th,  230/250 or 230/240.Or Sept 18 calls, sell 240 and buy 250.\n\n**Ok, here is my finalized trade I entered today (May 28th)**\n\n* December 18, bear call combo on QQQ.  Sold calls at 240, bought at 250\n   * 14.48 - 8.73 = 5.75 gained premiums.\n* December 18, bought calls on XLI (industrials) at 80\n   * Avg Price: 1.60\n\nReasoning is that of all the reasonable sectors, only financials are more beaten down than industrials.    Financials are in trouble as long as they are competing with the fed, so I'm not optimistic there.\n\nIndustrials however came back as fast if not faster than tech in 2008, so it seems to reason that there should be a rotation into that soon.  Also, in the case of china meltdown these should hold up fairly well given the amount of domestic production around these.\n\nQQQ got hit last week on HK announcement, but XLI did not.\n\n52 week high for XLI is 85, currently at 69.\n\nThe general thrust of this trade is protection against China issues and leveraging a bit of virus caused irrational exuberance in tech relative to other sectors.   It was either this or  I'd have to stay out of the market, cause I really don't know how this China thing will play out.  If it was just Trump, than I'd think we'd be OK, but China is acting in unexpected ways.\n\nIn the end, this isn't really tech vrs mainstreet.  It's more tech versus legacy\n\nOne note about this trade - as the differential decreases, so will the profit opportunities.  I'm looking for an annualized 100% return and will likely do a TP as soon as it makes sense.   Hopefully there will be more clarity on the China situation by that point and there will be other interesting trading opportunities.\n\nI'll update this post with news and  as I exit.   Book mark if you're interested.  \n\n\n\\*\\* Exited the trade today,  hope folks joined this for massive and safe tendies ", "id": "grto4r", "created_utc": 1590617906.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "You can’t really have any significant and sustained move differential in the IWM up QQQ down direction.
