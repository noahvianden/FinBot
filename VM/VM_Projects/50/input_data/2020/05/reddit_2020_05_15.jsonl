You can’t just forcibly bring the entire planet to a halt hoping for some vaccine that might take 12-18 months or may never come at all.\n\nFor every one percent unemployment goes up 37,000 people die per year... unemployment as of April was 22.80% according to the BLS U6 and is expected to increase in May. This means that 843,000 people would be expected to die this year due to factors related to unemployment ranging from heart attacks due to extra stress, suicides, crime, etc. And it must be noted that it will take many years for the economy to recover from this shutdown keeping unemployment high for many of those years. This isn’t a light switch you can flick on  and off. Current COVID-19 death count is 88,144 and it’s speculated many of those deaths were from other causes and they just happened to have COVID-19 when they died.
