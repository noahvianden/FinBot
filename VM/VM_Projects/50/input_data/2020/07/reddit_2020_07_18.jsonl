{"title": "CHGG DD", "selftext": "**\\*NOTE\\***\n\nThe goal of this DD was to provide a cohesive and whole picture of Chegg as a company, taking into account the booming growth they’ve been experiencing during this past quarter. There’s been a lot of talk of Chegg on this subreddit lately but I want to explain why I think it’s about to be the last, best time to buy in before earnings. If you disagree then I urge you to tell me how I’m being autistic and which crucial elements I’m overlooking.\n\nIn my personal opinion, I believe that Chegg is a solid play in the short term based off both the technicals and the environment in which Chegg exists. As we lead up to Chegg’s earnings on 8/3/2020 and as more people realize Chegg’s continued demand throughout 2020, I believe there will be a substantial run up to play off of (or maybe even multiple as we’ve seen over the past month).\n\n**OVERVIEW:**\n\nChegg is the leading student-first interconnected learning platform, which is on-demand, adaptive, personalized, and backed up by a network of human help. They provide textbooks, 24/7 tutoring, and solutions for a multitude of subjects.\n\nKey notes:\n\n· Leading direct-to-student connected learning platform\n\n· Large addressable market with compelling market trends\n\n· High growth and high margin model\n\n· Competitive moat given brand, reach, data, and propriety content\n\nChegg is focused on an online, on-demand approach to providing education to students. This has become especially useful with COVID which is going to affect students through the rest of 2020. Chegg’s earnings report is supposed to be on 8/3/2020. I plan on playing off of this run up which I don’t believe is fully factored into the pricing of this stock. Let’s dive in!\n\n**RELEVANT NEWS:**\n\nMass Arbitration:\n\n[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-massarb/chegg-tries-a-new-way-to-avert-mass-arbitration-cancel-users-contracts-idUSKBN24333W)\n\nIf you are/were a student like I was during these years, you may remember the huge Chegg data breach that occurred in 2018. The fallout of this data breach is still affecting Chegg. In April 2020, Z Law filed a class action lawsuit for more than 15,000 individuals asserting a claim of $25,000 for each Chegg customer. Reportedly in June, the American Arbitration Association (AAA) instructed Chegg to pay about $7.5M in fees to launch the arbitrations.\n\nRather than pay these fees, Chegg argued that the customers included in the lawsuit had ‘breached their user agreements by asserting frivolous or improper demands for arbitration.’ Now I don’t have a law degree but this just sounds like a Catch 22 that won’t necessarily hold up in court, and it doesn’t look like it will. It should be noted that all of this information is from a principal at Z Law since Chegg has not responded to requests for information on this issue as of yet. It is likely that this situation will come to a head soon with these latest updates being in the past couple of months.\n\n*Schools Closing:*\n\nWe are seeing a number of states, or at least counties, mandate that children not go back to school yet this Fall. I believe that this will be a catalyst for increased demand of Chegg’s services. Between their online classrooms, tutoring, and problem solutions, Chegg is in a perfect spot to take advantage of what’s happening for continued growth throughout 2020.\n\n**FINANCIALS:**\n\nMarket Cap growth vs. Revenue Growth\n\n[Source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHGG/chegg/financial-statements)\n\n· Chegg revenue growth for quarter ending 3/31/2020 was $0.132B, a 35.09% increase from 2019\n\n· Market cap during this period went from $4.4B to $4.19B, a -4% decrease from 2019\\*\n\n\\* It should be noted that while it’s a great sign that Chegg’s revenue growth is outpacing it’s market cap growth, since last quarter’s earnings were so good, market cap blew out to $8.69B as of this past week, which results in a **67%** increase from last year’s 7/15/2019 market cap of $5.20B\n\n· Chegg’s annual EPS has been slowly growing by around 30% per year, with the earnings in March 2020 representing a 25% increase since the previous year to $-0.05 EPS.\n\n· [Chegg’s current P/E ratio is 75.26](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/CHGG/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm#:~:text=Chegg%20has%20a%20trailing%2Dtwelve,value%20relative%20to%20its%20earnings.)\n\n**TECHNICALS:**\n\n[Source](http://www.stockta.com/cgi-bin/analysis.pl?symb=CHGG&cobrand=&mode=stock)\n\nChegg currently has a resistance of $79.48 with its nearest two supports at $70.15 and $66.76. With the downward trend of the stock market this past week, we saw the share price kiss the first support Tuesday morning when the price dropped but then it slowing gained back throughout the rest of the week.\n\n*RSI Analysis:*\n\nCurrent RSI Level: 63.34\n\nWe’ve seen the RSI stay around this level ever since Chegg’s earnings report in March, only breaking out to overbought occasionally before coming back down to near neutral levels (as we saw this past week). In fact, the correction that occurred last week offers a perfect, and quite possibly the last, best set up as we head towards earnings a few weeks from now.\n\n\\*Note: Stochastic oscillator is closer to 50 currently but I’m choosing to evaluate Chegg based on RSI since this stock has been booming all year and strongly trending upwards.\n\n*MACD Analysis:*\n\nAs of market close this past week, the MACD is currently just barely below its signal line. This is inherently a bearish signal, but the signal line and MACD have been dancing on either side of each other since last earnings, providing lots of opportunities to play these short run ups. The only reason the MACD is below the signal line is because of the correction that occurred last week, meaning that we’re in a perfect spot to take advantage of the next run up.\n\nThe current signs that I’m seeing that tell me that the train is on its way to tendie town: 1) As of Friday, the stock is trading in an upwards direction above both the [EMA](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100594&p=CHGG) and [SMA](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100593&p=CHGG) lines indicating very solid price strength 2) The [MACD](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100562&p=CHGG) is on the verge of crossing back over its signal line which is a bullish sign to buy and 3) the [RSI](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563&p=CHGG) doesn’t yet indicate that the stock is overbought (but it is heading in that direction). That being said, current resistance levels are set at $79.48. Over the past month, Chegg has been reaching its resistance, falling back, then shooting up past its resistance again – just look at the past month’s chart for Chegg. Past resistance was $75 so I feel confident that this’ll climb to at least $80 but likely higher once the earnings run up starts getting priced in. Once the MACD gives the signal, I will be looking to buy call options at $5 above its last peak of $75.02. This is purely based on my own risk tolerance, I’m sure that higher options would be profitable too though. I’m choosing $5 above since that’s the pattern I’ve been seeing with resistance lines since the last earnings report, but I won’t be selling until I see a downtrend. This could easily go $5-$10 past resistance in anticipation of earnings.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the stock has already climbed $3-$4 in the past few days after dropping. That’s a few dollars of growth that we’re missing out on, but that’s the price we pay for confidence. The price strength is finally looking strong enough to buy in which is why I’m sending out this DD.\n\n*EMA:*\n\nThe current 20 day EMA is $69.06 which it fell below earlier this week but quickly rebounded back on top of it and has been growing steadily ever since.\n\n**tldr:**\n\n**Long term investors**: Hard to tell if the pump this year will continue as COVID inevitably dies down. Past this year I highly doubt that Chegg can continue this growth. But honestly what do I know.\n\n**Mid term investors**: Chegg looks to be strong and growing. The school year will offer a surge of revenue in Q3 but at the same time it’s hard to tell if this same level of growth will continue. You should also be on the lookout for negative catalysts such as this arbitration lawsuit.\n\n**Short term investors**: All systems are a go for some **8/21 $80c**. Once we’re locked in, I’m expecting slow and steady gains for the next couple of weeks. If you buy in then I urge you to monitor RSI levels and be on the lookout for a sell off, especially as it approaches $80. If anything, at least set a trailing stop loss. But on the likelihood that this puppy shoots past resistance, we’re looking at a share price of anywhere from $80-$90. Conservatively estimating 50-120% profit depending on how fast it climbs and when it starts to sell off, ideally hold till right before earnings though.", "id": "htnowt", "created_utc": 1595104589.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "This all pretty much seems like \"technicals DD.\"\n\nDo you have any actual information on their operations?\n\nAny new contracts signed?
