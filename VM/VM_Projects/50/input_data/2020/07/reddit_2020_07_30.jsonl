{"title": "Microsoft sold my stocks- how do I get info to file my taxes?", "selftext": "Gonna start this off by saying I know nothing about stocks. \n\nSo my parents purchased some Microsoft stocks many years ago before it became very successful. A couple years ago my mom was contacted by the state of Washington saying that the Microsoft stocks were sold and they were trying to get in contact with the owner of the stocks to give them the money from the sell. Microsoft sold the stocks without our knowledge or permission and then turned the money over to the state, also without our knowledge or permission. It ended up going to me based on my parents' divorce decree. However, in order to file my taxes I need to know what the stocks were sold for, if taxes were paid, etc. The state said they did not know this info and suggested contacting Microsoft. I haven't been able to figure out who I'm supposed to contact to get this info. \n\nSo my question is who do I contact to find out this information? Someone at Microsoft? If so, who? Also, how was Microsoft able to sell off our stocks without our permission?\n\nEdit: Why is the top comment that I'm scamming and going to start asking for money? I'm just looking for advice on who to contact to get the info I need to file my taxes.\n\nGoing to add here that I already received the money from the stocks. My mom dealt directly with the gov employee by meeting with him at the Dept of Revenue. She thinks it was part of the unclaimed property division. She got paperwork from him, had me fill it out, and returned it to him. I was then wired the money. My dad purchased the stocks back in the 80s under my mom's name and his. But they were divorced and in the divorce decree it was declared the stocks were for me.

This is something companies hate to do because they want to keep people on staff for the perpetual hope of better sales/more capacity to serve greater demand; because it's demoralizing for current and prospective future employees to see layoffs; and because of general inertia, denial, and a wish to avoid something basically unpleasant like telling someone that you've decided their family will now be denied their basic livelihood.\n\nCOVID threw that out the window.  There was no hope of increased production; there was a plausible excuse to avoid the morale hit associated with layoffs; and everyone was told that everyone was sharing their pain, which was buffered by the $600 sit-on-your-ass weekly benefit.
