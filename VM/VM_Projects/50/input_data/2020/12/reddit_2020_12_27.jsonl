{"title": "Why GME will continue crashing on Monday using Technical fundamentals. (Not enough retail to break the balance board.)", "selftext": "Now many people are confused about some past posts so I figured we need to go into the deep technical fundamentals on why people hoping for a \"rocket\" so called on Monday will be instead met with a continuing crash. let me break this down with 3 fundamental stock activity charts that focus on the last 5 days of GME trading activity below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Technical charts showing stock activity, shows the rise, start of doom, and crash which will continue on Monday. Click to zoom in.](https://preview.redd.it/mtey1hnv7s761.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=618569d9fbfb1e252c6cbd62736bcd17bc2100fd)\n\n**Now then, the dissection:**\n\n1. **The first chart shows the full 5 days and what is called the \"balance board\" the balance board is usually a heavily resistant and stubborn point that if broken, usually leads to a massive spike that may have short or long duration. As you can see within the last 5 trading days of last week (today is Sunday so new week) even with inflated retail, fomoing, and a squeeze, GME could not break the balance board, and in fact declined as attempts to continue to fail.**\n2. Also on image 1 is the clear visual of when the rocket took off, Dec 22nd. That's the end of the flt lower line on Image 1 before the spike up.\n3. Image 2 points out the drop later on that week, showing that the big firms, hedges, and other rich conglomerates that control a significant portion of the market where starting to pull and retail and other smaller conglomerates were losing the ability to pump up the stock,\n4. Finally in image number 3, on Thursday the last day of the week, the big firms, hedges, and rich conglomerates did not go in or pulled back leading to a crash, you can tell by the trajectory of the fall and the grey line (which is for after hours trading) that the amount of investment and pumping by retail and smaller conglomerates were not significantly less than before.\n5. Expanding on point number 4 above, if you look at the after hours grey line, retail and others were still trying to push the stock up but because too much of the market controllers pulled back or/and stopped investing they were not able to not only keep up the pace from days before, but to bring back the GME stock into the green after hours.\n\n**All the points above show that more big movers will pull or stall while retail and other smaller investor individuals and groups will lose the ability to move the stock higher**, it will keep crashing until some part of the bigger market movers jumps in to give a platform for all that retail pump to bounce off.\n\nAs you can see on chart 3 the trading activity of these individuals in groups did not drop, the only thing that dropped was big funding and big money either stalling or pulling the rug a bit. And look at how it crashed the stock, and how even with low volume during after hours retail still couldn't get the stock back up even back to the CLOSING LEVEL they failed.\n\nWe should prepare for a continuing crash on Monday and possibly a bigger major crash back into the low 10's or single digits later this week. Do not be fooled, no time has WSB continued a long fomo has it ever kept going up, there is no exception, get out and/or buy puts now. People were expecting the squeeze on Wednesday and Thursday, it came and couldn't break the balance board, and crashed on Thursday. People are forgetting about Thursdays crash and are hand waiving it as some temporary feet\n\n***But there are no fundamentals or technical analysis to support this stock moving past the balance board***, and with no big major cash movers to help retail or smaller conglomerates move the stock, they can't move the stock by themselves, this just isn't possible. All you are doing is wasting money at this point until more major movers go into the stock, or stalled ones start investing again.\n\nHopefully the breakdown, and stock charts above will finally help people understand why you can't float something without support, or launch something without gas.
