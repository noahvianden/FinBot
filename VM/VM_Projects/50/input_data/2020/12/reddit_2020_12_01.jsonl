My crayons attempt to analyze all likely possibilities. Think of this analysis as a butterfly chart, allowing guidance over a variety of scenarios. Think of this analysis as entering and exit points.*\n\n# 6:15 AM MST - SPY Possibilities\n\n# 12/1 Plays\n\n* If SPY holds resistance look out for 364.88 and 362.62 ish.\n* If SPY bounces off 364.88 ish then look for 366.20 ish and 367 ish\n* If SPY breaks current resistance, look for 367.84 ish and above.\n* However, I expect a bounce back into the established uptrend channel if SOY breaks current resistance.\n* Line in the sand for SPY is 363.62. Anything below and I expect a drop tor 361-359\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/vve04aoisk261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=25b3fe7c7f563f493015f949d8c653594b224776)\n\n# 11/20 SPY RECAP\n\nSPY opened at 362.83 and fell to 359.17 and bottomed before recovering 362.06 at close.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/6f3dvwc3mh261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbdc7bf34b329503279474884776930110aab5de)\n\nSPY bottomed out .75% from its consolidation channel before entering back into it.\n\n[Here's the excerpt from last post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/)\n\n>Monday will be the start of SPY’s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.  \n>  \n>If current support fails, look out for 361-360 and below for PUTS to print.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/hzgro7whph261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=423b98ea6a824ef2157829d49c2df2db263b71a9)\n\n# 11/30 AMD, NIO, TSLA RECAP\n\n**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa's Nice List?**\n\nAMD opened at 87.33 and hit a high of 92.74.

It quickly topped and fell back down to the opening price. AMD took a steady climb up to 93 ish the rest of the day.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/exyl7zxitg261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=41e3cb59bc2016ae9a0be9a0e49edad12012e491)\n\nThe recommended playbook was right on the money from the last post, so if you got in on it, then congratulations.

Maybe even leave a runner for a lotto.  \n>  \n>If AMD bounces around that price point, you could look at scalping an 87p and trim at that price point, leaving a runner if she breaks to 85-83.  \n>  \n>If AMD finds support at around 87.18 and bounces, you could look for another 90-92c weekly. At that time, you could dump all your savings and play a late December lotto 98c like to true degen that you are.\"\n\nLook for AMD to trade in the 90-96 range tomorrow. It shouldn't go any lower than 89 ish IMO. Anything lower than 87 ish and AMD will fall to 86-83.\n\n[2h chart](https://preview.redd.it/40fggi19wg261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2924b49cb4d19ba67cee1f7213daec284d5bbce)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*EASY MODE ACTIVATED\\*\\*\\*\\* or Merry Christmas You Filthy Animal\n\nAMD Plays for 12/1:\n\n* If AMD holds support on its uptrend channel at around 92.16 you could scalp a 94c 12/4. Trim and leave a runner for 96+.\n* If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish. If it breaks at 93.51 ish, then expect a drop to 90.59 ish. If it breaks at around 95 ish, then expect a drop to 91 ish.\n* 89p, 90p, 91p 12/4 will be the plays, depending on where or if AMD drops out of its uptrend channel.\n* Trim and leave runner at price target or bottoms. I don't think we drop lower than 87.18 tomorrow, but leave a runner for the lotto in case we do.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/p5ph7ipjzg261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=b11ee5db7ea9d9e39e840364df3af8d1cf7978b9)\n\n**11/30 - 12/3 TSLA TA or When Will TSLA slow down?**\n\nTSLA opened at 602.21 and fell to 554.51, and rebounded to 567.60.\n\n[2hr chart](https://preview.redd.it/jm57x4653h261.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2a94bf3baedeeb6c05aa2b564cd6874a2f8f738)\n\nTSLA could hold support at 62 ish and fell hard to 554 before quickly rebounding.
