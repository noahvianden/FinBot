Blackberry software is in 9/10 biggest banks, they provide software security for the pentagon, they are in over a 100 millions  cars as well as providing security for governments and massive corporations . To me this is a stock that still has a long runway (places it can expand into).\n\nThe announcement made by Amazon is important because this has been in the making for at least 2 years. The product Blackberry is developing with Amazon is called Blackberry Ivy. This product provides software for autonomous cars in the future which Blackberry plans to sell to existing car manufacturers, so they can get in on the autonomous car action. But currently it's about gathering sensory data and is not linked with QNX or automation. \n\nBlackberry for me right now is a long term investment because its revenues should increase in the future, so before the market values this share at an over valuation get in and buy some shares. Please keep in mind this should be seen as a long term investment for a couple of years at the least and don't be put of by the every day vicissitudes of the stock market. Please be aware that the stock market is not a solid bet as prices can fluctuate for no reason in the short term.  \n\nFor more information on Blackberry they have share holder video conferences on there website which can be found in the investor relations part.

One is because the partnership has no specified revenue or orders or anything tangible.  I can't value that in dollar terms.  Secondly, the actual substance of what it is didn't sound that great to me.  It sounds like basically enabling Amazon lookups on Blackberry's in-car screens.  Maybe it's more than that, but that is how I interpreted it.  And really, what's so revolutionary about that?  It comes as cars and devices already integrated with hey Google and hey Siri, so I imagine this would let people say hey Alexa in their car, which I think can sort of be done already, indirectly.  \n\nSo how is that any different than an RCA bluray player adding an Amazon icon to its existing Netflix and YouTube icons?  It just doesn't sound that amazing (or revenue generating) to me.\n\nAnd car buyers don't have a choice of what systems are in your car.  You pick a car, and you get whatever system is in it.  As such, it's a utility function for the car maker.  It's a brake pad.  And that means the car maker is always going to look for the cheapest brake pad/touchscreen they can get.  And a lowest bidder market opportunity isn't that exciting to me.\n\nStill, like I said, Blackberry is ripe for speculation, which is why I had a position ahead of this.  Maybe they will announce more things or have some substance.  They're said to have lots of skilled people and strong patents.
