Their sales of computers have been stagnant for 10 yrs and smartphones have been for 5 yrs.  Moreover, phones are super competitive these days, they're lasting longer and phones have reached diminishing returns in terms of the tech they provide to customers.  \n\nThey're way behind on services.  Moreover, they only focus on customer-facing services (no cloud).  Don't see them challenging, Netflix, Spotify, etc...  \n\nThey better hope wearables or 5G is something people care about, it's their only realistic growth path.  \n\nThat being said, AAPL is a fine company.  Their goal, IMO, was to get a loyal customer base, then extract as much $$$ out of them as possible.  Mission complete.  Growth will only come from a new gadget; something they haven't done since 2007.\n\n__GOOGLE__\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, does everything AAPL does. However, Google's potential is outside of consumer hardware. At their core, they're a digital marketing company.  Which makes sense. Between search and YouTube they have the majority of the eyes on the internet.  \n\nThey also have all our data, i.e the most valuable asset in the world.  Moreover, unlike AAPL, they're actually trying to do something with all these goodies.\n\nDon't neglect Cloud, it's growing and making up more and more revenue a la Amazon and AWS.  \n\nPut simply, GOOG has tremendous growth potential.
