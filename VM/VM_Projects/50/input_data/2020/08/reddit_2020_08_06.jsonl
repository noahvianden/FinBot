{"title": "SPY: Probability of Tomorrow Closing Up or Down", "selftext": "I recently read there was a 5% chance of tomorrow being green based on the previous 4 trading days being green and that didn't sit right with me, so I did my own analysis. The other poster gave their conclusion and I'll give mine (at the bottom). Feel free to rip into my analysis or ask for clarification as you want. You can decide what to do with our conclusions to make your own trades.\n\nI'll discuss my methodology first. I chose to look at the S&P500 instead of SPY for more historical data [even though the two do not track perfectly](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/54373/why-dont-spy-spx-and-the-e-mini-sp-500-track-perfectly-with-each-other), I think it is close enough. I downloaded all the historical data of the S&P500 from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/). I chose to look at close vs open (rather than close versus previous close) because options are only traded during market hours. This eliminated data until January 2, 1962 when the price started to change during the day. I did not do a formal hypothesis test for significance because you can manipulate the alpha how you'd like to reject or fail to reject. Therefore, I leave it up to you to figure out if it is statistically significant. I left crashes and recoveries in the data, even though they're outliers and by most people's definition, we are not in a crash. The main reason was for ease but also we may be in a recovery (depending on your definition).\n\nNext, my results. I tested that if after four days in a row closed green, what is the probability that the fifth one was green. Out of the 1197 occurrences, 643 fifth days were green (53.72%) and 554 fifth days were red (46.28%). I also determined that streaks from 0 to 10 previous days were close to these percentages (within 2%). 11 days also presented this trend but doesn't happen enough to draw conclusions. A streak of at least 0 days counts every single day which had 52.96% green and 47.04% red.\n\nConclusion: My conclusion is that according to historical data, there is a greater than 5% chance that tomorrow is green. However, with results of streaks from 0 to 10 days all being within 2% of each other, I conclude that streaks (past performance) cannot predict the market direction for the following day. Additionally, I believe that tomorrow may be green or red or stagnant. Finally, this analysis will not impact my trades for tomorrow but it is still up to you if it impacts yours.", "id": "i4jeo5", "created_utc": 1596681036.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": ">Additionally, I believe that tomorrow may be green or red or stagnant.\n\nPerfect!", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Concur, there is a 100% chance of SPY closing up or down tomorrow.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah.
