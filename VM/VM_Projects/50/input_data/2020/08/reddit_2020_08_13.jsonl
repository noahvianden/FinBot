{"title": "PRPL: June sales/orders not equal revenue", "selftext": "We're not accountants. We messed up our revenue estimates by assuming sales/orders equals revenue. This is not the case.\n\nIn [PRPL's Q2 earnings calls](https://78449.choruscall.com/dataconf/productusers/prpl/mediaframe/40190/indexr.html) they state that the way they have been doing accounting all along, sales are not booked as revenue until the product has been delivered.\n\nThey pre-announced April and May sales numbers in 8-K filings. Presumably all those orders have been delivered and booked as revenue. We have all been trying to estimate June sales without being aware that some June sales may be booked in Q3 as revenue.\n\nAssuming all of April + May sales ($145M) were booked in Q2 revenue, then the $165M Q2 revenue seems to suggests only $20M of June sales. But due long production lead times throughout June (as well as shipping delays), I fully expect that most orders in June took 3+ weeks to deliver (some people were seeing multi-week production delays in their orders, and that doesn't even take into account shipping times during COVID).\n\nBecause of the 3+ week delay, I estimate only 1/3rd-1/4 of June sales/orders were delivered in June and booked during Q2 as revenue. So the $20M revenue number would guide to about $60-80M in June sales.\n\nDuring the earnings calls, Joe also answered a question about the production capacity of each Max polymer machine. He said each can support about $80-100M of revenue (presumably annually).  As they are producing at capacity right now, I'll assume the $100M figure and guide their 7 machines to $700M annual revenue run rate. This is $58.3M per month, which is about in line with the June estimate I have above.\n\nI repeat: JUNE SALES WERE NOT \"ONLY\" $20M AS IMPLIED BY THE Q2 REVENUE NUMBERS.\n\nBTFD.

[minus 10% for returns] = April may and June revenue of $19.925. \n\nOnly way it ends up making any sense would be if they had basically no orders in June.

Assuming the 10% returns you mentioned plus 1% cancellations, that would give April and May DTC revenue of $113M. If Q2 DTC revenue was actually $145M as you claim, then June DTC revenue was $32M. Because of production lead times in June, I expect average 8-15 days before revenue gets booked meaning 27-50% of June orders get booked in July. June DTC revenues represent only 50-73% of non-returned orders. Giving June non-returned DTC orders of 43.8-62M or raw June orders of 48.6M-68.9M. That is quite good. \n\nCan you give the math for how you backed out DTC revenue?\n\nNot sure why you think things don’t line up. The real question mark is how many days delayed is revenue recognition. If it’s 8 days then June revenues account for only 73% of orders. If it’s 15 days then June revenues represent 50% of orders. \n\nTheir website says that white glove delivery takes a few weeks. And their fast filings explain that revenue recognition for white glove delivery is when it arrives at the customer’s hands. So I’m not sure how many people do regular delivery and how many do white glove, but it’s possibly the vast majority of white glove (or all of it) for June will not be booked until Q3.\n\nSome revenue in one quarter being booked the  following quarter is normally not a big deal at all because the prior quarter would do the same into the current quarter. But this was COVID. Everything shut down in March so Q1 had no revenue pushed forward to Q2. Meanwhile, Q2 is seeing exploding growth and production delays because they can’t keep up with demand.
