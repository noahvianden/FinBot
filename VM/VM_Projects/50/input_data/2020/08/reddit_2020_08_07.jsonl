For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today.

I will not be going into TA nor FA to justify why $WORK is the next big play.\n\n**Recap & Highlights:**\n\n\\- $WORK reports its earnings on 09/02\n\n\\- $WORK is currently trading between $29-$30\n\n\\- $WORK beat its earnings expectations last quarter (Actual -0.02 vs Expected -0.06)\n\n\\- After $WORK reported earnings, its share price plummeted down to \\~$32\n\n\\- $WORK is expected to report -0.03 EPS for the upcoming quarter\n\n**Due Diligence:**\n\n\\- The hype hasn't yet started. And once it starts, it’ll explode. Hype is the only reason why $WORK was trading near $40 pre-ER 2 months ago. Hype is the reason why $TSLA saw 70% capital appreciation in 3 weeks. Hype is the reason why PRPL - sorry. I guess it’s too soon for you sad fucking sheeptards, I’ll stop right here.\n\n[No recent $WORK posts](https://preview.redd.it/5zju44ez9nf51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=564ce74cad64c7fd16a5c0bc57662189cd0c64ee)\n\n[No recent Slack posts](https://preview.redd.it/cymca9f1anf51.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=e205f74aa099447a8d4524644b6b5d10d005da57)\n\n\\- Other dogshit, popular tech companies like $DBX, $PD, $SNAP, $CRM, $WDAY, $SPLK, $ATVI, $ROKU and $DDOG all had their run ups to new ATH pre-ER despite their shitty/decent performances from last quarter, so why not $WORK?\n\nThat's it. That’s my entire rendition.\n\nIt's a shit stock, but people will still hype it up because it's tech and it's popular. The hyped up buying power could kick in as early as next week, but it will surely kick in within a few weeks time. Don’t you want to get in on the train early before it takes off like PRPL, $SLV and $NKLA? Then just buy your September calls right now. Who cares if you lose time-value when the increase in IV due to the earnings hype can compensate for it? $WORK was one of the most hyped up tech stocks before last ER. Just close the position out right before it. It’s trading near \\~$29 without any hype whatsoever.
