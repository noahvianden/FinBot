There is an abnormal amount of option volume relative to share volume, which is way different than the option volume: share volume of other stocks\n\nI believe TSLA is the hardest equity to trade in terms of being a pure options vol trader (ex delta).\n\nIf you can trade TSLA in terms of vol, I believe you can trade almost any single stock well except for maybe biotechs, corporate action stocks since that's another category.  I'm just talking about vol here, not like you are just bullish TSLA and bought a ton of OTM calls.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "By trading vol what do you mean exactly? Can you elaborate?

I'm not sure how much options knowledge you have, but basically in options space, if you assume things are delta neutral, puts and calls of the same strike and same expiration have the same IV (there's some borrow, interest rate, dividend in there, but those are usually negligible, especially for short dated options and TSLA has no dividend).\n\nEssentially, if you buy a put and delta hedge it, it's actually the same as buying a call and delta hedging it.  So all any vol trader (MM or prop) cares about is trading the realized vol vs. the implied vol (and the realized vol will eventually be in gamma vs. theta as it realizes).\n\nHowever, TSLA is incredibly hard to price the IV.  If you notice, take a look at the IV move itself on these options.  The IV itself is super jumpy, and the entire vol surface greatly changes.  The ATM IV is unstable, and the wing IVs (skew) is greatly unstable, dictated by large options trades, as the OP points out (you have situations where the call wing is actually higher than the put wing, which is super rare in options - most vol surfaces like for SPY, AAPL, etc. would not have that type of skew).\n\nSo it's just incredibly hard for people just trading vol (and realizing gamma/collecting theta) to trade TSLA if they want to stay somewhat delta neutral because the modeling of the vol surface is so hard.  Obviously, like I said, if you are just bullish on TSLA and load up on a lot of calls, that's a bit different.\n\nAs I pointed out in my other post, staying delta neutral in TSLA itself for a MM is also incredibly hard, due to the trades that aren't a consistent delta pattern and due to the fact that option volume: share volume ratio is much different for TSLA than a stock like AAPL.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the answer, it clarifies things. I have experienced myself the unusual options situation that you described.\n\nOn a slightly different note, I still haven't understood the role of gamma from the point of view of the volatility trader. Suppose I wanted to be short volatility on some underlying. Then I can construct a short vega position that will most likely have positive theta as well. If delta represents the directional risk of the position, what should we make of gamma? I understand that from its definition it's like the acceleration of the option price with respect to the underlying movements, but that's not intuitive at all for me as a trader. You wrote that the volatility trader \"realizes gamma\" but how exactly?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yea so let's say you like sold some ATM straddle, which is a short vega position (also long theta).  Over time, if the stock doesn't move, your straddle decreases in value, so you \"collect the theta.\"  You can also make money if the IV of the option decreases, but time and vol are technically on the same level (most options traders look at vol-time, rather than just vol or just time), so it's \"similar\" to \"collecting theta,\" but I suppose if you made money from a decrease in IV, the attribution will just be towards vega, but the effect is the same as collecting theta.  Actually, most professional options MM have a tough time truly separating this attribution, as it's one of the harder problems you do as a quant.\n\nRealizing gamma would happen in say you are long the straddle.  The stock moves a ton in one direction, so now you have a delta towards the direction it moves.  The more it keeps moving in that direction, your delta grows, and you should make money because the one side of the straddle that is ITM now will make a lot more than the one side of the straddle that is OTM will lose.  So you artificially create a position with the right delta becuase you are long gamma and the more it keeps moving in that one direction, becuase you are long gamma, your delta keeps increasing in that direction.  Conversely, if you were short the straddle and the stock moved a lot in one direction, you lose a lot since you are short gamma.\n\nMost options MM will continuously delta hedge, so the payout is a bit weird.  Like most MM will make money from long gamma positions if the stock zig-zags around a value, but most traders here probably don't continuously delta hedge, so they just need to have it move a ton in one direction.
