Typically, dips will favor your portfolio in the long run. Just be sure you spread your money out enough that you can keep taking advantage of it if it keeps going down.\n\nAs far as aapl, since it's your largest position, maybe you want to understand what has happened with them. They were at 170-200 not long ago. After the china trade deal they caught fire and kept going up daily. There haven't been earnings to warrant any of the moves in the market, even aapl. That's why this and next week are huge for tech. These earnings will dictate their mid/long term direction. Forget about the virus. If tech beats it'll be like it stamps itself new all time highs, even if delayed from short term volatility due to the virus.

Eventually you'll understand exactly how they move and you'll know when to enter. Don't hold long, be quick to take profit. I took any profit that day if I could. If I had to hold overnight I sold immediately. \n\nI made most my gains buying options. Since market sentiment is good I would only buy call options, not puts, even if I think a drop is coming. But a lot of gain came with only 3 separate call option trades. All the in between was spent with safer things like shares and selling options. You have to be patient on your entries if using options. I would only enter if it reached a certain price and only if the charts looked favorable. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is how external forces can affect the stock you choose. That's why I don't like index tracking stocks (aapl, msft) because too many factors affect their daily movement making them unpredictable. Since earnings were coming up, the last few weeks have been kind of a lull period where stocks only move based on technicals (or macro news). Now with tech earnings coming up, TTD might become untradable for me until things settle, because tech earnings will affect all tech related stocks in some way.

I invested around 10k last week, which was obviously a mistake.\n\nFirst thing you want to learn is that it's impossible to know what's coming in the future (near, or far). So, throughout your investment life, sometimes you'll be lucky, sometimes you won't. It is not a mistake to invest simply because the market went down. Mistakes are investing in random companies that offer little to no upside, because you think penny stocks are the way to become a millionaire fast. Investing in sound companies (Apple, Microsoft, Waste Management) and an index-tracking ETF (or two) is not a mistake. Your timing may have not been great, but there's a reason everyone here preaches the mantra \"time in the market beats timing the market.\" And again, some times your timing will be great, some times it won't.\n\nIn any case your stocks+ETFs went down less than 3% in total. If this stresses you out, then this is maybe a sign that your risk profile is not as high as you think. It's very easy to be an aggressive investor when the markets are going up. But if you start panicking and sell when it starts coming down, then you're too much into stocks.\n\nIf you think you can withstand this and you're not actually freaking out, then think of those 10k (-3%) and compare them to what you plan to invest in the stock market over the long term. If you think you can put let's say 2k every quarter, even if the market now fell to 50% of last week's value, you'd be back to where you started in 6 months or so. And, unless you sell, whenever the market goes up, you are significantly ahead of where you would have been, had you simply waited for \"the perfect moment.\"  \nThat same 50% drawdown when you have 1 million in the stock market has a significant impact on your retirement savings. The first 10k you put going down to $9700 in 5 days... in two months you'll have forgotten about it.\n\nFor a broader perspective, open the chart for SPY over the last two years. See how the market was from early 2018 to mid 2019. Prepare for that kind of thing, otherwise you'll do the wrong thing (selling) at the worst time (after severe corrections).\n\nBest of luck!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol,  dip.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Two tips:\n\n1) Keep a percentage of your portfolio in cash (or liquid bond ETFs)\n Some people call this keeping dry powder.
