The other faction consists of the founder of Bytedance, who has always been reluctant to sell because this is his baby and nobody wants to sell their app at a discount when they're on the rise (e.g., Evan Spiegel turned down Zuckerberg multiple times when SNAP was the new up-and-comer).\n\nEarly on in this saga, Bytedance's founder was outvoted by the board ([Source](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3095708/tiktoks-chinese-owner-bytedance-prefers-independent-spin-over)), so Tik Tok proceeded with negotiations with MSFT, WMT, etc. However, now it appears that the founder's faction has gained the upper hand within the organization. First, they started sending mixed signals by suing the Trump administration (Are you negotiating in good faith if you're also trying to delay the sale through lawsuit?). Then a couple of weeks ago, they got the CCP involved, so no sale can proceed without China's blessings.\n\nMy prediction is that there will be no outcome until sometime after the election in November. If Trump is reelected, the founder's faction will ultimately acquiesce because they're better off selling the US operations for something than for nothing. However, if Biden wins then there might be no sale at all because there's actually no real evidence behind any of the Chinese spyware accusations, so the Biden administration may not pursue any charges.\n\nBetween now and the election, Tik Tok will probably continue dragging its feet to delay the 9/15 deadline. The early investors who want to cash out will continue looking for ways to sell, while the founder's faction will continue finding ways to sabotage any potential deal.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "So what you’re saying is that Biden is a pussy and will cave to the Chinese.
