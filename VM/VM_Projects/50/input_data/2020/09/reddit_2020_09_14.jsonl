First, they started sending mixed signals by suing the Trump administration (Are you negotiating in good faith if you're also trying to delay the sale through lawsuit?). Then a couple of weeks ago, they got the CCP involved, so no sale can proceed without China's blessings.\n\nMy prediction is that there will be no outcome until sometime after the election in November. If Trump is reelected, the founder's faction will ultimately acquiesce because they're better off selling the US operations for something than for nothing. However, if Biden wins then there might be no sale at all because there's actually no real evidence behind any of the Chinese spyware accusations, so the Biden administration may not pursue any charges.\n\nBetween now and the election, Tik Tok will probably continue dragging its feet to delay the 9/15 deadline.
