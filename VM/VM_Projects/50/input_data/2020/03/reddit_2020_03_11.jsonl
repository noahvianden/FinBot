They've also cited that the coronavirus will not affect their work. \nhttps://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/PRListingNewsAction.do?action=detail&newsid=THGOPGPGTH\n \nXiaomi one of TSMC's largest customers has cancelled orders from them because they don't have the demand for their smartphones.\nhttps://www.digitimes.com/news/a20200226VL200.html\n\nHauwei, Apple, AMD, and Nvidia  (from what we know) haven't cancelled any orders or their revunue for February would have been terrible. Most of the Chinese firms were offline during the time so they likely cut orders when they were unable to work which is likely why it wasn't higher. \n\nLogically speaking, from this we can understand why Apple didn't ship as many phones to China even though they have been stockpiling chips from TSMC, they've been unable to get parts from Foxconn which will be online again in late March. \n\nhttps://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-10/chinas-smartphone-shipments-nosedive-more-than-50-in-february-101526430.html\n\nThen from what we can also gather is that TSMC will finally be able to mass produce 5nm chips for Apple's and Hauwei's 5g plans by the end of quarter 1 to early quarter 2. Apple is also planning on unveiling a cheap iPhone 9 which will likely a huge success like the 5c. \n\nAMD forsees 20% revunue growth this year. It is likely due to their new work with government which will be also run on TSMC chips. Nvidia will blow further higher with it's data center especially after such strong growth from last year, it's obvious to see why. \n\nIntel has given up even making their own chips to compete with TSMC.\n\nhttps://appuals.com/intel-xe-gpu-flagship-tsmcs-6nm/\n\nWhat does this have to do with anything?

This is just from rational deduction. Boeing didn't get a single plane order in January. Boeing makes up a huge part of America's GDP. Supply shock likely hit hard in February. Simply from news going around, about how China had terrible output. \n\nFurthermore, oil clashes between Russia and the Saudis hurt the Saudis far more. Saudi economy is like 80% oil or something crazy like that. They cant afford to sell cheap for too long as Russia is like 30% oil. Meaning that Saudis will likely come back to negotiation table much sooner than we'd suspect. And because they'd rather not take the blame for the affect on the economy, they will likely move to a deal.\n\nAfter this news people go into a selling frenzy and the stock market will be ripe for the picking. Then we'll be able to snatch up nice and cheap tech stocks that will ultimately cause 2nd quarter GDP to rise. Increasing our tendy count. With this news of 1st quarter GDP lose, we will be seeing people flee not realizing that the panic scare is over as likely by then the 737 max will be up and running again and things will be looking to better times.\n\nSo what I'm saying is to hedge against the economy until the terrible GDP report than to sell and buy calls for Boeing, TSM, Apple, AMD, NVDA(essentially any tech stock).

Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 ¬∞C, 20 ¬∞C, or 30 ¬∞C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission. The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 ¬∞C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle. For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 ¬∞C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 ¬∞C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 ¬∞C. To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined. Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 ¬∞C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system. Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear. We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Now we need the same for SARS and SARS-Cov-2", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Despite media reports to suggest the contrary, SARS was indeed just as vulnerable at high humidity and temp if not more (according to some studies).
