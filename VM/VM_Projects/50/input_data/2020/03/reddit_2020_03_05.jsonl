{"title": "Don't Miss The Boat on Gold", "selftext": "**Situation**\n\nCurrently, when investors are choosing between a corporation (a massive group of people with resources, real estate, plans, and intellectual property united for an endeavor) or a shiny rock, they are picking the shiny rock. I recommend that you also pick the shiny rock, there are a few reasons for that.\n\nThe first is that gold has been on the way up since before the coronavirus was even a thing. This is not part of a short term trend. A part of the reason behind its rise in value is the negative interest rate environment of much of the world, and the anticipated results of fiscal stimulus. \n\nAnother part is that gold production is peaking. There is not a whole lot of gold discovery going on, at least, of gold that is accessible and high grade. A recent find in India, for example, was alleged to be 3000 tons. That number has since declined to 150 tons that might be extractable. \n\nMeanwhile demand remains strong and increasing, in part, this is driven by the increase in the global population of the middle class across Asia, but it is also driven by demand from sovereign states and banks. This is putting price pressure on the material and increasing the value of the businesses that extract it.\n\nWhile some might note the wild swing in gold prices last week, it's important to understand why gold fluctuated. It is because in order to meet margin calls, traders had to sell something. They sold gold because it retained more value than their other assets-- selling gold is much better than realizing millions of dollars of losses on other securities.\n\nAs a recession starts to look like a reality, we can expect gold to continue to rise. While yes, it is spiking now, last time a recession happened gold continued to rally until it doubled in value, all while the S&P declined and eventually returned to flat.\n\nThe best part about buying gold is that the ideal time to sell it also aligns really well with the ideal time to get back into equities. Even if you intend to keep a huge equity position, storing some gold along the sidelines and cashing it in when you want to buy is a good way to mitigate risk.\n\n**Ways to Play**\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to get in on the rise in gold prices. The first is simply buying GLD stock. Or, for those who really thirst for tendies, buying GLD calls. If you do want to buy calls, please look at the scheduled federal reserve meetings. The closest ones are as follows:\n\nMarch 17-18\n\nApril 28-29\n\nJune 9-10\n\nJuly 28-29\n\nStrike dates two weeks out from the meetings might be best if you want to be less risky and give yourself time to recover if the Fed does not act as expected.\n\nIf you want to buy shares of the ETFs (GLD, IAU) it looks like the middle of the week, after 2:30pm ET, is a good sweet spot for getting a good price. GLD is nice because it is super liquid. IAU is nice because you can be more precise in the amounts you want to trade. You can just wait for a dip as well, like anything else. \n\nBe careful on buying before weekends. The price usually spikes on Monday, that can be great, or it can be very not great.\n\nThe other way to get in on the action is through companies that mine gold. While there are sector ETFs, I think that it might be better to pick individual companies. There is one that Cramer shills, he covered it sometime recently.  It is pretty good, but there are others.\n\nThe reason to avoid just getting all gold miners, is that this is a capital intensive business. A lot of mining companies are in debt and might not have access to the credit they need to continue operations. When/if that happens, they sink like a rock. So, perhaps create your own basket of securities rather than buying in on the premade ones.\n\nLastly, some people might want to buy physical gold. I do not recommend this just because the fees you would pay at spot price wash out your gains. Also, storing and securing gold can be a challenge. If you are going this route, I recommend getting 1 oz Kruggerands. Rather than buying them online, try to find a gold dealer near you that is highly reviewed on online platforms. You should not pay more than $5-10 above the spot price of gold for that day.\n\n**Resources to Learn More**\n\nHonestly, it is hard to get very good analysis of gold from the sites that sell it. They have a pretty obvious agenda and say crazy stuff like Gold to $2000?! just to generate hype and sales. \n\nInstead, I recommend going through any sort of general market analysis or newsletter. These are often put out by large financial institutions. They will almost always mention gold and it is worth looking at what they have to say.\n\ntl;dr There is still opportunity, wait for a good time to buy and then buy, call strategy should align with expected moving dates.", "id": "fe1lpb", "created_utc": 1583440519.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "Why the fuck does the tl;dr not have ticket, strike and date.
