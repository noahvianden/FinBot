In light of recent events, watching many an autist lose money on their puts despite predicting the correct movement of the underlying, I propose a new type of option. I would like to to predict the strike prices of puts themselves based on IV crush, theta crunch, beta munch, or any other factor in addition to the changing value of the underlying. \n\nHere's an example: Right now, a 4/20 SPY put @ 200 costs $6.37. However I'd like to wager that the price of said option will decrease significantly by the end of the week. With this in mind, I would like to buy a *put* on said *put*. So in this example, I might buy a 3/30 put on this 4/20 SPY 200P, perhaps at a strike price of $4. This put would grant me the *option*, but not the obligation to sell 100 4/20 SPY 200P contracts at the price of $4.\n\nIf such a meta option were to exist, I would simply buy put-puts on all the SPY puts that you all have been yoloing your McDonald's paychecks on for the past month and make millions.
