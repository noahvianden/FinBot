Many people are expecting Microsoft to report a loss tomorrow afternoon. There is no shame in taking your 25-30 percent and running before earnings. Fuck YOLO. Sometimes its all right to get paid and walk away before the catalyst. You YOLO'ed enough just by buying the options during the volatility before earnings.\n\n2.

If microsoft rises but starts to fall off before the bell, then it's best to sell off. :)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yup!

A lot can change in a month, and I'll hope that such sentiment will shield me from getting burned too badly.\n\nBut nah. I won't be holding until August 21st.
