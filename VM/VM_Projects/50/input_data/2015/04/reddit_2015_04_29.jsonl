{"title": "If you're just trading AAPL and are confused/upset by its market movement after a good earnings report...you should really just be trading indexes.", "selftext": "AAPL has been kind of 'easy mode' for trading.  It earned a spot on the DJIA for a reason, it's part of why S&P500 index funds have dominated many other sectors through the last six years.  It's one of the stocks that is easiest to see the long-term productivity effects through the short-term emotions.   But that also means that success in trading on productivity of the company makes it easy to confuse for having a 'real' grasp on the emotions that drive the short term behavior.  This is a mistake.\n\nI was originally given submitter status here for probably the wrong reasons--I had just told most of /r/personalfinance to just index everything, because honestly not many people have the knowledge to do more.  *I* personally don't, and any stock trades I do, I see more as mental exercise/pursuit of my investment hobby, and nothing more.  I think it is fantastic what some of you do here and I read your posts to sharpen my mind and gain insight so that I can become better at my hobby.  But I am probably never going to reach a level where I feel comfortable trading more than 5% of my portfolio actively even if I have the free trades from my brokerage to do that at will.  \n\nAnd as a result, I am never going to experience the emotional stress I am seeing some of you guys going through when things don't go the way you expected, even when you were right.  Because that's how the market is.  It's not there to make *you* rich or to build up your ego.  The long term index uptrends are there and will continue to be a boon to anyone with a retirement mindset.  That's where I have made nearly all of my money.  I'm a physicist and tend to look at market forces as being not so different from fundamental forces.  The long term growth of productivity and stagnation of worker wages is kind of like the gravitational force.  It's relatively predictable based on clear and quantifiable factors.  It has a clear direction, although that direction is not always up.   Emotions and valuations and technicals and even market fundamentals are nothing more than quantum electrodynamics by comparison--more significant in the NOW, but totally irrelevant when you're actually needing this money in your old age, and ultimately the momentum generated by it largely balances out over time.  And pretty wholly divergent from the ever higher march of productivity.  Predictable to some extent, but there's always going to be uncertainty.  That's just how small-scale effects are.  \n\nAnd if you can't handle being wrong about things that no one can always be right about, short-term trading is not for you.", "id": "349o8l", "created_utc": 1430309847.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "what if I told u that u trade like a ***lil' bitch***", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "This post was way too nice to not have a reply like this", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you don't yolo, *get the hell outta here*", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "this is the sort of paternalistic bullshit i see all over reddit.   it's really a subtle keyboard warrior power play.\n\nthat said you seem like a nice guy.
