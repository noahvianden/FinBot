Good job on PLUG. My best advice is to STOP right now hoping that anything you buy will ever recover. Hoping and dreaming will only blow up your account. Learn to cut your losses quickly, even if it is only 5 seconds later. Know your risk, develop your rules based on your experiences, and then follow them. Be robotic/systematic with it and you will be fine. ", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!\n\nWhen you stay STOP do you mean stop OXGN or stop hoping losses will recover in general? Either way, I'm thinking about cutting it loose.  I am watching one of your videos right now actually and writing up my rules in a .doc.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I just mean in general, never hope that something that has screwed you will recover. It will only make you hold onto losses too long, then the fact that you've lost will make you sell your winners too soon. It is a vicious circle. However you can stop it all very easily if you just define your risk rules and stick to them. e.g. max loss per trade = $150. Once it crosses $150 loss, you cut it whether you like it or not. Over time, this is what will make you money. And trading with at least 2:1 or 3:1 reward to risk (i.e. if you are risking $150 per trade you should be aiming for targets of MINIMUM $300-500). If you can't see the trade running far enough to make you that much, it's not worth taking. It takes a lot more willpower to sit on your hands than to enter/exit trades, but waiting is the name of the game. Wait for the opps that are perfect, well-defined, and low-risk and then hammer the shit out of em!

Also I should probably move away from my computer at some point around lunch time like you mentioned lol, today I was just glued to my screens.\n\nThis is what I have so far, I know I've got a lot of work to still do though;\n\n>Make sure the trade is worth it.  Is the upside higher than the risk? I.e. if I am setting my risk at $50 on a $1000 trade (5%), can I expect a 10% return? Or $25 risk on $1000 trade (2.5%) can I expect a 5% return?\nThe market is random, you cannot control where a stock is. You can only control where you buy and sell. Remember this when making an entry.\nSet an entry and exit target, based on support levels over the last 3-5 days (?). Do not get greedy. Cut losses when necessary and never be upset with profit.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I like it! I would suggest instead of considering % in terms of a $1000 trade, you use a hard number like 150 bucks max loss per trade or 100 bucks max loss. Then learn how to quickly calculate risk...for every 100 shares you have each penny is worth $1. So 100 shares, each penny = $1, 400 shares each penny = $4, etc. Then you can just say ok I have 500 shares and I'm risking 25 cents, 5*25 = $125 risk. Boom, done. \n\nthat really helps with day trading. And also, looking at the charts it will be difficult to determine what a 5% move is - it's much easier to say \"I am risking 10 cents, can this chart show me a 20c gain or better?\" then you just look for support/resistance levels to decide.
