When people want something bad to happen it usually props back up before that. \n\nAnyone buying leaps should be buying at any low point tomorrow. Anyone buying shares should be already be buying small brackets at any low point of a given day.\n\nThe problem with buying calls right now is that there's no cause for a big rush back up in a short amount of time. It could easily take another 50+ days to get back to 165.\n\nEveryone wants in on the iphone 8 and X, so right now everyone's waiting. January earnings will be great though, as that's AAPL's prime time. Last 4 years January to April has averaged ~20% in that time span, so leaps at any time is good.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "This one is just too easy.\n\n1. The stock drops because iPhone 8 doesn't sell out due to pent up demand for the X.\n\n2. Stock pops on insane demand for X.\n\n3. Stock drops because X is insanely supply constrained, majority of iphone shipments are pushed off a quarter, leaving only piddly iphone 8 shipments for this quarter. It will look like worst ever year for that quarter\n\n4. Stock pops when next quarter beats even iphone 6 quarter (which was also overly inflated due to supply issues). Stock pops even more because ASP moves up more than 10%-15% due to first-ever increase in base price (699 instead of 649) and $999 iphone.\n\nI am still in awe of the market's short sightedness. I wouldn't be surprised if they drop 15% on the bad iphone 8 quarter.\n\nI'll open a robinhood account as punishment if i'm grossly wrong about this.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I call it the iPhone Shuffle.
