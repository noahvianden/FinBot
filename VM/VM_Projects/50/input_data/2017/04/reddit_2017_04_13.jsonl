They'll probably be stuck with LTL and local routes for now. CMVs have weight limits, by axles(6t steers, 18t drives, 18t tandems) and gross (40t GVWR), which will be consumed by the batteries. The Model Xs battery weight comes in at 1,323 lbs. Thats almost twice the weight I've got in a single 87.5 gallon tank, or 100 Ibs more than both. Just for a 6,000 pound car. How heavy would they have to be to power a semi uphill weighing in at gross? If even legal, considering that requires getting the steer weight a shy below it's legal level, so you can move weight off the tandems and onto the drives so every axle can be a shy under it's legal limit while taking into account your fuel weight. Also considering it has to pull well for 8-10 hour days. Which now you have to factor in Hours of Service, fitting charging stations at terminals, possibly buying a larger fleet since you can't slip seat while the truck has to charge.
