{"title": "AMD - in at $10?", "selftext": "I'll start this off with saying I am new to trading stock, and not by any means good at it.\n\nI am looking to buy into AMD as I have been following a lot of hardware tech for much of the last 6 or 7 years, and watched the trends from year to year.  I know that a lot of what rocketed AMD recently was their Ryzen chips announcement gaining some steam, and it makes me wish I would have bought when I wanted to back in December, but I couldn't buy into the AMD gimmick I saw year in and year out.  That being said, with all the stuff coming out about the performance and the reasoning behind it, I am very much so anticipating it could shake down the market.  I have also been following a lot of the VEGA architecture information, but with less anticipation of shaking the market.\n\nAll of this being said, I, along with many others, have been watching the dip of AMD for what seems like no reason at all, and I am hoping it hits $10 (unsure how this will work out).  I am wondering - **Should I buy at $10 if it hits there?**  I know things are very shaky at this point, and AMD could just completely flop, but I haven't seen their products have much more of a bright future than I do with these, since the Athlon days.  Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!\n\n***Side note:***  I know it is not guaranteed they will go that low, but that is the point I am thinking it'd be best to buy at.", "id": "5ugidi", "created_utc": 1487266697.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "Step 1) take out a loan\n\nStep 2) All in AMD\n\nStep 3) Yacht ", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "***slow clap***\n\nBEST\n\nADVICE\n\nYET", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "you know it", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You dropped these ⌐■-■", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "100%, but it's not going to drop 30% unless something really drastic happens in which you're gonna want to reevaluate getting in", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "What would you consider a good buy in price?

Let's assume one thing - Intel doesn't drop their price because they have a marginal lead over AMD in overall performance at each level - With that assumption, Intel can probably win over most enthusiasts, but will not win over the OEMs.  OEMs want a bottom line type of deal that will give them decent performance with a small price tag.  AMD would have 1/2 price for a marginal drop in performance, which relates to millions of $$$ in savings.\n\nNow back to reality - ***IF***, and that is a very strong if...see, it's bold ;)...they shake up the market and the hype isn't completely just hype, Intel will be forced to either move their prices down, or eat some revenue loss.  The revenue loss is going to be small at first, but large in the long run, if AMD puts that revenue they gain into R&D, and start pushing the envelope.  If I had to guess, I'd say that Intel has been working on something big in case this ever came to be.\n\ntl;dr: Two scenarios can play out - either Intel drops their prices to be competitive, or they eat revenue and slow market loss on both ends (OEM and enthusiast) which will either push innovation or drop prices, the latter of the two will retain the OEM market because of the longstanding relationship.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Intel has such deep pockets, that even if they ever did feel threatened by AMD (again, I don't see it happening ), they can afford to take less profit and just bleed AMD out. \nAMD cannot win a war of attrition. \n\nSorry to say, but the primary reason AMD still exists as a CPU producer is so that Intel doesn't have to deal with being a monopoly and all the headache that comes with it. \nIt is cheaper for them, and better for their reputation, to let AMD have a tiny slice of the pie. \n\nIt is not entirely impossible for fortunes to reverse - after all, look at Microsoft\nand Apple in similar positions not that long ago.
