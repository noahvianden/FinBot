After a red day like today? sure, even FNMA had a dead cat bounce after the ruling\n\nGo down? I discussed down syndrome earlier. Not likely.\n\nStay flat - Yes, but it won't break 100, it had multiple chances to. The only question is.....for how long??\n\nYour welcome for the DD. Short puts, calls are risky. thats the play.
