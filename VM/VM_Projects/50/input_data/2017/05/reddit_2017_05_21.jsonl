It's \"in the money\" if the stock's currently above the strike price. A call's strike can be pretty much whatever. You can buy Amazon calls for 750, or 1250. Buying them at 750 will be ungodly expensive, and buying them at 1150 would be like 0.001.\n\nMain difference between a call and a put... a call you want it above the strike price, a put you want it below. A put's the equivalent of shorting.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "What would be the point of buying the 750 one? Would you lose money from the premium prices being too high?

That means if you exercised the option right then your break even is 961.30 for a share currently worth 959.84. Doesn't take much for you to start making money does it? It also gives you about 4x leverage on Amazon to where Amazon goes up $1 you'll have made $4 compared to buying one regular share. \n\nNow if instead you go with the 960 strike, the current ask is 18.55, meaning your break-even is 978.55. The risk of it expiring worthless is pretty high, assuming Amazon climbs up, you'd be leveraged about 52x, so significantly higher returns if it jumps that high compared to buying shares or deep ITM calls.
