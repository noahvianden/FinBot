Because VIX itself isn't a directly tradeable security (thus no direct arbitrage opportunity), and VIX only goes so far in practice, you will see this sorta disconnect all the time.  Trading VIX options alone seems like a futile effort without a tradeable underlying security, but I can definitely see the opportunity hedged against SPX as you did.

No, they can absolutely trade below intrinsic because there is NO underlying security to trade against.  VIX options are not options on futures as many others are, and VIX itself is not tradeable.  They are options on VIX itself, and because of the way VIX trades and the fact that there is no underlying security to trade on, it of course trades closely coorelated to VIX futures, because both assume a nearly identical ending price investors believe it will hit.

But what you don't get is that VIX options don't have VIX futures as their underlying to begin with.  ;P  They have the VIX value itself as the underlying.  At any rate, it's almost identical... they still mostly trade as if they did have the futures as the underlying, so all of this is relatively irrelevant.  The key point here is that VIX options, unlike stock options, trade at a disconnect with the value of VIX itself, thus why the strat of pair trading against SPX may have some value.
