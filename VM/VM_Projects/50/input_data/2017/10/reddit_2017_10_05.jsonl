{"title": "Rushing to buy on dips", "selftext": "With the recent dip on SHOP, I wanted to offer my thoughts on how we as investors and traders react to buying on dips. I would propose that we strive toward emotionless decision-making. But these dips have a curious ability to pressure you into forgetting that: *'is this pullback my last chance to enter before the next all-time high?' 'Will I miss the boat if I don't pull the trigger now?'* \n\nI wanted to go over the ones I've personally played this year, wins and losses and all. \n\nFirst one: **TD bank back in March due to their aggressive upselling scandal**. Decent dip from ~$55 to $50 and I bought it the next day. It was like, let's not kid ourselves, it's not even a real scandal. Ended up getting impatient and sold out flat because it dipped a little more and it was clear it needed time to get back in shape. Even if the substance of the news seems lacking, **it still impacts the market**. The swing traders bail if they're in the money. Some longs who'd otherwise stay in are spooked and are suddenly happy to protect their profits. Shorts who know this pounce and exploit. Stoplosses get triggered and it can take time for it to all flush out. These events are not a one-day thing; the damage takes time to absorb.\n\nNext one: **NVDA back when Pacific Crest downgraded them in April**, pullback from $120 to $95. It took a couple of days to retrace. I was lucky that when I started observing it, NVDA had already dropped a few days in a row. So it let me calm down and plan it out properly. That left the question: where to buy? At the time, I was reading up on basic technical analysis. Namely the concepts of support and resistance. A lot of people are split on TA, but this S&R has clear basis in reality. If you watch the Volume Profile of a stock, you'll see the heaviest concentration of longs' positions at these support levels. It's not magic, it's not tea-leaves - there is a definite and higher number of shares purchased by real people at that specific price, and require huge sell volume to break. \n\nAt the time, the key support for NVDA was at $95. The stochastics and rsi indicators on the 3 min, 3 min charts were forming a bottom while I was watching, so I bought it there. This is one where I did time the exact bottom at $95 and I'm still proud of it. (Still a pretty sad story; sold at $110 because I didn't feel comfortable holding through earnings haha, fuck!) \n\nStill, lesson learned. I mastered my emotions, got a little bit more savvy, and being patient worked out. I'll never rush into things again. Right? \n\nNope: **AUPH back when it was in full meme stock mode**. The management did a pretty clever timing trick. They did a secondary offering, but did it less than a month prior to a series of presentations/conferences. The trap here is you think \"*Oh damn, there are catalysts coming up*.\" To suck in investors who would otherwise give more time for the stock to consolidate after the dilution, and traders who would otherwise wait for price history to develop so they can identify the support level. \n\nAbsolutely not a situation a new trader like me should've fucked with. Again, I rushed. I jumped on a drop from $8.00 and $7.75, only for it to drop to $6.75 for a couple months. \n\nI learned the pattern of pre-conference pumps, then selloffs after the event pretty quick. But it took 5-6 cycles of catching the stock near $6.75, waiting on paychecks so I could lower my average optimally then selling right at the top in one of the later pumps. I caught the last one, and sold the runup to the earnings and ended up becoming a lot more confident. I stayed patient and waited for $6.70-6.75 when it was fluctuating in the low $7s, and I was able to time the tops pretty good. I got the satisfaction of 'beating' the stock and ending up on it a couple hundred dollars. But if I hadn't rushed that first purchase, I'd have more than doubled my money doing the *exact same* transactions. It didn't matter if after that I was the perfect veteran for that stock.\n\nTo average down I had to increase my exposure to the stock more than I planned, I slept less to get up early at market open to sell if I was stuck at work during an after hours news run the previous day etc. \n\nOne I didn't partake in but was high-profile enough I looked at it was the **AMD horror-show after their earnings report** that tanked the stock from $13 to ~$9.50. A lot of people on this subreddit posted when they bought at $11, $10.50, $10.00... all the while, $9.50 was  the 200MA at the time. Once again, the stock didn't get there to $9.50 in one day. \n\nMy point is each situation is different. But they're almost never a \"*I need to buy literally NOW*\" moment. For large caps and midcaps with tens of millions of shares traded a day, it takes multiple days for the negative event to fully impact the market. \n\nTake the time to step back, take into account the size of the float, the market cap of the company, etc and judge those against the severity of the catalyst. Is institutional ownership high? They may short as a hedge to roll with the general direction of the market but with the intention of sweeping up the depressed shares once it blows over. Buy near support, not in no man's land where the only long positions are stray retail investors, not enough concentrated volume vs. shorts who can just walk the stock down. If it's an unexplored price zone where there's no support or any information you can use, PASS on the opportunity. \n\nI say this as pretty much someone who started off reading posts here and could've used some detailed discussion on how to approach different situations. I got burned by blindly following the hype but pick things up quicker than a lot of people and I'm always thinking and evaluating my decisions. All the while, even having someone with a few months' worth of experience would've helped me. So hope this helps.

I'd say the 'context' gives me a pretty strong feeling of deja vu with NVDA. I don't like the comparison too much, but here it is: the similarity is that prior to the negative catalyst, there was a euphoric attitude. Both stocks were mostly the industry's darlings. When that switch flipped, Pacific Crest's downgrade ended a perfect upward channel for NVDA and kept it in a congested range\n\nNVDA ended its congestion phase once the next big fundamental came out - their earnings report. If I were to put up a guess of what happens, the downside would be limited to Shop going into a funk that it will break out of on the next earnings report. Recent history is on their side after all. \n\nI don't think it's this gamechanging thing for the long-term investors. Shopify has passed the first big tests of its earnings reports and demonstrating growth; now the bar is raised. The focus of the analysts putting out ratings were all focused on how the company will do on the early stages, if Shop would be building revenue at all. Now the question logically becomes 'how will the rate of growth be once it's more established?\" Instead of purely adoption, now retention is something that the industry needs to see tested. I think that's the real argument put forward in Andrew Left's report, not the headline 'omg it's another herbalife'. Amazon integrating with Shopify makes that a pretty stupid argument and we've already seen that angle fail with the Bill Ackman stuff.\n\nRather, his firm's trying to put doubt into the minds of other analysts: 'How many businesses subscribing to Shop's platform are profitable/established/will be established and be reliable future sources of payment?' 'How much can the earnings reports to date be taken at face value?' 'The numbers we have include the shops that might be trying to stay afloat before ultimately shutting down.' 'How many are struggling businesses who maybe have unrealistic expectations for Shop's effect on their sales?' Maybe other firms may bandwagon but cold hard performance will flip them right back.

Too many people in love with the SHOP story - I mean, look at Reddit, every thread about SHOP has been a cheerleader fest.\n\nLeft's discussion that this is \"Herbalife but worse\" is silly, but he does raise questions worthy of discussion about the sustainability of the majority of the SHOP user base and SHOP's aggressive marketing tactics. How many users are drop shippers who are in/out? How many are referrals from people promising business success on Youtube and elsewhere?\n\nThis may ultimately just pass over and the thing can keep going, but I do tell people not to just throw a tantrum every time a short seller says anything - people always go, \"OMGERD ITS MANIPULATION\" and say \"evil short sellers\" and stuff like that.
