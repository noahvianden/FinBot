At minimum, that $250B in cash will do something, M&A, dividend, either way, will return value.\n* Goldman Sachs - Think JPM is the better banking play\n* Tesla - Growth already priced into stock. Better to play lithium through ALB, LIT, etc. \n* Nvidia - Solid. Some growth already priced in but all their sectors are growing absurdly.\n* Caterpillar - Solid. Especially if an infrastructure bill can get passed.\n* Alibaba - Solid. China will need to keep growth rising, but I think that has good odds. \n* General Mills - Solid. People have to eat.\n* Skyworks Solutions - I don't know this company. \n* Adobe - Solid.\n* Nike - Avoid.

Largest retailer in the US.\n* J&J - Solid. Diversified (Consumer goods, medical devices, pharma) with strong and safe dividend. Will need good pharma results for strong growth, but they have my confidence. Have been a company for over a century.\n* FedEx - Currently solid but the risk is Amazon starts a shipping company. \n* Verizon - If you were going to invest in telecommunications, VZ would be the best play. Nice dividend too. \n* Home Depot - Solid due to it's 'Amazon-proof' business model. Would benefit from infrastructure bill too.\n* Volvo - I know this company but not their finances. \n* Microsoft - Solid.

I read about them he other day?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "AbbVie currently owns and sells the world's #1 most profitable drug (Humira) which is a straight cash cow (~$14 billion in annual sales). While Amgen has been approved for a bio-similar, and other companies are developing bio-similars, due to legal issues and the biotech development, Humira should still have two to three years of uncontested sales, and even after other bio-similars are approved, there is the question of whether or not physicians will prescribe them over Humira, which has a long history of proven success. TLDR: Humira will generate billions in annual profit over the next decade.\n\nOutside Humira, AbbVie owns a couple cancer drugs that bring in respectable profits, but more importantly, their sales are growing and this trend is expected to continue, helping to ease any blow from Humira sales declining.\nOutside of approved drugs, AbbVie has an excellent pipeline (I work in biotech/pharma, not for AbbVie, but I can understand their moves a little more than the average person). Granted there is a massive 'valley of death' between the pipeline and FDA approval, and nothing is every certain in drug development, but AbbVie has a long track record of success bringing drugs to market.\n\nIf you count their years under Abbott, AbbVie is a dividend aristocrat, having raised their dividend every year for 20+ years. Currently at 0.64 a quarter, that is yield of ~3.7%, which is nothing to sneeze at and higher than both MSFT and GILD.\nAbbVie consistently beats estimates (granted barely, but beating expectations is still beating expectations) and has a P/E of 18.5 which is average/low (lower than MSFT, higher than GILD).\n\nTLDR: Year after year of growth, good financials, excellent portfolio of current drugs (including the world's #1 selling drug), and a good pipeline of future drugs with a track record of success bring drugs to market", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you I screen shot that info and I will prob invest in them.

Humira will retain its monopoly status for at least another five years. \n\nEven after that, doctors can be slow to prescribe new drugs. Why switch to a new, relatively-unproven drug when there is a highly efficacious one that you've been using for decades? There will almost certainly be less Humira treatments(Amgen's biosimilar will pull some) and those treatments will be less profitable (competition reduces price). But Humira revenues will not plummet; it will be a slow decline. It is still a fantastic drug for a variety of inflammatory disorders. \n\nMoreover, while the majority of Abbvie's revenues remain Humira, their other approved drugs are showing YoY sales growth, estimated to continue in the coming years. Abbvie knows its own reliance on Humira and began years ago to shift away from that reliance.\n\nAdditionally, they have an excellent pipeline of over 40 drugs in clinical trials. Most of these will fail, but it will only take one blockbuster, or two or three regular pharmaceuticals to keep the Abbvie ball rolling.
