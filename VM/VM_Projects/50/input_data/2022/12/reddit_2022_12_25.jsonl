Thanks for the non advice and just blabbing about how every opportunity has been missed only to have 2022 be the year of shorts. \n\nSure, we will may likely see a bump in the overall market / index in the start of 2023, but some individual names are certainly in for some pain. Can you conjure any up or are you just bullish 100% on every name? Or could it be you had zero substance or an opinion on the question legitimately posed and so you threw out some breaking news story \\[regarding how we have officially hit the bottom\\] because someone asked regarding short opportunities in the market?\n\nI'll double down on my short position of each of your comments.

I'd really like to purchase that money printing machine of a product. \n\nThanks again for participating and providing no substance, nor value in this discussion. Except amusement (and not by your own volition). \n\nBreaking news: someone on reddit dubbed elegantly as random69 has provided no value, lacks sufficient investment theses on the potential to short individuals names in the market and cannot admit this to himself/herself and must make sure the community at large doesn't deem them a complete waste of time and space. \n\nAnother Breaking update: Random69 has officially given up on trying to defend any of their baseless argumentative falsehoods and does in fact truly believe there is a stock that can decrease in value yielding someone a profit, however this individual is unable to name or locate such an investment so they say snide comments and act as if they are clairvoyant and have some inside edge into the market and its soon to be conditions. This individual does not assume too much, nor do they misunderstand or not know everything. \n\n**Again, the question was: are there any good names to short?

Hope this years is a prosperous one for you.

I'd say it is you that doesn't know too much as evidenced by your falsely answering the question (so missing the point, or rather choosing to on purpose) and then by adding in your smart ass comment regarding the breaking news. Sometimes it just feels good to call some troll, bully out on their shit. \n\nBreaking News: Random69 cannot simply apologize for being a dick in his/her comment that was deemed unproductive, unhelpful and jeopardizing to someone's feelings. Good thing that Fluffy\\_Ad wasn't indeed hurt by the comment and instead took it as an opportunity to make it publicly known that Random69 had not the slightest idea or notion on how to answer the question, thus merely adding a nonsense comment and providing a weak attempt at best, humor, but more likely a dickhead comment that didn't resonate with anyone. \n\nThis just in, break news: Random69 cannot simply accept this self evident truth and thus therefore must continue to reply with one-line sentences feigning knowledge and attempting to not take responsibility for a) not knowing the answer to the question posed, b) pretending they do have an answer but would prefer not to share it, c) for acting cowardly once confronted, and d) lacking all suitable justification of their behavior and commenting. The world hope you move back under the troll bridge you emerged from or at the very least fuck off from this thread where you are truly unwanted -- both because you have not the working knowledge and ability to contribute productively and because what transpired has made you look like a dickhead. \n\nJust take your licking and fuck off. Or come up with a good short idea, even if it involves somehow creating that synthetic derivative to short you and your overall knowledge base of he market (or just in general). That product would be the new printing press. If only you could short people -- in the case Random69 -- we'd all be millionaires overnight. in case it's not clear enough, I wish I could short you with my life savings and then 100x leverage the position given the confidence interval I have in your lack thereof knowledge and trite bully like behavior. \n\nAlways feels good to nail an asshole/bully to the wall. Merry Christmas, here's your greatest gift, being outright told that you act like a prick and should change your behavior because behind a computer screen you may seem very tough, but we all know inside you're empty if you need to leave comments like that (only to make yourself feel better). It's actually quite sad and has caused my once annoyance to turn to pity for you. Seek help if you can receive it, and work through your issues. Therapy takes time, but it has the potential to change who you are. You don't want to be the goblin of a person. It's important you have come to realize this, now here comes the self help. It can start by leaving the chat and admitting to yourself that you didn't have the requisite knowledge to answer the question and so you used it as an opportunity to speak negatively of someone else in the community to make yourself feel superior. I wish you well in recovery. \n\nBreaking news: Random69 is seeking help for their destructive behaviors and lack of adequate market knowledge and has become thanks to Fluffy\\_Ad for guiding them toward this realization. Random69 feels very appreciative for this lesson and shall carry it forward in therapy and in not leaving comments on others threads in an attempt to belittle their OP only to make themselves feel better. Random69 also has conceded that Fluffy\\_Ad does in fact understand a great deal, and has formally come to the conclusion that they through their own societal structure / confine believe themselves to be on a lower level than Fluffy\\_Ad. However Fluffy\\_Ad has forgiven Random69 and doesn't feel the need to shame them to feel any less a person, just to know that their comments have implications and if their intent is to make someone upset, demean some, be a bully or something along the same lines it is really an attempt to not attack themselves through repression of their unbounded emotions. Random69 experienced somewhat of a Christmas miracle in coming to this conclusion so fast. We all applaud you. Truly sir/madam, you have shown us what it looks like to offer an apology and simply and efficient more on from your mistake, and seek out the knowledge you once lacked. Thank you, sincerely. You're a real hero to many on this site that cannot stop being an ass to others merely to feel good about themselves. A true inspiration. \n\nMerry Christmas! Have an excellent day in your excellent life filled with immense cheer and happiness. We'd all die to trade places with you, but fortunately for you -- you get to live the life you lead, as amazing as it must be. \n\nGoodbye Random69. It has been an honor getting to know why you couldn't answer the question, felt the need to leave a snide comment and couldn't initially confess to this because of your own shortcomings, but I am glad we were able to work through it and I was able to offer help to someone that was desperately seeking it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Treasuries", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dca instead of gambling ....", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tgt at a nice low again", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "NVDA SNOW SALESFORCE.
