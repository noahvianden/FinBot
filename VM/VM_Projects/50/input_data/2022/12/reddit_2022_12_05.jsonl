Had I followed strictly the technical id be starting my week with a big L. \n\nIm not saying we should never swing a play as I do it quite often but when we do it must be a high conviction play. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf6q95z1v54a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e99f564ddca8954bc77cc4ccda32c3ad8c3b833\n\nDuring Fridays weekly market recap and analysis I mentioned I saw a pretty equal case for 390 and I also saw a pretty equal case for 420 by EOW. Well as of right now it looks like SPY is going to go for that 390 support test possibly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8sogrh2v54a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=42e8e8df9359887b74ce72cd11dffee12fc79477\n\nLooking at the SPY daily chart here you can see we are still in that broad blue rising wedge and we have now form a carrot top (v top) that actually when met with the support of the blue rising wedge forms a beautiful breakout/ down triangle. \n\nThis means tomorrow if we lose 397.8 support we break the rising wedge that dates all the way back to the October CPI and the 52week low of the year. However, if we breakout back over 404 tomorrow then the carrot top resistance is broken and we should naturally retest 405.2 resistance. \n\nThe other important thing to note that happened today is that we are now back in that 395.2 to 402.4 range that we have been trading within since November 11th. Of the last 16 trading days all but 4 trading days has seen the daily close within that $7.2 range. We really have been on a pretty massive consolidation period since the November CPI. Which honestly is kind of surprising. You would think with how bullish all these big wigs are and talking points on CNBC and how many people are screaming for 450 by EOY that we would be making some upward progress… but in reality SPY has only pushed up a total of 3.8% over the 21days since the last CPI. \n\nThat means that 5.5% green day we closed on November 10th is almost double the total upside move that SPY has put in over the last 23 total days since CPI. If we are so bullish… why are we stuck here? \n\nToday they released the MoM CPI/ CORE consensus numbers and Bloomberg terminal put out the CPI/ CORE projections over the weekend. I am wondering if markets remain on edge going into this CPI and FOMC. \n\nI am reminded heavily of September CPI here and this whole movement and setup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8i9jxp13v54a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1c6cdf6b344e65432551f15ca4446a03c8beb4\n\nFutures gave back everything and then some of that red daily candle we put in on Friday. \n\nFutures is now trading back near that key 4000 pivot point. Below 4000 we look for 3910 retest, however if bulls can defend 4000 here we very well could see a breakout back to 4095 by EOW. \n\nKey support- 4000 -> 3960\n\nKey resistance- 4050 -> 4075\n\n**Note- I am taking a break from tesla… therefore to not distract myself no more Tesla TA for a while. Will re-evaluate come the new year.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpawrke4v54a1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffa65a0e4a696785bc1fe28a05ea58c421174509\n\nReally big green day for the VIX here which is kinda surprising as there was some news about apple, china, oil etc. but really nothing monumental. However, we did once again fail to close over the daily 8ema. Tomorrow if we were to see the VIX break out over 21.4 that would break the VIX bear channel that dates back to October 12th. \n\nThat to me would signal a bigger POTENTIAL that we are seeing the peak of the bear market rally and that we are going to start looking for a drop on Spy. However, to feel more confident in that we need to see the daily 20ema closed over on the VIX and I would like to see the consensus and preferably results of CPI/ FOMC. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ad9lv9u4v54a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d99c09fa1f2e84738a6ec148918bf05ae138a44\n\nThis challenge continues to go well as we enter the 4th week of this challenge. I look forward to continuing this challenge and seeing how the results fair over a longer period of time. \n\n**Daily Log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr00lia5v54a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=663a58bfced0e1424195b3130edc4e8a60553846\n\nI had a pretty great Monday which always makes me happy to start the week off. It can be defeating starting the week with a red day and feeling like you are in catch up mode. I had some really nice plays today, however, I believe all but one of my scalps had I held 5-10 seconds longer would have 3-4x every single time. The last put I closed at 4.6% 4x’d the instant I closed my play and went on to nearly 9x before SPY finally bounced. \n\nThe L2L are starting the week off nice and strong too. I am having some difficulty with these L2L plays in this time range and still working on trying to play the best DTE for those. On some plays it seems 3dte theta eats too fast if the move doesn’t hit instantly and on other plays 4dte just doesn’t seem worth the R:R. However, per the recommendation of another trader this week I am going to start using some OTM contracts for the L2L plays to see how that changes things for good or bad. This week I am also utilizing a -15% stop loss on all L2L plays… I am also considering this on scalps too but haven’t made the adjustment yet.", "id": "zdnbk6", "created_utc": 1670281575.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "Still kicking myself for closing my Tesla and Spy puts this morning, although profit is profit so still happy overall, but seem to let my losers run too long and close my winners too early.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Price action was whack, can’t blame yourself for closing puts early.
