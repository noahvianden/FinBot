After a horrible few months for Tesla\nTSLA -4.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle\nshareholders, the question is just how far the\ncomparison goes.\nTesla shares have roughly halved this year,\nworse than most of the EV maker's big peers in\nboth the auto and tech industries. Much of the\nunderperformance has come in the past three\nmonths, amid two broad concerns. One is that\ndemand for its products is no longer racing ahead\nof increasing supply, particularly in China. The\nother relates to risks surrounding Chief Executive\nElon Musk's purchase of Twitter, which came\ntogether in October.\nThe past week has been particularly bad for\ndemand worries. Following earlier news that the\ncompany has been cutting prices and offering\nsales incentives in China, Bloomberg and Reuters\nreported that it was planning to trim production\nat its Shanghai factory. Tesla denied the reports,\nbut Bloomberg followed up with details of shorter\nproduction shifts.\nLower output isn't completely surprising given that\nEV sales in China have been on a hot streak ahead\nof the expiration of some government subsidies,\npotentially leading to a hangover next year. Still,\nthe news plays into fears that Tesla's prospects\nin the world's largest car market aren't quite as\nspectacular as hoped.\nMeanw\nMr. Musk's chaotic turnaround of\nTwitter can be seen variously as a management\ndistraction, a financial liability that needs to be\nfunded by sales of Tesla shares or loans to Mr.\nMusk backed by those shares, a political hot potato\nthat doesn't sit well with a global mass-market\ncar brand, and generally a high-risk, high-profile\nenterprise that could take the shine off Mr. Musk's\nreputation and by extension Tesla's brand.\nThese risks are hard to relate directly to profit, but\nso is Tesla's valuation: The stock has always been\nhard to explain in terms of so-called fundamentals.\nThis year's selloff has made it easier, though.\nTesla shares now trade at about 32 times next\nyear's FactSet consensus earnings-higher than\nmost stocks but close to the lowest number in\ntheir history. Also, earnings per share are expected\nto grow rapidly, by 41% next year. Compare the\nearnings multiple with the earnings growth and\nyou get a so-called price-earnings-arowth or PEG ratio below one, often a signal that a stock\nis undervalued. This may be the first time Tesla\nshares have ever screened as cheap according to a\nconventional valuation metric.\nThe catch is that earnings growth needs to remain\nvery rapid for the metric to hold much meaning.\nThe big valuation question for Tesla investors is\ntherefore how easily it can carry on ramping up\noutput while maintaining the current high level of\nprofitability. The only reasonable answer is: not\nat all easily. Crucially for bulls, though, the dream\nscenario is just about imaginable if you look at\nthe company from the mobile-phone industry's\nperspective.\nAdd a comment\nIf EVs are like smartphones, Tesla can be seen\nas the next Apple. In the years after the iPhone's\ninvention, investors gave the product's inventor\na low valuation because they assumed its profit\nwould fall in line with those of other device makers.\nAs it turned out, the iPhone could be parlayed into\nan entire ecosystem, including subscriptions and\nother high-margin software, that has kept Apple's\nprofit for the most part growing.\nTesla teases the parallel with its guidance\nthat, \"over time,\" profit from selling cars will\nbe accompanied with \"an acceleration of\nsoftware-related profit.\" The big hope here is\ndriver-assistance software, with the company\nalready charging $15,000 for its most advanced\npackage.\nThe Apple comparison, which Mr. Musk made\ndirectly in Tesla's third-quarter earnings call, has\nenough substance to keep plenty of Tesla fans\nonside. But it ignores important differences.\nPerhaps the most fundamental one is that\nchoosing a car brand has long been a form\nof personal expression, leading to a variety of\nbrands and vehicle types. Will that change as\ncars go digital, with individual app and software\npreferences replacing differences in brand and\nstyling? Maybe, but it is a bet against a century of\nautomotive history.\nMore likely, Tesla's ambition to increase vehicle\ndeliveries consistently by 50% a year will dilute\nits margins. Today, these are high because it\nmakes few models on a large scale and sells them\nfor premium prices, helped by the shortage of\nvehicles in general and EVS in particular. Neither\nshortage will last forever, and Tesla's own growth\nwill undercut the combination of exclusivity and\noperational simplicity that support its current\nfinancial performance.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "How can you write decently yet not incorporate paragraphs? \n\nI apologise, but it always irks me. \n\nBullish on Tesla long term.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "🤌", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It is an unformatted cut and paste.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "bro just had to say it will go up or down and I would've been appeased", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyaefb92l5a1.jpeg?width=569&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e22596fd2a67c93200213dca5bcef62c6ddeb0e7", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Takes one tweet from the nutjob to undo everything...", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Paragraphs!", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "So is the author recommending investors get out of ALL EV stocks or just TSLA?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "All the world is screaming puts on Tesla and then there is this …", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The way people bend over backwards to make their theory work.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla is about 5 years away from being at a fair value for todays price.
