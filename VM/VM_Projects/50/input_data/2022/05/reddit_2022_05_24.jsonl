{"title": "Am I missing out at all by not doing more advanced strategies?", "selftext": "Just for some context, I traded paper for several years starting in 2017 until I could build up some capital I was comfortable losing, and develop a strategy. Start of this year I decided to start trading full time, I had a bit of a rocky start getting used to non-paper but it only took me a few weeks to be confident with my strategy/trading. Currently up 140% YTD with 62% W/L ratio (closer to 80% if you exclude my first couple weeks where I had some screw ups).\n\nPrior to switching off paper I had done a ton of research on the greeks, volatility, different strategies etc. Mainly I spent my research time trying to learn all the things NOT to do. The thing is I've been successful simply buying calls and puts on a very small number of tickers. No condors, butterflies, spreads, selling, earnings gambles etc. To me personally, I feel like I would be exposing myself to more complicated mechanics, that even if I understand them well it's just more points that are prone to failure or making a mistake. I understand the benefits of some of those strategies for longer term lower risk gains, but at the same time I also feel like those strategies in general require significantly more capital or margin to take advantage of well. I don't use margin and I don't like having large amounts of capital tied up in one strategy either.\n\nI just wanted to get perspective from people with more experience than me about my current trading from the past 6 months. To me I feel like \"If it works, just stick with it\", especially if I can be successful in the current market. I'm just wondering if there are potential good reasons to expand my current strategies, to me the only benefits I could see to changing what I'm doing is A) Spending less time watching the market every day, which I don't mind, and B) Lowering my risk exposure more, although I feel more in control of that with my current strategy, despite other strategies being obviously less risky.", "id": "uwxvkb", "created_utc": 1653417849.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 54, "comments": [{"body": "You are doing it all wrong , If you were doing it Right, you would have lost all your money by now.", "score": 41, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "“Guys, I’m only up 140% YTD… am I missing out?”", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "a little bit yeah lol, still a serious question though.

You WILL blow up sooner or later, or at the very least, fall back to earth. Since you are buying option, you might not blow up in 1 or 2 trade, **but it will happen eventually**.\n\nWe don't know what kind of sizing/exposure your portfolio has, but I'd suggest you start there and ask yourself, \"*What if part of my success is luck based? What if my W/L ratio normalizes to near theoretical value of the trades that I am taking\"*.\n\nAlways remember, your due diligence might give you an edge over many others in this business, even enough to beat the market comfortably, but that edge won't be 140% ytd. You must have heard of stories of people succeeding for a couple of months/quarters and then losing their shirt. This is how it generally starts.\n\n**Here is a tiny example** \\- you've seen how some of the tech companies are moving during earnings correct? 20-40% movements. Folks who bought strangles/straddles would have made a killing this year. It is STILL not a profitable strategy over a long term to long volatility during earnings. It just happened that this year RV > IV. It's not the norm. If I was a newbie, and I traded these, I'd be up 140%. I caught a lucky break.

I don't really do any kind of TA, I set a weekly and daily range of prices based on order book, volume profiles, futures etc. (mostly just informed guessing). I research a lot in terms of just keeping up with general world news, financial news, certain high cap companies, important financial calendar events. Keeping up with that stuff helps me gauge if there might be a specific move within the range or out of the range I have set up.  \n\nIn terms of the actual positions I take I actually look at charts of the contract prices more than I look at the price of the index. I look at strikes that fall somewhere within my range for the day/week with 7-10 dte and then I look at the 2,5 and 10 day charts for the contract price. \n\nWhen I am trying to open a position I'm looking for the best value. For example the premium for SPY 5/31 400c at today's low was almost the same price as it was on Friday's lower low. Friday low to Monday high it moved from about $1.40 to $5.20. So today I see that same 400c at $1.70 and assuming I'm bullish (from research or price in range) I'll pick it up since it has room to move. You just have to factor theta in when you look at longer price histories. Here are a [couple](https://i.imgur.com/qYvSsXp.png) of [screenshots](https://i.imgur.com/fNfpD3P.png) showing what I'm talking about (Active Trader doesn't actually mark your entry price or exit or anything. I add those while I'm trading). I watch these charts while I also watch the index charts.\n\nWhen it comes to timing I tend to sell early, but I'd rather sell early than hold and lose to theta or some wild movement. On index trading it very much feels like there is big money that wants to wipe out people who are trading on general sentiment. Just meaning we have a lot of days where half the day will be what everyone expects, and then big volume tries to reverse it. It doesn't always happen but it's a big reason why close out positions early. I usually wait a bit to open a reverse position and I look at the value on the contract prices again and look at the range I set up.\n\nLast thing is I keep a lot of notes on my charts saying what I did good or bad, what to possibly expect the next day etc and use a trade journal to keep track of things since I trade with multiple brokerages. I actively note when I let emotions affect my trades so that I can be aware of those types of decisions in the future.\n\nAlso probably dumbest thing I do, I don't use stop losses at all. I also don't hedge my positions at all. \n\nAll that being said maybe what I am doing is really stupid and will blow up in my face, or only works in the current market etc. Like many in this thread have said there is probably a good chance one of my accounts will blow up.
