{"title": "Buying the dip - An analytical deep-dive into what you should do in a turbulent market", "selftext": ">*Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face* \\- Mike Tyson\n\nThere’s no point beating about the bush here - From Twitter to the mainstream media, everyone’s talking about the market correction. The S&P 500 saw an 18% drawdown and Nasdaq is down 25% YTD, enough to get investors and traders panicking about the dream bull run ending, and wondering whether we’re entering a bear market now.\n\nBut when emotions are high and anecdotes are used to draw comparisons, there’s only one recourse - Data. We’ve seen three significant corrections over the last 20 years and studying the market’s behavior during those corrections can give us clues about what to do. Let’s dive deep into the previous corrections to understand why this isn’t the time to panic - And what you should do with your investments now.\n\n## Data\n\nThere were three major market corrections in the past - In 2000-02, in 2007-08, and in 2020. I mainly looked at data related to these periods to answer two questions:\n\n1. Should you wait, keep investing, or double down during a dip?\n2. Can you protect against downside risk?\n\nI have used the S&P 500 as the benchmark for most of these backtests. The data for this article has been collected using Yahoo Finance. The analysis and data are shared at the end of the article.\n\n## Buying the dip\n\nMarkets fluctuate every day. But the reason a drawdown gets everyone’s attention is that the drop in prices is rapid, and the psychological effect is immense. The 2007-08 correction saw the S&P 500 losing value by more than 50%. Imagine seeing half the value of your portfolio seemingly evaporate overnight!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj03wbt698091.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=240a148b5327e60b1037ca6898b9b2ce5a682fca\n\nIt’s very hard to hold on to your investments in such cases. The instinct is to sell at a high and buy at a low. But is it possible to do so reliably? Market timing is a tricky business and it does not work in the long run. \\[1\\] But in the case of a market correction, ***should you wait out the storm before investing again, or should you double down and buy more?*** Let’s study the past corrections to find out.\n\nConsider three investors: Cautious Charlie, Average Andy, and Daring Dave. Each of them invests $100 into the S&P 500 at the beginning of every month. When the market goes below 10% of the previous all-time high (let’s call this the threshold), each investor reacts differently to the dip.\n\n* Cautious Charlie “holds” - He stops investing and waits till the market crosses the threshold again.\n* Average Andy “stays” - He continues investing as usual.\n* Daring Dave “doubles” - He invests double the usual amount till the market crosses the threshold again.\n\nWho did better? Here’s how they would have performed if they had started investing in 1998:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uvyqtz798091.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde8138d1f036bd208fb2508002d207b078fc6e9\n\nWould you look at that! At the end of 24 years, Average Andy and Daring Dave have returns of greater than 330% while Cautious Charlie has a return of about 240%. The most profitable strategy is to double down during dips, but continuing to invest as usual also does great.\n\nBut how do their average returns compare in the short term? These are the average returns if you had invested using the three strategies starting at the beginning of the last three major corrections:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mynxx1x898091.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7f1e30d02b6b2078e44226c1f36a2b8488965c\n\nEven in the short term, buying during the dip is far superior to waiting \\[2\\] You would have lost money by waiting but made positive returns over even a 3-year and 5-year period if you had continued to invest - and the profits of the “double” strategy are almost 2x that of the “hold” strategy where you stop investing.\n\nThe message is clear - Buy the dip if you can afford to.\n\n## Hedging your bets\n\nSometimes we get so lost in the commotion that we forget to analyze the fundamental reasons behind a correction. A blanket term like a market correction is hard to understand - but looking at how different sectors performed during similar periods in the past can help us find safe bets. This is how each sector performed on average:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6ufxmea98091.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=97531102833b5fcdaa1d14872331d5c86a9e9f86\n\nDuring the last three major drawdowns, semiconductors, tech, and financial stocks were the worst affected. On the other hand, consumer staples, healthcare, and telecom have seen a drawdown much below what the market sees on average. This offers an opportunity - while continuing to invest in the S&P500 is a good strategy, ETFs which invest specifically in these sectors can offer some protection against the downside (The risk of course is that you will miss out on the opportunities that Tech and Growth stocks provide). \\[3\\]\n\nHow you see the market also depends on how you look at it. The S&P500 is just one index out there, and other indices tell a different story. The NASDAQ 100 is a tech-heavy market-cap-weighted index that does not track financial companies. The Russell 2000 tracks 2000 small-cap stocks. The Dow Jones Index is a price-weighted index (unlike the others) that tracks only 30 companies - and it leaves out a lot of big Tech names like Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m59cr9sc98091.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=a291777f255186995f103e2a84a0a0dc9096d54c\n\nHistorically, the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have reacted much more violently to a market correction than the Dow Jones, as the Nasdaq invests heavily in Tech, and the small-cap companies in the Russell 2000 are more susceptible to corrections. Currently, the market might be in the middle of a correction and we don’t know when it will end - but this is another indicator that investing in non-tech stocks like the Dow Jones Index does is a good way to hedge your bets.\n\n## Should you wait?\n\n>*Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.* \\- Warren Buffett\n\nWe saw earlier that timing the market is a very unreliable strategy. To push this point further, here’s a thought experiment: How long would it have taken to double your money in **the worst possible circumstances?** Imagine you had bought into the S&P 500 just before the price dropped and held on without selling or putting in any more money. This is how long you would have had to wait.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1v0txie98091.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3f933eb52595debf7424c9cbf23aef218e6613\n\nThe worst waiting period was from 2000 to 2006, and even then you would have doubled your money in just 6.72 years! That’s a return of 10.8% compounded annually. The market bounced back way faster in case of the 2020 correction. The wait feels long because the drop from high to low happens within a year or two on average, and it may take a long time to reach the previous high again - But once the previous high is reached, the market doubles in a little more than half a year on average! Timing the market is a fool’s errand in this case.\n\nIn fact, if you believe that compounding is the key to long-term wealth creation, unnecessarily disturbing your portfolio could cause more harm than good. CNN tracks market sentiment through a metric called “[The Fear and Greed Index](https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed)”. Right now, the index is at an all-time low - indicating that the market is very fearful and it’s a good time to buy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvq0pgdf98091.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=68cf7cf1a5243c82034d6ea0218f71a2a27b44c7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMarket corrections are psychologically difficult times, and all investing rules go out of the window. It’s hard to hold on to your stocks when you see them go down, but as the data shows, market corrections of more than 10% are not a time to sell, and rather a time to keep investing or even invest more.\n\nBe clear about the timelines of your investing. Hedge your bets to reduce risk if necessary but consider if it’s worth interrupting your investment if you don’t need the money now. If your wealth-building game is long-term and not based on trading, there is little reason to try and time the market. Stay invested, wait for the recovery, and be greedy when others are fearful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data:** All the data used in the analysis [**can be found here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/buying-the-dip-5c1ngpw3v99Do3XSsdgnL/live)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Footnotes** \n\n\\[1\\]\n\nAs Nick Maggiuli demonstrates in [this article](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/right-now-but-wrong-later/), rules of thumb like “wait for six months before buying into the market” would have given you a profit after the 2000 and 2007 corrections, but you would have miserably underperformed in the 2010s when the volatility was not as much.\n\n\\[2\\] The 2020 correction was excluded from 3-year and 5-year returns.\n\n\\[3\\] There’s a parallel between the 2000 Dot-com bubble and the correction that’s happening now, in that Tech and growth stocks are the worst affected even now. But this is not the burst of a bubble unlike 2000 when Amazon was just 6 years old and Facebook didn’t even exist. What’s going on? One explanation for the current dip is that the free money that was pumped into the system after the COVID lockdown last year propped up the market to unrealistic levels and now that the Fed rates are kicking in, the market will normalize at a little higher than pre-pandemic levels (Michael Batnick covers this in [his excellent article](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2022/05/13/how-low-can-stocks-go/)).", "id": "usbp0g", "created_utc": 1652876745.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "Very good take, you forgot to tell me where the bottom will be this time though!", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "The bottom will be the lowest point before it starts going back up.", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "You’re a genius.

{"title": "Stale data on housing costs are 40% of core-CPI, or why 2022 is going to continue to be a crappy year for risk assets.", "selftext": "**TL;DR: While there’s a lot of talk about inflation, by far the largest component of core-CPI (40% or several orders of magnitude more heavily weighted than everything else) is housing costs and due to the methodology “updated” numbers are actually over a year old. Virtually no one mentions this outside the academic literature. For this reason CPI could continue to rise for the next year or more, forcing the Fed to raise rates more than expected and essentially popping the pandemic-era everything bubble. We still have a ways to go before mean reverting to 2019 trend and there’s always a risk markets could overcorrect. So I’m keeping a lot of cash on hand and also favor buying commodities over stocks.**\n\nI want to start by saying that inflation in my view isn't as new or scary as some will make it seem unless you're retired because there has also been wage inflation and people are earning more. Inflation is simply more demand than supply which causes prices to go up. We've all seen this play out countless times--not enough Yeezys or workers or raw materials as people want and the prices start skyrocketing. The difference between the inflation Jerome Powell (JPOW) talks about and some dude hawking Yeezys at a 500% premium to sticker price is really just how pervasive it's become in so many parts of our lives--food, energy, shelter, ie the basics.\n\nJPOW got a lot of flak for repeatedly insisting last year that inflation was \"transitory.\" **In a philosophical sense maybe he was correct--everything in life is transient said the Buddha. And everything will eventually get sorted out--but it took years to get here. It could take years to get back.**\n\n*In a more immediate sense he was speaking of supply-demand mismatches that are partly a result of \"supply chain bottlenecks\" like chip shortages that cause shortages of new cars that had spill over effect into used cars. This is definitely part of the story. But so too is the confluence of pandemic-era accommodative fiscal (stimulus) and monetary (QE, negative real rates) policies by Congress and the Fed, respectively.* Just as one example, if a family was receiving thousands in stimulus payments and child tax credits (expiring) and also saw the value of their home and retirement accounts double because the Fed kept nominal rates near zero while buying trillions in bonds to essentially create money then they might have been quick to go out and buy an even bigger home or take a really nice vacation--but because millions of other families were in the same boat lumber prices and airfares started to soar. And in a sense this effect really is \"transitory\" although it will likely take years to mean revert.\n\n**By the end of 2019, the S&P 500 had (already buoyed by 4 previous rounds of QE since 2008) trended up to 3000 and the Nasdaq to 9000. Markets tend to overshoot and overcorrect** so short or medium term it's really anyones guess where things will bottom out but in the absence of QE and the return of higher interest rates I think we are likely to revert back to the pre-pandemic trajectory at some point. **And there's another 20-25% of correction left before we get there**\n\nIt will probably be a choppy road but the reason in my view markets haven't corrected harder is the hope that the Fed can somehow engineer a \"soft landing,\" or in other words avoid having to engineer a recession to get asset prices back in line. This will be difficult for a number of reasons that are not a secret: The conflict in Ukraine has further accelerated the multiyear supercycle in commodity prices (if you look back in history, commodities invariably go through multiyear periods of extended boom followed by cyclical bust) **that was already underway. Furthermore, extended Covid-related lockdowns in China will cause further supply disruptions and costs increases.**\n\n**And now with all this in context I finally get to the crux of my post:** While the markets are probably pricing in Ukraine and the China-lockdowns and the probably of two 50 basis point increase in interest rates, **the Fed will likely be under even greater pressure to raise interest rates more and possibly faster than markets are already expecting while also drawing down their massive balance sheet for one rarely discussed reason:**\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm)\n\nWe use the BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary gauge of inflation. **In the CPI, there are two components of housing costs: owners’ equivalent rent of residence (OER) and rent of primary residence, which combined are 40 percent of core CPI**, which is the most widely watched because it excludes volatile energy and food prices.\n\nHowever, these are not real-time metrics. Unlike milk which people buy often, people enter into longterm leases and as such the BLS (the government agency that publishes the monthly CPI) divides into 6 cohorts. For the May measure, which will be released in the second week of June, the will ask 1/6th of respondents how much they pay in rent despite the fact that most of respondents entered leases during the pandemic when before wages and home prices started to skyrocket and the measure will be artificially lower.\n\nAn even larger component of the 40% than actual rent is owners’ equivalent rent of residence (OER).\\*\\*The methodology is beyond the scope but basically because BLS considers homes investments rather than consumption so uses an indirect metric rather than asking about actual expenses like maintenance or **mortgage rates (which are rising and not captured)** or taxes. I'm going to defer to a group of economists much smarter than me to explain. One is Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary, Chief Economist for the World Bank, and President of Harvard. This research is supported by multiple others and I will post a longer lit review if enough interest but probably suffice to say this is solid research by world leading scholars with no obvious interest in manipulating markets or selling anything and much more helpful than whatever equity research department at Goldman says.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795)\n\n>\"\\[Last year\\] home prices have jumped by 19.9 percent according to Zillow.

While we may say headlines about airplanes fares (only 0.5% of the CPI) we forget that 40% of core CPI measures direct and indirect rents over a year ago and won't capture any decreases until 2023 at the earliest. For this reason, it is my view that the Fed will be under pressure well into next year to continue to raise rates and push markets further down to eventually mean revert to pre-pandemic levels.**\n\nIn fact, JPOW said just yesterday “It’s not a time for very nuanced readings of inflation” and the priority will be getting “very high” headline inflation (ie core-CPI) down. I take that as him meaning the Fed won’t be very concerned about why core-CPI remains elevated even if partly due to very stale data for its largest input and could continue increase rates faster (ie 50 bs during all FOUR remaining meetings this year and continue well into next year… the market is currently pricing in less with the Federal Funds rate currently at 1% and the 2 year at 2.58%). \n\nSo what to do?\n\n**C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me aka Delever)**. Even if the scenario of a Fed being more Hawkish than currently priced somehow doesn't pan out the risk-reward profile of markets at present is not favorable in my view. **Keep a lot of cash on hand**. Even if you're still convinced GME is the greatest thing since sliced bread, keep some cash. **Remember that high beta growth stocks are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates since their valuation depends in part on very far out csh flows that need to be discounted to present at a higher cost of capital.**\n\nAlso **consider hedging**. Put options might be an obvious play but also consider (and I usually hate ETFs) an ETF that is short ARKK or SOGU (which is short SPACS) or an ETF short emerging markets (which tend to get hit even worse than the US when rates rise quickly) or an ETF short the US housing market on a forward basis... not 16 months delayed like the CPI. Not for the faint of heart but you can also follow the Fed in selling treasuries by buying a fund that shorts them.\n\nAnd **diversify**. Sounds like boring boomer advice and the energy trade has become crowded but the energy sector and underlying commodities remain attractively priced in my view. Yes you would have ignored me 6 months ago and that \"would have been the time to buy\" but with PEs of 10s and low price to book and sky high dividends and buybacks this sector remains attractive in the face of rising inflation for the next few years until everything gets sorted out.

New workers are more expensive, so whatever hiring a company might be looking to do is harder.

You have been posting about this for years and know much more about it than I do.\n\nI’m very curious to hear your thoughts on some lingering questions:\n\nFirst this is what I understand:\nBLS estimates price indices for tenant rent and OER used in BOTH the CPI and the PCE but the CPI and PCE assign different weights because they're meant to capture different constructs\n\"In the housing survey, the BLS collects the prices of 50,000 residences through personal visits or telephone calls. If a housing unit isn’t rented but is owned by the resident, they use what is called the owners’ equivalent rent: the BLS finds what it would cost the owner to rent a similar place and uses that as the price for housing instead. Since rentals do not change frequently, the rent of each unit is sampled every six months, allowing the BLS to survey more houses overall.\" https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/06/28/how-does-the-government-measure-inflation/\n\nQuestions:\n1) Let's say I entered a lease in December 21 and I was included in the BLS sample in May 22 and Nov 22. I see how the data could be delayed by five months (lease price in Dec 21 included in May 22 survey) or even 11 months delayed (lease price in Dec 21 included Nov 22 survey) but wouldn't this average to a 6 month delay across samples assuming everyone had 12 month leases and leases were evenly distributed across months? \n\n2) Now assume I own my home and were also surveyed in Dec and May \"Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence (OER) is based on the following question that the Consumer Expenditure Survey asks of consumers who own their primary residence:“If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?” (https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cMMMB0TI3QIJ:https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/owners-equivalent-rent-and-rent.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari) If I noticed rents were going up wouldn't I answer this question based on present knowledge in real time? How does OER become time lagged?\n\n3) This part is very confusing to me: \"Since this price is not observed, the BLS uses statistical techniques to infer OER using rental prices for similar units in the area.In particular, the estimated average OER value is determined by a linear regression of imputed rents on property value, income, and number of rooms from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Once again, this procedure is done for all units, not just newly signed leases or newly purchased houses to the rent index, and for the same reasons, the estimated OER will therefore lag spot prices.\" (https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795\n) Which is it? Is OER based on survey response to Consumer Expenditure Survey as in Question 2 or alternatively is it based on statistical matching to similar units in the area? If it's based on matching to similar rental units, it would seem on average delayed by 6 months but why do several authors conclude it is delayed by over a year?\n\n4) \"Current house price growth is most strongly correlated with OER inflation 16 months later (https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824). Does this mean that even though the information in the BLS survey is on average from leases 6 months prior, the authors empirically found the strongest correlation at 16 months? Is this simply an observation and not due to a delay in reporting?\n \n5) \"As part of the upcoming annual update of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) and subsequent revisions to the industry and regional accounts, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is planning to implement improvements in source data and the methodology for annual current-dollar estimates of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) of housing services on tenant- and owner-occupied housing for the period 2002–2020.\" \"Results from the annual update of the NIPAs will be released on July 29, 2021, and results from the annual update of the IEAs will be released on September 30, 2021.\" (https://apps.bea.gov/scb/2021/05-may/0521-housing-services.htm) Is this a one time annual report that is backward looking and separate from monthly PCE releases?\n\n**Thank you very very much for helping me make sense of this.**\n\nEdit: Also came across this which confused me further. https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.361.7359&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nMeasured Rental Inflation Lags Reality by Three Months. One un- usual feature of rents compared with other prices is that the typical rental unit experiences a price change once a year. Thus, if the price inspectors were to check on a given unit every month, 11 times out of 12, the answer would be the rent hasn’t changed. So BLS price inspectors collect data on rents only every six months from a given unit. The current monthly rate of rent- al inflation is then calculated as the average rate of inflation of the units surveyed in that month. One mea- surement problem shows up immedi- ately: The actual rental price increase at these units could have occurred any time over the past six months, but the increase is included in the index as if it had occurred in the past month.3 3 The monthly inflation rate is taken to be the monthly rate that would compound to the six- month change.
