To get reliable data I will not just randomly select people. I will make sure to spread my sample over different socio economic backgrounds, age groups and geographies. That helps too. Also the survey is only the starting point. Statisticians will review the results and compare them with hard figures like sales of an item.\n\nNobody ever claimed the CPI was perfect.
