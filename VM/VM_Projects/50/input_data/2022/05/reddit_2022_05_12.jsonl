It’s a difficult thing to do. Luckily there are ways to improve data. First, the sample size. No, I have not met the typical person, but if I talk to several thousand people I might get a better idea. Secondly, the selection of the sample. To get reliable data I will not just randomly select people. I will make sure to spread my sample over different socio economic backgrounds, age groups and geographies. That helps too. Also the survey is only the starting point. Statisticians will review the results and compare them with hard figures like sales of an item.\n\nNobody ever claimed the CPI was perfect. In fact the Fed agrees and chose to use the PCE. Same concept. Different basket. There is no right or wrong. Any index has flaws. Doesn’t mean they are useless.
