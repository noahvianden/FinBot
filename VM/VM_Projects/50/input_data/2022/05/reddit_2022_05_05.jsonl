Though it is odd to see Musk and Wood being the ones raising it. \n\nI was reading a lawsuit regarding collusion in a particular industry (can't disclose more details) and concerns regarding antitrust issues. The industry reps were arguing that there were multiple major companies \"competing\" so there was no monopoly or basis for antitrust (despite embarrassingly blatant evidence of collusion). However, it was alleged that just 10 hedge funds held a combined-majority stake in each of the major companies of said industry. So while there was a perception that the major companies were competing, these handful of hedge funds were steering the companies to collude and work together via their trade association, reducing competition. While healthy competition would be in the best interest for consumers, it is not for these 10 hedge funds.\n\nTo put it differently, antitrust laws prevent anticompetitive practices and monopolies within and industry so no single company becomes too large. But I am unaware of any protections to prevent a few large investment firms from collectively obtaining a controlling position for each major player in an industry.  \n\nBlackrock alone owns 7.2% of ATT, 7% of Verizon, and 7.6% of sprint (quick search, please correct if I am wrong). The top 10 shareholders for each of these companies predominantly consists of the same handful of hedge funds. This can obviously lead to a conflict of interest if 10 firms coordinate to steer all of the major companies in an industry. \n\nMusk has probably faced frustration and concerns because he likely needs to persuade a handful of major hedge funds whenever voting on anything at Tesla. \n\nWhile businesses like restaurants face healthy competition, industries like airlines, telecoms, insurance, health care, eye glasses (look it up), etc have seen less and less competition over the past decades through consolidation. This is a possible explanation why US consumers have higher phone, tv, health care costs than the rest of the world with less choices and competition. \n\nThe example I cited are obviously over-simplified and much more can be said. This is just to illustrate examples which may be concerning.
