Surprised they were granted a patent on this as its fairly obvious. Seems functionally equivalent to just quantizing to a lower precision.\n\nEdit: having skimmed the patent and figures I'm still surprised this survived examination. Floating point numbers already use exponent-mantissa typology so the structure is not novel in any way.  Here is researched published a year prior to the filing date that used the same exact data structure also in a machine learning application: [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Representation-of-low-precision-floating-points-used\\_fig3\\_323429756](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Representation-of-low-precision-floating-points-used_fig3_323429756)\n\nBasically what you are doing with this technique is trading precision for range. You have a certain number of bits to represent each number and those bits can either be used to represent precision or to represent scale. A traditional 8-bit number for example could represent values between 0 and 255, -127 to 127, 0 to 12.7, etc. You can either get a wider range or more precision with the bits you have. This Tesla patent and the other example are basically saying that more machine learning, range is often more important than precision, so you can devote a greater number of bits to range and a lesser number to precision. In the example they give, you have three bits for precision (representing numbers between 0 and 7), and four bits for range (the exponent, which can be up to 15). As such, your range can be up to 7X10\\^15 but you only have a single integer between 0 and 7 to work with. So if you wanted to represent the number 15,357, you'd have to round that up to 20,000 which would be represented as 2x10\\^4.  You are able to represent a very wide range of numbers with a much smaller number of bits, but you sacrifice a lot of precision as a result. This is good for machine learning because usually you are dealing with strong or weak filter activations that don't need very much precision to propagate properly.\n\nWhat I can't figure is how this fairly obvious approach got through the patent office.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "From personal experience, patent clerks are usually pretty sharp- albeit understaffed.

While I agree the supporting claims are hardly novel to any computer scientist or engineer intimately familiar with IEEE 754, these specific encodings are not what Tesla is claiming to invent. The important claims are specifically 1,12, and 15, which tell us this is a specific *hardware patent* covering vectorized MAC (multiply-accumulate) matrix operations that perform mixed-format operations on \"biased\" floats to address bottlenecks for CNNs outlined in previous referenced patents- some of which predate the article you linked.\n\nOnly way to invalidate it down is to find some prior art, such as a demonstrated microprocessor that actually performs this operation- not an academic whitepaper that handwaves the implementation. AFAIK, no publicly known TPU or GPU had previously advertised the ability to configure bias via FP bit-level encoding (outside of changing word sizes). But I've only been reading public whitepapers on low-level GPU (and TPU) hardware features.\n\nIn other words, you have it backwards- this is not obvious. On the contrary, this may be too narrow as to be defensible outside of Tesla's specific application- perhaps too specific to be defensible against any potential competitor today, such as Nvidia or Mobileye.
