I believe the market as a whole is not sleeping on gold miners especially since they did well during the 2008 recession.

Gold is a safe haven against uncertainty, and it will continue to keep value while we pump trillions into the economy, generating further inflation. It's noteworthy, though, that gold is used in both high-end electronics and jewelry.\n\nOver the next year, I believe gold miners will outperform the market. The reason being, that the price of gold itself is near a multi-year high, and at current prices, many miners will do very very well in terms of profits and profitability.

Wait until earnings and watch it trade up as a result, just like deliveries).  Tesla only needs to double deliveries once to likely fill in its valuation.\n\nTesla will more than double revenue with doubled deliveries as prices have gone up, model s sales were basically nothing before the release of the refresh near end of 2021, and demand is leading to premium model sales first, with doubled revenue it could likely triple earnings, which would give it a forward P/E of near 30.   \n\nIt is possible tesla will deliver 2M autos this year, more than doubling revenue, potentially tripling profits, and filling in its current price.

Wall Street Says It’s Worth 100 Times Earnings.\nT￼esla stock traded above $1,200 a share early Tuesday, putting it close to its all-time high of $1,243.49. As the stock rises—it soared by double digits on Monday—expect more debate about how to value shares of the EV leader.\nWall Street, for its part, appears to believe the stock (ticker: TSLA) is worth roughly 100 times Tesla’s per-share earnings. That is about 10 times more valuable than stocks of traditional auto makers, but it seems about right, based on one valuation methodology. \n\nIn premarket trading on Tuesday, Tesla stock was up 0.6% at $1,206.95, while futures on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up about 0.3%, though both the broader market and the stock later lost ground. In late morning, Tesla stock was down 4.3% at $1,148.32 , while the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. \nThe shares gained 13.5% on Monday after the company reported that it delivered more than 308,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, roughly 15% more than the roughly 267,000 Wall Street expected.\n\nAt $1,200 a share, and with about 1 billion shares outstanding, Tesla is valued at about $1.2 trillion—an eye- popping valuation, especially for a car maker. \n\nThe price is about 130 times the relatively outdated Wall Street consensus forecast of about $9 a share in 2022 earnings. Ford Motor stock (F), by comparison, is valued at about 11 times, while General Motors stock (GM) is at about nine times. \n\nBehind the gap is the fact that traditional car companies like Ford and GM haven’t grown the way Tesla is expanding now in many generations. Tesla’s delivery volumes rose about 87% in 2021. \n\nMore deliveries at Tesla means more earnings. And as Wall Street has responded to Tesla’s latest news on deliveries, disclosed Sunday, the consensus call on 2022 earnings has gone up by about 20 cents a share over the past couple of days. The  average forecast for Tesla’s stock price, meanwhile, has increased by about $20, to roughly $863 a share.\n\nAn increase of $20 in the target for the stock price for 20 additional cents in per-share earnings is a multiple of 100 times—a rule of thumb investors can use in tackling the novel challenge of valuing a rapidly growing car company. \n\nSimply plug in the consensus call for 2022 earnings estimates and multiply by 100. By that logic, to justify the $1,200 price Tesla would need to earn $12 a share in 2022. The current consensus estimate is $9, but the figure is based on part on forecasts that are out of date: Not every analyst raises estimates at the same rate, or in response to every tidbit of news. \n\nEarly this past year, analysts expected Tesla to earn about $4 a share in 2021, but the actual figure is likely to come in at more than $6. Earnings estimates rise when things are getting better, as they have been for Tesla lately. \n\nThe 2021 experience makes a per-share profit of $12 look possible. If Tesla hits that number, it would represent growth in earnings of roughly 100%. At a stock price of $1,200, the price/earnings ratio would be 100 times. Divide that by the growth rate, at 100%, and you get a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of about 1.  \nThere is no right PEG ratio: What figure makes sense depends on the company, the industry, and the growth rate. But a PEG of 1 isn’t all that excessive. The PEG ratio of the Russell 1000 Growth Index is roughly 2 to 3 times. \n\nWhatever the multiple Tesla trades for, investors can be sure bulls and bears will debate it. Investors can also be sure that the stock will go higher if the company manages to keep beating delivery estimates by double-digit percentages, as it did in the fourth quarter. \nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-price-record-valuation-51641306889", "score": -9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Posts like this make me even more bearish.

Unfortunate how the market performed while I was gone*\n\nThe stock market sank on Wednesday, pressured by a sell-off in technology stocks, as market participants digest the Fed’s latest meeting, which suggests an interest raise hike could happen ‘relatively soon’. As a result, growth stocks and technology stocks harshly pulled back. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a fresh intraday record high in the morning before slipping in the afternoon to close lower.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.92%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -3.07%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.03%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -3.39%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -5.35%\n* Roku (ROKU): -11.72%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.96%\n* Microsoft (MSFT): -3.89%\n* Alphabet (GOOG: -4.51%\n* Rivian (RIVN): -11.22%\n* Block (SQ): -8.21%\n\nThe meeting minutes from the Fed’s December monetary policy meeting suggest the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation.\n\nThe meeting minutes said, “Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.\"\n\nMoreover, the minutes said, “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”\n\nHere is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)\n\nTreasury yields jumped to build on gains after moving sharply higher on Monday and Tuesday, which had added pressure to technology and growth stocks. The benchmark 10-year jumped to a 9-month high following the release of the Fed's meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon.\n\nScott Kimbal, Co-Head of Fixed Income for BMO Global Asset Management said, “Yields are moving sharply higher ... or in the very recent past, but they've been stubbornly lower when you compare them to what the inflationary talk has been. There's been lots of discussion about runaway inflation, the Fed being behind the curve. All of that would translate into a long-end — the 10, 20, 30-year portion of the yield curve — that's a lot steeper, or materially higher even in absolute terms than it is right now.\"\n\nThis morning, market participants digested a fresh upbeat labor market report, which showed private payroll gains handily beat estimated for December. ADP, a leading data processing company, that private-sector employers added back 807,000 jobs during the final month of November,  well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 375,000 and the November gain of 505,000.\n\nHiring was broad-based, though leisure and hospitality led with 246,000 new positions. Trade, transportation, and utilities contributed 138,000, professional and business services increased by 130,000, and education and health services added 85,000.\n\nWhile service-related professions led with 669,000 new hires, the goods-producing side also showed strong gains with manufacturing rising 74,000.\n\nNela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, said “December’s job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicron’s impact had yet to be seen. Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.”\n\n[https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx)\n\nFollowing the ADP release, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the December nonfarm payrolls count to 500,000, a 50,000 increase from its prior estimate.\n\nAs I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins raising interest rates. Now that the Fed seems to be accelerating its timeline, it’s time to reassess. While I think the pullback the last two days is overdone, I do think market conditions are shifting. I remain bullish in the long-term but expect a lot more choppiness compared to the last two years. Trades should be quicker, with tighter profit targets and stops.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Omicron variant continues to surge across the US, with the country once again recording a new record high. On January 4, the US reported 885,451 new coronavirus infections, more than tripling the peak of any of the previous surges.\n* Ford Motors (F) stock recently jumped more than 10% after the company announced it planned to double production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck.\n* Ford also reported sales for 2021 fell 6.8% compared to 2020 but had a very strong fourth-quarter, a sign that demand could begin to pick up. Ford sold 508,451 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 27% increase over the previous quarter\n* Meta Platforms (FB) has ceased development of a new VR/AR software operating system that employed more than 300 after four years. Meta quickly issued a statement via Gabriel Aul, its vice president of Reality Labs Engineering. \"There are several technical directions we're pursuing in our efforts to build the operating systems, we're still working on a highly specialized OS for our devices - we remain very much invested in this work and continue to dedicate the resources necessary to build this.”\n* GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told the annual CES technology conference via video on Wednesday that the electric Silverado will launch in two stages in 2023.\n* WarnerMedia’s HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers through the holidays, defying the slowing pace of growth at some rival services. HBO ended the year with 73.8 million subscribers to its streaming service and namesake cable network, up from 69.4 million in September.\n\n“*Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.” - F.
