{"title": "Do you guys think I should stay involved in my company ESPP during current bear market?", "selftext": "We have a standard employee stock purchase plan at my company. Basically, they buy stocks at the cheaper price (initial start date or purchase date) and you get a 15% discount on top of that. The initial date is June 17 and the purchase dates is each 6 months. So December and then the following June. My first year is about to come to an end and I donâ€™t know whether I should contribute as much for the next 12 months with how things are. I currently do the max 15% of salary contribution. \n\n\nDo I keep the ESPP plan or do I keep the cash myself and wait a bit to invest or dollar cost average each month? As it is right now, itâ€™s basically waiting every 6 months to invest and Iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s ideal in the current market where things can change so quickly.
