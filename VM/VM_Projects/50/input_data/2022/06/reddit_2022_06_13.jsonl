{"title": "Stock plunge puts S&P 500 on track to enter a bear market: What investors need to know", "selftext": "The S&P 500 on Monday was on track to confirm what many investors have been saying for months: The large-cap benchmark is in the grips of a bear market. Stocks suffered sharp losses Monday after major benchmarks saw their worst week since January. Much of the weakness was attributed to the Friday reading of the May consumer-price index, which surged to 8.6% year-over-year — a 40-year high. Investors fear the Federal Reserve will have to raise rates even more aggressively than already expected, risking recession in their effort to tame inflation.\n\nA close below 3,837.25 would mark a 20% pullback from the S&P 500’s Jan. 3 record finish, meeting the traditional definition of a bear market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 SPX, -3.14% was down 3.3% at 3,772 in recent action.\n\nThe S&P 500 briefly traded below the bear-market threshold in May, but didn’t close below it. Stocks subsequently bounced, but the rebound has since given way as recession fears have increased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.24% dropped 740 points, or 2.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.86%, which slumped into a bear market earlier this year, was down 4%.\n\nTo be sure, many investors and analysts see a 20% pullback as an overly formal if not outdated metric, arguing that stocks have long been behaving in bearlike fashion. And note, that if the S&P 500 were to close below the threshold, the start of the bear market would be backdated to the Jan. 3 peak. A bear market is declared over once the S&P 500 has risen 20% from a low.\n\nHow have stocks behaved once a bear market has been confirmed? \n\nThere have been 17 bear — or near-bear— markets since World War II, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in a May note. Generally speaking, the S&P 500 has fallen further once a bear market begins. And, he said, bear markets have, on average, lasted about a year, producing an average peak-to-trough decline of just shy of 30%.  Beyond the averages, there’s a lot of variability in the length and depth of past bear markets. The steepest fall, a peak-to-trough decline of nearly 57%, occurred in the 17 months that marked the 17-month bear market that accompanied the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The longest was a 48.2% drop that ran for nearly 21 months in 1973-74. The shortest was the nearly 34% drop that took place over just 23 trading sessions as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a global rout that bottomed out on March 23, 2020, and marked the start of the current bull market.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/s-p-500-threatens-to-open-in-bear-market-territory-what-investors-need-to-know-11655121858?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/s-p-500-threatens-to-open-in-bear-market-territory-what-investors-need-to-know-11655121858?mod=home-page)", "id": "vbf08s", "created_utc": 1655134719.0, "score": 175, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 54, "comments": [{"body": "I am almost certain the March 2000-November 2002 Bear Market was longer than the 21 months in 1973-1974.

Today marks the first official time since the COVID crash that SPY has closed in a bear market. Closing at officially -21.8% on the day. \n\nNot only that but this is the first time since December 1995 that SPY has closed with back to back gap downs. However, these gaps are about 5x bigger than the gaps back in 1995. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5rv41eu0ng591.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c8c6777ae7545bb439f91cd6c0e0fa7a84e9693\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2z00an91ng591.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=693a4be1335b775b79eb2af8224e0ebd980025ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikesu8z1ng591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=34b7fb3201f9fa345cbeffd78f1bd3fe038af8de\n\nIf we are going to bounce I think this is a pretty darn good spot for it… I highlighted 5 blue arrows (one is today) all 5 of those besides the middle one for May 12th bounced off the same support line. Today that support line was at 373.3 and we rejected pretty hard there to bounce back to 375 for our close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hy9yyi2ng591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b7ec86f49dc379a225be49c4763f06534ced1f7\n\nGap wise we now have a Gap from 401.44 to 395.78 (1.43% or $$5.66) and a gap from 389.75 to 381.81 (-2% or $$7.94). Perhaps someone else can speak on this but I have never seen a gap that big or back to back gaps this big every on SPY. The question now is will we fill these gaps? My thoughts are yes we will. But when I am not sure. The first gap is about 4% from todays close and the 2nd gap is about 7% from todays close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tm0tx13ng591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6799204162e75125f79a9e6e7fb6e8c5437d5fa8\n\nThe VIX today had a massive 12% move intraday. The VIX has in the last 3 trading sessions gone from a low of 23.82 to todays peak at 35.05 for a total 3 day move of $11.23 or 47% upward move. That’s a hell of a lot of volatility and new fear entering the market. \n\nSo what I am seeing (this is the daily VIX chart here) is that the VIX broke the most resistance may/ June resistance line and now is using the January to present resistance line. We failed to reach it today which would have been 35.64 intraday. We did break above the 34.8 resistance of the tan channel, however, we were quickly rejected and unwound to close near 34. If you look back almost everytime we break this level on VIX we are immediately swatted down and touch 30-32 the next day. We also have a massive VIX gap (not quite as amazing or consistently filled as SPY gaps) but I suspect that 29.7 VIX level to be filled. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0lt2el3ng591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b98f17025ad007065910a3710e44eb48e191c1a5\n\nThe weekly chart is actually the most impressive because we actually have the $7 gap displayed on the weekly chart. I imagine this will fill this week but who knows with this market. I wonder if anyone can speak on whether or not we have ever had a weekly gap. \n\nBut you can see we hit just near support today with the weekly support being closer to 371. We also have a massive falling wedge on the weekly which if we get a support bounce we might get a bounce back near 407 next week. \n\nOverall what I am expecting is for us to break up and close tomorrow somewhere near 385 to maintain the 15min red channel on SPY and then we will end up with VIX near 30. I suspect that Friday and todays massive red days were the markets officially pricing in the expectations. Now that the market has priced in the 75bps I suspect we are going to see a slightly green day tomorrow with a range boundness. There is also a case we see a small rally into FOMC. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jdcgfc4ng591.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=a661266f5270d3b6c8b5821733c1ce53906b93c3\n\nIf you look at the last 3 FOMC meetings there has been 2 of the last 3 very green (both were the last two) and the March one was 2.2% green. And both of the last two FOMC meetings were majorily green days (most movement came intraday though after the hike and presser). \n\nI suspect we see a similar pattern. Today before the WSJ put out their piece on the 75bps expectation around 230pm markets were arguably starting to find support at 377.3 and were looking like it could see and EOD short covering breakout. However that was quickly slapped down. I think we find support for now and see this 373 level as support for the rest of the week personally. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI played two swings overnight both did not go well. I planned and really wanted to hold calls overnight tonight for an expected rally tomorrow but I know that with premiums being absolutely ridiculous today I would need to see a pretty large 1%+ move pre market to really get paid out well. I went with UVXY puts instead and I think we will see the VIX unwind nicely tomorrow. \n\nIntraday today there really wasn’t much to trade after 1015 and I just was mostly of a watcher today. Remember on days where things seem to good to be true or we just don’t have strong conviction we do not have to trade. We have about 250 trading days a year we don’t need to trade them all. Just like we don’t need to trade every breakout or breakdown. Wait for you setup and capitalize on the move. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89f48ty4ng591.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac9b4996751e928bf92f760eb96c393b649d7eb9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ybkywdi5ng591.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=acc89139c7403d39170cb86dffcf9a267dcb77cf\n\nIntraday I made about 60% of my daily goal but with the swings I had a red day today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ekqfo16ng591.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a4d957f46f32d356ea279bdd89b4440ba1b1bd", "id": "vbnl4b", "created_utc": 1655157391.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|195|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1787|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ur9t1w/51622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spxvil/spy_210_the_bear_rages_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uyxorz/52722_spy_pre_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skp8ci/24_spy_recap_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/us0d0d/51722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rj1up5/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v23784/53122_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v9jfp2/61022_spy_weekly_review_fomc_analysis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v6ewtr/6622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5w3m/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyng6s/buy_the_rumor_sell_the_news_hear_me_out_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/riyt4w/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v2sj0k/6122_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v7clxo/6722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdhxd/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v3mubg/6222_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v82mas/6822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgqp0q/spy_dec_14th_recap_and_dec_15th_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v48yk1/6322_spy_weekly_ta_and_analysis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthl4s/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthspd/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ux4ri2/52422_spy_daily_ta_fomc_minutes_prediction/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vbnl4b/61322_spy_daily_ta_and_fomc_anticipation/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vbnl4b)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vbnl4b)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "spy puts tmrw🫡", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Too expensive to open puts with IV where it is right now, went with SH.
