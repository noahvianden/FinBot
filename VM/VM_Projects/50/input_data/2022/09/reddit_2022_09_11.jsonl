It seems like these strategies center around high probability trades and managing losses.

I want to practice getting into and out of real trades, experiencing things like slippage and managing all that.\n\nShould I wait for the market to calm down before starting?

You’re probably going to make similar mistakes when you start but the biggest mistake you can make is staying out of the market entirely in your early earning years. \n\nVolatile environments are great for selling options because of the added volatility premium. But that’s not “free” money, you’re absorbing the risk for someone else so there are big swings in portfolio performance and it takes time to understand how that can impact your decision making.\n\nEarly years imo are for understanding your decision making and it’s a life long process of improving it. It’s an active process and non linear.\n\nI’m partial to the wheel over spreads because it’s less to manage and the risks are more straightforward. \n\nThere’s never an ideal time to learn so I’d just get after it and treat the 3k as tuition.

{"title": "CPI Analysis and my Trade Plan", "selftext": "It twas the eve of the eve of CPI release… When all through the houses the bears and bulls were preparing. The puts and calls were bought, lottos and longs together. The bears hoped for a big miss, in hopes of avoiding a fat lump of coal. The bulls hoped for a soft reading, in hopes of starting the santa rally early. The bears and bulls nestled themselves all snug in their beds… with visions of lotto wins dancing in their heads. \n\nNote- this is a revised and updated CPI document… I deleted the previous one as a lot has changed and I felt like it was a disservice keeping that one up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itf2lpw7fbn91.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4f8e29373bbf9b49e0c5b2e03ec669bdacdfd5c\n\n**Previous CPI trends and data analysis**\n\nOf the last 8 CPI days.. we have seen SPY open up red 5 out of 8 times and of those 5 times 4 out of the 5 times have been >1% red. Of the 3 out of 8 times that have been green two have opened less than 1% green and one opened 1.8% green. \n\nOf the last 8 CPIs the two days before CPI releases is averaging a total drop from open to close of  -0.75%... however, if we look at the last five CPIs (April, May, June and July) we are averaging a two day drop of -2.19%.\n\nNow when we look at the previous CPI we must look at the way the markets sentiment of CPI has changed. Markets used to see CPI as a big scary thing with no stopping or slowing insight. Even worse markets used to not know how the fed would react to CPI readings with their rate hikes or if there was a potential for a fed pivot. \n\nWith the fed being clear in continued rate hikes (clear on 75bps regardless next) the markets in my opinion care less about what CPI will actually be. I believe instead of seeing a April, May, June and July red we are about to see a big green much like August CPI. \n\nComparing the last 5 CPIs which averaged a 2 day drop of about -2.19% to the last CPI which had a drop of only 0.52% over the two days… when we look at Fridays (which was day 1 of 2 before CPI release) we already put in a 1.55% green day. \n\nOf the two days before CPI dating back to march this is the biggest green day (individually) dating back to March. \n\n**Intraday movement the day before CPI**\n\nThe January 11th, February 10th, March 9th and August 10th (days before CPI) were all considered flat days. However, When we look at the four CPI days (April, May, June and July) all four of them have had pretty significant dumps from about 1pm to close. If you had bought puts around 1pm almost all four of these days you would have ended up extremely profitable. \n\nThe average drop of those four CPIs from 1pm till EOD is 1.425% with the smallest being 0.8% in April and the most being 2.3% in June. \n\nIntraday puts are almost certainly the play once the morning chop is over… only if there is a bigger 1pm sell off that starts, however, when we look at the last CPI on August 10th if the sentiment is still bullish going into CPI we might not see the sell off. \n\n**What will CPI be? Are we bullish or bearish?**\n\nIf we look at July to August releases of CPI we saw a decrease from 9.1% to 8.5% for a total drop of 0.6%. Now the very interesting thing about Augusts release is that this was the first time we saw the forecast and the consensus differ from each other. Not only that this was the first time we had seen the consensus be revised to a lower number prior to the release of CPI (it was edited just under a week before hand). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7g9bbmp8fbn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0716f198f2fa3765346313d66fcabaac45389fa5\n\nWhen we look at the current projection for consensus/ forecast of CPI you can see its currently rated at 8.1%. Now the significance of this is that these reads did not come out till Thursday and Friday. The odd thing about this CPI is that the markets had no idea what to expect for CPI this weak. My opinion has changed on why. \n\nWe were in a 4 week long sell off (it ended last week officially with the 3 green days to close the week). I had initially interrupted the fact that consensus and forecast were unavailable, JPOW Jackson hole speech (and his Thursday Q/A) along with the fact that literally every single fed member has said and continues to say “inflation has not peaked” that they were purposefully withholding the CPI consensus and forecast to as close to CPI as possible to prevent a June sell off, however, no I view it differently. \n\nLets objectively think about the market for a second here… I know its hard but lets do it together… What does the market care about? They care about KNOWING ahead of time what is going to happen and then when that thing does happen they care about it being the SAME as they expected. Markets want to naturally go up. It takes a great deal more of effort to cause a sell off in the market then it does to cause a rally in the markets. The markets do not care about the economy, the world, you, me, your mom, your brother, Joe Byron, the queen, no one… it gives no fucks… its like Switzerland its neutral. \n\nSo when you realize that and you look at things from that perspective you can change your idea of what to expect next. Yes 8.1% inflation is dogwater and that sucks when you look at the fact that inflation is out of control… but markets already know this… and it doesn’t really effect the day to day of the markets. Even looking at earnings over the last two quarters where inflation has been 1%+ higher then current inflation… earnings were still pretty okay. If that didn’t drop earnings what will? My point is… markets need a NEW reason to sell off and I don’t think they have it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puocgt89fbn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe4aafe3d68b1b87d4cbfff3bfeaca1add4ecaf\n\nWhat did JPOW say during his Jackson Hole speech and did he say during Thursdays Q&A? There is going to continue to be aggressive rate hikes regardless of what the CPI rating is. They will NOT make the same mistake the previous feds have where they stopped rate hikes too soon. So here is a scenario to chew on… If the markets have already priced in 91% chance of a 75BPS hike and it would be pretty unlikely that inflation would increase high enough without the consensus/ forecast catching it… What if regardless of what CPI comes at markets STILL rally? Why? Because does CPI really matter in the grand scheme of things? Honestly no it doesn’t (to the market) all this number does is tell us what the fed is going to do rate hike wise which DOES actually matter to the markets… So if CPI comes in over 8.5% does it really matter? We are getting a 75bps hike regardless… Think about it… \n\n**Why did they hold the consensus/ forecast for so long?**\n\nThis is where I go back to the psyops of the markets that always seem to surround CPI. Remember the rogue leaked CPI report that called for crazy high inflation in July? When that report hit all the algos tore the market apart and sold us off. What this did was “reset” the algos and when inflation came in high BUT less then the fake report the market rallied intraday. \n\nSo this is my conspiracy theory psyops of why they held off. If you see that article above and if you have looked at the put/ call ratio for the next 30-45 DTE people are beyond jacked to the tits with puts. I mean heavily heavily invested in puts… Most of that OI has been put back on in August/ September with this 4 week sell off. In my opinion the markets were already running too hot and it wouldn’t have been sustainable for us to really hit 440s then have a good CPI to then hit ATHS. That would be pretty crazy and is what would have happened based off that rally we had… markets sold off on purpose on the idea that CPI was gonna break us. Look at the media for the last month the media all of a sudden became the doom and gloom patrol. Everything was the bottoms not in, we aren’t gonna see ATH, this bear markets gonna be a bad one, the crash of 2008 is coming, etc. etc. etc. That fueled this sell off and now its being tacticfully slowed by that bullish consensus/ forecast (purposefully lately added to trap EVERYONE deep in puts). Remember the market is good at wrecking the most people at once. There is no way they are going to let all that crazy high put OI expire ITM… \n\nI believe CPI comes in bullish we rally, FOMC drops that 75bps hike and we rally till end of October till earnings start. \n\n**So whats the play? How am I going to play CPI?**\n\nRemembering like FOMC I trade off the data I have analyzed and what the highest probability risk to reward is…  \n\nIf we were to see the president or the feds front run CPI with a presser I would feel even more confident in puts and a bigger CPI miss. Historically whenever the president or feds step in to front run CPI release the day before (so that’s tomorrow Monday) its cause its gonna be hot hot hot! IF we have radio silence tomorrow for Biden we are good to go. \n\nNow if you follow my TA you know I was hella bearish last week but im riding that sweet sweet bull train. \n\nTaking previous CPI (since its really our only big green open to analyze properly). April did open a 0.71% green but its nothing like the big CPIs which are 1-2% +/-.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrbg8nx9fbn91.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fef56db1d7dadfd28df7f168eea1f94e64a3c7d\n\nDon’t worry DD did the work for you on what the best option to play is IF you want the best risk to reward…. So assuming your treating this as a TRUE lotto… which means it’s a VERY small sized position compared to normal… then statistically speaking the SPY 0dte 5 strikes OTM bought at 414pm (or just before close) would be the bigger reward at nearly 300%. Now mind you we don’t have enough data to really get an average as we only have one big green open (but I expect another one). \n\nSo the interesting thing about this CPI is its being released on a Tuesday… so that means there are NO 0dte SPY options so we would be left with a 0DTE SPX contract. That 0dte SPX contract did received quite a bit less reward then the SPY 0dte counter parts (peculiar and intriguing). Just for reference I did a 10strike OTM SPX call also and it only rewarded about 296% which is still less than the 0dte spy 5strike call. \n\nNow keep in mind… IF you are wrong you are going to get WRECKED with anything OTM. Yes the CPI release IV pump will help some but being that Tuesday is the release and I will utilize SPX I would stick to more of a 3OTM call vs going crazy out of the money…\n\n**My current Game plan** \n\nAssuming the feds don’t surprise us with a front run of CPI tomorrow and CPI comes in bullish this is my plan for CPI and FOMC (FOMC analysis and trade breakdown will be posted next weekend). \n\nMonday September 12th around 414pm= Buy 3strikes OTM SPX Call\n\nTuesday September 13th within the first 5 minutes of opening= sell call (regardless of profits)\n\n\\-One could do a stop loss or trailing stop here but with the volatility I don’t like my odds of a fill and would rather realize gains then take a chance of getting wrecked.\n\n\\-If I am wrong and CPI dumps us if there is anything left on my call I will sell immediately\n\n\\*wild card play\\* Wednesday DTE calls bought Tuesday before market close to hold till FOMC expecting a big green move.\n\nTuesday September 20th= calls going into the night before FOMC (more details to come on this) \n\nWednesday September 21st= sell calls at open \n\nWednesday September 21st= buy calls after the FOMC presser begins (more details to come) \n\nNote- if obviously im wrong on CPI here and the market does tank us on CPI then I will be revisiting all of this. The one thing that I am nervous about though is a massively green day tomorrow (Monday). I would like to see a red day honestly. A green day tomorrow would be the 4th green day in a row and while yes we can of course do 5 in a row and especially do 5 in a row on a big news day that would leave less upside reward. A red day small or big tomorrow would give me even more confirmation bias. \n\nGood luck… be a smart degent!", "id": "xbxaze", "created_utc": 1662939468.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "First paragraph is a winner.
