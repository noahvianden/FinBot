Where do you think?", "selftext": "# The Bears\n\n**1. Ray Dalio: Expect a 20% sell-off in the stock market if rates keep rising.**\n\n\"With inflation well above what people and central banks want and the unemployment rate low, it's obvious that inflation is the targeted problem, so it's obvious that the central banks should tighten monetary policy. Everything will flow from that,\" Dalio said on Wednesday.\n\n\"I estimate that a rise in rates from where they are to about 4.5% will produce about a 20% negative impact on equity prices,\" Dalio said.\n\n**2. Scott Minerd (Guggenheim CIO): A 20% decline in the S&P 500 could happen by mid-October.**\n\n\"It's really stark to see the price-to-earnings ratio where it is... given where seasonals are, and how far out of line we are historically with where the p/e is, we should see a really sharp adjustment in prices very fast,\" Minerd said last week.\n\n\"It appears people are ignoring the macro backdrop, monetary policy backdrop, which would basically indicate that the bear market is intact. We may very well already be in a recession... with YoY core PCE now at 4.6% and S&P 500 trading at \\~19x, we should see stocks fall another 20% by mid-October,\" Minerd said.\n\n**3. Jeff Gundlach (DoubleLine Capital founder): The credit market suggests both the economy and stock market are in trouble.** \n\n\"The action of the credit market is consistent with economic weakness and stock market trouble. I think you have to start becoming more bearish,\" Gundlach said on Tuesday, adding that he agrees with Scott Minerd's call that stocks can fall 20% soon.\n\n\"You always want to own stocks, but I'm a little on the lighter side...buy long-term Treasurys, because the deflation risk ‚Äî in spite of the fact that the narrative today is exactly the opposite ‚Äî the deflation risk is much higher today that it's been for the past two years,\" Gundlach said. Gundlach believes the Fed should hike interest rates by just 25 basis points next week.\n\n# The Bulls\n\n**1. Tom Lee (Fundstrat founder): Inflation has already peaked and that means you should buy stocks.**\n\n\"Even for those in the 'inflationista' camp or even the 'we are in a long-term bear' camp, the fact is, if headline CPI has peaked, the June 2022 equity lows should be durable,\" Lee said on Friday.\n\nAugust's higher-than-expected CPI report \"does not mean stocks have to break below the June lows,\" Lee said, as he reiterated his view that S&P 500 will rally more than 20% to new highs by year-end.\n\n**2. Jeremy Siegel (UPenn Wharton professor): Inflation is falling and whoever wanted to get out of stocks already has.**\n\n\"It seems like everyone that wants to be out of the market is out, and everyone that wants to be tactical is short. Therefore the surprises are going to be to the upside... when everyone has sold, only the buyers are left, and the shorts are exposed,\" Siegel said on Monday.\n\nSiegel said if the Fed says rates will be higher for longer, \"That would be a policy mistake. I think they're going to look at the economy, and I hope they understand what the statistics are and what on the ground inflation is.\" \n\n**3. Marko Kolanovic (JP Morgan Chief Global Strategist): The stock market will rally as inflation resolves itself.** \n\n\"Given the lag it takes for rate hikes to work through the system, and with just one month before very important US elections, we believe it would be a mistake for the Fed to increase risk of a hawkish policy error and endanger market stability,\" Kolanovic said on Monday.\n\n\"Our expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus, and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,\" Kolanovic said.", "id": "xhcyfh", "created_utc": 1663496193.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "It‚Äôs almost like CEOs and analyst go on TV and pump their positions.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Precisely.

{"title": "How Europe Burns Wood to Remain Carbon Neutral! Wait... What?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2il0j6oiclo91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=998e027f2f5eb1f79a774634d18a730a46a5e1bb\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note - this a Twitter thread that I have compiled here as one long note. The original tweet is** [**here**](https://twitter.com/DoombergT/status/1571063488860286977?s=20&t=YbYCMu0OZIloBGe9G4v1aw) .\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, Britain plunged into an energy crisis. At the time, the primary source of energy driving the British economy was heat derived from the burning of wood, and Britain was literally running out of trees. As the supply of wood dried up, its price began to soar and inflation set in, compounding the problem and spreading it to all corners of the economy. With imports from continental Europe insufficient to close the growing supply gap, the resulting crisis was dire. \n\nAnd then they discovered coal. Well, they didn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù coal ‚Äì it had been known for centuries that coal could be a useful fuel ‚Äì but they did learn that coal could replace wood in many important applications. They also recognized that they had a lot of it. **With a higher energy density than wood, coal is a superior fuel that enabled meaningful improvements in the British economy. Trees could be preserved for construction purposes, homes could be more efficiently heated, and companies could leapfrog their competitors**.\n\nIt is now well understood that the wide adoption of primary fuels with high energy density enables a better standard of living. Transitioning to higher density fuels is something that usually occurs spontaneously in an economy unless politicians interfere. It took little encouragement from the British government for its economy to realize the benefits of coal over wood ‚Äì the inherent advantages of the material and the phenomenon of creative destruction were sufficient.\n\nIn another example, the history of propulsion technology at sea is marked by a completely sensible journey up the energy density ladder. **Wind power gave way to coal, which was displaced by diesel, which ultimately gave way to nuclear technology in military vessels. Given this, it might surprise our followers to learn that the European Union and Britain are incentivizing a return to the primitive concept of burning wood for energy on a massive scale**.\n\nNot only are they going back to the future, but they also claim doing so is carbon neutral (spoiler alert: it isn‚Äôt, not even close). **Nearly 40% of Europe‚Äôs so-called renewable energy is currently obtained by combusting wood, much of it coming from forests in the US**. In a farce so perverted and obscene that it can only be the work of bloated and arrogant bureaucracies, **a carbon accounting loophole is causing huge amounts of CO2 to be pumped into the atmosphere today that will take decades to abate using natural means**.\n\nAll across the US Southeast, massive industrial feller bunchers are cutting down and stacking mature trees with ruthless efficiency. **The resulting logs are loaded onto trailers and hauled by diesel-powered trucks to wood pellet factories. Once there, the logs are milled, dried, and pressed through specialty extruders at high pressure, all of which require significant primary energy and raise local pollution issues. The resulting pellets are transported to coastal ports where they are loaded onto cargo ships. The diesel-powered cargo ships make their way across the ocean, emitting CO2 along each of their several thousands of miles traveled. Once in Europe, the pellets are burned, emitting more CO2 per unit of heat generated than any other fuel source currently used at scale**.\n\nWe are meant to believe THIS process is somehow carbon neutral. **The loophole that enables this orgy of deforestation boils down to how and where emissions are counted. In the current framework, burning wood is zero-carbon at the point of combustion. From the perspective of Britain and the EU, the wood pellets they burn were immaculately conceived ‚Äì the manner in which the pellets arrived at their power plants is not relevant to their carbon emission calculations**.\n\nBy burning ‚Äúcarbon neutral‚Äù wood pellets and decreasing their use of coal, **European environmentalists get to brag to the rest of us about what wonderful stewards of this shared planet they are, all while being among its worst offenders. Further, the fact that mature trees sequester huge amounts of CO2 compared to newly planted saplings is ignored**, making the premature death of that generation irrelevant to the political calculations of environmental impact.\n\nThe time value of carbon emissions does not matter to the European environmental elite, despite their repeated hand wringing about how urgent the carbon crisis is, what little time we have to reduce emissions, and the devastating consequences of not acting immediately. **Studies show that the burning of mature US trees absolutely overwhelms the carbon impact of all electric vehicles ever sold in the UK**. All the economic sacrifices made in the name of minimizing our impact on the climate are turned into a mockery by this one insanity.\n\nTo the credit of some 800 scientists from virtually all disciplines, serious efforts to reverse course have been made. In 2018, a letter was penned that accurately pointed out the environmental bankruptcy of the current biomass accounting policy. They were ignored. Back in the US, publicly traded companies like Enviva are rushing to meet Europe‚Äôs virtually insatiable demand for ‚Äúcarbon neutral‚Äù wood. There‚Äôs lots of happy talk about responsible forest management, good corporate citizenship, low-impact supply chains, and so on. **Enviva recently announced it is expanding into Germany. On its last earnings call, the company‚Äôs CEO proudly announced the signing of the first in a series of agreements with a German utility operator.**\n\n**Germany ‚Äì a country proactively shutting down nuclear power plants despite suffering a massive energy crisis ‚Äì is back to burning wood for power on an enormous scale. For the planet, of course. You could not make it up if you tried. A single pellet of uranium fuel no bigger than your fingertip provides as much energy as a ton of coal (and certainly even more wood)**.
