{"title": "Zero DTE Double Ratio Spread - The Batman - Infinite Money Glitch", "selftext": "Hello Thetagang!  Apologies in advance for the glib title - and the length of this post - but I hope to demonstrate a potential strategy of the highest quality.  I would appreciate both positive and/or \"constructive\" feedback from the gang.\n\nTypically, the type of 0 DTE strategies I've seen are both pretty sus - they are either:\n\n1. \"OMG premiums on OTM Puts on \\[Garbage stock x with 500% IV\\] are through the roof for tomorrow!!\".  No good.  There's a reason (or many reasons) why premiums are high, and, as we learn over time, it's better to avoid this type of setup.  People often reiterate here that Theta strategies and/or the Wheel specifically should only be run on quality underlyings that you would like to own.  Not the meme junk.\n2. While not always ZERO DTE - often 2-3 DTE instead - there are other strategies that typically involve selling a far, far OTM Put Credit Spread.  I forget his handle but EarlyRetirementNow and others featured on his blog have used this strategy, and typically it involves collecting a very small credit against a very large max loss for an index like SPY or SPX.  So no meme stocks, but these strategies have major risk anyways - like risk $1,000 in collateral to collect $35 in premium.  You have to scale it up to levels that a major move against you is going to hurt.  Not saying this can't be a successful strategy, but (1) it requires large amounts of capital, (2) it requires a fairly extreme tolerance to risk - and the ability to tolerate heartburn - because a small credit can turn into a big loss when the market moves against you.  It relies on picking up lots of small credits that over time are greater than the sum (infrequent but major) losses.\n\nI've also played around a bit with strangles and/or straddles on 0-3 DTE options, but it always feels so much like running the razor's edge, at any time you could swing to a 200-300% loss, which you either have to eat with a stop-loss or let it ride and hope for the best.  Also not great.  There's huge gamma risk, little upside and massive downside.\n\nI present to you instead a 0 DTE strategy that converts the characteristic of having so little time until expiration from a risk and liability to an asset: **the Double Ratio Spread, aka The Batman**.  This is not as simple as The Wheel and may sound fairly complicated to the noobs out there.  But it's really just a naked strangle plus two debit spreads (one PDS, one CDS) - which ultimately has a much better risk profile than a similar short strangle.  Allow me to explain and walk through various points of consideration.\n\n# The Setup\n\nHere's how it might set up today, using pre-market options pricing on SPY (2/7) - using \\~**$449** as the approximate ATM price (which is changing due to pre-market trading, but best kept static for this explanation).  Note that I drafted this prior to market opening so obviously the prices have since changed.  **\\*\\*\\* ETA: The Below Numbers have been updated to shortly after market open using my trade this AM.\\*\\***\n\n**Ratio Spread 1 (Call Side):**\n\n* ~~But One Near-ATM Call: $451 strike = debit of $1.18~~\n* ~~Sell Two Slightly-OTM Calls: 2x $453 strike = credit of .59x2 = $1.18~~\n* But One Near-ATM Call: $451 strike = debit of $1.00\n* Sell Two Slightly-OTM Calls: 2x $452 strike = credit of .67x2 = $1.34\n\n**Ratio Spread 2 (Put Side):**\n\n* ~~But One Near-ATM Put: $447 - debit of $1.96~~\n* ~~Sell Two Slightly-OTM Calls: 2x $445 - credit of .1.33x2 = $2.66~~\n* But One Near-ATM Put: $447 - debit of $1.09\n* Sell Two Slightly-OTM Calls: 2x $446 - credit of $0.80x2 = $1.60\n\n**Net Credit Received: $0.85 (\\*updated)** \\- all from the put side in this example, as the call side credit is equal to the debit.  This is particular to the example I chose, but in general the put side credit is greater than the call side credit - although the call side credit can be there if setup that way.\n\n**Max Profit**: The credit received *plus* the max profit potential from the embedded debit spreads, which would occur if the SPY price moved right to one of your short strikes (e.g. $452 or $446), and results in your debit spread achieving max profit but without incurring any ITM losses on your short options.  Since our Debit Spreads are each $1 wide, this is a $100 max profit for each.  SPY can't ultimately land at BOTH $452 and $446, so you can only win on one debit spread (in theory - but see below).  Thus, $1 + $.85 = $185.  **(\\*updated)**\n\n**Max Loss:** Technically unlimited, as you are holding an uncovered call at $452 strike (about 20 delta) and an uncovered put at $446 strike (about 30 delta).  I didn't take the time to make this completely delta neutral, but you could slide the put side strikes down one each to make it close.  As I will show with trade management, my theory is that this trade can be managed to effectively reduce or entirely eliminate losses.\n\nBefore moving on, I think it would be helpful to compare and contrast this Double Ratio Spread/Batman as against a regular Short Strangle.  *Compare*:\n\n**$452 call / $446 put SPY Short Strangle** \\- e.g. just selling 1x short put and 1x short call at the same strike as the short strikes in the above - also at 0 DTE.\n\n* Total credit received =  $147.  **(\\*updated)** (The Batman collects *less* upfront credit in exchange for *greater* max profit from the embedded debit spreads).\n* Breakeven = $444.53 on the put side, and $453.47 on the call side.  (Batman has Better Breakevens at $444.15 and $453.85).  Thus the Batman has about $.38 more cushion on both sides.\n* Max Profit = $147 for the Short Strangle vs. $185 for the Batman.\n\n**So far, this has just been a basic comparison as between a double ratio spread and a short strangle - so what is the benefit here of going to 0 DTE?**  It's all in the way it allows you to manage the trade, without having to go overnight.\n\nIt's might useful to think about how a regular Short Strangle (for any DTE) might perform in practice.  Often, what can happen is that the credit received/initial trade price very quickly moves against you and becomes more expensive to buy back immediately after being sold.  Sell at $192, but then the trade price moves to $204 and then $225 and on and on, never providing you an opportunity to buy back at a profit.  So we have to wait, and hope the price to buy back the trade goes down (whether it be hours in the 0 DTE context or days in another context).  Or we roll.  Even if the trade does return to profitability, the waiting extends the trade time (and ultimately reduces ROC).  The worst case scenario is that the Credit Received (e.g. $192) is the lowest cost of the trade - e.g. it never get better.  You are never in the 'profit zone' and instead left in the loss zone, wondering whether to close out the trade for scratch, for 1x loss, 2x loss, 3x loss, etc.\n\nIn comparison, the Batman/Double Ratio Spread has a \"profit zone\" on both sides of the current share price - at each ear on the Batman.  Which means that, before moving to a net loss, the trade ***must*** necessarily move past one of the Long options and through a zone where the entire trade can again be sold for a credit - adding on to the initial credit received.  I call this \"**The Gauntlet**.\"  (Yes I like the naming of things).\n\n# Gap Risk\n\nSo where's the risk?  It's all about dat gap.  The risk is that the share price shoots either up or down, past your short strikes, past your breakevens, before the trade can be closed for a further credit (on top of the initial credit) when one of the Long options is ITM.  We can *avoid* the Gap Risk by doing the following:\n\n1. **Using only 0 DTE**.  By going to 0 DTE, we can eliminate or reduce the biggest (only?) risk in the Double Ratio/Batman - the gap.  Most gaps occur overnight.  When the market bell opens, the share price could have jumped past your short strikes, past your breakevens and put you at a loss - without ever having the opportunity to close your trade in the profit zone aka the Gauntlet.  The only way for the trade to run the Gauntlet and for you not to be able to close for additional credit would be with an overnight gap.  But with 0 DTE, we avoid this overnight \"gap\" risk.\n2. **Using only highly liquid indexes (and not stocks)**.  I'm talking SPY/QQQ and nothing else.  (Even better, if you can support it, would be SPX for the 5x weekly expiries, and all of its other benefits).  There is a risk with any single company that the share price could gap heavily.  What if Elon Musk got pulled over for a DUI at 12:45pm?  TSLA is going to gap down, hard, as soon as the market makers sniff the police radio.  In contrast, even on very red or very green days, it would be extremely unusual for a broad index to gap in a way that skips 3-4 strikes in a matter of seconds.  If you look at daily graphs, these indexes might swing 5 points over the course of 20-30 minutes when moving particularly violently.  Outside of a \"Putin Nukes Kiev\" type scenario, I just don't it happening where it just gaps - but if it did, we'd be up the same shit creek without a paddle as if we had sold a \"regular\" short strangle, or a short put.\n3. \"**Stop Loss**\" **order** \\- We can set up a stop loss order (sometimes called a stop profit order, since it locks in your losses) but unlike a stop loss order on a Short Strangle (or short put), rather than Stopping our Losses at 2x or 3x the initial credit received, the Stop Loss order for this trade is actually a \"**Keep Profit**\" order.  We set up a BTC order right after opening the initial trade, to collect an *additional* credit when closing the trade - e.g. a portion of the ITM debit spread, if the share price moves past one of our long options.  Typically, a ratio spread would be managed at 50% of max profit - e.g. 50% of the initial credit received *plus* 50% of the max profit from the debit spread.  Here, we close for profits before we have to stop for losses.\n\n# Fill Risk\n\n**One other risk: Getting an order fill.**  We've got 6 total options here (2 long, 4 short) so getting an order to fill may be difficult.  How difficult?  I'm not sure.  This risk can be mitigated in part by using highly liquid indexes and near ATM options, which are just a few pennies wide at most and typically have Volume in the tens-of-thousands.\n\nBut we can go even further to reduce this fill risk:  Setup the \"Stop Loss\" or \"Keep Profit\" orders *separately* for each side of the ratio spread - so two closing order.  This cuts down on the total number of options needing a fill at one time from 6 to 3 (so the same difficulty level as filling a single ratio spread).  It also allows us to - potentially - \"double dip\" the max profit without incurring any additional risk.  It would be possible (although not likely) for the underlying to move one way, e.g. to move our Long Put ITM, allowing us to close at 40-50% of the max profit on one of the debit spreads, and then later in the day to swing to our Long Call to ITM, allowing us to close the other debit spread at 40-50% of profit as well.\n\n# Trade Management\n\nWait for the first 5-10-30 minutes after market opening to allow the algos to settle down.  Then  try to very closely pin the underlying share price with long options that are close enough to the current price that we can still sell 2x short options 1-2 strikes further away for a net profit.\n\nImmediately after entry, enter two closing orders, one for each ratio, at approx. 40% of the width of one of the debit spreads (each of which should be the same size) - rather than at 50% of max credit.  Since the profit target is only a portion of the max profit on each side (e.g. max being 100% of the width of the debit spread), we should be able to get a closing order fill *before* the share price has an opportunity to move beyond our short strikes and past our break even.  This is because, as the share price moves past the midway point in your debit spread, you're actually selling it back for less than market value.  E.g. the debit spread will move to 75%, while you have a closing order to sell it at 40%.  Eventually the debit spread moves to near 100% profit, and you've still got an order to sell it at 40%.  The share price keeps moving, past your short strikes, and your profit from the debit spread starts to reduce by the amount your uncovered short strike is now ITM, but it hasn't yet hit your breakeven.  It's coming down the mountain - or down one of the Batman ears.  It's still at 75% profit, now on the way down, and you've still got a closing order to try to fill at 40% profit.  My reasoning here - by setting up a closing order for 40% of the max profit of the debit spread, we leave cushion to give back $0.10-$0.20 on the fills for the other legs.  At some point - either on the way \"up\" or on the way back \"down\" either Batman ear, it *should* get a fill, even with a fast moving market, because some algo is going to snap up the closing order and bank the money you left on the table in exchange for giving you a fill.\n\nFinally, there's no additional risk in closing just one side of The Batman - so long as you close the entire ratio and not just the spread - since you will no longer have any exposure to that side.  For this reason I think it is preferable to close out (either one side or the entire trade) as an entire ratio and not just as a spread, *and* to close out prior to max profit.  This is obviously open to improvement - maybe 50% of max spread profit, or 75% of max spread profit, is better for the closing order.\n\nNote that the more typical way to manage a ratio spread is at 50% of max profit - which would be necessarily *higher* than merely 40% of the debit spread max profit.  I am adjusting this slightly for the reasons discussed above related to fill risk.\n\nFurther, note that if by some scenario the share price does gap past your shorts, there is always the option to roll out and roll up or down for additional credit, because this is ultimately an undefined risk trade.  Doing so would collect additional premium and further improve our breakevens and give us some more time - but would obviously destroy the 0 DTE aspect here and make us vulnerable to overnight gap risk.\n\n**Gamma Risk**: This trade takes gamma risk - which is a problem at less than 21 DTE and is massive at 0 DTE - and uses it as an advantage.  When the share price moves from OTM with respect to one of your long options, to make one ITM long option - you experience a massive change in value since gamma is working in your favor.  If the share price moves even more, past your short options and your breakevens, you are now in the same position with respect to gamma risk as you would be on a regular Short Strangle at 0 DTE - e.g. massively exposed.  But again, since the share price must run the Gauntlet before you feel any pain, first gamma works to your benefit before it hurts you.  We simply have to close out before gamma changes against us.\n\n**Most likely scenario**:  Assuming that the underlying share price stays range bound, within our Ratios and never moves one of the long options ITM (or not ITM enough), we just set a closing order to buy back the trade at the end of the day for a small debit, e.g. $0.10-0.20.  So we close it out and repeat.  $69 initial credit (minus $10 for close and avoid pin risk = $59) on the approx. $6,500 margin requirement (Noting that I have Portfolio Margin) isn't massive but works out to an insane annual rate:  it's about a 1% return on margin for the day, which if replicated 3x per week and 50 weeks per year is an insane 136% annual return.  That's without considering (i) 5x weekly options on SPX and (ii) the possibility of selling the trade for further credit.\n\n**Theta:**  Since in this trade we are net sellers or premium, theta works in our favor.  Specifically, theta is equal to the credit we receive when opening the trade - in this case, we are net 69 theta - the entire credit since we are at 0 DTE.  In practice, it's a bit less than that, because we will close out a range-bound trade for a small fee to buy back at $0.10-$0.20 before the end of the trading day.  In comparison, a more typical short strangle at 30-45 DTE and at reasonable deltas might bring in something like 25 theta for SPY.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn summary, I think this 0 DTE strategy has significant potential - but please note I am *not* experienced in trading this strategy!  For now it's merely a thought experiment: essentially it's a Short Strangle (which I have traded fairly often), with much better risk profile.  In exchange for a slightly lower initial credit, we get: greater potential max profit, wider breakevens, and, in theory, a potentially bulletproof \"Gauntlet\" of profit from the embedded debit spreads, which should allow us to close the entire trade (or one-half the trade) at an additional credit / further profit before it ever incurs a loss.  In most scenarios, this trade just collects less initial premium than the Short Strangle - assuming that neither long option moves to ITM.  That's the price we pay for greater potential profit. But we also get, at least in theory, by operation of the long strikes and BTC orders - the ability to avoid losses entirely - which is worth much more than simply reallocating premium vs. max profit.  Yeah, it's a hassle with all the moving parts, and each leg is going to cost some fees to open and close (if you pay fees).  Is it worth it?\n\nI now invite your responses.  How realistic is it to assume that we can get a 3-option ratio order to fill *before* the underlying rips past our shorts, given a highly liquid index like SPY or QQQ?  **Is there any other risk I haven't considered here?**\n\n**(\\*updated) - I revised the numbers in the Setup using actual trade numbers after market opened rather than pre-market prices.  After revising the numbers, the same arguments hold true - the Batman has better BEs and greater max profit than the Short Strangle (but the benefits are more muted than with the premarket numbers).  However, these benefits are not the main reason to setup a trade in this way - the main reason is to setup the profit zones where the trade can be closed for further credit, which zones the index must pass through on its way to busting your short strikes and breakevens.**", "id": "smuqcj", "created_utc": 1644252539.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds retarded can’t go tits up.

Ratios are also generally considered a viable strategy even though there are 3 trades to open and close. This is essentially 2x ratio spreads, so if a single ratio spread can be profitable not withstanding the fee drag, then 2 ratio spreads should also be profitable notwithstanding the fee drag. \n\nBut, I think it's worth considering whether the trade would be better off using just one ratio spread and picking a direction.  If SPY moves the other way, the initial credit is collected without the chance for collecting further credit.  In the example (the trade I ran today), only the put side collected initial credit and the call side was a scratch.

But hear me out.\n\nWe all know, MSFT proposed to acquire ATVI at $95 per share before FY 2023. However, ATVI is current locked below $80 for extended period of time. There’s only one single reason for such huge price difference, the fear of regulatory intervention. \n\nFrom a financial point of view, the biggest all-cash acquisition certainly guarantees antitrust investigation. Even more so if you only consider the console market, as US personale usually do. But if you know gaming industry, as most apes do, it’s easy to conclude that the deal will ultimately go through without much fuzz, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The post acquisition Microsoft will only be the third biggest gaming company across all platforms behind Sony and Tecent. \n2. Gaming industry is highly fragmental in nature. The combined revenue of Microsoft and Activision are only in the middle teen of the whole gaming market including console, PC and the fragmental mobile gaming. \n3. Microsoft has promised to honoured all past cross platform deals. Antitrust based on pure speculation doesn’t holds water.\n4. An argument could be made in the metaverse angle. But let's be realistic, no way FTC or the justice department could capitalize on something that no one knows what it is. \n    \nIn conclusion, there’s no real antitrust angle. The deal will go through. Worst case scenario, the deal break. Still not a big deal since ATVI at $79 is running at 24 PE, compared to their main competition's 60 (EA) and 36 (TTWO).\n\nThere isn’t any yolo potential.
