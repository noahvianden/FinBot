{"title": "Market is bouta do a pumpfake on you nerds and TSLA is gonna be leading the charge.", "selftext": "Listen up Tards, \n\nEveryone knows interest rate hikes are right around the corner. .25% or .5% hike next month isn't going to matter in the long run. The market seems to be expecting interest rates to finish the year somewhere between 1-2%, with another couple of rate hikes in 2023. It's no secret the Fed will have trouble hitting 3% much less 4% interest rates before the start of 2024, and ultimately I don't think that will happen. The Fed can't finance it's 30Trilly debt with interest rates that high. If so, we would go full Volcker and have positive real interest rates, but cmon now let's not get ahead of ourselves. \n\nWith that out of the way, we are also starting to see a flattening of the yield curve. That coupled with the consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan coming in at 61.7 instead of the expected 67.5, the lowest it's been in 11yrs it's not looking great. If inflation eats away at your salary that can't outpace inflation you will end up buying less, and that's what we're starting to see. \n\nThis points us towards a looming recession around the corner. While no one including me knows how long that will last, the Fed won't want to go into it with near-zero interest rates. Therefore we are going to get the interest rate hike we expect, but sometime in the next 12-18 months, the Fed will have no choice but to lower them again and put the market and economy back on crack. Expect this dip to be short, and don't be the Tard who sat on the sidelines during March of 2022. Get your good deals in while they last. \n\nNow one might ask \"what's the best way to invest during a high inflationary period?\" Great question. Let's ask the professional Tard who does this for a living: Buffet. He describes companies that generate large cash flows, deep moats, have pricing power over their competitors, and software companies that don't require a lot of upfront capital to generate profits. \n\nEnter Tesla... Let's go back to inflation real quick and how auto fits into that. Used auto prices are up abt 40%ish yoy and new cars are still up in price and don't show any signs of coming back down soon. On top of that gas prices are through the roof. Month over month consumers have to do more and more mental gymanistics to go out and buy an ICE vehicle. Through this mess Tesla emerges with no demand problem in site, while they continue to outpace their own 50% delivery growth comfortably. Tesla grew deliveries 80something% yoy in the midst of a chip shortage that still did affect them. With the chip shortage hoepfully subsiding later this year, how will that afffect Tesla? On top of all this they increased their gross margins throughout last year. This is the pricing power you want a company to have in a high inflationary environment. Also, now for the most devisive part sorounding Tesla: fsd beta. While I don't think beta will be necarsily better than a human by the end of the year, I think were a lot closer than most expect. Fsd beta revenue will be pure profit to Tesla's bototm line, which is what you want during inflation. \n\nBuT tEsLa'S pE iS 180! Well I believe Tesla will prob do abt 12$ in eps this year at a minimum which equates to a PE ratio a little over 70 at todays price. How does that number change when a comapny continues to grow it's earnigns at 50+% a year? Tesla is dirt cheap if your investing horizon is longer than 5yrs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: Fed can't raise rates for long with a recession aroudn the corner, and with inflation showing no signs of slowing you must invest in productive companies with strong balance sheets, pricing power, and deep moats. \n\nPosistions: TSLA", "id": "ssl19b", "created_utc": 1644871933.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 55, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|28|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ssl19b)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ssl19b)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Are you a 🌈🐻, or just exceptionally retarded?", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "My mom did call me special soo...", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Your mom also called me special", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) tesla is trading at 875 you retarded bulls are insane and I love it keep retardin up in the free world", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Right?
