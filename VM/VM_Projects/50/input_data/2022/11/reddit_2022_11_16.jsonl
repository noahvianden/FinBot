{"title": "Economist Nouriel \"Dr. Doom\" Roubini says crypto is an ‘ecosystem that is totally corrupt.' Do you agree?", "selftext": "Outspoken economist Nouriel Roubini described crypto and some of its major players as an “ecosystem that is totally corrupt.”\n\nOn a panel hosted by CNBC’s Dan Murphy at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week on Wednesday, the New York University professor said there were “seven Cs of crypto”: “Concealed, corrupt, crooks, criminals, con men, carnival barkers,” and finally, Binance Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, who spoke on a prior panel at the same conference.\n\n“The lesson of the last few weeks is these people should be out of here,” Roubini added. CNBC has contacted Binance and Changpeng Zhao for comment.\n\nRecent turbulence in the crypto market has seen the collapse of one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, FTX, with the revelation of highly risky and unsustainable borrowing and lending by the company and related investment funds.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has plunged below $17,000 for the first time since 2020, and some fear the contagion could spread to topple other major players, such as Crypto.com. The CEO of the company has denied this.\n\nBinance has repeatedly centered the story around FTX, with the company initially suggesting it would buy its failing rival before pulling out of the deal.\n\n“I can’t believe that CZ and Binance have a license to operate in the UAE. He’s banned in the U.K., he’s under investigation by U.S. Justice Department for money laundering,” said Roubini, who was nicknamed “Dr. Doom” for his prior pessimistic forecasts, including a prediction of the property market crash in 2007-2008.\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/crypto-an-ecosystem-that-is-totally-corrupt-says-nouriel-roubini-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/crypto-an-ecosystem-that-is-totally-corrupt-says-nouriel-roubini-.html)", "id": "ywssel", "created_utc": 1668603861.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 57, "comments": [{"body": "It serves as a fantastic platform to separate people from there money.\n\nHowever, all of that noise only strengthens the idea behind Bitcoin and holding truly incorruptible money. \n\nMany people start out in \"crypto\", read for 2 years, and end up only in BTC, on a decentralized hardware wallet only you can access... after some sweet losses in the general crypto space likely haha.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I mean, here we are on r/StockMarket. You don't buy stocks with Bitcoin, do you? You don't exchange anything for Bitcoin besides dollars. Bitcoin has no true obligation behind it.

You need the debt of the government and banks, to pay your taxes if nothing else, whereas you don't need Bitcoin because there's no obligation behind it, no credible use of force. It is designed to be solely an asset, and in doing so, mistakes many of the FEATURES of money (exchangeability, fungibility, store of value) with the VALUE of money, which comes from the issuing authority. And since the issuing authority of Bitcoin is, in a sense, the people who hold the tokens, the value of Bitcoin lies in what people will give in exchange for Bitcoin. And no one is obligated to give anything. So the entire thing rests on faith and speculation; on the hope or conviction that someone, someday, is going to give me something in exchange for this token.

As an investment good, it is outclassed by all kinds of assets that have actually intrinsic value - they are useful or productive in their own right, not just as a means of exchange, like farmland or shares of a company.\n\nIt's also pretty funny to me that you apparently need to study 100 hours and read four or five books in order to understand and use crypto. It didn't take me a hundred hours to learn how to use real money, or computers, or the internet, or ChatGPT, or any of those actually revolutionary technologies.

No surprise there - after all, contrary to your assertion, the only way BTC will be widely accepted as money is if everyone can be convinced to use it. The fact that people have poured a bunch of money into something that they speculate people will want in the future, does not give that thing intrinsic value.\n\nThe element of coercion is a key part of what gives money value. The USD has value precisely because the gov forces us all to use it. Of course I can understand why anyone might not like that from an individual perspective - just as no one personally likes paying taxes, and indeed, it is precisely the tax obligation that forms the base of demand and therefore value of the dollar, as economists and monetary experts have been explaining for more than a century. We couldn't have property rights without a government forcing people not to take your stuff; we can't have public police and firefighters and teachers without the government forcing us all to pay for them.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "USD has no intrinsic value.

Good luck friend", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that USD doesn't have intrinsic value, totally. It's value is not in anything that it can do for you itself, but its value in exchange. Having said that, the dollar is debt. It's something that the government owes you. And the government promises (some would say, forces) us to redeem USD in payment of our OWN debt - the tax obligation. There are many other ways besides that in which the government encourages or coerces us to use its various forms of debt. This creates a basis of demand, and therefore value, for the dollar.\n\nWhat's the basis for demand for Bitcoin, or any crypto? Mostly it comes from people speculating that they will be able to trade it for dollars in the future. Some will argue that they are holding on to it for the day when everyone accepts it - but until that day comes, it just isn't a real form of money for most people. It just isn't used a means of exchange. For the most part, the only thing you can reliably exchange it for is fiat currency.\n\nThat's enough to give Bitcoin value. If someone offered me Bitcoin for goods or services, I would likely accept it because I have reasonable faith that I could offload it on an exchange (although I would expect a premium for having to go through that hassle). But, for one thing, those transactions are going to engender some taxation, so I will need to acquire at least enough USD to comply with the law. And ultimately, I'm happier to accept USD, despite the fact that it is designed to lose value and doesn't pay interest. Why? Because of its acceptability as a means of exchange.

They have strong leverage in negotiating since workers are for the most part fungible. So they can offer a low pay, and even if one person doesn't want to accept it, another person will. One of the tools in the past against this was collective bargaining(unions), but that has recently weakened a lot and does of course come with its own issues.\n\nThere are of course real issues(such as congress being effectively able to inside trade, and money and power making people more or less able to break the rules and then take a slap on the wrist for punishment), but the real structural issues of the increasing wealth gap are due to globalization and automation. This can be shrunk through regulation and laws, and different countries have taken different approaches to this. The US has been among the more laissez faire, and has been rewarded with large stock returns but at the cost of a huge wealth gap and the social unrest that comes with it. China is even worse with a lot of people working massive hours for little pay, while an elite class get extremely rich. Regulation often does stifle innovation and competitiveness so there's always a struggle to exactly how much to put in. And that competitiveness part is important because there's very little international regulation around now: corporations have the ability to leave a country for another one if their regulations are too tight, so it's not as easy as \"oh yeah, just tell them they can't do that\". New efforts to put in an international corporate tax floor may help a bit with this.\n\nThere's a lot of conflicting stuff in there. There's no single simple solution. I'm not saying globalization, regulation, unions or corporations are inherently bad or good. All these things work with and against each other and every nation has a different idea about how to steer them. There's no simple solution.
