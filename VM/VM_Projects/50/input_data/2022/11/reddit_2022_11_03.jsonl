{"title": "META Yolo Long & Short term thesis", "selftext": "My $META Long Thesis as of today  \\*Meta is $88 and has a June 2015 Market cap.\n\nFirst of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec399ad44901de81c8023e2ea495580e954fe9d\n\n\\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.\n\n\\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.\n\nMETA dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)\n\nFirst of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.\n\n:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4n4swedbtx91.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f8095042e1eea793b164924b1f09779c81176b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.\n\n**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**\n\n1)Instagram reels fully monetized\n\n2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization\n\n3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.\n\n4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.\n\n5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.\n\n**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**\n\nIMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.\n\n1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.\n2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.\n\n3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.\n\n4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.\n\n5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.\n\n6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.\n\n7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.\n\nThese funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d\n\n[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8eyumlcjtx91.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=580994eecdec4c399d2b3772e1f777f973544164\n\nIf the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.\n\nMeta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.\n\nUPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.\n\nTLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.\n\nHope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.\n\nUPDATE Below Shares\n\nFYI I currently have 2250 shares so far about $100 average, I have been DCA in.
