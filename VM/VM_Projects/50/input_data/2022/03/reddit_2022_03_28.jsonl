{"title": "Anyone else notice AAPL is running a little lean?", "selftext": "I just went through their latest Form 10-Q. Their current ratio is 1.038, which is barely passable in my book. For a company famous for having a huge pile of cash, their cash ratio is 0.252. While they have a solid profit margin (28%), their PE ratio calculated off of current price / quarterly EPS on 10Q is 83.2, which is insane to me. Idk, what do you guys think?\n\nEdit: their D/A ratio is 81 percent!!! What happened??\n\nEdit 2: Thanks to u/ticktock1001 for correcting me. It's price over ANNUAL EPS, I was using quarterly EPS, which would make the calculation 4x what it should be.", "id": "tpwlx5", "created_utc": 1648425706.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 50, "comments": [{"body": "It's called asset allocation.\n\nInstead of having cash sit idle, Apple created more shareholder value.\n\n\\#1, the cash was used to purchase marketable securities which as they matured past one year, are no longer considered 'short-term marketable securities.' Apple bought U.S. treasury bonds with them. They also invest in other treasuries across the world. It's not like the cash suddenly disappeared. They're just being used to generate a higher return through other investment vehicles.\n\n\\#2, they increased dividends. Last year, they paid out nearly $15 billion in dividends to investors.\n\n\\#3, last year, Apple spent nearly $90 billion in stock buybacks. The past decade, they spent nearly $500 billion. That's where their money is going to. Buying outstanding shares, creating more shareholder value, and making use of their cash. Their profits are locked up in other countries to avoid corporate taxes. It makes sense from this perspective.\n\n\\#4, Apple gets low interest debt from banks. Lower than the U.S. treasury rate. It's like if you had $1,000 and you can either put it in U.S. treasury for a 5% yield and then borrow the $1,000 from a bank for an interest rate of 3%. Why wouldn't you borrow and then deduct interest expense? That's why Apple's current liabilities have gone up (which will affect their current ratio). They have been borrowing money and using their cash stack for buybacks and marketable securities.\n\nThe thing about ratios is they are formula-based. You need to figure out where the money went and this is why you compare their overall balance sheet and also check their 8-K and other additional info disclosed.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Its honestly amazing to me how much cash they make and return to shareholders.
