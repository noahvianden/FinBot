{"title": "S&P 500 index guilty until proven innocent", "selftext": "Any day now the $SPX 50 day moving average (DMA) is going to crossover below the 200DMA going down into a 'Death Cross'. $DJI went into death cross yesterday and Nasdaq is already in death cross since end-Feb. But $SPX is the mother of all indicators and if it crosses over then we could be here for a while.\nA typical death-cross lasts a few months before the reverse happens -- i.e. 50dma crosses back above 200dma aka the 'Golden Cross'. \nLast time $SPX  entered a death cross was in Spring 2020 but that didn't last long because the Fed printer went brrrr very quickly.  This upcoming one seems more brutal & recessionary given the inflation, Ukraine, rate hikes, oil shock etc. And the Fed printer is turned off. So it could last a while.  The death cross in the 2008 Great recession lasted 18 months and the max drawdown was 53%. The one in 2000 dot-com  recession lasted 18 month and had a 35% drawdown. The average drawdown of all death-crosses from 1950-2020  is 10.37% No one can really predict what will happen but it is always a good idea to have a historical perspective.", "id": "ta84v1", "created_utc": 1646833656.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ta84v1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ta84v1)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lmao death cross deez nuts u fucking nerd", "score": 348, "replies": [{"body": "Haha got em", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Got eeeeem", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Happy to see the top comment be so substantive.

{"title": "Dow rebounds 600 points as rally in commodity prices driven by Ukraine conflict cools off", "selftext": " Stocks posted sharp gains on Wednesday as recently surging commodity prices cooled off while the war in Ukraine continues.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 620 points or about 1.9%. The S&P 500 climbed about 2% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%.\n\nThe bounce came after the market fell for a fourth day on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Dow falling deeper into correction territory and the Nasdaq Composite adding to its bear market losses.\n\nThe market is reacting to an easing in commodity prices that have spooked stocks lately. Energy and agriculture products, in particular, have catapulted higher amid the fighting in Ukraine, while some metals also have posted major gains.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, was last down 4% to around $118, while Brent crude, the international standard, fell 3.5% to around $123.\n\nWheat futures also were sharply lower, falling 6.3% to $1,206 a bushel, though palladium continued its march higher, rising 3.8% to $3,082 per ounce. Silver, copper, and platinum were all lower on Wednesday.\n\n“The equity market continues to take its cues from changes in commodity prices, namely oil,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “Trading will continue to be volatile and rally when prices retreat, but overall the prospect of oil and non-energy prices remaining very high casts a cloud over all the outlook for economic activity and the equity market.”\n\n Certain consumer-related stocks roared back on Wednesday after weakness on fears that higher gas prices would dent consumer spending. Nike rose 6% and [Starbucks](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX) added 3.8%.\n\nAirlines and cruise lines were also higher on Wednesday. Carnival Corp. is up more than 7% and United Air Lines is 7.2% higher.\n\nTreasury prices fell and yields climbed as investors rotated out of bonds after huddling in fixed income for protection amid the Ukraine war. The benchmark 10-year note rose about 3.7 basis points to 1.91%. A basis point equals 0.01%.\n\nBank stocks moved higher as yields rose. PNC Financial was up 4% and Wells Fargo rose more than 5%. Goldman Sachs and [JPMorgan](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM) were 3% higher each.\n\nEnergy stocks were lower on Wednesday following a strong session Tuesday after President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian fossil imports, including oil, in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPepsico shares rose more than 1% after the soft drink giant said it will suspend sales in Russia, though it will continue to sell snacks and essentials such as baby formula. Elsewhere, shares of dating service Bumble soared 37% after it reported profit and expected growth that was much better than Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe major averages all closed lower Tuesday after a day of whipsaw trading. The Dow gave up a 585-point gain to end the day lower by 184 points, falling deeper into its correction. The S&P 500 slid 0.7%, in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2%, after entering bear market territory Monday.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Federal Reserve will manage a soft economic landing, but the U.S. should be able to avoid a recession, according to Ross Mayfield, the investment strategy analyst at Baird.\n\n“The strength of the U.S. labor market, consumer and aggregate corporate sector should act as the weight to keep us out of recession near-term,” he told CNBC. “Overall, volatility is likely to persist, \\[there’s a\\] wide range of outcomes possible in Ukraine, but the fundamentals of the U.S. economy still look decent, especially if the Fed can navigate raising rates without breaking demand.”\n\n [Dow rebounds 600 points as rally in commodity prices driven by Ukraine conflict cools off (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)", "id": "ta9il1", "created_utc": 1646837660.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 57, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|16|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ta9il1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ta9il1)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.
