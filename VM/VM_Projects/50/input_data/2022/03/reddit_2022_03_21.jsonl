{"title": "Most Overlooked Opportunity of 2022 | $VXX", "selftext": "# Disclaimer\n\n>Before I begin, I wish to announce that I'm an experienced volatility trader who specializes in trading volatility futures and volatility ETPs such as $VXX. $VXX is a complicated product and consists of many advanced variables and metrics that most investors are not familiar with, nor suited to trade. Trade these products at your own caution and be sure to read the full prospectus of $VXX [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312512118832/d317408d424b3.htm) before making any trading decisions.  \n>  \n>Feel free to trade this as you please, as all positions hold risk. Opportunity may be present, however, we don't know when Barclays will make the announcement. I'm not a financial advisor. I only wish to state my opinions relative to my personal trades and investments as I believe it offers educational value to those wishing to learn.\n\n\\- VolatilityStreet\n\n# \n\n# Initial Explanation\n\nOne of the market's most popular instruments, $VXX, recently underwent an anomaly of an event that hasn't occurred in over 10 years in the volatility-trading space. **On March 14, 2022,** [**Barclays**](https://ipathetn.barclays/cms/static/files/ipath/press/Press%20Release_03_14.pdf) **announced a suspension of share sales and issuances on the iPath® Series B S&P 500® VIX Short-Term FuturesTM ETNs (BATS: $VXX).**\n\n# Ok, so what?\n\nThe reason that I bring attention to this announcement is as follows:\n\nGenerally speaking, the $VXX is built to track the first- and second-month VX futures on a rolling basis. Barclays, the issuer of $VXX, doesn't actually hold underlying futures contracts to maintain the ETN, rather, it tracks the performance of the underlying futures contracts on a rolling basis. The product that the ETN tracks is known as the net asset value (NAV) or \"indicative value\" of the underlying ETN. Issuers use NAVs as a metric to match their ETN prices to their NAV. Essentially, in order for Barclays to maintain the publicly traded product, they match long and short order flow on their ETNs. For example, if a trader wanted to buy 1,000,000 VXX ETNs in one transaction block, **Barclays will** ***usually*** **issue 1,000,000 shares of VXX to keep the price of the ETNs the same.** On traditional shares of stock, however, 1,000,000 shares of stock in one transaction block could change the stock price due to an increase in demand and a shortage of supply. **Equities, unlike ETNs, do not issue shares of stock for order flow to keep the price of the security at its NAV. Whereas, ETNs generally issue notes to keep the ETN price at its NAV.**\n\n# The breakage\n\nConsidering that Barclays is no longer issuing shares for their $VXX ETNs, long order flows will not result in the issuance of new shares.\n\n*So, what does this mean?*\n\nLet's say you purchase 1,000,000 shares of stock, similar to the equity example made in the last paragraph. The purchased shares are no longer issued by Barclays to keep the price of the ETNs at their NAV. Rather, the **existing market participants must sell their 1,000,000 shares of stock to you**. Due to the increase in demand, **the price of the ETNs will increase past their NAV.**\n\n# Where is $VXX trading now relative to its NAV?\n\n$VXX is trading approximately $3.00 above its NAV (approximately a 12% premium). As more investors purchase $VXX, the share price will continue to rise until authorized participants or Barclays announce the resumption of share issuances. Eventually, however, Barclays will announce the resumption of share issuances, which will result in a fast, and certain, decline back to $VXX's NAV.\n\n[$VXX - $VXX \\(NAV\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/zrhndwnvnmo81.png?width=2724&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f0b39f757d5166aef4786d1240ee77d8c50c67)\n\n# Has this happened before?\n\nYes. On February 22, 2012,  [$TVIX (a 2x leverage front- and second-month VIX futures ETN) experienced a suspension of share issuances](https://www.etf.com/sections/features/11092-creations-of-velocityshares-tvix-halted.html). $TVIX continued to rapidly rise (high of 90%) above its NAV for an entire month before the announcement of resumption of share issuances was released (March 22, 2012). Once share issuances resumed, $TVIX crashed nearly 60% in 2 days back to its NAV.\n\n[Closing Values of $TVIX relative to its NAV](https://preview.redd.it/q03o41ouomo81.png?width=3167&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c04fec51daba23ed9a5443fd12970fe2a1018e)\n\n# How can this be traded?\n\nWell, until Barclays announces the re-issuance of shares, traders could take the long approach and trade the upside that $VXX could experience. After all, $VXX is a volatility product. Volumes generally increase when markets experience volatility. $VXX's value could drastically surpass the current \\`12% premium value given the price discrepancy between its ETN value and NAV. On the contrary, once the announcement occurs, traders can enter short delta trades using the options market, which is generally liquid on a product such as $VXX (may not be as liquid due to the current crisis).", "id": "tiyx5l", "created_utc": 1647822093.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|32 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tiyx5l)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tiyx5l)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sometimes the best trade is to not trade.

{"title": "Cum and get some CUMMINS stock!", "selftext": "Hi everyone, here's my latest bit of TA. Recently I have gotten  into Cummins stock for a couple of reasons. First of all, I know that there was a downgrade on Friday however the stock bounced strong ending the day at a HOD. it bounced on some of the highest volume I have seen for the stock in the past couple years which was weird. The volume was nearly 300% of it's 3 month average volume.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/PF90VOqh\n\nNow for some TA. My analysis for this one is pretty simple, it broke daily resistance on Friday on very large volume. MACD  is bullish and rsi has room to run before it nears oversold territory. Additionally, Dow stocks and industrials in general have been hot during the most recent stock cycle and I predict it staying like this for a little longer. CUMMINS has also had a pretty good earnings recently l. Being a company with low debt, they tend to fair well when people move out of growth and stocks. Despite the crazy rally last week in the general market, I think things still look decent for the short term. Monday may be red so that things have a chance to cool off but it seems that the market is shrugging off the war for the time being. Anything can change but for now this is where I stand with Cummins stock.\n\nAs always, good luck to all this week!\n\nPositions: 04/14 210c", "id": "tizmos", "created_utc": 1647824287.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|64|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgnjkr/blink_is_primed_for_short_squeeze_get_in_while/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tizmos)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tizmos)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "CMI really missed out… could’ve been CUM", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Fun fact: Cummins Engine used to trade under ticker symbol CUM, but traders are degenerates and it got to be too much on the open outcry exchange.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.\n\nBoss: I want CUM!\n\nTrader: in the moth or the ass?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Only the finest trained cock snipers can cum on a moth", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Pew pew", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Almost time...on the edge...about to...shoot to the moon", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I see what you did there", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cummins (engine company) is planing to buy/ acquire “Meritor” who makes axles/ brake assemblies for semi trucks.  \n\n$3.7Billion dollar deal.\n\nhttps://investor.cummins.com/news/detail/552/cummins-to-acquire-meritor\n\nFor those that don’t know.
