Based on that, adjust for time frame and experience.\n\nSome general advise I have been saying for years now (yes even when people were calling me stupid as stocks went up last year); The popular philosophy of taking chances when young is 100% horseshit and only for complete and utter fools.\n\nDont want to go into the big write up as to why this adage is horrible advice (check my history if you want details) but summary:\n\n1. Youre likely still an idiot when starting out so your odds of making good picks are the lowest at any point in your adult life (until you get alzheimers).\n2. The sooner you have a financial foundation (aka nest egg), the sooner you can stop feeling desperate about money.\n   1. You can quit your job and do something you actually like which is more likely to make you both happy and wealthy in the long run.\n   2. Mental health improves. Family life improves.\n   3. And finally, you will have disposable money for gambling since you already have a good retirement anchor to rely on.\n   4. I call this an \"anchor\" portfolio. Something that keeps you safe in a storm. Its basically all about risk mitigation.\n\nWhat young people need to do is stick to low risk initially until they are experts at investing. Not the other way around. Do pick your own stocks (rather than index) so you can learn, but stick to safety.\n\nSo assuming you are fairly new, I sell everything except MSFT (enterprise tech) and DIS (cyclical entertainment). Those are safe enough to be in your anchor portfolio. They are companies with long legs.\n\nNow I want to be clear. I am not saying that your other picks are bad per se. The companies may actually perform at some point but what I am saying is if you are young and inexperienced, they are wrong for you at this time. You can start gambling on stuff like this later once you have a lot more experience and some disposable cash to throw around. Thats when you start swinging for the fences. Your odds will be much better than now.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Really appreciate what you're saying here because it's the strategy I'd like to implement, but other than DIS and MSFT, what are some other safe bets at a premium at the moment?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I get it and I will help out with a list but obviously do your own DD. Note that I am by no means some sort of stock picking god or anything like that. My Average since 2008 is about 30% yoy so I am good at this game but I am small fries and I make plenty of errors.\n\nWhat I am really good at is mitigating risk and I am good at NOT listening to my \"gut.\" Believe me I wanted to jump on the high growth train too... many times over the years and even last year. But every time I analyzed it I just couldnt make sense of some of the companies and I dont trust revenue on its own.\n\nConsumer Staples (I am including soda and coffee in here)\n\n* GIS\n* KO\n* PEP\n* KDP\n* CAG\n\nHealthcare\n\n* JNJ\n* PFE\n\nREITs (recently just buying healthcare and senior living stuff)\n\n* VTR\n* NHI\n* OHI\n\nFinancials\n\n* V\n\nUtilities\n\n* AQN\n\nMisc Cyclical\n\n* SBUX\n* COST (price might be high right now)\n* DIS\n\nThe above is about 25% of my portfolio (give or take). It changes very little over the years though at some points in time I did also have a lot of fixed income. Obviously there are a lot more companies to pick from.\n\nNow one caveat. I do time my purchases... sort of. Basically I look for price correcting events within the safe companies and I buy when they are down. And there is always a few which are down at any point in time. For instance, right now CAG, DIS, SBUX, and V are in a dip. So those would be my current targets if I didnt already hold them. There are many others. Just dont rush to buy. Wait for opportunities. I really dont think this is \"timing the market\" but rather more like opportunity buying or simple value investing.\n\nThis is how everyone should start. Build this nest egg 1st so that you can learn how to trade stocks, gain some confidence, and down the line have a buffer for risk taking. Now if I take a risk and it blows up in my face, I can laugh it off because I know that my family is still good financially. How long it takes to reach that will be different for each person.\n\nAs you suspect, this part of my portfolio will never make me rich on its own. It is however, low management (very little DD required) and thus frees my time for other things. They also generate cash giving me passive income lowering risk even more (dividends are great risk mitigation).\n\nThe rest of my portfolio is 25% big caps with decent growth, and the remaining 50% is either cash or big risky positions with each taking 10% to 25%. And even then, my definition of \"risky\" is not the same as others. For example, I have almost no respect for revenue growth in tech or financials. Im ok with revenue for hard assets companies where something physical actually trades hand but not software, internet, marketing or money moving revenue.

He didn't make market moves, he was just plain scared.\n\nI don't have any great insight into markets or macro, I was actually despondent for a period of time, throwing a couple hundred to a couple thousand on various positions. I think that the depth of financial despair removed my usual trepidation and proved to me that my usual DD is worthless. It was pretty much just dumb luck. I remember lying face down on 3/18 at my parents house, in my app, just moving thousands from my savings into the market. I remember where i was and what i was doing during the Bill Ackman freakout on cnbc, the negative oil dip, the PFE vaccine news. It was a crazy time.\n\nAn interesting thing to note is that I did NOT recognize pioneers in stay at home (except PTON), I am not an early adopter, but 'investing' has helped bring me some insights into my psyche.
