However, keep a few things in mind:\n\n* **Three month core inflation is higher than six month core inflation**, and six month core inflation is higher than twelve month core inflation.  That implies an acceleration in core inflation (which excludes fuel and food, btw).  Larry Summers discussed this in an interview yesterday: [https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/07/larry-summers-on-the-likelihood-of-a-recession.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/07/larry-summers-on-the-likelihood-of-a-recession.html)\n* **Shelter is a major component of inflation numbers, and rising rents are the only thing that matters.**  CPI doesn't factor in real estate transaction prices.  Instead, it factors in rents and \"owner's equivalent rent,\" which is just the rental value of one's home.  So even if the real estate market is slowing down, the shelter component of CPI won't come down unless rents cool.  They show no signs of it thus far.  To my eye, rising rent prices are the most under-the-radar contributor to CPI, and they are raging right now.\n* **Inflation will peak at some point, but the real question is what it will take to get back down to 2-3%.**  It's great to go from 9% to 7%, but if the Fed has to keep hiking for another year to get us down to their target range, it's extremely unlikely that we avoid a significant recession.  IMO, that scenario is not baked into stock prices.\n\nI'm not saying that inflation hasn't peaked, of course.  But there are still significant tailwinds for inflation, and rising retail inventories and dropping gas prices don't suddenly eliminate inflation as a concern.\n\nWe'll learn a lot in the next few weeks.  If we do in fact have a second quarter of negative GDP growth next week (likely), the Fed is in a bit of a hard spot.  Normally, they would start accomodating at this point, but they can't.  And if inflation doesn't start dropping quickly, they might still have a long road ahead of them on which they have to be hawkish.  We would then be in an unusual spot in which the Fed is hiking and tightening during a recession.  Given the lag time that rate hikes have, there is a significant risk of overaction and a significant recession.", "id": "vzthxk", "created_utc": 1657904200.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "7-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX/ UVXY and AMD weekly TA", "selftext": "What a great week.. even with CPI day being a bust.. I had one of my best weeks in a while. So lets get to a few market things first before I touch on charts. I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. \n\nWhat does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case… lets get into that a little bit. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntef185ersb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=205de0ab1f8401b1fea3bfa422dcde6a13c58da9\n\nYesterday the fed went from “we will not be doing a 100bps hike” to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected… now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn’t matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don’t care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? \n\nConfused? Me too… I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t339fnversb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79712e9d1e204460a4cb516d7c50ff700396a6fa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywwl1rffrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a66c885ba69022317171ecd97d889ae0a25e885\n\nI mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market… the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the “fear” is being contained right now… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86mdud1grsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6863b2f55ecccf654fd87d8426b4d53b6f5ff82e\n\nThe VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. \n\nThis is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. \n\nI am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. \n\nMany of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvek7kpgrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c236e9f122d5c176259d7aee8a1584d9aa7862f2\n\nThe one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om58fu6hrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee04dd25917171850484aaea0cbd89b3863abb7a\n\nThings to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. \n\nBull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  \n\nBear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. \n\nDaily supports to watch- 382 à 379 (gap fill) à 375 à 370 (channel support) \n\nWeekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) à 364 (weekly 200ema)\n\nDaily resistance to watch- 388 à 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) à 393 à 398 à 402 (gap fill)\n\nWeekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) à 413 (downward channel resistance)\n\nWhat I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zggc0vhrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9804cfbd004521003749725d4227a650c72d2392\n\nES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). \n\nI am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. \n\nDaily supports to watch- 3793 à 3744 à 3672 (channel support) \n\nDaily resistance to watch- 3850 à 3915 (channel support) à 4020\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/305c46dirsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=946d2343961418ae9a82028e7630a4d59e9e8239\n\nFutures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. \n\nThe weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. \n\nIf we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.\n\nWeekly supports- 3830 à 3675\n\nWeekly resistance- 3875 à 4136 à 4165\n\nOverall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwvgt6xirsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2140f0ae9ed8cec493e005e038ff089b4b17dbcf\n\nAMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. \n\nDaily supports- 79.5 à 76.6 à 71.6\n\nDaily resistance- 83.8 à 87\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7em8pjjrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a546f501675e7732e435ba25a37d583fd9868007\n\nAMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87… 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. \n\nThis is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyjmp56krsb91.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d897c2a6bc72def7c56986b3035d3b978e6594f\n\nI look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done… but most of the time like I have said before don’t add to a loser to make it a bigger loser… I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. \n\nOverall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!", "id": "vzz7j9", "created_utc": 1657919235.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body":
