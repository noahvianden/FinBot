{"title": "No Recession in Sight", "selftext": " \n\nBy Mickey D. Levy, \n\n ***Mr. Levy is chief economist at Bank of America.*** \n\nOct. 9, 2007 12:01 am ET \n\n \n\nDespite recent financial turmoil and a dismal housing market, there are key reasons why the economy will continue to expand, albeit at a modest pace, and not go into recession. Businesses are well poised to absorb a period of weaker product demand and are unlikely to significantly alter their hiring and investment behavior. Consumer spending is supported by rising incomes. Exports are strong. And monetary policy is consistent with sustained growth in domestic demand. Next year, we will look back and once again marvel at the flexibility and resilience of the economy.\n\nTo be sure, there is bad news. Housing construction and prices will continue to fall at least through 2008. There is an 18-year high in the inventory of unsold homes and soft sales that are constrained by several factors, including expectations that home prices have further to fall.\n\nThe surge in home ownership, which rose dramatically to nearly 70% in 2005 from 64% in 1994, has proved just as unsustainable as the reliance on subprime mortgages. That surge has begun to recede, and lower prices and onerous adjustable-rate mortgage resets point toward a modest further decline -- each one percentage point represents about one million homes. That decline, along with foreclosures, will elongate the housing inventory adjustment, exert downward pressure on prices, keep builders on the sidelines, and shrink employment in construction and the home finance sector.\n\n U.S. businesses are poised to withstand contraction.\n\nDuring the late stages of prior economic expansions, as product demand slumped in response to excessive monetary restriction, firms tended to maintain production and employment growth, resulting in large inventory overhangs. Business capital spending also tended to grow too rapidly -- witness the late 1990s investment boom. Consequently, most of the decline in real GDP during prior recessions was attributable to inventory liquidation, which meant cutbacks in production and jobs, and sharp reductions in capital spending. Presently, those conditions don't exist.\n\nBusinesses in a wide range of industries outside of the housing sector have nimbly adjusted their production processes, and inventories are very lean. That significantly reduces the potential impact of any slowdown in demand on production and employment. Similarly, firms have constrained investment spending while maintaining high cash balances. Following the capital spending boom of the 1990s, the unwinding of the capital stock, net of depreciation, also lowers the probability of a jarring reduction in business investment spending.\n\n Fed monetary policy points toward sustained growth in nominal spending. Despite the financial turmoil, credit remains available to basic businesses and the vast majority of households, and a general \"credit crunch\" is highly unlikely to unfold.\n\nHistorically, real disposable personal income has been the dominant factor driving consumer spending. As long as businesses maintain employment, and wages continue to rise, reflecting tight labor markets, rising personal income will outweigh the negative impacts of declining home prices, declines in mortgage refinancing, and even the recent increase in energy prices, on consumption.\n\nThis assessment presumes that businesses will not cut net jobs. No doubt, jobs will be lost in some industries -- real estate, mortgage brokers and related finance, to name a few. But that's minor in the context of 138 million U.S. workers.\n\n My discussions with a wide array of business executives in an assortment of non-financial industries suggest that they have not materially altered their hiring plans, despite heightened concerns about general economic conditions. The majority plan to maintain employment levels or increase them in the next year, with most of the planned increases in export and international-related activities. September's reported rise in employment, covering the period of maximum financial crisis, is encouraging.\n\nOnce again, turmoil on Wall Street doesn't necessarily translate to contraction on Main Street.\n\nRemember, following both the stock market crash of 1987 (which involved a cumulative 35% decline in equity valuations) and the 1998 financial crisis, the economy continued to expand. In both cases the Fed eased, financial markets absorbed the shock, and the economy proved resilient. The same will unfold this time; recession is not in the cards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pay close attention to the date**", "id": "w9z78i", "created_utc": 1658980244.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 55, "comments": [{"body": "That is that.

Right now though, economic indicators don't point towards a recession.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "As someone who's been investing for a decade one thing that never ceases to amaze me is how wrong experts can be and how quickly market narratives change.\n\nFor example, just last month everyone was saying how tech was done and how a hard-landing and recession was almost inevitable. Now it seems almost everyone on CNBC is saying how tech is looking attractive and that the Fed should be able to pivot policy fairly soon.\n\nAnd what's really changed? I think you could make an argument that the worst thing that could have happened this week was for earnings to come in strong while inflation data remains hot. At least that what I was worrying about. The only good news from what I can see is that commodity prices have fallen a bit, but I don't really see why anyone would expect that to persist. In fact, the narrative there has been utterly idiotic. Are we really expected to believe that oil prices are down because we're heading for recession, while simultaneously believing that earnings are strong and the market is worrying too much about recession?\n\nIt really feels like sentiment got blown out last month and now that markets have done a bit better this month people are starting to get FOMO and trying to justify these moves higher. Realistically inflation will come down to target when the economy meaningfully weakens. Despite sounding a little more dovish yesterday Powell basically acknowledged this with his comments around needing to see more slack in the labour market. Yes, the market is forward looking, but we simply don't know with any certainty how that weakening will play out. Personally I'd bet against the Fed creating the perfect amount of slack in the labour market and for that to cause a final recessionary panic before we see a bottom, but we'll see.\n\nAll I'd say is to take everything you're hearing right now with a grain of salt. No one knows what's going to happen and these are extremely unusual and uncertain times. Don't make moves based on slight week-on-week improvements in data followed by some bullish comments from \"experts\". There's a lot of risk out there right now so invest appropriately given your risk tolerance. It's certainly possible that things could better from here, but they could also play out much, much worse. You need to be ready for both because no one really knows what will happen. And on top of remember that markets like to play mind games with investors. If you're not able to call the market on it's BS or ignore the short-term moves completely, you're probably falling for it's games.

{"title": "7-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TA", "selftext": "Welcome to the officially unofficial 2022 recession! I hope we all survive… cause the markets and the feds do not care if you or I do! \n\nOkay so I have a few things to say about where we are at right now and where we are going and how to play these future days. I hope I am correct and I hope that we all make a lot of money. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mtzkll2jde91.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=a829c13c3e54ebeccedb6b1b3626bf3b1c599b6c\n\nOkay first off I want you to take a look at the March FOMC meetings data and todays FOMC data… kinda interesting if you ask me. We had similar days yesterday and today was identical. Now lets take a look at the Daily chart and see some interesting correlations…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt9ppd23jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=27acf0fd4e865d23478b92dedbafa0bb7fc35cd0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xopj4hn3jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0216a7ee5afd3032b32f46697d4d34ee70b5b2cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5urcbk74jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c2ef12809a7a07c19d2687ed75761a154692302\n\nOkay take a look back at march I have highlighted with a blue arrow and a “the day before march FOMC meeting.” If you look at it there is clearly a trend there where we bottomed the day before fomc and from there if you look at the candles they are nearly identical. So what does that mean? Well it means to me we are about to go on a even bigger bull run then we are currently on. Okay hear me out here for a second…\n\nIn March we had a meeting and then we had no more meetings until May… we are currently in July and have no meeting until September. We are looking at a nearly identical trajectory and base as then. If you remember back to march it was the simple buy calls on the morning dips and let it eat. This morning I was very tempted to get into some 30dte calls and the only reason I did not get into those calls were because I knew Apple earnings were tonight and PCE was tomorrow morning. \n\nWe are in a clear bull path towards 420-430. \n\nHere is a few other things to look at and think about. If you look at the purpleish blue trend line I highlighted the May 20th to June 2nd bear market rally. That rally was about 9.69% and lasted 8 days from low to peak. I superimposed that over to current July 14th bottom. Which shows that we are now tapped out on the bullrun is that’s the trajectory we are going off. Currently from the July 14th bottom we are up 9.6%. The argument could be made that we just made the top today and it is downward from here. \n\nNow if we are basing it off the day before FOMC meeting being the bottom like March then we look at the March 14th to March 29th 11 day rally of 11.1%. Which give us an 11 day trajectory (August 10th… the day of the next CPI meeting….) and a 11.1% rally which give us about 432.8 price target. \n\nNow this is where it gets crazy…. I calculated that trajectory strictly based off of the data not the chart. Now if you go to the chart and you look at August 10th AND look at the resistance line (the solid green line) it PERFECTLY correlated at…. 433.33… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tidgke35jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e442e5dc7c303b8f19e29dc7232fdb596c80c36\n\nSo am I bullish? Hell yeah. Apple looking great after its earnings… why does that matter? Well let me show you why…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxrfhjm5jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5208488935ad14684486cd108fb5cb64f11458\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3d2qbg46jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7745111953aa891e93b5f13070a9115775ae881b\n\nHere is the Apple chart… what do you see? You can see we are in a CLEAR downward grey channel that we have been trading within for all of 2022. This channel uses the lows from January and May then projects that to the highest point of march. IF apple opens over 157.2 tomorrow morning (which with earnings it should) then we are about to see Apple confirm 100% that its bear market is over… This would be the first time in 2022 that Apple fails to make lower highs over and over. Yes we have not broke the actual March high but breaking this channel is essentially saying the 2022 Apple bear market is now over… With this move Apple is going to Guide SPY and the rest of the market higher and higher. \n\nApples next price target assuming it holds and breaks over 157.2 at open will be 163.9 -> 174 -> 180.\n\nThe one thing to be careful about with Apple is if it opens up with a massive gap tomorrow whether that fills or not. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tphgasq6jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2954f225490cd2f28c76eb06fc50da07312c49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhlqwnk7jde91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=842020edb718d2e0a009ad5209de891092ccd8dd\n\nHere is the SPY and ES weekly charts that show just how bullish we are… Tomororw bulls are going to look to close the week out over 4145/ 413. Breaking those weekly downward channels opens us up to those green dotted resistance lines with a price target of 430/ 4335 by the week of CPI. \n\nIf you look at the green dotted resistance and blue dotted support lines they are actually forming a massive symmetrical triangle which should lead to a fairly significant breakout or break down. \n\nOverall with not really anything negative besides PCE tomorrow… which im only even mentioning this since JPOW was so clear in his “we look at PCE more then CPI” during his speech. But after tomorrow morning when market opens and we see it settle I will be entering some either 14dte calls. I will be looking at some 14dte 414C according to optionstrat that will be about the best risk to reward for my price target of 433 and time frame. \n\nLooking at after hours right now we are up about 0.83% which will leave another nearly $3 gap on the daily down below. This would be the third on the daily chart to the downside now… does that confirm we see more downside in the future? Yes I think it does… one small gap I can justify leaving but I cant really justify leaving three pretty decently sized gaps on the daily chart. \n\nMost likely scenario is we get somewhere near that 433 price target before we reject and see further downside. 410-415 will be a crucial resistance to watch on the way up. \n\nLately it appears at least for the last two weeks that we get a fake breakout in the morning followed by a sell off and then around 10 to 11 we finally find bottom and that is the optimal buy and hold call opportunity. I will be looking for this to play out tomorrow as I do suspect we could back fill the gap down to 406.8 in the morning at open before we push higher. \n\nIt wouldn’t be unheard of to see markets open and straight rally in a trend day now that all earnings are down, gdp is apparently old news already, no fed meetings for 8 weeks and no cpi for 3 weeks. There is literally nothing to worry about now…\n\nAll dips are now call buying opportunities…\n\n10% challenge-\n\nA pretty meh day for me today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12t0x5b8jde91.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=23b4d6a992ad71fc3d6b2cfaa0e88047dcae5e93\n\nI held those SPX puts overnight expecting a pretty big dump on GDP. Thankfully was able to get out of them at the bottom this morning. Apple looked hella weak this morning and with the earnings I attempted to enter for a nice free IV pump but apparently I bought the bottom.   \n I had the perfect SPX scalp around noon when there was a big dump in volume. Was up 10% instantly. Had a stop limit order in and it didn’t fill on the way down. Never saw green again. 404 was the probable high of day and it was not quite convincing at the time we would go much higher. At least we did though and I finally took my loss. Play a SPY 1dte call on the way up. \n\nSo far since I was on vacation earlier in the week and didn’t trade FOMC im sitting on a slightly red but manageable week right now. \n\nNot riding anything overnight. I was pretty close to entering those 14 or 30dte calls at market close but decided it was best to wait for apple and PCE just in case.", "id": "walbtb", "created_utc": 1659042375.0, "score": 50,

Day went as I expected though not in magnitude. Two trades - got short just after the open with some ES 4015 puts - but pulled the trigger before we actually got to yesterday’s high so my entry wasn’t great as usual. Since entry wasn’t great and I can’t hold long when I get in at the open as IV can collapse, I was on a super short leash and took a $.75 profit…8 minutes later that would be $12 (and as much as $17 after 20 mins). Clearly a sign I put on too much size for that time of day that and had to run when the trade started going my way. \n\nNext trade was just playing for a bounce above 4000 around 10:20. Another quick gain and was out in 6 minutes. No conviction. \n\nAs I mentioned yesterday, I wasn’t expecting this to end a big down day and found there to be some critical and nuanced dovish sounds coming from jpow yesterday and that the rally wasn’t a mistake for a change. That said, I was probably as shocked as all those covering shorts to see the market turn on a dime at 1030 and rip through the morning highs less than an hour later. I thought we might work lower and then higher in the afternoon. Not necessarily a Green Day but not a deep red day was the thesis. \n\nAmazon and Apple are ripping 12% and 3% respectively….and ES closed over 4100. I suspect they’ll open ES up another 10 plus points. I hate that in this scenario because I’m not so sure we fill a gap tomorrow so finding spots or a long/short view will be tough.  PCE probably won’t help that as I expect the signs of cooling to be apparent. \n\nI do like your view on targeting SPY 433 and then working to fill those gaps we keep putting in. \n\nGreat work and good luck tomorrow. \n\nWe’ll see what they give us tomorrow…\n\nEdit - Your Apple comment last week was spot on when you said “Apple looking hella bullish!”", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Haha.
