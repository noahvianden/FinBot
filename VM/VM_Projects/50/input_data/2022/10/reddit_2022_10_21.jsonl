{"title": "There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks.", "selftext": "An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?\n\nThe answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]\n\nThis post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.\n\n**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**\n\n[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)\n\nFrom another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):\n\n> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000¬Æ Index) led both large caps (S&P 500¬Æ) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap¬Æ) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.\n\n\nBut even outside of recessions, the outperformance is [robust across many decades](https://i.imgur.com/W0sAt4K.png), though. [Another graph](https://i.imgur.com/0OaFiH1.png),  and [another](https://i.imgur.com/HBkJ6aA.png).\n\n**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**\n\n Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)\n\nThis has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [\"Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk\"](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]\n\nThus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.\n\n**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**\n\n- US small cap value is relatively insulated from the broader global economy, unlike the enormous multinational firms dominating the S&P 500. They do not face the currency risks that are currently hitting large cap company's revenues. [Source](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/insights/article/why-small-cap-value-now.do) and [source](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/small-cap-interview).\n- Right now, the problem in the US economy is its strong labor market. Small cap value stocks see more earnings growth (relative to large firms) in such periods. \n- [Expected earnings for small caps](https://i.imgur.com/yJ1DPGZ.png) from [this source](https://www.lordabbett.com/en-us/financial-advisor/insights/markets-and-economy/a-strengthening-case-for-small-cap-stocks.html).\n- [Returns to expect](https://i.imgur.com/4sc85CZ.png) given these valuations in small caps.

I'll include a few of those quotes:\n\n> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.\n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/e3fb3c34-b982-4827-9762-f5b9a8d33dc5)\n\n> \n> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks ‚Äî Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks ‚Äî the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.\n\n[Source](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/)\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst:\n\n>  Meanwhile, small cap stocks trade at much more attractive valuation levels than large-caps, according to the note. The S&P SmallCap 600 trades at a P/E multiple of 11x, which is near its cheapest level of the last 30 years. \"This multiple also represents a 30% discount to the S&P 500,\" Kostin said.  That's the largest discount since the dot-com bubble, and if earnings don't deteriorate meaningfully from here, it could represent a big opportunity for investors.\n\n[Source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-valuations-rich-small-caps-value-interest-rates-2022-10)\n\n**Cheapness is even more pronounced in Europe**\n\n\n> Arnold also writes ‚Äúvalue stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they‚Äôve actually de-rated over the last five years.‚Äù\n\n> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: ‚ÄúThe Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!‚Äù\n> \n> Finally, Arnold writes that ‚Äúover the last five years Europe‚Äôs cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!‚Äù \n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) \n\nAnother [valuation graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png) for Europe valuations\n\n**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**\n\n>  After Japan's bubble burst, from 1990 to 2019, Japanese total country returns averaged 0.6%. Japanese small cap value averaged 5.13% and Japanese value stocks averaged 4%. During 2000-2010,  US small cap value grew 7.94% on average and US value stocks grew 4.56% on average, in contrast to a declining/flat S&P 500. \n\n\nSource: Ben Felix's various videos on small cap value.\n\nYou aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.\n\n**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**\n\nBecause market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?\n\n**Ticker recommendations**:\n\nI use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.\n\nI explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. \n\n> They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies \"tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning\ntheir prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent\nunderperformance.\" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.\n\n> [You can read about their approach to investing here](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/dam/ac/pdfs/ipro/viewpoint/iuo/scientific-approach-to-investing.pdf).", "id": "y9xr61", "created_utc": 1666368988.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 54, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôve got 20% of my portfolio in VB and have been adding to it.

There are lots of reasons.\n\nTo be honest, it probably is possible, but it just won't happen, because it has never happened before regarding the sp500. If you check historically, bottoms only occur when yields are lower compared to the years surrounding. And you will also see that crashes only start when yields are high relative to the surrounding decade.\n\nOne reason is that high yields make it harder for companies to raise money in the corporate bond market.\n\nI don't fully understand all the reasons, but I trust the historical pattern, because it's batting damn near 100%.\n\nIf you haven't done so yet, line up TLT and the SPY on tradingview or something. You'll notice the correlation pretty quickly, it holds up across very long timespans and also day-to-day\n\nLong duration growing companies and companies with high debt load or companies that are tryjng to take out new debt soon are the most affected. Things with high PE expecting profit long in the future are most affected. Tech is particularly negatively impacted by high yields.\n\nOne reason is that the higher rates go, the more incentive people have to sell stocks to buy bonds. The 10 year note has a pretty huge yield right now, it's a better deal than stocks, so people will sell stocks to buy bonds when the yields get high. This is one reason.\n\nAnother reason is that the housing market is very important to the economy, and the common 30y mortgage has rates that track the 10y note yield. So high rates weaken the housing market, which is a pillar of middle class wealth and spending, since most middle class people have much of their wealth in their home. And if the housing market is weak the sp500 will probably follow. A lot of new money is created from the housing market via loan origination. So if mortgages slow down, literally less money is being created in the real economy. And also people buy new shit when they move into a new home. Mortgages are stimulatory.\n\nAnd car loans. High rates means less people can afford car loans, and car loans are stimulatory, they just create new money out of thin air and it stimulates.\n\nFor a bunch of reasons, nobody is going to buy stocks and drive them upwards on another bull run until the yields are back near 0%. There's just no logical incentive, the incentive to buy US stocks goes up the more the more the rates go down.\n\nYou will usually see PE contraction of stocks associated with high rates. That's arguably the only important reason why stocks have been dropping lately, it has nothing to do with earnings (yet), so far the rising rates and rising dollar are just forcing money out of stocks, so the PE drops. Eventually earning will matter a lot and we are probably fucked, but so far imo the bear market is pretty much entirely because of rates rising.\n\nHigh yields also make default on loans more likely.\n\nIt's important to consider the stock market with respect to the bobd market. The stocks are barely down. Bonds are in one of the most brutal bear markets in modern history. So the more yields go up, the more sense it makes for institutions to sell stocks and buy the bond dip (yield spike).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a ton for this reply, I agree with your analysis completely.
