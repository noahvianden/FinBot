But the bank is planning on divesting/restructuring through this time of sheer incompetence. I don’t think that means they’ll go through a Bear Stearns style bankruptcy. There have also been so many regulations passed since 2008 globally (doesn’t stop shady shit from happening but still). I don’t think an equivalent style shockwave will happen. \n\nI think that brings me to my point which is that they are 100% too big to fail. They are a ginormous Swiss bank with over $1T in assets. \n\nIf you know anything about Swiss macroeconomics, you’d know they have had the money printer on for years to devalue the CHF. They don’t want their citizens to contribute to the EUR economy just because their own currency is so valuable. Inflation was only 3.3% in 2022. Meaning they can definitely turn the printer on, and leave it running until Credit Suisse gets through this ginormous hiccup. \n\nI will buy some shares/calls for the medium term (3/6 months) because even if they get bailed out, I don’t think that means long term success.
