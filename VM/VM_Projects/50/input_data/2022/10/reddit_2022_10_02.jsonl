They are a ginormous Swiss bank with over $1T in assets. \n\nIf you know anything about Swiss macroeconomics, you‚Äôd know they have had the money printer on for years to devalue the CHF. They don‚Äôt want their citizens to contribute to the EUR economy just because their own currency is so valuable. Inflation was only 3.3% in 2022. Meaning they can definitely turn the printer on, and leave it running until Credit Suisse gets through this ginormous hiccup. \n\nI will buy some shares/calls for the medium term (3/6 months) because even if they get bailed out, I don‚Äôt think that means long term success.
