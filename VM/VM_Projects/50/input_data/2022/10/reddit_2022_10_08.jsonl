They’re literally begging for the company to be bought out basically. It’s 100% a div trap because the shipping companies are “dying”, but ZIM still has very strong earnings. It’s market cap based on assets/liabilities alone should be greater than 3b, at least 4.5b, and that’s not even including future growth. Even though future growth is expected to decline by a whopping 80% in 2023, only bring a quarter EPS of $2 (compared to a whopping $14), that’s still a 50% yearly return based on current share price, and that’s not including future company projects. \n\nThe company itself has 4b short term liabilities and 4b long term liabilities.

It's a completely different industry and can't be compared to containerships at all. What you should be doing is comparing ZIM to peers like DAC or GSL.\n\nWhat you'd find, if you did so, is that Zim operates asset-light, engaging in long term charters of other companies' ships, and operating on the spot market to profit on the difference. Obviously, the last two years were phenomenal for spot, and Zim made truck loads of cash. As spot rates come down, and the company enters into new, higher rate charters, profits close. Currently, there's nothing to imply a significant long term upside in spot rates that would lead Zim to huge margins.\n\nGSL and DAC, on the other hand, operate in the same market, but are the ones owning the ships, and have fixed rate, multi year charters for most of their ships. That means stable, secure cash flow, regardless of market conditions. In a wild market like 2020-2021, they lose some of the upside, but you can lock them in for profit over the next few years, even if the market crashes. Both companies, for instance, could let their ships be used to the end of their charters, immediately scrap them, close up shop, and be worth roughly 2x their current share value. ZIM, on the other hand, will face compressed margins for the foreseeable future, and does not have significant assets beyond cash. If they enter a negative earnings period (highly possible), they'll burn cash.\n\nSo basically, by buying Zim, you're betting on a surge in spot rates that nothing currently points to existing, in exchange for giving up guaranteed cash flow and value in more stable companies.
