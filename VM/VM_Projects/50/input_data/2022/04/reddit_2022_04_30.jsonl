{"title": "Semiconductor stocks discussion", "selftext": "As the title suggests, what semi stocks are people still bullish on at these levels for the medium term? \n\nI don't hold any tech right now, but I'm looking forward to AMDs earnings. It's close to my $80 price target and I kinda want to buy some shares before earnings. \n\n$KLIC seems undervalued at first glance, but I need to read up a little more on it. Seems intriguing though.\n\nI haven't been watching tech as much as I should have in the passed few months honestly, because frankly it's been a bloodbath and I've been sticking to oil swings. \n\nIt seems like a lot of good semi stocks are finally starting to reach a point where they may be worth buying. Obviously the rate hikes, P/E compression is real, and the market outlook doesn't really look great, but I'm feeling tempted to start buying. \n\nBack in 2018-2019 I owned a lot of semis that got beaten up, and I sold em for a loss. From then until now the stocks have blown up, but the companies are also much more innovative and massive now. I would think AMD, lam research, Qualcomm, are all pretty solid medium term exposure to semis. \n\nI owned Nvidia, but I'm a bit scared to get back into them, especially when I think of their pre split price, which I owned shares in the $180s. Obviously Nvidia is a great company, but in 2018, it's stock got cut in half, and probably has room to do so again under current circumstances. \n\nPersonally, I love Intel products, but maybe it's just because I'm old school. Alot of my gamer friends prefer AMD cpus and gpus. Obviously, I understand AMD and Intel compete more over data center, but it's still a shift in consumer opinion. I, also prefer AMDs explosive growth over Intel's slow transition, but it may be worth looking into a small position to hold for years. If Pat can turn that company into a foundry, it'll be a start. it's a long time aways I think, but the government wants US semi companies to do well, and Intel directly benefits from that obviously. \n\n\nWhat do y'all think is gonna be the climate for semi companies moving forward? Are a lot of people buying now or is the fear that real with tech?", "id": "uf3ub0", "created_utc": 1651293922.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "Why is no one talking about TSM?\n\nThey have 55% market share.

Add to your own due diligence as you see fit:\n\n(I’ll try to keep this in the order of yours.)\n\nAMD earnings will be interesting for sure. The good Doctor seems to inspire staff and investors. But they’re always a more volatile ride. \n\nQualcomm earnings were a solid A in a crappy early part of the year. \n\nIntel earnings, the fabs made up for a lot of pain. Think the number I remember is they were up 178% on revenues(!) — may have missed that boat and their expenses were skyrocketing. If you took away the fan growth they weren’t growing strong. \n\nGovernment wants semis that build US fabs to do well. Not many are sinking significant money into that without assurance they virtually never pay taxes on it, they can’t afford the labor here. Flat out it’s more a PR move than a real money move. \n\nThey all have massive headwinds in the short term, people put off buying gadgets and companies run systems way past when they should be still in service when budgets get tight. People put off buying phones until they finally shatter the silly glass things. Etc. \n\nAs a purely bullish play on fab building if these companies are truly serious about that, I like ASML. Everybody uses their stuff. Problem is, I see they authorized a share buyback today and that’s a sign of them wanting to pump the stock price artificially like numerous other techs have done recently. And the stock is stuck and unmoving. Foreign company. All that jazz. I want a sign of life out of fab building before playing that one. \n\nThat may be two years from now If construction projects remain difficult and hampered by supply and labor issues. \n\nIn other words, I don’t see anybody fully harshly committed to US fab building. Or even that hard core committed to fab building at all really. They’re all waiting around on China to get it together. \n\nI always like tech. It’s what I do. But I can’t see dumping capital into any of them until the macro down trend plays out a bit more. All current numbers are rearward looking into an economy that believed it was headed for all time highs again on the cusp of “reopening” and was downplaying inflation. \n\nWe know at least that part was flat wrong now. I’ll wait at least another quarter for another earnings number set, after the Fed whacks the market again. \n\nNone are bad companies. \n\nOh did you mention Nvidia? They’re good too but they’re getting stuff headwinds ahead FROM Intel and AMD both. All see the need for “video” processing (really it’s encryption and all the things graphics processors are good at, that general CPUs aren’t — and that stuff is high profit margin high demand stuff) and are going after that specialty hard. Nvidia is best of breed but Intel and to a lesser extent AMD will “give it away” to grab as much market as they can and not give it to Nvidia. \n\nAnd of course, Apple is off doing their own chip thing… with TSMC and the like. \n\nSuper wide angle picture — all are chasing smaller available dollars in a hotly contested sector. Whether there’s enough dollars to go around is the real question. They’re getting rotated out as a sector because of the usual move in down economies to defensives. \n\nYour mileage may vary. Consumer staples outpaced tech even after decent earnings in most of them. Market psychology says folks are spooked about tech right now. Especially as high growth names. \n\nI think there’s better sectors to be in at least in the short term. Once you see 12 year olds clamoring for the latest iThingy and getting it for a $1000 gift, tech has roared back. But it’s not right now. \n\nTrading. Sure.

Whereas tech is down to its Jan 2021 levels. It's just funny that Reddit and CNBC, etc. all say that people who bought tech in late 20-early 21 were soooo foolish, but now say buying the peak in defensive stocks is so much safer right now.
