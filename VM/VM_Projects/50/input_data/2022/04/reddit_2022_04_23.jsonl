A judge ruled against them and the information is terrible in those docs.

The WHO, CDC,  or NHI wouldn't track or discuss natural immunity even with other countries showing positive studies that immunity was better and lasted longer. There was even an old recording that was dug up recently of Faucci from 15yrs ago saying natural immunity was the best when discussing the flu and it's a corona virus too. This is all verified.

There were other countries that were too poor to get the vax and used ivermectin and their infections dropped to nothing but we banned it here. YouTube and Twitter, both speech suppressors, blocked talk of a lab leak and then it came out that Faccui was aware of the possibility and was blocking it.
