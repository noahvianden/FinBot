Your example is flawed because each holder of shares doubles their shares, which doesn't happen with buybacks. \n\nBuybacks: The company loses capital, so each shareholder loses value per share. However, this is 1:1 canceled out from the lowering of numbers of shares, making each share a larger %.\n\nIt does generate value though because each share now holds a larger %, which means that you \"get\" more earnings per share in all future business, either through the company holding the earnings for you or through dividends.\n\nIf a dividend giving company does buybacks, assuming no future dilution, you will permanently get a larger dividend. This is how buybacks returns to shareholders. If it had no change, similar to splitting (aka how you describe it), buy backs would have 0 effect and never be done.
