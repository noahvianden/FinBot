Don’t have your primary focus or goal be trying to buy a company at the best price and getting in at perfect timing. More often than not, you’ll fail at trying to time it correctly. You’ll do it, I’ll do it, your neighbor will do it, the financial advisor charging high fees will do it, most of us will fail. Timing the market or specific companies correctly is very difficult.\n\nInstead, look within the company itself. If it’s a good company with strong fundamentals along with a solid outlook and place in the future then it shouldn’t matter too much what its price is today if you’re going to hold the company for years. The great investor Peter Lynch once said something about worrying about getting in/out too early or late. He said something along the lines of “more money has been lost trying to time than in corrections themselves”. To throw another quote at you, “time in the market bears timing the market”.\n\nThey might sound like empty or silly statements but they really are great pieces of advice. Timing the market is incredibly difficult to do consistently. You’ll risk getting in too late or too early by possibly being wrong. You might miss out on solid returns waiting to long. You might jump in during a dip only to find out the worse has yet to come. In other words, don’t stress trying to time things too much and instead focus on the companies themselves.\n\nIf you like Visa, have throughly researched it, and are confident in its future then buy today and hold it for years.

Early on, I also watched beginner or crash course videos on YouTube. I read some of the investing websites and newspaper. It’s not a day job but I probably spend between 5-10 hours a week reading about this stuff. Again, use caution with some of the investing websites as a lot of them are trying to sell something, pitch subscriptions, or use low value buzzfeed like articles to attract viewers.\n\nTry to watch some videos about how the stock market works, check out investopedia for any terms you hear a lot but aren’t totally sure what they mean, it’s a great tool to have at your hands. Stay up to date and keep your eyes and ears open for any news or trends. Read up on guys like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch. It takes time but I guarantee if you dedicate a couple hours each week you’ll learn a ton in time.\n\nOnce you’ve done all that, slowly familiarize yourself and read some earning reports and financial statements. A lot of it will be intimidating and complex at first but with practice and research you’ll begin to understand things a little better. Truth is, with publicly traded companies they are so big and complex that you’ll never fully understand or realize everything going on within a company. You can, however, get a better idea and grasp of things. Just remember it won’t happen overnight and takes a lot of time, practice, and even trial and error. Also understand you can do everything right and sometimes still fail. The market and companies within can and do act irrationally or unpredictable at times. Luck is part of the game.\n\nYou can do all that without having to pay for an advisor or taking classes.
