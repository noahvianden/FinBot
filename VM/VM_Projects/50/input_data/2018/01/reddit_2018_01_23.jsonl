Someone was saying they were worth 800-900, but I was saying that there were 10 times yesterday where you could order within 30 minutes of getting the alert and get a 1080 for 600.\n\nLarge operations usually don’t buy from retail as you said. There are plenty of public grey markets where you can buy diverted stock by the pallet. The prices aren’t all that much better then retail though, just more convenient than buying up stock on amazon Newegg micro center etc if you’re needing 500 GPUs for ex. \n\nBut the tldr of my comment is, plenty of 1080s available for purchase around 550-650, no way they’re worth 800-900 (and they aren’t), mostly because they are pretty mediocre for mining compared to 1070s.
