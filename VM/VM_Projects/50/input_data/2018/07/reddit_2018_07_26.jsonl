Epyc on 7nm second gen will absolutely rip intel a new one is also on track and continue to take advantage of the growing high end data centers. That is what is happening. I'm really surprised that it is happening this early, I figured it would happen around Q3 to Q4. This probably has a strong chance to correct in the short term. \n\nFurther more intel finally admitted that amd will be on equal ground(almost parity) with their 10nm vs 7nm. Thing is 7nm will be out for a full 6 months ahead. AMD was just given a free ticket to wreck intel's shit. Intel isn't dead but there will be some time for amd to gain mindshare and customers while intel works it out and gets back on track. A lot of people think intel admitting 2019 \"Holiday\" will probably result in another delay even further into 2020. All this allows intel to gain a foothold into the server market and genuinely start being a force to be reckoned with. It's going to be a very fast change in revenue Q4ish and 2019 once the initial testers of gen 1 epyc realize that bitch is on point and for the price/perf it is literally the best option out there.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Time to short it.
