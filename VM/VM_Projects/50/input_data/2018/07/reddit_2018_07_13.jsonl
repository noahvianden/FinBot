People are allready not fond of mail order pharmacies as they are a pain to deal with. Amazon would likely follow the centralized and ship-out model of distribution which would require large upfront costs. Plus pharmacists are expensive, like 120k/year expensive. There is a maximum amount of techs you can have to each pharmacists so you would have to hire a lot of PharmD’s. Also amazon has a notoriously poor worker satisfaction so they likely will have to pay pharmacists more just to stay. Then they will want to make money too, so I don’t see this dropping prices much. Mail order pharmacies allready offer meds at cheaper copays than pick-up pharmacies and people still hate them. Not to mention the massive headache involved with regulatory compliance in script storage, getting new perscriptions for every med at least once per year to ensure seamless service, and training and certifications for staffing.

When a company invests $1 billion to get their drug to market, you can bet that they’re going to charge whatever the hell they want. If the retail giants like WBA or CVS aren’t going to make them budge, what makes you think Amazon has any leverage when they have a fraction of their market share. For medications that are brand only, there is only a single manufacturer and thus they set the price. Amazon can either accept that price or not carry the drug at all. For drugs that have several generic manufacturers, Amazon isn’t going to be able to get a better contract from a wholesaler than WBA/CVS. They can charge less for cash paying patients sure, but for patients with insurance, there is no incentive to do that because insurance companies almost never reimburse what the pharmacy asks for anyway so Amazon will receive the same amount of $ for a prescription as WBA/CVS regardless of what they charge/ask for. And WBA/CVS are getting their drugs for much cheaper because of their better contracts. Losing WBA/CVS would be catastrophic to a wholesaler. The wholesalers don’t need Amazon.\n\nIn term so if OTC drug prices, you can’t compare them to Rx. There are hundreds of OTC drug manufacturers which drives the price down simply because of competition. With Rx drugs, there might be a dozen or so. And with these Rx companies, their production is cyclic and this artificially decreases supply and thus keeps the prices high.\n\nSo no, imo Amazon will not be able to lower Rx prices by much, WBA/CVS will always have the upper hand, and the whole blisterpacking that makes PillPack unique is geared towards people in long term care facilities/nursing homes and this acquisition has no impact on 90% of the population.

Oh wait they already are. It's a product of health care for these companies employees, but I also strongly believe they're doing this to test a market to disrupt the insurance industry financial models. Also they will disrupt how they've lobbied for the design and legislation that structure the annoying and ineffective American health care model. Amazon might just use this partnership to leverage a strong hand to work with drug manufacturers.\n\nBut let's go back to this.\n>For medications that are brand only, there is only a single manufacturer and thus they set the price.\nYes. \n\nBut the entire design of the price structure is a problem created by insurance companies, and not pharmaceutical companies. Yes, there is a supply/demand provlem with med supply, which forces price up. The primary  reason drugs are expensive in the US is based on how the insurance industry lobbied for and created billing laws both during obamas era, and during Bush's era, and during Clinton's era, and during the Reagan era. Let's take one drug for example, any proprietary drug. Let's say Truvada or Biktarvy, to pick on Gilead. Medicaid reimburses between 10-40% of the cost of the meds, if at all. OHBummercare. (Sarcasm) Medicare reimburses 50-60 % of the cost. Private insurance varies from 30-80% reimbursement for meds. So if you average the two biggest players reimbursement, Medicaid and Medicare, the average reimbursement to Gilead would be about 30%. So for a 200 dollar bottle of truvada they get paid 60$. And for a 3000 -3200 one month supply of Biktarvy it would be just under 1K. I'm just picking on one company that I know and, but using one example makes things simpler.\n\nBasically what I'm getting at is that by reimbursing shitty and hypervariable amounts of drug costs to suppliers, the suppliers have responded by changing their drug prices. Are their CEOs and executives sleazy? Yes, indubitably. But was this entire drug cost crisis created and designed by the laws that insurance companies have helped write? Yes. Definitely. The pharmaceutical company has just adapted to the price structure. \n\nSo if Amazon, jpmorgan chase and Berkshire Hathaway reimburse more directly to these companies, maybe a 3200 dollar bottle of Biktarvy will actually just cost them 1500, because it's agreed upon.  So Amazon and JPMorgan and Big Bad Buffett will design an insurance company that actually works, for their employees, and then introduce it to market later.
