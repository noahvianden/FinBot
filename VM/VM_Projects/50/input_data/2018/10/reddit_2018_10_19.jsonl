Knowing the exact hardware and software the chip has to integrate with may enable Tesla to use the ASIC more efficiently.

Here's an example. Volvo plans to launch Nvidia Xavier powered cars in the early 2020s—call it 2022.

Musk [explained](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4193497-tesla-tsla-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript), “whereas the current NVIDIA’s hardware can do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over 2,000 frames a second and with full redundancy and fail-over.” Tesla is [currently using](https://www.anandtech.com/show/9903/nvidia-announces-drive-px-2-pascal-power-for-selfdriving-cars) an Nvidia chip with 12 teraflops of performance. A tenfold improvement would suggest Tesla’s chip has roughly 120 teraflops of performance. Nvidia’s [Xavier chip](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-drive-xavier-soc-detailed/), which is currently sampling and likely won’t be installed into vehicles until late 2019, has roughly 30 teraflops of performance. In other words, traditional automakers have committed to a chip with inferior specs, and will likely have to wait for Nvidia’s next autonomous product before they can have a processing system comparable to the system Tesla is testing today.\n\nTesla isn’t making chips any better or faster than Nvidia. It’s bringing a part of the Tier 1 automotive supply chain in-house to accelerate speed of deployment in its vehicles. \n\nIt’s also vertically integrating hardware and software, which can significantly reduce processing overhead by ensuring that the chip integrates well with the rest of Tesla’s electronics. \n\nTesla is _not_ making its own GPUs, and will still buy those from a supplier like Nvidia.
