{"title": "Surviving a 100 point drop in TSLA and taking it through earnings", "selftext": "Hey r/options!\n\nMany people expressed interest in more elaborate trades, so I figured I'd post one of the interesting stories. To set the record straight:\n\n* This is a premium selling track.\n* These are not the trades to follow. It's a retrospective and physically you won't get these numbers now.\n* Trader's rationale and thinking is the core substance, IMHO\n* I always have something going in TSLA, this is merely a slice of the recent history. I won't be unwinding the pre\\-history in full here, it's not the point.\n* I will post some numbers, but they aren't meant to brag, just give additional context. It's a big number for person A, and maybe an underperforming P/L for person B. So take it as an entertainment rather.\n\nI will try to address as many questions as possible in comments. Hope the sub enjoys!\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nSo it all 'started' with the mid\\-March TSLA drop which eventually was a full 100 handles \\(on a $340 stock non the least!\\). [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ:TSLA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nActively defended a typical strangle, traded around it, rolled out, inverted. The end result:\n\n* Stock sitting at around $301 on May 2nd \\(reporting earnings after the market\\)\n* The position is almost a scratch, but giving up all this effort and juiced up volatility in a position is something I really didn't want to do.\n* Full position wrapped around 0 delta \\(\\+/\\- 100 delta was a rounding error basically, see below\\)\n* 20x tight 290/295 strangle in May monthlies\n* 10x inverted 275/300 strangle in May monthlies\n* 5x synthetic long stock\n\nAs I mentioned, there was no chance I was closing it all \\(TSLA is great to trade in due to all the volatility\\). Earnings reported after market that day, and an expected move was almost $20. TSLA never goes through earnings unchanged, so I clearly needed to do something, as with all the layers I was perfectly centered and didn't have any directional assumption. Also, TSLA can blow past the expected move easily, but given all the pressure recently already, running it into the ground was probably not in anyone's plans.\n\nMy breakevens were right around the expected move. My thinking was, that even taking it as is and breaking even would be a shame :\\) So I decided to throw in some kickers on the short and long side. Usually I'd do it with ratio spreads, but I didn't want any additional undefined risk in the position. A broken\\-wing butterfly wouldn't give enough kick either. I did something unusual for myself \\- paid for debit butterflies:\n\n* 10x $15\\-wing put butterfly 255/270/285 for $1.88db in May 4 weeklies\n* 10x $15\\-wing call butterfly 315/330/345 for $2.11db in May 4 weeklies\n* The strangles and butterflies overlapped nicely, giving that extra piece of mind should TSLA decide to go outside the expected move\n* With such pumped up volatility pre\\-earnings the max butterfly payoff could easily be 5x\\-10x, which would cover for missed opportunity in the main position.\n* All\\-in cost about $4K. A cheap price to pay for a position with a theoretical $61K upside \\(May monthly expiration\\). I wouldn't hold it to expiration, so practical upside was less, but significant.\n\nFinally, the ER comes out. No movement. I was checking all possible platforms, desktop, mobile, thought I was missing something. Something **was** broken, right? Nah, TSLA really didn't move. Until a conference call, where more stupid analysts started throwing irrelevant questions at Musk, and he had the arrogance of opening his yapper and basically GFY'ed them. Riiiight... There it goes, the \\-$20 overnight, like an 8&#37; move.\n\nComes morning, all in\\-arms, ready to fight the TSLA tape. Surprisingly, the delta was very reasonable there \\(long, but not crazy\\). So it becomes a different game. The strangles are giving back the money after the IV crush, but the butterflies are now all the fun. The call side one is dead in the water, even for pennies. I stopped bothering even, wouldn't cover the commissions with 40 contracts overall. The put one is more interesting, with the price going in and out of the sweet spot.\n\nHere's the next decision to make. I want the butterfly to pay me something, but I need to roll into JUN while the cake is still very hot, and ideally uninvert and re\\-center. So the price action is favoring either the strangles or butterfly, but not both. Ugh :\\) A high\\-class problem to have on hands, I guess :\\)\n\n* Sold the put butterfly for $3.02, a profit of $1.12 for every contract. Out of curiosity, I saw it trading for $5.50 at one point later in a day \\(but I needed high volatility on the opening after the ER to get the best price for a roll, so... never look back :\\)\n* Uninverted the 275/300 strangle and left the same strikes. Basically paid less than 50&#37; of intrinsic value in debit for a $25 spread by selling a straight strangle in JUN\n* Widened the narrow 290/295 strangle \\(well, a step away from a straddle, really\\) to 270/300 in JUN, and still collected $1.30 per contract. Not bad, that crush really wiped the premium for ATM options.\n\nEnd of day result:\n\n* $19K\\+ up on a TSLA for the day, a tad bit long new position in JUN \\(basically neutral, with 5x synth long skewing things a little\\)\n* New strangles at 35\\-40 delta. They will burn fast, but require a watchful eye and active management and defense. Which I can all provide and then some\n* Earnings disaster averted. New adventures await :\\)\n\nFew points which will be important if you read all the way down here:\n\n* It wasn't a huge outsized trade for me. Yes, it grew larger than a typical TSLA position, but this was a result of fighting the $100 drop.\n* It's a Portfolio Margin account. Don't try this with cash. At some point the margin was $107K, but dropped to $64K as soon as I rolled to JUN. Your gamma risk in action, 'they know' and charge more if you try to bring it all the way to expiration\n* I'm not specializing my trades in TSLA. It's just another ticker on my board, which required some creative thinking this time\n* I didn't spend all day babysitting the position. Had my one eye open looking at the TSLA price while adjusting overall portfolio. When a favorable opportunity shows up, it's time to make a decision \\(and again, never look back :\\)\n\nThis was my longest write\\-up, I think :\\) No outrageously sophisticated strategies, just a good old quick decision making \\(and some hardened nerves\\).

Delta wants to approach either 1 or 0 by expiration, so the whole position becomes more and more black & white vs some P/L in between. This is gamma, the acceleration of delta per $1 price move. The JUN was at a 45 dte sweet spot, still with high IV out of earnings announcement, what's not to like there? :)\n\nYou will be required to post more margin closer to expiration, because same price swings result in bigger and bigger P/L swings (gamma).
