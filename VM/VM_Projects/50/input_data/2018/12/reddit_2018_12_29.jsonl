Spiegel?\n\nThere's nobody I'd rather see get hit by an electric bus more than this pole-smoking, knob-gobbling, fear-mongering, rumour-spreading illogical assfuck named Mark Spiegel. The guy's AUM were down from some $20M to under $5M (and now probably $2.5M) and he's literally going broke trying to battle Elon with his fucking $2.5M options as he loses in EVERY way. \n\nAllow me to demonstrate the retardation factor at play, here: \n\nMark Spiegel BRAGGED ABOUT selling naked Jan **2021** (EDIT: READ. YES, 2021) $440 calls for $51 credit and called it **insurance** somewhere in the conversation. Can you fucking believe that? This fucking guy. His super-genius idea of SELLING NAKED CALLS netted him a $51 credit but those almost immediately shot up in value to $93 (mid-december) and rests today around $69. Great for call buyers, shitty for sellers named Mark. Unknown if he sold-to-close since then. [Here's the video timed to exactly where he all smugly talks about selling these for an unbelievable $51](https://youtu.be/ye4nbzIMk58?t=928). \n\nIn September he stated he loaded up on $100 and $150 puts because \"they were cheap\". ($0.15 to $2.00). Who would've thought that it was cheap ticket to throw money into a fucking fire? \n\nSo how about his June 2020 puts? He bought in at 40, they're at 30 today. Whether he's selling calls or buying puts, he's just fucking losing. \n\nI would feel bad wishing financial ruin on any person, but just go to his twitter and you'll see he's really just a piece of shit in a douchebag's skin. \n\n[Video source for pretty much everything I said above, right from the horses mouth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye4nbzIMk58) ", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "“Don’t be stupid” ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "!remindme may 2019", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "i win, right? not tendies but mark surely did", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you bet on bankruptcy and lose 75% of your portfolio in the process, a couple years of TSLA being flat / in its usual fluctuation zone, you aren't making money.

Tesla's receivables are squared up immediately upon delivery (unlike the incumbent's *manufacturer -> dealership -> customer* cycle, which the mfg is not paid for 30-90 or more days). To your point on receivables, it's pretty obvious and I don't understand why it's a red flag: if delivery is a bottleneck, you're going to have enlarged receivables while that inventory is in line to be converted to cash. \n\nSimilar but not related to that: Tesla's payment terms to suppliers are 30-60 days. Their cash conversion is immediate upon delivery. This gives them 30 days (or more) of float equal to their revenues from deliveries. That means Tesla sells 1BN worth of cars, they'll get $1BN worth of float for the month. Ramp that up to 10BN, 20BN, and you've got enough float to accomplish some crazy things. (edit: It's worth clarifying, for some models configs, you order today, you have it in 2 weeks. That's 14 days out of the 30-60 or more days until you have to pay your suppliers. This is why Elong has stated his goal to have 24H delivery...that would create a float defined by your relationship / leverage with your suppliers. That's a bezos move.

There could be a million reasons why they did this, and only some of them are \"Because they're fudging the numbers\".\n\n> Maybe because of the convertible notes or a need to raise capital?\n\nOK I feel like you're just throwing bear's favourite buzzwords around hoping something will stick. Why would they be raising capital with everything I just said about float and the company being profitable? \n\n> huge ramp is a red flag\n\nOccams razor. They are finally delivering their mass-produced vehicle. This was planned a long, long time ago. The beginning of the company, to be exact. This is nothing new. \n\nThe trouble they are having with delivering this volume of vehicles at once has been widely-covered by the media and TSLA bulls&bears. I don't know how someone can ignore these two factors when throwing the \"MMMmMSuspicious!\" alarm out there. It's like you're intentionally ignoring the clear-cut information in front of you, and then using that ignorance as as a basis for your argument. \n\nYou do you, bud, but I won't root for your financial ruin like I do Mark S.

In this case, obscure stuff in the footnotes that almost nobody pays attention to that change revenue recognition to be much less conservative, jumps in receivables, and weird inconsistencies in tooling depreciation are only some of the obvious problems that show up in their 10-Q. \n\nSure, they can do this for a while, BUT not when high yield spreads blow out and the credit cycle ends.
