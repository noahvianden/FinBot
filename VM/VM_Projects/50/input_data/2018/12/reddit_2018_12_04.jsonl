{"title": "A stock I had never heard about until this weekend.", "selftext": "Read about it in Barrons. LITE or Lumentum holdings. It reported a down quarter like most semis and it sold off dramatically. Lost all its gains for the year. It's a pretty new company but they make optical hardware and devices that use lazers to map things in 3d. They made the lazers for apple's face recognition software which works really well. Im sure all phones will use iit someday. Probably not just phones, but cars, lots of smart devices could use it. I dont know how big their share is in that but its not even their biggest revenue stream. I think its just 20 percent of their revenue right now so that is a huge opportunity for growth. It trades at 10 times earnings so I'm just wondering why no one talks about this company. It could easy double in a few months. It's a fairly new company too.
