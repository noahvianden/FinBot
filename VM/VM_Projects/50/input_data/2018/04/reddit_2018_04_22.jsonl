Here's a (relatively) small sample:\n\n>    In June 2009, the SEC sued Angelo Mozilo, former CEO of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, and two other former officers, charging that they misled investors about the quality of Countrywide's loans while knowing the company was fueling its growth by letting its underwriting guidelines deteriorate and originating a growing number of risky subprime loans. In October 2010, the SEC settled the lawsuit and Mozilo was required to pay a fraction of the $521.5 million he had earned, just $67.5 million in penalties and disgorgement.[3][4]\n\n>    In August 2009, the SEC filed a suit against Bank of America, alleging that the bank failed to disclose $3.6 billion in bonuses that Merrill Lynch paid its employees.[5] In January 2010, the SEC filed another suit against the bank, alleging it failed to disclose extraordinary fourth-quarter 2008 losses at Merrill Lynch prior to a December 5, 2008 shareholder vote to approve a merger between it and Merrill Lynch. In February 2010, Jed S. Rakoff, a federal judge derided, but approved a settlement to resolve the lawsuits, having rejected a previous settlement for $33 million as too small. He called the new agreement \"inadequate and misguided\" because the penalties were \"very modest\".[6]\n\n>    In October 2009, relying on informants and wiretaps, Raj Rajaratnam and his hedge fund, Galleon Group, were charged with an insider trading scheme that generated more than $25 million in illicit gains. Six others involved in the scheme were also charged, including senior executives at IBM, Intel and McKinsey & Company.[7][8] Overall, the SEC in the Galleon series of cases has charged 29 defendants for widespread and repeated insider trading in the securities of more than 15 publicly traded companies, generating illicit profits or losses avoided of more than $90 million. The investigation involves cash payments by Rajaratnam and Galleon in exchange for material nonpublic information, and the investigation has ensnared corporate executives, consultants, rating agency personnel, proprietary traders, hedge fund executives, and public relations personnel. Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison in the parallel criminal case, and the court entered a final judgment in the SEC civil case holding him liable for a civil penalty of $92.8 million, representing the largest penalty ever assessed against an individual in an SEC insider trading case.[9][10]\n\n>    In December 2009, three former executives of New Century Financial Corporation were charged with conspiring to mislead investors by not disclosing dramatic increases in the rate of borrowers who were defaulting almost immediately on their loans.[11]\n\n>2010\n\n>    In April 2010, the SEC filed a suit against Goldman Sachs and one of its vice presidents, Fabrice Tourre, alleging that the firm misled investors with respect to a subprime mortgage product. The SEC charged that Goldman and Tourre did not inform clients that what they bought was crafted in part by hedge fund manager John Paulson, who was betting the product would fail. In July 2010, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle the case, among the largest penalties ever assessed in the 76-year history of the SEC, although just 1% of Goldman's market value at the time and 2% of its cash balance in March 2010, and considered to be a \"slap on the wrist\".[12] The penalties prompted a sigh of relief from Goldman and Wall Street.[13] In announcing the settlement, Robert Khuzami, current director of the Enforcement Division, twice referred to it as \"more than half a billion dollars\", but Michael J. Driscoll, a professor and former senior managing director at Bear Stearns called it \"a steal\".[13] A former SEC commissioner, Paul Atkins, said he was \"embarrassed, as an American,\" describing the suit as \"basically playing for headlines with very little substance\".[13] Eliot Spitzer said Goldman's reaction was \"OK, we'll pay you $550 million to settle the Abacus case — that's a small price to pay for the $12.9 billion we got for the AIG bailout.\"[14] Khuzami states that the penalty paid by Goldman Sachs ($535 million) was “30 to 40 times” what the firm hoped to earn from the Abacus deal ($15 million), and such a significant penalty sends a “cold, hard and sharp” message to Wall Street and risk managers that they better think twice before undertaking transactions that violate the law.[15]\n\n>    In July 2010, Citigroup, with a market cap of $120 billion, agreed to pay a $75 million penalty[16] to the SEC for its failure to adequately disclose its exposure to subprime mortgage debt. Citigroup advised investors it held $13 billion in subprime investments when in fact it was more than $50 billion. Fines for misconduct were also assessed against the former chief financial officer, Gary Crittenden, and director of investor relations, Arthur Tildesley.[17][18]\n\n\nAnd then there's this:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission#Regulatory_action_in_the_credit_crunch\n\n>The SEC has been criticized \"for being too 'tentative and fearful' in confronting wrongdoing on Wall Street\", and for doing \"an especially poor job of holding executives accountable\".[29][30][31]\n\n>Christopher Cox, the former SEC chairman, has recognized the organization's multiple failures in relation to the Bernard Madoff fraud.[32] Starting with an investigation in 1992 into a Madoff feeder fund that only invested with Madoff, and which, according to the SEC, promised \"curiously steady\" returns, the SEC did not investigate indications that something was amiss in Madoff's investment firm.[33] The SEC has been accused of missing numerous red flags and ignoring tips on Madoff's alleged fraud.[34]\n\n>As a result, Cox said that an investigation would ensue into \"all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm\".[35] SEC Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations Eric Swanson had met Madoff's niece, Shana Madoff, when Swanson was conducting an SEC examination of whether Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme because she was the firm's compliance attorney. The investigation was closed, and Swanson subsequently left the SEC, and married Shana Madoff.[36]\n\n>Approximately 45 per cent of institutional investors thought that better oversight by the SEC could have prevented the Madoff fraud.[37] Harry Markopolos complained to the SEC's Boston office in 2000, telling the SEC staff they should investigate Madoff because it was impossible to legally make the profits Madoff claimed using the investment strategies that he said he used.[38]\n\n>A similar failure occurred in the case of Allen Stanford, who sold fake certificates of deposit to tens of thousands of people, many of them working-class retirees. In 1997, the SEC's own examiners spotted the fraud and warned about it. But the Enforcement division would not pursue Stanford, despite repeated warnings by SEC examiners over the years.[39] After the Madoff fraud emerged, the SEC finally took action against Stanford in 2009.\n\n>In June 2010, the SEC settled a wrongful termination lawsuit with former SEC enforcement lawyer Gary J. Aguirre, who was terminated in September 2005 following his attempt to subpoena Wall Street figure John J. Mack in an insider trading case involving hedge fund Pequot Capital Management;[40] Mary Jo White, who was at the time representing Morgan Stanley later nominated as chair of the SEC, was involved in this case.[41] While the insider case was dropped at the time, a month prior to the SEC's settlement with Aguirre the SEC filed charges against Pequot.[40] The Senate released a report in August 2007 detailing the issue and calling for reform of the SEC.[42]\n\n>On September 26, democratic senator Mark Warner in a letter asked the SEC to evaluate whether the current disclosure regime was adequate, citing the low number of companies' disclosures to date.[43][44][45]\n\n>Others have criticized the SEC for taking an overly rule-based and enforcement-focused approach to regulation, rather than an approach that emphasizes industry-wide safety and learning and thus ensures the reliability of the national securities trading system.[46]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ohhhhhhh\n\n/u/walden_walkabout got owned.
