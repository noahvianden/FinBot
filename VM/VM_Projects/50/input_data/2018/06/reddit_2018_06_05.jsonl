{"title": "Rewrite on my advice to newcomers: My take on how to start investing", "selftext": "**Hello! Welcome to /r/StockMarket**\n\nWelcome to the fantastic world of investing where there is infinite to learn and infinite to go. The problem with giving advice on finance is that there is not a proven system that works. You need to find what works for you and work with that. First of all, I would recommend searching around on the financial subreddits for new people posts and reading them. The question has been asked thousands of times, and there are tons of amazing answers. Otherwise, here is my short-take.\n\nIn finance, you need to read. That is how you learn, how you get information, how you find out new developments in the market. All of the information. Books, news, financial statements, press releases, and earning calls. Read everything. You will find hundreds of words you don’t understand, so look them up (investopedia has a majority of them). In the beginning, you will struggle, however, as time goes by, you will start to understand. If you do not like reading, learn to like it. There is no way around this. If you find yourself investing without reading tons, you are going to lose.\n\n**Reading**  \nI recommend reading the 10Q document (hard), conference call transcript (easier), and the shareholder's presentation (easiest) of your favorite public corporation. You can find it on their respective investor relations page. Other than that, without exception, anyone attempting to understand the huge complex thing called the stock market, I heavily recommend reading “One up on Wall Street” by Peter Lynch. It is a true masterpiece, and it is very easy for a newbie to read. Enjoyable, teaching, and fantastic. After that, I recommend The little book on Common Sense Investing by John Bogle (best book on funds), and while not a finance book, Mindset by Carol Dweck is a must-read to understand success and failure.\n\n**Doing**  \nThen after you have started learning, it is time to start doing. As you start out, you should consider two things. Indexing or stock picking. 90% of people should own indexes, but people truly interested should look to specific stocks. \n\n**Exchange Traded Funds**  \nThese are ETFs like $VOO, $VTI, $VWO, and $VOOG,  and is a way to take on the least amount of risk while still gaining along with the market. You get a wide basket of stocks, focusing on things like the S&P500 ($VOO), which is an index of large (minimum 6.1 billion USD) US companies. Historically, you can expect 7% annual gain here on average (some years might be up much more, or even in the red). That’s realistic. Anything offering much more than that without risk has tons of risk without disclosing it, per definition. $VOOG indexes growth companies, focusing less on the giants and more on the up and coming. $VWO focuses on emerging markets, getting places like brazil, Russia and all over Asia. Indexing is by far the best choice, and will very often gain you steady growth. If you disagree with this you must get John Bogle's take on it, the founder and former CEO of Vanguard. The best way to do this is in the book recommended above. The final and great choice is $VTI, which is the global basket that contains the market as a whole. It will never be a mistake, even if performance may vary.\n\n\n**Stocks**  \nBuying individual companies through common stock is much harder, and the process is really tough. To put yourself into that, you need to be ready to put in some serious work, and the process is much more complicated than I could explain here. Here is a Due Diligence (DD for short) checklist to evaluate a company. That said, it is simplified to the point of worthlessness really while being a start. Before you make a decision if you should own a company or not, you must know these things:\n\n* What does the company do?    \nHow do they earn money from that?  \nWhat is the edge or competitive advantage of the company?    \nWhat prevents someone else to just out-compete them by spending more money?    \n\n\n* How are they priced now?    \nWhat does their stock costs, and what does that make their valuation (Stock price * Number of shares = Market cap (company market value))  \nWhat does that market value imply?   \nIf they are high priced, high growth & returns are expected. Is it likely that they will complete that or even do better? This is what would move the stock price.  \n\n* What are the company's competitors?  \n What makes this company a better pick than the competitors?  \n\n* Understand their balance sheet!  \n What is their net cash?   \nHow leveraged are they?  \nIs inventory increasing or decreasing (inventory increasing faster than sales is a horrible sign)?  \n   How solvent are they?   \nWhat's their book value?  \nWhat do these numbers actually imply about the company?   \n\n* Think about growth and developments!\nHow does their best-case scenario look?\n Same for the bad scenario, good scenario, worst-case scenario, and realistic scenario. How likely would you say each scenario is? Try to find facts to back your hypothesis up!\n\n\n**Questionaire**\n\nLastly, and honestly most importantly, here is a list of things you should ALWAYS be able to answer before buying security, equity, or derivative:\n\n* Why am I getting this instead of an index? Where is the upside?  \n* If the stock goes up, what action do I take? When do I sell? At what price or % gain.  \n* If the stock goes down, when do I sell? At what % loss or a price.  \n* What risks are there? How does the worst-case realistic scenario look like?  \n* Why am I making this investment right now? Is there a better time?  \n* What exactly am I buying?   \n\nAnd finally, always, without exception, perform your own due diligence. Don’t take advice from other people without understanding the situation yourself. I never give advice on what to do, I make it a rule to just spread my viewpoint & strategy. If you have to ask questions, you should not own the equity. Ask about what you do not own. If you have to ask questions about equity you already own, you have messed up. Try to not mess up again.\n\n**Oh.** Remember, you will get cocky. You will get greedy. We all do. Everyone thinks they can do it all and make the cash rain. WHEN that happens (not if), make sure you follow your system, because, without the system, you will lose over time.\n\nWelcome to the market.\n\n/u/lykosen11", "id": "8otywg", "created_utc": 1528228581.0, "score": 280, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "awesome write-up /u/lykosen11!\n\nthank you for taking the time!\n\nthis is great stuff man.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man, appriciate it!

However, I've found through my investing career that it only goes so far. If youre lucky, you will buy and do well. However, over long enough time and on standard developments, stocks start doing bad. Something happens, issues pop up, competitors rise up, markets change. When that happens, if you do not fully understand the business you bought, you hold no edge. You have no advantage and since other people do know, you are actually on a disadvantage. You need understanding of the business to hold long term, or absolute faith in the leadership that they can maneuver it. It's super easy to invest while it goes well.\n\nFor example, Uber is currently looking to partner with Waymo to handle autonomous driving. If Uber drops on this development, and it looks like they won't be an industry leader, you need to understand their business to make the right call if it will hurt Uber or not in the long term. If you don't want to lose a lot, you need to know this before the market is unified, and the stock tanks. Similarly in the opposite case, to buy the dip while the market is unsure, since you're sure that it won't affect their growth and earnings at all. \n\nYour method however is fantastic for finding companies to research. It's very similar to my own method to find companies to build fundamental models, summaries and development structures for. \n\n\n", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.
