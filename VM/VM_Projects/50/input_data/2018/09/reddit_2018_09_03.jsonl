{"title": "Covered Calls Income - August Recap", "selftext": "Hello WallStreetBets,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast month I created [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95675f/covered_calls_income/), and I said that I would follow up with how I am sticking to my covered call only strategy. My goal is to make $500 a month off of around $20,000 to $25,000 in investments, which is 24%-30% annually. Although I cheated and played with calls and puts, I stuck to the spirit of my original post and only SOLD these calls/puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are [my trades](https://i.imgur.com/Ocyv0CM.png). I'll explain each one and plan what I should do next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. KR Put **\\[NET GAIN: $8.40\\]** : I had money sitting around so I wanted to sell a put. I didn't mind owning Kroger at that price either. I made $8.40 lol. Put expired worthless and the strike was $29.00. I did this trade before I made my original post.\n2. TWTR Call **\\[NET GAIN: $145.35\\]** : I bought 100 shares for $32.05 and sold a call with a $32.50 strike. Twitter shot up so I bought my call back and sold the shares. Unfortunately, I was in class and did not calculate this on my spreadsheet, and due to commissions, this trade cost me $19.60. I should have let it expire. Although I did make $281.55 on the shares, buying back the call lost me $136.20. \n3. KR Call **\\[NET GAIN: $85.35\\]** : I bought 100 shares for $30.05 and sold a call with a $30.50 strike. I let the call expire and the shares get called away from me. I made $39.95 (not official, this will happen on Tuesday after Labor Day weekend) on the shares being called away and $45.40 on the premium collected for selling the call.\n4. MU CALL **\\[NET GAIN: $115.40\\]** : I bought 100 shares for $52.52 per share. I sold a $54.50 strike call. I collected some SWEEEEET MU premium, and I still own the shares.\n5. CVS CALL **\\[NET GAIN: $205.73\\]** : I love CVS. I've been selling calls on it for a while now. My cost basis (not including premiums collected before) is $68.73/share. $69.50 strike. I bought back the call a week before expiry and sold the shares. Doing that made me an additional $80 so that was a good call.\n6. AMD PUT **\\[NET GAIN: 60.40\\]** : $19.50 strike. I wish I bought calls lol.\n7. MU PUT **\\[NET GAIN: $36.40\\]** : I had already sold my shares of CVS and TWTR so I had cash sitting around. I figured I'd sell an MU put and collect some SWEEEEET MU premium. Sold the put with a strike of $50.50. *I haven't really gotten into strategies yet, but I think this is called a covered strangle*. This contract expired worthless. Even if it had been exercised, it would have let me reduce my cost basis on MU (shown in #3).\n8. IQ CALL AND PUT **\\[NET GAIN: $63.80\\]** : Fuck IQ I guess lol. My cost basis was $33.50 from a put I sold last month. I sold a $33.50 call (expired worthless, collected $24.40). Also sold a $29.50 put (got exercised, collected $39.40). Now I have 200 shares at $31.24/share (decent I guess). The problem with IQ is that it dropped so low that I couldn't get decent premium until I sold the call and put on the 27th of August, so the Monday of the expiration week.\n\n\\*ALL THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRED THE 31ST, EXCEPT FOR #1\n\nFor the month of August, I made $720.83. The problem is any idiot could've made money this month, even though my main strategy (covered calls) is used for sideways or slightly bearish markets. I am hoping I can continue to make over $500/month in the coming months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am considering using diagonal spreads to sell calls against, I need to research the strategy more. I am also considering buying 100 shares of $BABA and selling monthly calls (which is $500 premium for my chosen strikes) lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime for September plays, I will update again.", "id": "9ci1dy", "created_utc": 1535945000.0, "score": 106, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "nice work i enjoyed reading this.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.
