Problem solved.\n\nGuns - Require more training before any non-single shot(eg bolt action) rifles and limit clip sizes to 7 or 8 on pistols.  Bigger pistol clips can be acquired after finishing the required gun safety courses.  Of course subsidies for poor families that cant pay for it.\n\nCops shouldnt kill people.

Also I'm kind of busy so I'll stick to the bigger points.\n\nFirst of all, learn the difference between magazine and clip before you start proposing legislation. Secondly, you seem to be misunderstanding the purpose of the second amendment. It's not for \"sporting\" or hunting, it's for shooting people. Specifically it's for shooting anybody that wants to infringe on your other inalienable rights. That's literally the whole point of it. I can't understand how much your mother must have had to drink while she was carrying you because this is something that should be clear as day.\n\nYou want to see what happens when people are disarmed by the US government? Go read about Wounded Knee. You probably won't so let me break it down for you: Government tells Indians to turn in their guns. Indians turn in their guns. Government massacres 297 Indians, 200 of which were women or children. Police were mysteriously absent during the entire ordeal.\n\nAlso, wtf is this shit:\n\n>If someone is in a situation where guns need to be used, then swat should be called\n\nWhat kind of CoD retarded fantasy do you live in where SWAT is on call at a moment's notice? Their response time is even worse than the regular cops, and that shit can be up to an hour or more in some places. Also, read about Warren v. District of Columbia. I know you won't do this either so let me break it down for you: three women are raped and tortured for 14 hours. Cops are called but decided \"nah.\" Supreme court rules that police have no duty to protect you or your loved ones. Kinda throws a wrench in the whole \"just call the police bro, they'll come and save you\" argument, huh?\n\nFinally:\n\n>Home Depot is a store where you buy ALL the tools\n\nI buy my tools either online or from the Snap On guy. \n\nFaggot.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Stop!
