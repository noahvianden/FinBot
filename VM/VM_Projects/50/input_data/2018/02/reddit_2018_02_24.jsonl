When I was watching the trading on Friday, I noticed the ES futures were consistently traded less than SPX.  Sometimes by as much as a buck or two and I realized something.  If someone had a short interest in the market (say if bridgewater's short position extended to the largest US companies), and wanted to use someone else's money for additional leverage they could open large quantities of short positions on ES at market price to drive the price down?  Arbitrage bots would then step in, buy the futures and sell the underlying (all components of SPX) to drive spx' s price down and raise the futures price so they match.  So if there's a 5% margin requirement, the hedge fund or large player can get 20:1 leverage on their ability to drive the price of the market down.  On Friday I noticed that whenever spx got near 2730 there was a big spike downwards like a big player was trying to hold it down.  Once 2730 broke, it appeared like a short squeeze happened as the price rocketed up 15+ points in under an hour.  If someone had a short position in many of spx's largest companies (Apple, msft, fb, jpm, brk, etc) would it be legal for them to use 20:1 arbitrage bot leverage in the ES futures market to try and manipulate the share price of their shorts downwards?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your last posts were between 2-6 years ago.
