{"title": "For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing.", "selftext": "#DON'T PANIC\n\n(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)\n\nFor what it is worth this is my advise:\n\nSAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. \n\n#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. \n\n\n::\n# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. \n\n::\n\nI was really just talking about pocket change \n\nTry to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. \n\nIf you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.\n\nThis is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. \n\nYou either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. \n\nMy grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. \n\nGo to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. \n\nNone of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  \n\nIn 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. \n\nDon't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?\n\nBroad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. \n\nI like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. \n\nPick a solid broker, read above. \n\n#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. \n\nDon't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)\n\nStart with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.\n\nAfter you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. \n\nMaybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. \n\nAfter you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  \n\nDon't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. \nIf you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. \n\nIf you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. \n\nLook at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.\n\nDon't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea.

Many Western countries have young people locked out of their housing markets, many of those would be home buyers will be looking for alternative investments (and possibly have more time to research investments if they're stuck at home), and there has been a rise in apps like sharesies that allows them to put the (relatively, for investing) tiny amounts of money they would usually spend on takeaways etc into shares, the overall effect of which has pushed prices up. A lot of investments related to \"trendy\" things like veganism, environmental stuff, Tesla, and that kind of thing have all experienced quite a bit of growth from what I've seen, though I will admit that I haven't looked too far into it, which fits with this idea as people usually invest in what they know.\n\n>Combine this with younger people having notoriusly short attention spans these days and often poor ability to delay gratification, as well as often not being super financially stable and needing to draw from those investments to cover expenses - especially if they've lost their jobs in the later waves of lockdowns - and it's inevitable that they will start selling off what they've brought.

Investing for Dummies - I hate to resort to these kind of guides, but this one is somewhat worth it as a starting point. It's an 8 books-in-1. More like 8 subjects in one, but it's a good starting point. The section on fundamental analysis is the most helpful. However it jumps around somewhat (and the author of that section suggests to buy the book \"Fundamental Analysis for Dummies\", so you know it's not the entire book in that 8-in-1 book). I recommend this book only because it's a broad introduction into investing, finance, real estate investing, retirement planning, etc...\n\n2. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. I'm half way through reading this book and have learned a tremendous amount. This guy has a cult following, even though he passed away in the recent past. You will understand the concepts of compound interest AND compound fees. Yes...compound fees, as in mutual funds and what money managers charge. It all adds up. You will get a deeper understanding of index funds and why they are a good idea to have in your portfolio. This book is really worth getting for sure. It will get you started with how to think like an investor, not a gambler.\n\n3. Elements of Investing by Malkiel and Ellis. Haven't read this yet. However I have read Malkiel's book \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" (that was a good book, however I read it in the 1990's and need to read again LOL. Essentially it says everything is BS and you can pick stocks at random and still do as good as the pros. Throwing darts at the stock pages to pick stocks vs going with a pro). Anyhoo, \"Elements of Investing\" gets great reviews and the author's are well regarded in both academia and the real world.\n\n4. Anything by Benjamin Graham. This was Warren Buffetts mentor. I just bought \"The interpretation of Financial Statements\" published in 1937 and has been in continuous reprint. Haven't read it yet but since I have no background in truely analyzing financial statements, accounting or any of that stuff, I figured it is worthwhile. It's considered a classic text in value investing and fundamental analysis. \n\nI did download Grahams \"Intelligent Investor\" on Kindle and am currently on Chapter 4. As far as I can tell, this book gives the reader a real fundamental understanding of the stock market as a whole and it's history of the \"ups and downs.\" BTW the stock market in the US has been more \"up\" than \"down\". Knowing this info helps put investing in perspective. This book is highly regarded and I would not ignore it.\n\n5. If you are like me, I have never taken an accounting class or a finance class. No problem because you can pick up Accounting and Finance books at used book stores and thrift stores. And by books, I'm talking about college textbooks. The kind that cost $150 when you go to college, but cost only $2-$5 in the real world. These are good references to have to double check if a formula you are using is correct or if your approach to something is correct.\n\nI hope this helps.

Here is the financial advice that I plan to give to him. On his birthday, I will hand him a hundred dollar bill and a 1 gram 9999 pure gold foil 100 dollar note. Both have a similar value. One is money, the other is currency, a promise to pay issued by the government. Think about how over time, the difference in value each will hold. In 1978, when I was 18, gold was 168.00 an oz. Yesterday it was 1750.00. Has the price of gold increased or the value of the dollar decreased? Food for thought.\n\nEstablishing a rock solid foundation is critical. \nTell yourself that 10% of all I earn is mine to keep. Repeat it daily, take it to heart. 10 PERCENT OF ALL I EARN IS MINE TO KEEP.   Worth repeating, over and over until it gets so deeply ingrained it is what you do without even thinking about it. \n10% to keep and to invest. That's only 10 bucks out of every hundred. You spend that on 2 trips to the drive through coffee place or a fast food meal and never give it a second thought.\n\nEstablish an emergency fund. It should be 3 to 6 months of your minimum living expenses. Put this in a bank money market account. Think of this as an insurance policy, something you never spend.  \n\nEstablish a long term savings account for major purchases. Amount varies depending on your goal.  If you're planning on purchasing a vehicle or real estate, put aside money to make that happen. \n\nThere is good debt and bad. Stay out of \"bad debt\" like credit cards. Never put anything on a credit card that which you cannot pay off by the end of the billing cycle. \nA good credit rating is like gold in the bank. The better your credit, the better interest rate you get. Establish credit early and use it prudently. \n\nAfter you have a solid foundation on which to build  remember that savers are loosers, except for the intended goals stated above. Savings depreciate in value over time.  INVEST! Remember your 10%?  do more if you can. If you have an employer that will contribute matching funds into a retirement account, max it out!  A employer that offers tax deferred 401 k or 457, same thing.  Most all of them are in stock market mutual funds of some kind. That's not an option? Self directed Roth IRA.  Learn the magic power of compounding interest.\n\nChoose investments wisely, investing is a little like gambling. You place your bet that a stock is going to rise in value, not fall. That real estate investment will rise in value. Do your homework. Due diligence pays dividends. I cannot stress the importance of this enough. Diversify your holdings, never put all of your shillings in one basket. I can't tell you what to buy, only what i would do at the moment. \n\nStock markets are fluid and ever changing. With experience  comes foresight, the ability to pick more winning investments than loosing ones.  Look at the economy, look at trends. Especially look at investors like Warren Buffet. Emulate what successful investors like him do. If Buffet buys a gold mine and drops airline stocks from his portfolio, what should you do?  Create a power group.

A PMCC is only a CC by name, it's not actually a CC with all of the usual automatic handling. Most brokers don't have any sort of automatic handling of diagonals if the short is assigned or the long expires. Even if they do, you shouldn't rely on it.

{"title": "Inflation impulse sets off precious metals, once they get going it can snowball quickly. Some advice for anyone looking to jump into Silver or Gold", "selftext": "TLDR, Buy PSLV as the buy, hold, and forget trade of the decade, avoid SLV \n\nThis is a quick DD just getting a few facts out there in case anyone searches WSB for gold or silver today in light of inflation picking up.\n\nFirst, on the ‘Citadel owns SLV’ line. SLV is garbage so it kind of makes sense. Secondly, citadel is a market maker. They are long and short pretty much every stock, so good luck avoiding anything they have their hands on. Thirdly, it’s a minuscule portion of their portfolio. Net long position likely less than 0.1% of their AUM.\n\nThe fed is likely to cap rates as they respond to to higher inflation.  They might not announce anything, but look at the size of their purchases when the data comes out.  In many ways they’ve already begun YCC.\n\nThis means that as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall because nominal yields are capped.  This is extremely positive for gold and silver.\n\nI prefer silver to gold because in a raging bull market for PMs, silver will greatly outperform gold.\n\nSilver’s industrial and jewelry use is coming closer to eclipsing the annual production. You may not know that silver is used in solar panels, electric cars, and really anything that’s electronic and expensive. This is because it is the most conductive of all elements.  If you are bullish on green tech, silver is a natural play. As monetary demand comes in, it just doesn’t have the capacity to absorb it, which is why it can spike.\n\nYou may remember the silver squeeze movement that took off for about 3 days on WSB back in late January.  Barely anyone joined that train as virtually everyone was still playing GME (and still are, keep holding GME brothers) and yet it still had a fairly large impact.\n\nThe supply situation is far tighter today than it was 2.5 months ago, so people jumping in the silver train now will be far more impactful. \n\nAlso, we’ve learned that SLV is a scam, and silver surfers probably shot themselves in the face by buying it.\n\nHere’s a very long DD that explains it. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nBroken into 3 parts, that DD addresses SLV being a scam, the silver short squeeze, and the fundamental case for silver.\n\nEssentially to properly buy silver through an ETF you need to buy PSLV, not SLV.\n\nIf you still own SLV because of embedded taxable gains, know that SLV gets taxed as a ‘collectible’ which is super shitty. It means it gets hit with your marginal tax rate up to a max of 28%.\n\nPSLV on the other hand gets normal cap gains tax rates which are always lower at 15-20%.  Even if you have taxable gains now, if you think silver is going to double or more then switching now still means you come out ahead due to the larger future gains getting hit with the lower tax rate.\n\nIn the silver squeeze world there are many ways to play it,\n\nPSLV is like buying shares, it directly contributes to the snowballing of the squeeze. It’s also highly marginable so you can get a leveraged pure play on the metal if you want\n\nMiners are like call options on the metal, but also frequently mine other things than just silver and carry political risk and other types of risk, not a complete pure play, but some of them can be very close\n\nThere are also call options on miners. \n\nMost of the miners are too small in terms of market cap to post here unfortunately.\n\nIf you want more info go read the longer DD I posted in the link above!\n\nPSLV, not SLV\n\n\n\n\nAlso:  PSLV was also banned on Robinhood a few months ago, so if you are still using that shitty broker please switch to one that won’t try to screw your at every turn", "id": "mq2kxl", "created_utc": 1618321598.0, "score": 731, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 400, "comments": [{"body": "You know you can get better returns here: https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower", "score": 329, "replies": [{"body": "There was report this morning that Bank of America has an $8.3 BILLION short on silver.  \n\nSee https://twitter.com/goldseek/status/1381918992412073992?s=21", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Of course they would want to short a direct competitor to how they make the money from (inflationary FIAT currency not backed by anything)", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bank sells derivative\nIndustrial user buys derivative to lock in price.\nBank buys underlying and stores in warehouse.\n\nIt's not a conspiracy and is normal for every single other commodity market.\n\nBut if YCC happens silver and gold will moon!

{"title": "Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD", "selftext": "I’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.\nSo when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. \nGME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. \nCLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. \nSince then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. \n\n\n\nEnough of history. Retail following:\n\nSince GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. \n\n\n\nFriday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:\n\nOn Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).\nHindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. \nFactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.\nThis further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. \nA lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. \n\n\n\nTechnicals:\n*CLOV free float is 109mil \n*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil\n*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days \n*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%\n\n*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. \n\nA lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.\n\nIn my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: \n-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....\n-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. \n-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. \nSo my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. \n\nFallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions\n-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. \n\nFollowing all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). \n\nI hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. \n\nI won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there.

Nuke plants are somewhat insulated from reduced capacity factor as they are dispatched almost always-on, and deserve to be so because they are carbon free power (especially the existing ones). However many older and smaller nuke plants have already been killed by reduced sale pricing from increased gas and renewables penetration. Nuke plants are even more allergic to low CF that cool/gas are as nukes have high capital costs but ultra low variable costs. A key driver for how long they last will be whether carbon is priced - if it is then coal and gas will be killed off first while the nukes stick around, if it isn't then we'll retire carbon-free nukes while continuing to burn gas and coal.\n\nNote I would not advocate building any new nuclear basically because the LCOE is already uncompetitive even without Tony's predictions on reducing CF, But I absolutely hate the idea of retiring existing nukes (especially newer and safer ones) while continuing to operate (or build new!) coal. (I'm looking at you Germany)\n\nTony's take on hydro is interesting, because reservoir hydro can offset reductions in CF with increased value sales (peak prices are directly inversely correlated to reduced CF).
