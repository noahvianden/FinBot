But investors should be careful not to confuse a buoyant stock price with a sustainably profitable business.\n\nFourth-quarter vehicle deliveries, expected later this week, might keep the momentum going. Analyst consensus calls for Tesla to deliver 106,000 cars in the quarter, according to FactSet. That would be a record for the electric auto maker and amount to roughly 17% unit growth from a year earlier. Wall Street analysts expect nearly $50 billion in annual revenue by 2022, which would be more than double 2019’s projected total.\n\nStill, evidence abounds that Wall Street should curb its enthusiasm. Hitting that figure would mean Tesla barely met the low end of its 2019 guidance, which originally called for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries. At the end of 2018, Tesla said it was selling vehicles at an annualized rate of 350,000. While record deliveries helped Tesla eke out a small third-quarter profit, total revenue fell by 8%. The car company has booked a cumulative net loss of more than $3 billion since sales of the Model 3 sedan began in 2017. Delivery figures should be flattered by the fact that Tesla began selling its Model 3 sedan in overseas markets in 2019.\n\nTesla hasn’t traditionally broken out vehicle deliveries by country for investors, but U.S. automotive revenue fell by 40% from a year ago in the third quarter. The loss of federal tax credits for new Tesla buyers won’t help. Evidently fleeting interest from U.S. buyers should raise questions about how long current strength in markets like China or the Netherlands can persist.

We'll see if I manage to post it this time.\n\nI think Tesla's engineering completely outclasses the vast majority of if not all competitors.  Sure, there's some industry knowledge they're having to learn that competitors have known for decades... but for the most part Tesla is crushing it.  Musk attracts -very- talented people.\n\nThis actually gets to the heart of perhaps 75%+ of what I like about Tesla and maybe half of what I like about Musk... and it's actually a huge part of why I think Tesla is going to be nearly unstoppable for quite some time.\n\nMy strong impression is that the normal process for any modern manufacturing is to optimize as much of your design as possible up front, before building the factory or line... then perhaps take lessons learned to inform the NEXT factory or line.  Improvements and retooling happen, but quite slowly and the scope of individual improvements stays small.  This is MBA-driven management.  (make the business case for something, decide to do it, and get it done)   To justify making a significant improvement on an existing line would take engineers recognizing the potential improvement (I think they're not on the line watching how things run nearly as much as Tesla is), then building a business case and pushing it through to whatever management level is required for it to be approved.  The risk to someone's career for trying out something wildly different and failing would be catastrophic, so it's avoided.\n\nAlso, mediocre engineers LOVE to sit at their desks looking at designs and simulations without \"getting their hands dirty\" or \"stooping to the level of a mechanic\" by going out and watching how everything actually fits together or how the products of their intellectual labor are fully realized in production.  You'd think it'd be obviously a good idea, but it's rarely done.  It's kind of a classist thing... white collar engineers not wanting to go associate themselves with blue collar work.  Good/great engineers usually know that's ridiculous... but mid level really tend to think that way.\n\nI can't tell you how many software development teams I've been a part of that never bothered to send people to watch how people actually use the system.  They just depend on operations managers to feed back new or changed requirements to them.  Those operations people are not software developers though, so they don't fully recognize what can be improved or how it could be different. Whenever I saw how things were actually used, it usually drove me crazy.  Nothing ends up coming of that, though... because there's no incentive for the software managers to be proactive.  They just wait for new requirements.\n\nI've also seen the same sort of thing with machining parts.  Mechanical engineers rarely if ever bother to see how their parts actually get machined.  Machinists pride themselves on figuring out how to machine a difficult part, so difficult parts are actually fun for them.  Sometimes, an enterprising machine shop or machinist may try to suggest improvements... but in effect they're saving the customer time and possibly reducing their billable time.  I've even witnessed engineering managers completely chew out a machinist for having the nerve to suggest there was a better way to do something.  So often, very simple design changes can make parts drastically easier to produce... but there's no incentive for anyone to look for them.  Engineering would just be highlighting how they didn't get it right the first time, and machinists would lose work.  There is a time in the design cycle to look for those improvements... but they're typically just done in a short research stage (relative to how long something is in production) before finalizing the design / building the line.\n\nThen there's the whole \"If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail\" thing with how problems tend to get solved within a person's own domain of expertise.  Rarely are problems correctly divided between domains (Software, mechanical, electrical, etc)... there just aren't enough people that can cross those domains to recognize when something should be done differently.\n\nThese kinds of observations regarding the typically high levels of dysfunction in corporate engineering was perhaps the greatest single piece of encouragement I took in deciding to start my company.  It's why my company is also highly vertical, why I'm still regularly taking a day to go run manufacturing equipment... looking for places to improve.  I can guarantee my approach is a huge part of why we're successful.\n\nI have the strong impression Musk approaches engineering and manufacturing very similarly.  It's so much of what I like about him... it's me cheering from the sidelines as he champions an engineering-driven corporate philosophy vs. the usual MBA-driven one.  He's my guy, he's championing more or less my style of business.  I can finally point to Tesla and SpaceX when one of my kid's friends' MBA parents decide to try to tell me what I'm doing wrong (\"You need to outsource, focus on your core competencies\").  It's far from a definitive justification of a highly vertical, engineering-first approach... but at least I've got something to respond with now.\n\nTesla pays a huge amount of attention on the manufacturing processes and equipment (more than designing the products themselves).  Lately, Musk has been repeating his \"the best process is no process, the best part is no part\" mantra everywhere.  He obviously is not just asking engineers to go design, implement something, and move on... he's focusing them on looking everywhere for some way to improve things.  Making something isn't likely to impress Musk.. Making something BETTER is.  He encourages engineers to take risks when suggesting something and think big.  It's a stronger focus on continuous improvement than (I believe) anywhere else in the competitive landscape, by a wide margin.\n\nThat plus the usual high level of dysfunction in most corporate processes leads me to believe there's a huge scope for possible improvements. This stuff is horribly complex... they'll probably adopt quite a few standard industry practices at first, and slowly figure out what was not so good and improve it.\n\nSo, that's why I believe they have as long way to go on improving margins... and more generally why they're so difficult to beat.\n\nOk, fuck it.
