Economic output fell in the first quarter and signs suggest it did so again in the second. Yet the job market showed little sign of faltering during the first half of the year. The jobless rate fell from 4% last December to 3.6% in May.\n\nIt is the latest strange twist in the odd trajectory of the pandemic economy, and a riddle for those contemplating a recession. If the U.S. is in or near one, it doesn‚Äôt yet look like any other on record.\n\nAnalysts sometimes talked about ‚Äújobless recoveries‚Äù after past recessions, in which economic output rose but employers kept shedding workers. The first half of 2022 was the mirror image‚Äîa ‚Äújobful‚Äù downturn, in which output fell and companies kept hiring. Whether it will spiral into a fuller and deeper recession isn‚Äôt known, though a growing number of economists believe it will.", "id": "vrel2e", "created_utc": 1656961076.0, "score": 481, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 439, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|80|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|147|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vas0sp/why_i_simply_dont_ever_want_to_touch_netflix_stock/) [x](https://i.redd.it/r7gqtrjv79591.png) \n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vrel2e)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vrel2e)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I have the answer.

I've seen it up close. My family is in an area experiencing this. These freshly retired boomers from the northeast are coming in, flushed with cash, snatching up homes left & right.

On the EC they mentioned they made a slight profit, but it was offset by their impairment.\n\nAs for that, the way BTC accounting works is that you are not allowed to recognise any profits until you sell. So if you buy at $10k and BTC goes to $100k, the profit in your books is $0. Once you sell, you are allowed to recognise that profit.\n\nOn the other hand, if it drops below your \"carrying value\", you do need to recognise that impairment. So if you bought for $10k and it drops to $5k, you need to take a $5k loss on your earnings. If after that it goes back to $10k, you're still \"carrying\" it for $5k until you sell. You're not allowed to recoup your losses in the books until you sell. If at any point it goes below the lowest it's been while you were holding it (so $5k in this example), you again need to take an impairment in your books.\n\nSo in short, they made a small profit on the 75% they sold this quarter, but because the other 25% dropped roughly 30% below their carrying value, generating a $100-130M impairment (again, can just calculate this based on the earnings report), that offset the gains from the other 75%.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Dang, thank you very much for clarifying, it makes sense as I can see the reasoning, but this is just awful haha. \n\nThank you very much for taking your time and stress clarifying!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No worries!

Your cash can be easily robbed, not as traceable (which is why all cartels -drug and sex trafficking use it). If we went all digital with the security and lack of printing more money within crypto, you can stop all of that. Did people forget that people commit more fraud with regular money than crypto? How do these people think the media found out bitcoin was used for black market drug deals? BECAUSE they caught them. They seized more drug operations easier than ever before. I honestly think it‚Äôs a fair trade. Banks know most of your transactions already, but if they can see all of it you can actually stop a lot of illegal activity. \n\nOfc my only issue with this is that they would have to make society go cashless. Cash does suck though. It‚Äôs terrible to hold during inflation, it‚Äôs a huge transmitter of disease, is destroyed and created easily, almost infinite supply, hard to trace, used for fucked up illegal trade. If cash was declared worthless, cartels would be forced on the digital system. Even politicians would have all their money activities traced. What we need to set up as a society is make the validators that run the network be people from all over the nation/world and not just the big banks, then crypto will surely be used in a dystopian way. I also have concerns with money use during a blackout. \n\nOnce regulations are set though the scammers in crypto are DONE. NFTs, stablecoins (except usdc), and shitcoins will basically get shut down. \n\nThere are coins that actually **produce** small amounts of energy per transaction, have **instant liquidity**, hard capped supply, fair node systems, etc. People need to start reading white papers. It‚Äôs the best way to educate yourself rather than reading articles written by people who do little to no research and use Buffet as their source. \n\nPeople in here act like crypto ain‚Äôt it but probably only understand bitcoin and ethereum. Maybe tether. Which I personally think all three of them will fail. Bitcoin - 7 transactions per second, lmao only a small population of the world uses it for trading but imagine how poorly it would scale if the whole world went to using bitcoin. Ethereum is a shady organization that has deep ties to legacy banking. Nobody knows who the whales are for their IPO (very problematic). Costs $3000 to buy a $200 NFT, ok lol. \n\nBut check out the technology and read the white papers of Algorand, Hedera Hashgraph, XRP, XLM, XDC, Vechain, etc. and you start to get clarity on how the future will be. These are the tokens that actually save our economy and have known respected people in tech working on them. To those that want to downvote this, let me just say that we have to resort to one or few of these tokens because our current system is literally collapsing in the next few months. We will need currency that provides instant liquidity.\n\nBanks will use the coins that make their systems run better. Remember banks are competing against each other, so the big banks are going to want to keep the corrupt legacy system that everyone here thinks is the way to continue.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Libertarians?

Engineers still lean left although it depends on how you define \"engineer.\" Some colleges call their majors \"engineers\" that are anything but. They are more like technicians or mechanics than engineers. But if you go through an accredited program then odds are you will be doing all the STEM that every other science major has to do. These guys will lean left. Its much higher level of education requiring physics, chem, calc and some bio/life science. \n\nGovernment actually does very little R&D in the grand scheme of things. Also healthcare workers is somewhat varied. Nurses outnumber doctors but nurses can be anything from 1 year of education to 4 years. Most however, are only 1-2 years. This includes many of the technicians and phlebotomists as well. I had that license 1 year after high school. I also got a optician license in about a year as well. These are fairly low level licenses and both are considered \"healthcare.\" They dont require anything but algebra for math, some life sciences specific to the job, and practically no chemistry and practically. The higher level professionals do have to take those classes but most nurses dont go that route nor do most technicians.\n\nSo when we say \"healthcare\" workers its important to note a huge divide in education and to also note that even the lesser educated make well over $100k.\n\nThere are plenty of sites that show the education divide and you can easily correlate that to trends in majors.

ARM isn't taking over because ARM has no intrinsic advantage in high performance CPUs.\n\nLike I mentioned it needs to be better at something in order to take over. And it isn't better, it's worse at a number of things. The most notable one is the sheer size of the PC ecosystem and the millions of programs that were written for x86. ARM looks good compared to Intel because Intel is struggling particularly in efficiency, but AMD isn't struggling. They clearly have the best architecture with industry leading PPA (that's Power Performance Area, the magic triangle). Their processors look impressive even with a node disadvantage, which tells you that x86 at least as far as AMD is concerned are as ahead of ARM architecturally as they have always been. If 6800u can provide similar multithreaded performance with less transisotrs at same efficiency as M2 while being a node behind. That means Zen is actually architecturally superior and can deliver more performance when all else is equal. Because the 5nm Zen4 will be significantly better and more efficient. So node for node Zen > M2. \n\nAnd Apple's processor is the most impressive of the ARM bunch because it's a custom core they designed, which fits their use case, but it comes at a cost of using the bleeding edge node (ahead of everyone else) and at the cost of area.

Designing high performance cores is an expensive and arduous process. Zen 1 took 5 years to design, next Zen 5 by the time is released will have taken 4 years. No one is going to spend 4-5 years of engineering time and just give the RTL source away for free.

This statistic is hotly debated.

Unemployment numbers always increase in a broad decline decline in general economic activity because in that circumstance there's no other sector to pick up the slack. So according to the NBER, whether unemployment is 10% or 50% or 80% is irrelevant, because the other factors they use, aside from GDP, correlate strongly with unemployment.\n\nIf people spend a lot less, demand drops and employment drops. The question is whether it's meaningful and represents a broad decline in activity.\n\nI am saying the FRED data correlating is NOT revelation.

Anybody who's ever had a job knows that people stop looking for work when they get an offer, and that in the period between leaving their old job and joining a new one, not only do people typically take a week or two off, but it also takes a few weeks for companies to report new payroll admission because of lag in processing.\n\nThis matters. People leave the workforce and aren't on the payroll between jobs, and when you have low unemployment, when you have job growth without growth in the laborforce that typically means you have people changing jobs in many cases.\n\n**This doesn't need data to prove, it's an inherent and known and often advertised limitation in the BLS' data collection methodology, which is why people don't hyperfocus on wobble in monthly jobs and workforce numbers.**\n\nI also don't need a separate dataset to demonstrate it because, again, it's directly inherent in the source of the dataset you're using per the BLS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Labor Participation rate is also an odd choice for you to make.

That's evident, and the BLS admits it.\n\nThe onus is on you to prove that a statistical wobble of 0.2% of the workforce demonstrates a blindspot in unemployment data such that we can't use it to assess current economic conditions.\n\nThat's your claim, and it's not proven by your analysis of the numbers.

Do not pass go, do not collect $200.\n\nAnd here's the thing: We know this because the BLS publicly posts its methodology and explains it in their reports. They literally adjust the figures every month to account for the wobble you're citing.\n\nIt's not a big secret, there's no scam, and there's no bamboozling. The White House didn't redefine a recession, as you've admitted every time you cite the NBER's definition.\n\nIt's OK to say that all of these other factors point to a possible recession, I'm not arguing that... what I'm arguing is that you're skewing data to claim some grand political conspiracy when ironically everything you're citing is all public data and agrees with the administration and the Fed.\n\nAbandon the conspiracy bullshit and the politicking based on misunderstanding the data and I'm on board with your argument that a recession is likely, but we can only get there by agreeing on bedrock principles.\n\nOne of those principles is that we are not just wandering aimlessly in the dark and questioning data is not the same as it being useless. We can assess magnitude of imperfection and come to conclusions, like the fact that 0.2% wobble in this environment in the numbers you cited doesn't really mean anything.\n\nWe also need to agree that the NBER has long held that a recession is not just based on GDP and as such no one's redefining anything.\n\nYou've already admitted that point is bullshit every time you cite the NBER methodology, so just fucking be consistent and abandon the bullshit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">I am saying that the FRED data uses a declaration which heavily relies on unemployment.\n\nYou're missing my point.\n\nShow me the NBER calculation used to determine a recession has a heavy weight assigned to employemnt and you have a point.\n\nYou don't have thay calculation.

The NBER wouldn't take notice of an 80% unemployment rate.\n\n>the FRED data uses a declaration which heavily relies on unemployment\n\n?\n\nThat just doesn't make any sense.\n\nYour argument is the FRED uses the NBER determination of a recession in its data and that the NBER uses employment as a **major** data point in its determination. But the NBER thinks unemployment is irrelevant.\n\n>What I did was look at the numbers you're making a big deal about and assess their legitimacy in prediction and with regard to the veracity of the numbers\n\nYou're rejecting a thesis that unemployment data does not correlate to a recession based on the fact that a recession cannot be defined by the NBER.\n\nBut you're providing no suggestion as to how to how one could ascertain when a recession begins or ends so we could compare that to unemployment.\n\nI guess there is no way to define a recession in your mind.\n\nSo why bother discussing it at all.\n\nYou can't clearly demonstrate that unemployment levels do not have a correlation with a recession.\n\nBut you are certain unemployment levels do rise mid/late in a recession.\n\nYou're arguments are circuitous and self-contradicory.

You're focusing your argument on one sole point while ignoring all the other evidence I provided in support of the fact that, along with the FRED data, unemployment will rise.\n\nYou're trying to be right instead of considering more data that proves you're not.\n\nJust like the Fed and the White House.\n\n>unemployment has a relationship to calculated workforce participation and is dependent on that number. What I'm discussing here is the statistical implications of people leaving and re-entering the job market, which influences unemployment numbers.\n\nCorrect. And, coincidentally, both the labor participation rate and unemployment tend to behave the same way before and during a recession.\n\nA point I didn't bother to make because you so strongly object to the FREDs delineation of a recession vis a vis employment. (because it's based on NBER data which you state has a *major* factor which you can't actually know).\n\n>you're skewing data to claim some grand political conspiracy when ironically everything you're citing is all public data and agrees with the administration and the Fed.\n\nAnother straw man argument.\n\nI did not state there was \"a grand political conspiracy\".

That's either bullshit or naivety.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "There's nothing to respond to here. Your response is just vomit from the very start.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward: The NBER uses unemployment as a primary criteria for whether we're in a recession or not and it's a side effect of a mass indicator broad economic decline, which is necessary to be in an **economic** recession.\n\nNot a GDP recession... an economic recession.\n\nThat's not debatable, you've already said it several times, yet when I say it you move the goalposts and say I need to show their formula or that you have these 4 other reasons (which were not in the original argument and are not in the \"correct\" {to you} definition of recession you keep using repeatedly which is two periods of negative GDP)... you just keep trying to dodge the obvious reality which is that to have an actual decline in overall broad economic activity across every sector you need to actually have a meaningful and broad economic decline in overall activity, which GDP does not alone represent.\n\nIt's easy to understand, but it doesn't reinforce your biases so you're doing somersaults to avoid seeing even the most basic sliver of light.\n\nFor instance:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That 315K loss is very relevant in comparison to the 372K gain that the BLS is also representing took place in a different survey. That was the point.  \n>  \n>There is a discrepancy of 687K in those numbers. When discussing numbers that are 300-400K, that is hugely relevant.\n\nI already explained this, and the BLS report you linked also explains it.\n\nThese numbers do not actually conflict, which you'd know if you read the report. What you are seeing is overlap in the data because the two surveys happen side by side at different rates through the month.\n\nThe BLS employment situation survey you're all in a wad over at [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm) shows the following relevant statistics:\n\nCivilian labforce: -353k\n\nWorkforce Participation rate change: -0.1% (this is subject to rounding error, and the number is between -0.1 and -0.2% once accounted for)\n\nEmployed: -315k\n\nUnemployment rate: 3.6% (unchanged)\n\nSome of these are retirements, deaths, etc... people who actually left the laborforce. I don't need to go into deeper data than that because it's not really up for debate. Every month people die and retire, and it's a factor that we already agree on.\n\nIn the end, you made the claim that this survey said we lost \"315k jobs.\"\n\nIt does not say that, it says workforce participation rate reduced by around that amount. You don't think there's a difference because you don't understand the source of this data or how it's calculated.\n\nTo get this data, the BLS asks two questions:\n\n1. Are you currently employed?\n2. Have you been searching for a job in the past 4 weeks?\n\nPeople who have accepted new jobs (in your \"created jobs\" data in the month of June) are quite likely to be between jobs, still on the payroll from their old job, and  may or may not be on the official payroll at their new job yet.\n\nThe BLS does not survey the entire country, so these are projections based on a sample. That produces statistical risk wobble. Because this overlap exists between the two reports, ask yourself this question:\n\n**Would people accepting new jobs in June be likely to be out of a job and not looking for a job during the period between jobs?**\n\n**The answer is \"of course they fucking are\" and this is the reason why the numbers are constantly being revised.**\n\n**This is a known limitation of the two datapoints. It does not represent an additive discrepancy of 687k jobs, which is hands down of all of the dumb things you've said the dumbest fucking thing you said. A learning disabled 9th grader in a high school stats class would know not to add these fucking numbers.**\n\nWhat will happen when you have unemployment stay the same and an increase in filled jobs is that someone has to leave their original job to go to their new job. There will then often be a lag filling the old job, and that's exaggerated lag when there are limited candidates like right now.\n\n**I'm not pulling anything out of the ether here. Anyone who's ever had a job knows it works this way.**\n\n**I don't need any extra data to prove it, because it's in the fucking data you already provided.**\n\nBut either you don't understand that data, or you're intentionally misrepresenting it.\n\nIn response you're saying I'm trying to say it's too complex to assess... to the contrary, **I'm saying that if you actually fucking consider the way the BLS gets the data and the mechanics of the labor force, it's not that mystical or uncertain or imprecise at all. In fact, the BLS is pretty open about how imprecise the data is and isn't.**\n\n# Unlike you, I actually took the time to work the numbers to see if they matched your claim, and they don't.\n\nAnd yes, my analysis of this datapoint doesn't take into account any of your other points because I'm only assessing this one point in this response.\n\nYou say that's \"sharpshooter bias\" but for that to be the case, I'd have to be arguing that a recession is not likely, and therefore your other datapoints would be relevant.\n\nBut as I have said multiple times, sometimes in bolded letters, I am not saying we are definitely not entering into a recession. In fact, in the very post you're responding to I acknowledged that those 4 points are possible signs of economic weakness. (Whether they are or not is a much longer discussion.)\n\nYou made a specific claim, I referenced your own data to demonstrate that it doesn't mean what you think it does.\n\nThe bottom line here is that you are apparently incapable of doing full research before forming opinions, having fallen into a rather deep pit of logic failures in trying to collect data to make your claims... first in completely misunderstanding the FRED chart and now with a thoroughly and extraordinarily basic misunderstanding of BLS statistical data... not to mention a complete and total butchering of the very field of statistical analysis... in order to create an absurd claim that we can't see big layoff data in current unemployment data.\n\nMy point here is that we can measure the degree of imprecision and understand where there are contradictions by digging into the data.\n\nYou are literally saying \"It's too complex, so let's throw our hands in the air and just not use the data.\"\n\nYou keep accusing me of that in an extraordinarily infantile and stupid projection play, but that's basically the entire point you're making about unemployment and it's just dumb.\n\nIf we lost 1M jobs this past month, it's going to show up in the data. It'll be significant. The degree of imprecision here is knowable and these numbers don't conflict the way you think they do.\n\nNo amount of muddying the water, or misattribution, or claims of fallacies (which are almost all bullshit on your part representing a lack of understanding of fallacies, too), or bad math that would keep you behind a year in elementary school is going to change that.\n\nSee here's the thing, though: Your trollish, Internet debate methods give you away. I don't think you're actually dumb enough to come to stupid conclusions like the idea that this data is readily comparable such that you can claim there's a discrepancy.\n\nI think you know your argument's a misrepresentation of the data, so you're trying to cover it up by confusing the thread and using alt-right style inertia methods akin to 4chan and projecting your own arguments onto me.

At worst, people are ginning this up for clicks or political/economic motivations.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many times people modified Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not an authoritative source on what a recession is.\n\nOver 20 years ago, when I got my education, the definition of a recession as being more than just GDP retraction was pretty well set in, and had been for decades before that. It is true that there is no universally agreed-upon definition of a recession among economists (which is true for most things in economics because this is not a simple discipline).\n\nThe problem is that \"recession\" is a loaded term, and GDP retraction DOES NOT always result in the types of behavior people commonly associate with a recession, like mass economic difficulty and spending reductions of significant scale.\n\nThis is why the extended definition matters. We typically in common discussion say \"a recession is technically two periods of negative GDP\" because two periods of negative GDP is a relatively rare of an occurrence and we want to calm people down who get freaked out over ANY negative GDP print (which is not as rare as people think and doesn't always mean what people think it does).\n\nUnfortunately, people are generally unsophisticated and complicated topics confuse them, so autistically delving into complex topics as I'm prone to do doesn't always penetrate (as I'm sure it will not penetrate for many people here who either do not want to understand this topic or who are talking their book, and I will let people figure out who is who but both types of people exist in this sub).  So we tend to stay away from the complex part of the discussion until we have to address it.\n\nAlso unfortunately, this leads to misconceptions, like the conclusion drawn about the FRED chart on unemployment.\n\nThat chart tracks declared recessions. The fact that unemployment is a lagging indicator from declared recessions is not revelational. It's literally in the criteria the NBER uses to declare a recession...\n\nWhen we're looking at the FRED graph, if we understand that the NBER declares recessions based on factors like unemployment elevation rather than just negative GDP, it's not a surprise that the shaded grey areas are where the unemployment spikes are and end when they slow.\n\nThat's just in the fucking definition being used to shade the graph, and is NOT the question we're asking looking forward. This is a fantastic example of mining the history in a chart to find a pattern that doesn't exist looking forward.\n\n# The REAL question: Does two periods of GDP retraction predictably lead to a recession as defined by the NBER (meaning with the social ills we associate with recessions)?\n\nIf you overlay the graph of relative GDP changes, which is the datapoint that is actually pertinent, not recessions that don't fit that definition looking back, you'll find that decline in relative growth rate is not strictly tied to the social and economic issues people tie to recessions, like market crashes and mass unemployment spikes.\n\nSo can we look forward and predict a market crash from GDP retraction?\n\nThe answer is that this condition is more common than crashes, and so we cannot do so.\n\nThe logic used to claim that a crash is predictable on the basis of tracking low unemployment is also flawed because it uses the same flawed logic people use when they say \"VIX is at support, so the market has to crash.\"\n\nNo it fucking does not have to crash, and a lot of people got washed out this past week thinking this same broken logic. (I got washed out from my puts, too, as I was also short-heavy, but not because I fell into the VIX idiot trap.)\n\nLagging indicators cannot, by definition, predict the future. VIX lags and unemployment lags... this is only a surprise to people who do not understand the topic. What happens is that these conditions happen frequently enough that people build tactical methodologies around them and losing a certain number of times is manageable.\n\nWhat isn't manageable is dumping all of your money in puts because someone on the Internet told you that GDP was a reliable indicator for crashes based on the wrong data that is backward looking, not forward looking, nor even tied to the claim about GDP.\n\n**Now I want to be clear, and I'm going to bold this so people fucking get it. I'm NOT convinced the bear market is over, nor am I convinced that we won't have a recession...**\n\n...**my point is simply to educate people and clarify that the information in this post DOES NOT PROVE THE CLAIM.**\n\nIt's an interesting argument, but the chart and the argument do not prove definitively that the bear market is intact as presented. It may in fact be, and I am not betting that it's over. We do not have confirmation of that in the chart based on past review of volume and price action trends of prior corrections/crashes.\n\nI'm just really tired of people talking their book frankly lying about people redefining a recession when that's not the case.\n\nAnd it's bad advice to suggest that it's a sure thing that we're taking another leg down on this basis, when we really don't know that. Much of the market is already down between 50-80% at the trough, which if we're going to oscillating indicators like market breadth as an indication is a pretty good sign of the end of a bear market. People will tell you that a capitulation crash has to occur where megacaps all take the same hit.. it historically does not.\n\nThe most reliable indicator I've found of a reversal is the flattening and breaking of On Balance Volume trends, because they correlate price and volume in the market, and that correlates to buying inflow which is what really decides reversals. Even then, the trend can fake people out and we do not have confirmation there yet even though the OBV trend is looking like it's possibly ready for a bullish reversal.\n\nSo I recommend a guarded position. I don't think it's sound fiscal advice to suggest a switch to short here if you're positioned bullish except with regard to a contrarian or guarded portfolio stature.\n\nRemember: Somebody's selling you those puts and people are buying puts themselves, and all of them have reason to convince you that a crash is a sure thing so you behave in that manner. Be skeptical. Ask if the information you're being given even makes sense given the situation we're in. Ask if there are conflicting factors, such as the behavior of institutions and addressable capital to put into the market (which is a major factor now because the Fed is NOT pulling all of the capital out of the market... hell they're barely making a dent which makes our current situation very unique relative to past corrections and GDP declines).\n\nSo be wary of arguments like the OP. Nothing in economics is so cut and dry, and the market is \\*definitely\\* not cut and dry and predictable like this. If it was, 2020 would have been a year long bloodbath based on macro scare factors... but it wasn't because context and addressable capital matters.\n\nI'm not necessarily accusing Stockpreacher of that, as I don't know what his motivation is... he may be falling victim to confirmation bias here and may honestly think the cornerstone of their argument means what he thinks it does.

What you're retracing from matters. The amount of capital in the system matters. The social contexts (which drive demand and spending patterns) matter.\n\nFor instance there's an assumption that there's going to be a massive crash in the housing market a la 2008 among some posts here, but the context really is different than 2008 and while I fully expect a continued decline in price in many markets, the debate is really about what happens to that market and whether it replicates prior extreme examples, and there are several things which will help keep the real estate market somewhat propped up, including the Fed continue MBS sequestration and holding risk for the banks and the extreme increase in liquidity in the market particularly among housing speculators.

There always have to winners and losers in the market, and there are lots of ways to find advantage in the market, so deciding when and where to buy is hard whether it's stocks or real estate.\n\nThe big question for me, based on what we learned in 2020, is how much liquidity will be addressable in the system. That's what really drives the market:\n\n\\- How much capital is available to institutions?\n\n\\- How much does accessing that capital cost?\n\n\\- What's the potential for growth? (will offset capital cost)\n\n\\- What's the risk-free rate of return? (The maximum gain from a sure-thing investment, like a 10y T-bill or other type of secured bond)\n\n\\- What's the directional risk in the market, and how do existing market metrics reflect buying tendencies?\n\nThis is a good place to start. This is where you combine your macro, chart, and fundamentals and micros data to find a place to play.\n\n**--- My trending methodology, in brief ---**\n\nRight now we're trending down, so overall bullet point 5 is weighting equity valuations heavily. There are multiple ways to trend the market, but personally I draw a lot from SMMA and EMA matrixes comprised of the SMMA 20, 50, 100, and 200 and EMAs 8, 21, and 50. I do this on the one-year SPY chart (daily candlesticks).\n\nIf you go to tradingview and set these up and zoom out, you'll find that they align in specific ways where the short term moving averages are aligned at the top and the longer term are aligned at the bottom during bull markets. During bear trends it's exactly the opposite, and when the market is flipping directions all kinds of patterns emerge where the averages cross (many youtube and other videos suggest playing these crosses, but in my experience they're only sometimes tradeable - by definition crosses represent periods of volatility and can as a result lead to fake-outs).\n\nI use two charts to do this. The SMMA-based one I call strategic because I'm tracking long term trends. The EMA one is short term, and reflects different patterns in the short range. For SMMAs, because it's longer term, I use the close metric. For the EMAs I use high and low lines, so that I see the range like a cloud on a daily basis. The tactical chart gives short term signals. The strategic term chart confirms the prevailing trend.\n\nOn the Strategic chart, I setup Fibonacci ranges, looking for measured movements and breaks of pattern. Breaks of pattern often coincide with reversals. This is a little tricky, but can be used with Pitchfork and channel analysis to find inflection points, and when the market doesn't continue on a pattern trend at an inflection point where a range and a channel intersect, it's usually violent and causes an unwinding or cover event on a trendline break when backed by reinforcing price action and volume structure.\n\nThere's actually a lot to this and I can't explain all of it right now, but the cornerstone is actually On Balance Volume. I also use channel analysis, trendline intersection on the short term (I'm not 100% sold on the relevance of long-term trend lines), RSI/MACD/Bollinger Bands for minor confirmation and trending (though these are of limited tactical value), and Pitchfork meanline trending based around the fact that the market tends to trade within 2 standard deviations of its established trend meanline until a break happens. (The market broke above this this week, btw)\n\n**--- The importance of On Balance Volume in verifying trend changes and changes in market sentiment ---**\n\nOn Balance Volume measures price action against volume, and volume trends over time dominate outcomes in trends. If people are buying into the market, it'll go up... and if you don't have inflow, it'll go down. There's always a little selling in the market, but buying to balance the selling is only reliable if reinforced by exuberance and trust in the market, but that's driven by the trending since any bull trend induces FOMO.\n\nWhen a bear market rally happens, typically OBV respects its trend. A person looking just at EMAs in March-April would have been faked out on trend, seeing the price action take SPY up into the bullish territory, but OBV respected a long running trend while breaking a short term weak trend, and when it hit the trend (going back to December 3rd) the market began another leg down. OBV can bounce, settle, and then bounce down since it reflects market price, But divergence in OBV that lasts, like when you price for SPY is lower but your OBV is higher than it should be, usually reflect a volatile change and when OBV begins to find support stepping its way up, that can be a sign of reversal of the market. It reflects buyers coming back in volume.\n\n**This is why the institutions are important.**\n\nWhen the Fed began raising rates and tightening, they increased the cost and the race to sell created the pattern of fear that drove institutions to de-leverage and preserve capital. With continuing uncertainty and bad news about the cost of capital and availability of capital from banks in the form of loans (since Fed tightening increases bank reserve capital drawdown - which is a mixed bag for banks right now since it increases their reserve utilization while also increasing risk for new loans), and with the 10y bond going up, the risk-free rate of return against growth prospects was balanced against elevated returns in bonds.\n\nBut the Fed's been influencing the bond market through QT resulting in higher bond volume, which has been influencing the yield curve along with sentiment.\n\nWhat are 10y bond yields doing now? Going down, reflecting a reduction in a risk-free rate of return.\n\nWhere are relative valuations for equities? Down heavily, meaning the potential for growth on return of capital to the market exists.\n\nCapital cost is more expensive, but if the Fed slows raising rates, now there's more certainty about future potential for measurable return rate, which means less risk in buying decisions (since getting stuck while on margin doesn't inherently result in the risk of having to finance at greater and greater rates outside of a predictable rate).\n\nAnd even with tightening, the Fed's not gonna get anywhere near the excess capital in the reserve system... that's gonna remain elevated relative to baseline. We pulled 10 years forward in the banking reserve expansion plan...that's not all coming out at once. It'd destroy the country to do that. So the plan will be to get it down to like 2025-2026 levels is my guess and continue growing from there.\n\nMeaning that liquidity addressable will increase, not decrease over time as people are presuming as banks become more sure of capital deployment and less concerned about Fed fund rate hikes. Banks don't get anything from idle capital, so a reduction in callback risk is tantamount to a demand to increase the rate of lending or investors will punish banks that fall behind, the higher interest environment will eventually (once risk has reduced) actively promote increased lending.\n\nThen you have all of the capital that was in the market when the market topped in Dec/January. That's still floating around out there looking for a home. That is not getting taken out of the market. That shit's here to stay.\n\n**Add this all up. Is the greater force economic uncertainty that we all currently expect and are looking for, or is it structural capital liquidity flows?**\n\nThere's no clear answer to this right now. Preacher's arguing that the economic risk still represents increased threat of uncertainty, and aside from the things I disagree with about what he said in his position, I do agree that uncertainty remains heavily elevated.\n\nBut does that matter if the lack of a threat of reduced access to capital and the lack of a significant relative increase in cost of capital promotes institutional lending, resulting in and reinforcing a dominant trend?\n\nThat last part will happen a LONG time before the macro uncertainty abates.\n\nSo we must be guarded, but there's absolutely no guarantee the market will do what we think it should based on sentiment. **There's too much structurally reinforcing potential for buying to not entertain the thought of market/economic divergence.**", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "If recession started in Jan, this would be the only recession on your graph where unemployment was steadily decreasing.

Therefore, this could be an indicator that we are in the early stages of a recession. \n\nFollow?\n\n>and it will only become clear months after it's too late to act. \n\nNo.\n\nUnemployment does not always take months to grow in an appreciable way (go pull your own chart of unemployment rates and look).\n\nThe unemployment rate is released Friday. It has been at 3.6% for 4 months which could mean a bottom (especially because it's also the lowest it's been in 50 years).\n\n3.5% or lower means unemployment is down and supports the thesis that we are not in a recession.\n\n3.6% is inconclusive.\n\n3.7%+ supports the thesis that we are in the early stages of a recession.\n\n>at the moment it looks like we're in an awfully weird recession with low unemployment\n\nAgain, low unemployment is typical at the early stages of a recession.

Easily the dumbest thing I‚Äôve read on this site.\n\nThe chart, data, and analysis is from fucking Bank of America you moron. Yahoo just printed it\n\nNFP employment has gone up the last 6 months. This is an objective fact.\n\nSo has household survey employment.\n\nSo has real personal income.\n\nSo has real consumer spending.\n\nSo has industrial production and real wholesale / retail sales.\n\nAs in, fucking everything NBER looks at. NBER being the group of phd economists who wrote the fucking textbooks you‚Äôve clearly never even been in the same room as. By NO measure is the economy in a recessionary period. This would be the first in history to feature declining unemployment. A fact you are desperate to stop talking about because admitting youre wrong about the main point of this post might pop your overinflated unearned ego.\n\nHalf of the shit you mentioned is a declining rate of growth. Not an actual decline. You‚Äôre too fucking dumb to know the difference.\n\nYou should stop pretending you are something you‚Äôre not. Youre clearly untrained and unqualified. You lack any and all ability to analyze data or do even basic research. You continually embarrass yourself and have never been right in any of the times I‚Äôve seen you post. Not fucking once.\n\nYou are a clown. A dunning Kruger afflicted clown. With no credentials and less ability, and an embarrassing amount of unearned confidence.

What is an expansion?\r  \n\r  \nA: The NBER's traditional definition of a recession is that it is a **significant decline in economic activity** that is spread across the economy and that lasts **more than a few months**. The committee's view is that while each of the three criteria‚Äîdepth, diffusion, and duration‚Äîneeds to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another. For example, in the case of the February 2020 peak in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the trough occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief. However, the time that it takes for the economy to return to its previous peak level of activity may be quite extended.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "You‚Äôre a fucking moron.
