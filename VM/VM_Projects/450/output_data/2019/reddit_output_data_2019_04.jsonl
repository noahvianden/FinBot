Specifically, there's a subreddit wide invitation limit of 100/hour, and 25 pending invitations at any one time. \n\nFor this reason, we've had to prioritize who gets invited to mod.\n\n---\n\nQ: Who gets prioritized first? \n\nA: It's based on a couple things, in order of importance:\n\n1. If you're subscribed to WSB\n2. Your most recent activity \n3. Count of positively rated comments/submissions on reddit.\n4. Overall karma amount\n\n---\n\nQ: I got a PM saying I was invited, but I can't accept!\n\nA: To make sure we can invite everyone, invitations expire after 15 minutes!
