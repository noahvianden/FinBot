Businesses where physical colocation of the customer and the worker will persist.  Whether this is a requirement or not (it is not for a fantastic and growing amount of companies) will determine whether a companies employees do their work in an office or home.  No office can compete with the benefits of remote work, they just can't.  You instantly shrink your talent pool you can draw from to almost nothing, take on huge equipment and maintenance costs, the lease, etc.  It's really a monumental cost for any business to take on - with no clear return on that investment.

Expect a rebirth of local communities.  Neighborhoods will be a thing again.  Because people will actually be present, and humans are abundantly social animals.  The scale of change might take decades to fully be realized, but computers and the Internet basically solved the problem that the Industrial Revolution created.  Industrial Revolution required factories with a centralized workforce, which birthed dense cities, and resulted in a large pile of nearly-identical goods.  That invented the problem that would rule the next century - Distribution.  Solving that problem built empires.  Empires that have been eroding and failing and dying since 1990.  The Internet, by and large, solved it.  It's not a valuable thing to solve any more.  In fact, most of those empires got built in ways that restrict them from even taking advantage of the Internet, so they persist with negative value, actively destroying rather than creating.\n\nBut let me cut this short or I'll be ranting all day like the madman I likely am...

And we're going to stop doing without.  We're going to have to pick something that factories offered and do without that, sure, but we'll feel the tradeoff is worth it eventually.

It changed medicine (its why you were told you'd go blind if you touched yourself).  It changed architecture (unless you have a house with only a common room and kitchen).

There are a lot of desires in the business world.  Executives and managers at places like Amazon fulfillment centers desire strongly that their workers were not human beings, and while they might be able to sustain treating people like machines for a little while, we know how this ends.  It ends in bloodshed (where do you think the phrase 'going postal' comes from?  The USPS in the 1990s, after rolling out automated sorting machinery adopted a program to pair human operators with the automated machines, handling the mail the machines couldn't sort.  And they expected the humans to operate like a component of the machine with zero downtime, zero slack time, minimal bathroom or lunch breaks, etc.  Which broke people.  They're human beings are their human needs are BUSINESS needs.  The USPS failed to recognize this, and dozens died in workplace massacres.)\n\nSometimes desires do translate into immovable forces, I will admit.  Industrial Revolution factory owners did not want to pay adolescents a wage adequate enough to raise a family, and instead of forcing them to, the entire machinery of society organized to enact the largest global change in human reproduction in history and we got the Victorian era.  Remote work certainly isn't a similar degree of desire, I don't think.  If companies had done remote work and seen their business flounder as a consequence, or seen productivity dive by 50% or something like that, sure, it would be a much bigger deal.  But as it is, it opened a lot of eyes to a lot of opportunities.  You mean a company in San Francisco can hire a software engineer with 10 years experience living in Ohio for $90k instead of paying $300k for a local?  The competitor who does that also nets the benefit of not having the negatives of an office aside from price.  Human things like how when a group of humans discuss an idea, the tallest extrovert wins in almost every situation.  Protip: The tallest extrovert rarely has the BEST idea for the business.  Knowing this nets you nothing.... unless you can omit the physicality from the interaction.  Many companies seem to have made the beginners error in remote work of adopting VIDEO calling, but I expect that to die off.  Audio is useful.  Text is better as it is more fungible, but audio is much higher bandwidth and faster.  You just can't save it, reference it, or search it later.  We may revert to almost entirely text interactions because of that last bit.  Search won.  It is the best human-computer interface we've ever developed and it is what people prefer.  But that's a different topic.\n\nI entirely agree about higher wages will have to be offered for companies that insist on on-premise staff.  I think those that pay this premium because they merely prefer it, rather than can make an objective ROI argument for it, will be insolvent before 2030.  I also think this is going to push up wages at jobs that require physical colocation of workers, things like heavy equipment manufacturing.  Light manufacturing might be offloaded to distributed workshops, but no one is going to build a John Deere tractor that weighs 5 tons anywhere EXCEPT in a large purpose-built factory.  And no one is going to want to work those jobs unless the pay is greatly increased when they can work a good paying job from home 'in' a city 1000 miles away.  Or in another country.  Or on another continent.\n\nOnly doing remote for new/low level roles is very beginner-grade for remote work, but I could certainly see it starting there, especially for established companies.  This will backfire.  You will end up with senior members of the company, higher ranking, performing very poorly in comparison.  While their newer compatriots are at home with that productivity boost, not getting interrupted, wearing comfortable clothes, eventually someone is going to notice almost none of the projects getting done have the seniors' names on them.\n\nHybrid is a non-starter.  It's a terrible idea that can not be executed well.  It preserves all the bad parts about offices while sacrificing their few benefits, while abandoning most of the good parts of remote work.  \n\nI'm seriously not engaging in fantasy here.  This is my life.  I had been talking about how remote work was the future for years online, and in 2016 I decided to put my money where my mouth was, I quit my job of 15 years without another job lined up and no intentions of looking for one.  Not an office job, anyway.  Started doing freelance gigs online.  Best decision in my life so far, actually.  Ended up ducking back into an office for about 3 years (company didn't offer remote to 'unproven' folks in their eyes which I can understand), then to remote contract work, then just in the latter half of 2019 I landed my \"unicorn\" job.  100% remote, global team, permanent, high up enough I pick my own technologies and propose my own projects.  Many of my meetings have people on 3 different continents on them.  Customers are spread out just as much (its a B2B managed IT and professional services company, we do lots of different things, I'm in the engineering/hosting ring, like a mini AWS sort of thing, building private clouds, helping companies transition to public ones, etc).  My company did maintain some physical offices in the US, none in states I am less than 500 miles from, and they realized they could close one permanently with the pandemic, and moved to a smaller one for the other.\n\nThere are absolutely problems and issues left to be figured out with remote work.  The people who set to doing that with affordable, workable solutions are certainly places to invest IMO.  I can't imagine how you would handle entry level positions where its a persons first job out of college.  I very much grew up online, getting early Internet access in 1990 as a kid (real Internet too, not AOL or Prodigy or Compuserve junk, dialup to a VAX that dumped me at a shell prompt and let me use gopher and telnet and shit), and even I don't know how I would have figured out the whole 'being a decent employee' thing with my first job being fully remote.  At my company the AVERAGE years of experience is 17 years in IT or related field.  And hiring is a very real challenge.  But hey, there are challenges in the traditional way of working too.  Solving them makes money.\n\nI thought fully remote was a long-term fantasy, and up until the pandemic I would have said it was still definitely a decade off before it was widespread.... but the real world has a way of throwing a wrench in things.

His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively)\n\nNow let's look at some **counter arguments**\\-\n\n**Automatic sell:**\n\nLooking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public?\n\n**DPO vs IPO:**\n\nYou might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true.\n\n**Stock-based Compensations**:\n\nYou might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?\n\n**He needs money like everyone else:**\n\nAnother argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more.\n\n**TlDr:** Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently.

Almost all of them I sold over at 100% profit in less than 2 months. You might say that was a special time. With that logic and if you actually know how a moving average filter actually works, you should know that price of a stock on a random  day in Sep 2019 has an effect on that 50 and 200-day filter curve you see today (on 05/07/2021)! That means all these 50 and 200-day MA curves are severely skewed due to that rapid fall and rise of all these stocks.\n\n>but people much, much smarter, and with a LOT more money, have already put in their bets\n\nMost of the volume we see in stock market is due to trading activities by institutional traders/investors. Some are betting on bullish speculation and some are on bearish speculation. Most of the major stock prices are currently above both 50 and 200-day MA on a yearly chart. Now tell me the people who are betting bearish are less smart and have less money? Go and look at the option open interest on SPY. Billions of dollars are betted on both sides. So, the bearish side is less smart, poor and they do not follow these indicators. Is that what you are trying to say?\n\n>Why would u want to buy a stock below the 200-day MA on the daily, and especially on the weekly?\n\nAll these indicators changes their level based on whether a chart is daily, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, monthly, 3 months, 6 months or yearly and so on. The shape of a chart also changes based on the frequency of the data points such as 1 min, 5 mins, hourly etc. play around with the frequency and duration, you get many different charts. All of them are real chart based on true stock price but they all will look different, all the TA indicators will look different. I would not even look at these MA indicators to buy a stock so that question was invalid.\n\n>Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying\n\nI entered SPY calls this week when SPY was below both 50 and 200-day MA on both daily and weekly chart. I sold them and make profit when SPY was above 50 and 200-day MA. Which is exactly the opposite of you are referring me to do. \n\nLet me tell you one thing, stock price do not follow any predefined pattern. Once the market closes and the chart is established whether it's a daily or weekly or monthly you can then draw as many pattern as you wish by changing the variable like timeframe and frequency. If a stock price closes above it's 50 and 200 days MA line on both weekly and daily chart. Nobody, I mean nobody in this world can guaranty that that stock price will close higher on the next trading day. Period.

{"title": "Inflation explained like you're five", "selftext": "I started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.\n\nLet's say, currently the inflation is 0%, a burger costs $1 and a single stock  share of any company costs $20. You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that share.\n\nTomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.\n\nThe government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.\n\nNow let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.\n\nYou remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.\n\nThe SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.\n\nSo, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.\n\nYou've already figured it out.

Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company\n\nBlack berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX\n\nQNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software \n\nIVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY\n\nCylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015\n\nDeep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.\n\nThat‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)\n\nThis stock is a deep fucking value", "id": "nlqklx", "created_utc": 1622060630.0, "score": 1266, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 241, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 218, "replies": [{"body": "Do you agree with the premise of this DD then??

HERE'S HOW!", "selftext": "$$$ HOW TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE $$$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**\n\n* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world\n* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE\n* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE\n\nAs many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.\n\n(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)\n\n***\\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\\****\n\nSemiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.\n\nTSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:\n-Apple\n-Toyota\n-NVIDIA\n-AMD\n-SO MANY MORE\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.\n\n**Semiconductors in Automobiles**\n\n1. **Vehicle electrification ‚Äì** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.\n2. **Safety and driver assistance ‚Äì** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.\n3. **Connectivity ‚Äì** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.\n\nSemiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver‚Äôs dash and in the back of passenger seats.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FINANCIALS/NEWS**\n\n* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.\n* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.\n* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year\n* Japan‚Äôs government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country‚Äôs first 20-nanometer chip plant.\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.\n\nThese are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSupply and Demand.\n\n**Positions**\n\n**30 7/16 $120 C**\n\nIt‚Äôs a yolo play for me.
