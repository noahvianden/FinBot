If you will only be invested for a short time don't go all risky trying to make up the money, if you have less time less risk. This is a simple, will help a lot of people kind of advice.\n\nFor myself\n\nI started investing roughly 2-3 months before a crash guess that would have been around 2000 was a one time thing at that time so wasn't really able to buy the dip. \n\nFinished schooling / other smaller jobs and had started training to be a financial advisor around 2007. This was my second time I was able to add money to investments. Guess I had good timing, that being said I was lucky to not have to sell.\n\nIt was amazing how many calls the office we has with clients wanting to sell. Overall the advice was to stick to the plan and if possible invest a bit more if they could.\n\nI was in a way unlucky, as some issues didn't allow me to continue putting the same amount of money in each month. A bit unlocked I guess but was still able to keep my funds invested.\n\nThe bigger problem happened to the ones that needed to pull their money out. Let's say job loss at the same time as the market dropped. This is why having a emergency fund is important.\n\nThe thing is we don't know what will happen in the future and honestly you will learn in time that people telling you this will happen or that will happen will end up being wrong a lot of the time.\n\nSo again, set up a good plan. Honestly for a lot of people this can be as simple as a few etf's. Be consistent with the plan and you will \"probably\" be fine.\n\nI won't say that timing is useless, but I like to think of it as I get my core plan in place regardless of what is happening. I will time things by buying a bit more when the markets drop.\n\nFor the people that need to try and time or attempt to beat the market, I would suggest you pick a % of your investment to do that with. Perhaps you like investing with etf's or perhaps you are a stock picker, or a dividend investor. We can argue about what could work out best here but a reminder it doesn't have to be black or white. You don't need to only do one thing.\n\nA simple example, I can invest 50% ETF 25% single stocks and 25% dividends if I want to. That being said have the core of the investment following the plan. \n\nI could probably be fine trying to speculate with 10% of my investments not so much 50%.

I was getting a ton of money from the PUA assistance program. I did put the work in. My autistic brain spent hours each and every day learning about investing, reading up on companies, and trading, and all that. Which only made things worse because i thought not only that i was a great investor but also solidified it with the rationale that it was because i put the work in and taught myself.\n\nSomething very bad happens when you start investing in a raging bull market. You begin to feel like you cannot lose and that it's because of YOU and your choices that you're making money. You begin to think that doubling your money in a year is not only possible but sustainable.\n\nAs the saying goes \"everyone is a genius in a bull market\"\n\nLuckily i had enough sense to put most of my money into a \"less risky\" long term account. But - i put about $8k into robinhood for \"riskier plays\". I was constantly tracking shit, waking up at like 8 for premarket, trading in and out of stuff like crazy, eventually getting into buying options (of course), largely on stuff like shopping malls, airlines, entertainment, REITs, all of which absolutely tanked with Covid and ran up like CRAZY.\n\nRan that $7-8k up to like $25k. I thought i was a genius and saw the matrix. For context i grew up broke and i basically NEVER saw more than $2-3K at once. The only reason i had money to invest was because the government assistance for small businesses during Covid was giving out a FUCK TON of money. Not once did i consider selling everything and cashing out or even just moving it into safer blue chip stocks. FUCK NO. The human brain doesnt work like that and it ESPECIALLY doesn't work like that until you've gotten the shit kicked out of you repeatedly.\n\nI did what any sane man would do - i doubled down, invested more heavily into options and into a nasty, nasty place called the biotech sector because i had an \\[extremely intelligent\\] friend who knew a ton about the Biotech space. Biotech will rip your motherfucking FACE off without a care in the world and leave you with an entire portfolio of -85% and -95% stock losses. Instead of buying $200 options, well....now i had the \"bankroll\" and \"skills\" to finance $400-600+ options that would build my bankrolll even higher.\n\nThe combination of A) GREED from seeing your money and numbers going up so damn quickly and B) FOMO and JEALOUSY from seeing how every bozo on the internet is making a fuck ton of easy money triggers something so incredibly PRIMAL and uncontrollable. The vast majority of people just lose control and double down. You don't hear about it because people almost never go around talking about how much they lost.\n\nAnd in my \"long term\" account i thought my risk was managed expertly when i took out about $8k in margin against the like $24K in assets in the acount because they were lending it out at like 1.5% or 2% interest. I figured worst case i'd be stuck paying a couple hundred bucks a year in interest or whateever and wait until the market goes up, or i have the assets to cover the margin. (little did i know that later on interest rates would just keep raising HIGHER AND HIGHER and that 1.5% interest rate turned into an 8% rate as the value of my portfolio kept dropping because i started to mix riskier plays into this account too.. I really couldn't believe that, the interest thing - never saw it coming)\n\nThen the market turned. I was also buying what i thought to be growth stocks with a promising future. Really these were just extremely high risk, smaller cap companies riding the wave. My options started dropping in value....aggressively. Things just kept going down. Lose $900 on an option that is now worth $60. Watch my $800 cost in a company lose like $60% value in a few weeks. I couldn't bear to sell some option i had paid $600 for for like $220 so i just kinda stupidly waited.\n\nIt was just a steady trend down...and down...and down, and the more things sank the more depressed i got about it and disgusted that i lost all of that money and just ignored even looking at it. A good portion of those companies went under or filed bankruptcy. Down until my $25k portfolio eventually ended up being worth about $2500 in fall of 2023.\n\nThe biotech stuff was basically ALL down around -85% to -95% across the board. The \"growth\" companies are like anywhere from -55% to -85% for most of them save for 1 or 2 that ran up like 100%. And of course thousands and thousands of call options expired worthless or i sold them for tens of dollars.\n\nI couldn't even bare to really look at the account until just this month. Luckily the robinhood account is up to like $4200, i started paying more attention to it, took profit on the stuff that went up, solid the trash for tax losses to claim and i do feel like a lot of stuff left in there is higher conviction for me and will go up enough eventually to make my original $7k back with patience.\n\nAll in all - i lost more money than i had ever seen, and it was extraordinarily painful, but truthfully, i think it was worth it and i would do it again. The only way people learn is by getting their face ripped off. I probably learned more about investing through losing all that than i did from the countless hours i spend reseaching. I have a completely different view on investing and risk now. And honestly in my mind i had \"written off\" that original $7k as high risk fun money. I consider myself lucky that this lesson was more or less break even for me instead of being like 38 and risking some $70K in savings or something. And it was honestly a crazy, insanely fun ride (at least the first year or so lol)\n\nA piece of advice. You will NEVER time the market in any truly meaningful way. If you could every hedge fund in the world would want to hire you. It's easy to sit there and say you'll \"wait\" for a crash, but that's bullocks. In a turbulent or bear market you don't know WHERE the fuck things are going to go, where the bottom is, when you should start buying, when you should stop buying. You have NO idea when a crash is coming, and most people don't keep nearly enough cash ready and waiting in their brokerage when it happens. So they spend weeks waiting for paychecks, and trying to transfer money around and try to read up on stocks at the last minute, waste a lot of time.\n\nOr the market drops 20% and then you get your dollar bills all ready to fire off for the big crash when it drops another 20% but it shoots back up. \"Oh shit i missed the bottom, maybe that was it guess i have to buy now before it keeps going higher!\" NOPE. Market decides to drop another 20%, then another 40%, but you've already put your money in at what you thought was a good time and now you're down like 60% or whatever it is. And it just KEEPS going down. \n\nDo you have the stomach to invest a couple grand into a market going down quickly, thinking it's the bottom and promptly watch like 50-60% of the value of your money just disappear calmly? And then keep buying at even lower prices because you did your research and have high conviction in the companies? Starting out you WILL buy stocks and you WILL watch with a knot in your stomach as those stocks just start dropping despite your careful plans. And then you WILL watch with regret as it rebounds and keeps going up...and up...and up, until you kick yourself because the kid down the street made like $10k \"Easily\" and you didn't put nearly enough in at the bottom because you we're fucking terrified that it would just evaporate because everyone is moaning about how much further it could drop and now the stock is \"overvalued\" to you and you're scared to pay too much for it in case it drops again.\n\nGood luck!

With apple and Google pay the cut provided to visa and MC  seemingly is gone, with merchants being able to process using apple and Google pay without fees. I am not sure exactly how or why this is but I know JPM and Citi have been pressing to institute a fee and generate kickback for themselves but I am assuming that the data collected by apple and Google on these transactions makes it worth paying the fees to Visa and MC out of pocket and cutting the banks out completely.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The acquiring banks that provide the POS terminals are not impacted, the issuing banks (that actually back the card you've loaded into ApplePay) and the networks (that the transactions are routed through) are unaffected except having to deal with the volume - and signing shitty deals for Apple branded cards,of course.\n\nApple have absolutely no desire to be as regulated as the networks and banks are.

You are also right that Merchant account providers like First data and Fiserv whom supply the terminals are not affected as they will still charge nominal fees (although they are substantially lower thus why many small businesses push for apple Pay usage so much) but for online transactions that's where it gets a bit weird. The issuing bank for your card is not responsible for handling processing fees, this burden is passed along to whatever institution the merchant utilizes to process the transaction and the merchant themselves. The way apple Pay works is very similar to stripe except without the fees stripe charges, apple processes the payment utilizing their Super-MID and then deposits the payment into the merchants account.

Apple collects extremely limited anonymous data in this whole process.\n\nThere's no real way to cut the payment network out of the process. Merchants don't accept Apple Pay, per se; they accept contactless Visa (etc.) payments, and the issuing banks provision a contactless Visa onto the person's iPhone.

While your first paragraph is true that the card is processed over visa's network and the issuing bank of the customers credit card is given their portion of the fee it skips entirely over the fees processed on the merchants end. When processing an apple Pay transaction the transaction does not go through the merchants assigned merchant account it goes through apple's Super Mid. Very similar to how stripe works (except stripe still charges the merchant associated fees while apple does not pass along those fees). Therefore the acquiring bank of the merchant is left not getting any of their pieces of the pie due to the payment just not routing through them. This is why JPM and others are pushing for a higher rev split in terms of the split in terms of issuing bank fees. Banks make a majority of their credit card processing revenue through charging the fees to the merchant, this is why companies like Fiserv are so massive and make up a great deal of the money generated in e-commerce.
