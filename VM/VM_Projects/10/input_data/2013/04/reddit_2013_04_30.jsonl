I ended with 1500 shares at 5.5 avg. so oversold down here. They have about $180M cash, and a pipeline in P2 and higher for a drug with potential sales (in the expanded indications) well over $1B. Hypothetically, if this was only indication with potential sales, then current market cap attributable to the drug sales in this p3 RCC indication is $100M. Roughly speaking, that means expected peak sales for this indication is less than $100M. Not only is that 5-10x smaller than the lowest sales estimate for the indication, but we are not factoring in P2 pipeline, partnerships, and milestones, w/ is larger.\n\nBroke even on DRRX thinking post-spike pps collapse would not be so pronounced.

The docs stinked of cya, and they do not even cast a question wrt to PFS or safety. People srsly underestimate just how derisked adcom became due to the FDAs passive admission that the primary endpoint and safety is sufficient for approval(by not asking questions about them).

And it got destroyeddd, lol. Going to need all my funds to recoup my losses on the bounce. What a meltdown. FDA and doctors are so very strict about trial conduct now. Trial wasn't powered to do OS data, OS isn't the primary endpoint, and yet OS data is the undoing of this NDA.  Then all this talk about RoW patient population being so high... Only a few years ago it was acceptable, when the design of the trial was created... If these results came out when this trial was designed, it would be 13-1 for approval, but the goalpost has changed markedly since. I am disappointed at how none of the no votes mentioned what so many of the public speakers addressed... That a lot of people do not respond to the approved drugs. This isn't like other treatments where one is simply better than the other and trying new options is not a priority... Cancer treatments are all about finding responsive treatments, and I was so sure that the PFS/safety data made the case for meeting that subset, at least.\n\nADCOMs are nuts, but with every bad hold I do I learn all the different reasons for why good data can be twisted into complete failure on the basis of some uncertainty.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you think this might rebound in the future?
