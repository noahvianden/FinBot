I dont like apple as a company, but thought i could get in at the 421 dip and ride the next bump, and immediately get out. I saw 1-2% gains, but I was expecting a bit more, held on, then cirrus fucked my idea up. Hopefully they do release decent numbers and then follow through with what one analyst said: bumping up dividends to temporarily stop their free fall.\n", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "That's because you bought at an arbitrary location.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The market is arbitrary.
