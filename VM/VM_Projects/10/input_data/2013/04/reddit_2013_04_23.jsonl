{"title": "Thoughts on AAPL and things to look out for for when the market opens tomorrow?", "selftext": "Hello /r/stocks.\n\nI stumbled onto this sub two days ago, and reading the threads were interesting to say the least. I enjoy the lively discussion going on for both large and smaller stocks.\n\nWith Apple releasing their earning reports tomorrow, I am interested in what you guys think. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What are some things to look out for that will signal either a drop or an increase in stock values? \n\n2. What are other things in particular that I should look into prior, during, and after their earnings report gets released?\n\n3. What are the general consensus of Apple holders and potential buyers? Should holders sell or buy?\n\nWhy I chose Apple is because it's most likely going to be widely observed and monitored. I am a total newbie to stocks, so I chose Apple as one of the companies I will be observing, and coincidentally their earnings report for Q1 is being release tomorrow.\n\nThanks for the reading. I look forward to reading your opinions.", "id": "1cwk89", "created_utc": 1366679398.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "2 things Wall Street is looking for: 1)future growth 2) what they will do with all that cash.

That trend and low P/e shows something that knowledgable investors see that you or I can't see just yet.

Do people who say this pay any attention whatsoever to Apple's performance?\n\nJobs died October 2011. The price of a share of Apple was around $400 then. Since his death, it reached new highs of $700, and has since returned down to $400. In no way is that \"tanking since Steve Jobs died,\" at least not in terms of causation. And if you aren't looking at share price alone, Apple has seen explosive growth and massively growing cash reserves since late 2011, so in a fundamental sense they DEFINITELY haven't \"tanked.\"\n\nI mean seriously, how can you justify (and its not just you, it's a ton of people) the statement \"AAPL has tanked since Steve Jobs died\" in any sense, either fundamentally or technically?

When we say value move we mean divined increase, buyback, or acquisition. Anything they will report will be perceived as shallow because of their cash hoard. If they don't do a value move GTFO. It wont drop below $300 though so its just calling a bottom. If it does go close to that the cheap price will be the catalyst it needs and it will flat line till it gets picked up with another.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/HandOfDestiny", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply.
