Right now this trade looks like a loss.  But, as I said, this is the seventh consecutive day down and in the past five years AAPL has not had an eighth so tomorrow...\n\nGranted, however, if this market decline were to morph into a 1987 or a 2008, there is a point when the pain would get too intense to go on and that would prudently be at about a 5 percent loss.

It follows the simple logic that, as J.P. Morgan famously said, the market will fluctuate and too many consecutive days in either direction is begging the reverse fluctuation.\n\nAs for this trade, I closed the initial position on yesterday's up day.  Had to hold it through a seventh day down so the bounce was only less than two points, less than half a percent. That's disappointing.\n\nBut given the rarity of seven consecutive days down, I added on that day and am holding a second position here.  As I noted above seven days has only happened twice before with no eighth day to follow (and once again AAPL is up on the eighth day -- yesterday).  My hope is this trade is more a swing than a quick scalp. My initial protective stop is the low of the current AAPL downswing (443 or so) and I'll move that up if AAPL moves up. \n\nThe previous two seven-day pullbacks had AAPL rise approximately 18 points, 22 percent (1/20/09), and 50 points, 13 percent (10/4/11).  Granted those were both in better times for AAPL, when the stock was in an uptrend, and it could be different this time, as they say, but I disagree there's anything \"retarded\" about making a bet like this even if I have a loss on this one.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}
