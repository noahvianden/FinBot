I am in a similar situation and heard good things about the books here on reddit not sure of your understanding of the stock market but the book is an easy read and breaks things down to an understandable level. It delves into many topics including how to valuate stocks, when to buy, when to sell, and brought up many things I have never thought about before such as not buying or stocks emotionally rather whether the numbers and demand can drive the price higher. Although the book doesn't go into \ninstruments such as EFT's and bonds per Se. So with my extremely limited experience on the topic I'll take the stance that book does and say that you need do as much research as possible before buying your share of a company and try not to pay attention to friends, coworkers, or people on the internet for that matter.

I would suggest perhaps an S&P 500 ETF (I personally have VOO) or perhaps a small-cap stock or growth ETF (haven't done this myself yet, but planning on doing this shortly--not sure which yet). \n\nHere are three things to think about:\n\n#1. With that amount of money your trades will actually cost you a fair percentage of your investment (unless you have free trades). Scottrade for instance costs $7 to get in and $7 to get out. If you decide to get $1,000 worth of stock that is 1.4% (which might not sound like a lot, but if you decide to sell that stock and buy another that goes up to 2.8%, and so and so forth). The reason I bring this up is don't go crazy trading day in and day out or you will eat into your profit margins.\n\n#2. Try to choose an ETF with low overhead (i.e. the cost of operating it) and one that gives you dividend payouts. This will help you to maximize your investment over time and give you a real sense of growth. \n\n#3. Research, research, research before you buy. No matter what anyone says you want to know how a company makes its money and what it's value is. Although it is challenging if not impossible to really time the market you can still pick stocks that are at a great value. If you go for individual stocks (despite what I recommended above) choose large cap companies with great brand value--these will return you money over time.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You seriously want to just put that somewhere safe until you have more to play with.
