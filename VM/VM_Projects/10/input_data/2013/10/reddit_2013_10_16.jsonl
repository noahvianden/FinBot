For example, I believe that once everything gets opened up to developers, an APU/GPU combination from AMD will blow performance out of the water and straight to the stratosphere, as, in theory, you will be able to perform all the graphical instructions (vertex plotting, algorithims, etc) then send the data to the GPU, which will allow the GPU to solely render information. This can happen much faster due to a substantially higher clock speed on the CPU, and more efficient access to RAM, and since AMD owns both the chipset and the GPU, they will naturally be more efficient.\n\nAssuming the above scenario does in fact happen, would that cause the stocks to go up?

That's something I have been burned on in the past, getting too much focused on what looks like a good stock without examining where they stand in relation to developments from their competitors.
