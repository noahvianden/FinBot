I closed my position about 15 minutes before the announcement for a gain of about 2% on my initial investment. I tried opening a short vega position just before the announcement but it wouldn't fill so I just stayed flat. I took a very small loss on the spread I opened yesterday, but that one kept hovering around breakeven so it was a lost cause from the start. Overall it was a great learning experience.

I used to just stay away from them. I was straddling the SPY so that I would benefit from an increase in volatility, but not a drop. Putting a straddle on VXX does sound like a much better play. I was essentially just long vol. If I were to buy a straddle in VXX and vol dropped, I would make money on the underlying price movement, but would it still have a negative impact on the long vega of the spread?
