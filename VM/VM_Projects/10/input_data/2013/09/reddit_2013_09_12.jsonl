{"title": "AAPL Thoughts/Frustrations", "selftext": "**EDIT: For some reason it finally occurred to me I probably should have posted this in a different subreddit, I'm just used to lurking on here. Please tell me if this post should be taken down/moved**\n\nI need some place to vent my frustrations at AAPL, so I'm sorry if this post isn't appropriate (and I hope I don't offend anyone with this post). Also as a reference, I am Chinese, both my parents are from China, and nearly all my relatives live in China. My dad frequently visits/stays in China as part of his occupation, so my thoughts on China are somewhat reliable.\n\n\nTL;DR at bottom, but would encourage you to read the entire thing and share your thoughts as well.\n\n\nAs a now-senior in high school, I've seen my share of Apple-fandom. There is a culture around Apple; it's hip and cool to own an Apple product. There's an underlying motive when someone buys an Apple product (usually) - they want the brand. People pride Apple as being a luxury brand, especially China. The Chinese people want luxury goods - they love to shop at Coach, Louis Vuitton, etc. Why? Because it shows **STATUS**, and that's why China is such a huge market for Apple.\n\n\n\nNow I do realize that Apple's products are of exceptional quality (well at least in my eyes). The finish and designs are very well done, and build quality is pretty amazing compared to other products, though all the other competitors are all caught up now, main one coming to mind being the HTC One. I myself enjoy Apple products, as I own a Mac Book Pro, and I love it as much as anyone else that likes their Apple product. \n\n\n\nHowever, it frustrates me how the company hasn't done anything innovating or exciting lately. As much of an asshole Steve Jobs was, he had the highest expectations and standards, and that's what made his company so successful. There has arguably been no large changes to the iPhone line since the iPhone 4 with their more modern design - squared edges instead of rounded, thinner, sleeker, etc. Simply put, the iPhone 4 looked sexy compared to the iPhone 3 line.\n\n\n\nBut there wasn't a large physical design change from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5. Sure, it was thinner and sleeker, and had a larger screen, but I personally don't think that was enough. My main problem with the iPhone during that time was the OS. The graphical design of iOS had not been majorly changed since *OS 1 in 2007*. I believe that there needed to be a graphical change to the OS design earlier. Their major OS change is going to be iOS 7, *6 years later*, which is much too long to be using the same-looking OS for, and it's not even out yet! (Probably going to get a lot of disagreement here but that's ok, I enjoy conversing about this). \n\n\n\nI did not believe the iPhone 5 was going to be good at all, so I sold all two shares had of Apple at the day of its day, around $700 per share, before they officially announced it.  With the release of the iPhone 5, their stock has dropped and has yet to recover ever since.\n\n\n\nI think there are two directions Apple can take with their brand - keep it as an expensive, brand-name company, such as for example Prada, LV, etc. This would solidify Apple as a premium brand only the some-what wealthy/cool people could own (in no way do I mean to offend anyone, this is just my observation). The Apple brand is a fashion, and is what makes it so popular.\n\n\n\nThe other route would be introducing Apple products at a lower price point to cater to more people who can't afford the pay the regular premium for their products. This is what the company tried to do recently with the iPhone 5C or whatever the fuck it is. What the hell does the C stand for? Cheap? Color? China?? Frankly, I think $100 is too much for a cheaper, plastic (I think the back is plastic, please correct me if I'm wrong) version of the premium version; I don't think this middle ground works. I feel like if they put it at a $50 price point, there would have been much better results. However, this gives the impression that Apple is less of a luxury brand.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the whole \"S\" updates to the iPhones. They probably generate more money than they would if they didn't update their phones so soon, but it seems tacky to me personally (but if it gets more money, hey whatever). Announcing the iPhone 5C with the iPhone 5S seems conflicting to me; the audiences attention is split toward this lower end product as well as  this higher end product (I'm pretty much talking out of my ass at this point). After the event, the media focused more on the pricing with the iPhone 5C instead of the innovation with the iPhone 5S. It's the same thing that happened with the iPad mini - people expected it to be cheaper. Apple didn't move in any direction other than backward with their recent iPhone event. \n\n\nLost my train of thought here, will probably add more stuff later but please discuss below your thoughts on Apple!\n\n**TL;DR: Apple is a luxury brand that is trying to cater to a middle ground that not many people seem to like. There has also been less innovation, and standards seem to have dropped (Ex. being Apple Maps fiasco).**\n\n\n", "id": "1m7zzv", "created_utc": 1378953879.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I should have touched more on this:\nIn China (don't know about India), the cost of the iPhones are much higher - the 5C will cost around $730 unlocked, and the 5S being around $860.

They build great consumer electronic products, absolutely.  Maybe you could label them as \"premium\".  But go into any electronic store and Apple are just one of many great offerings.  iPhones are ubiquitous here in Canada, and are priced the same as the premium phones from Samsung or HTC; there is zero cachet with owning one.\n\nIn my opinion, don't over-think it.  Apple had a game-changing, transformational, innovation streak, and reaped the benefits while the competition had to catch up.  They don't hold a monopoly on talent and creativity.  So repeating (or even maintaining) that kind of success will be difficult.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'd like to propose an opposing view. \n\nNow I'm not gonna lie, I was expecting as much before the announcement as well. But when I heard about the price, I too started doubting whether my initial assessments were wrong. $549 did seem off a bit off target if Apple wanted to enter the mid-range market. Being a shareholder and a longtime follower, I just chalked it up to Apple believing they could make up the lesser volume from higher margins. But I did start becoming a little unsettled from the uncertainty. (and the massive drop yesterday)\n\nThen I was on the bus today getting home today, when I heard two young college girls talking about the iPhone 5C. They were comparing it to the iPhone 5S, and talking about the fingerprint sensor, the 64-bit processor; and despite all their reservations about the unusual development, you could hear the awe in their voice. Then I turned my head to look out the window, and saw through the window of the car next door a woman drawing her finger across her iPhone's screen. I recalled all the times I'd seen an iPhone draping the tables I walk past, the thousands of iPhones I'd seen in the hands of people on the street, the way people ooh and ahh over their iPads in ways a Samsung tablet would never deserve. We may have become desensitized to it, but the brand is *everywhere*. Apple isn't just a phone with high end specs, or a useful all-in-one replacement; it's a lifestyle. It isn't just trying to maximize revenues; it's really trying hard to become a part of the social background. More specifically, a luxury part of the social background.\n\nSo how does this tie into the iPhone 5C? Well, consider how a cheap, plastic low-end phone on the same range of the low-end Android titles would fare. It would be competing on price, which means that margins would have to be shot. No additional profits, means limited software support for the phones. Just think about all the cheap Samsung phones; how many of them actually got an update beyond day 1? Maintenance of the user experience would have been a nightmare, and you can pretty much kiss goodbye to the peace of mind that the iPhone usually connotes. If people started complaining about slow updates and poor user experiences, how would that affect the brand? Wouldn't that polished, perfect ideal of a brand get dragged into the mud?\n\nPlus, doesn't $549 off contract seem *a little* far-out for a low-end phone? How would the millions of middle class Chinese and Indians afford it, as the investment banks have been anticipating? \n\nThat's when it hit me. It's not Apple that's the problem, it's *our* expectations that is the problem. Apple has never been positioning the iPhone 5C as a cheap, low-end phone. They've never been aiming  for the low-end consumer market all along. Truth be told, when you really give it some thought, it would have been an exceedingly tall order for Apple to come up with a low price solution without having all kinds of knock-on effects on every other part of the company. By pricing the phone firmly as a high-end consumer range phone, Apple is saying that the iPhone 5C is *not* aimed at the low-end market. If it really wanted to gain market traction, it would have pulled an iPad and surprised everyone with a $299 phone.\n\nSo if the iPhone 5C is not a low-end consumer phone, then what is it?? Surely it can't compete with the iPhone 5S and other premium brand Android models? That's where the magic begins.\n\nIf you look at the specs and the price of the iPhone 5C ($549 unlocked), you'll draw an eerie parallel with another phone. Which phone is it? Why, it's none other than the iPhone 5. That's right, take away the pristine shell and replace it with a chintzy attractive plastic cover, and what you basically have in your hands is an iPhone 5. Look a little further and you'll notice that that's what the iPhone 4S was priced last year when the iPhone 5 was announced. *Exactly $549 unlocked.* I'm kid you not, I had the chills when I came to this realization. \n\nNext, consider how the iPhone is being sold right now. When the new model comes out, everyone ditches last year's loser and switches for the brand new thing. Having an iPhone 4S when everyone has an iPhone 5 is *uncool*. Sure the iPhone 4 and 4s are still available in stores, but how many people actually buy it? I would bet that if you actually looked at their operating segments, you'd see a huge disparity between the newest model and the older models. People either can afford the iPhone 5, or not at all. Instead, they settle for something else new-gen, like a slightly cheaper Nexus 4 or HTC One.\n\nThis is what I am getting at. The iPhone 5C is not a low-end consumer phone. Instead, it is part of Apple's grand strategy to introduce a new tier of availability into the iPhone line, which makes it more accessible to the middle-class. It's not trying to flood the market with cheap knock-offs; rather, it is bringing the iPhone within the *limits* of their affordability, so that even they can say they own an iPhone. Spec-wise, you're really not getting a tool; it's actually a very capable phone. But finally, now they can consider getting a 2 year financing plan to support their fix instead of making do with the other Android phones. Finally, even they can own an iPhone.\n\nDo you see what Apple is doing now? It's not trying to introduce a mid-range alternative to their premium product. They're merely lowering the cost of their premium phone so that millions (literally) of Chinese and Indians can save a month's less wages to afford one. With two separate tiers, they can market the same product, with the same software and practically the same hardware, to 2 vastly different market segments. They get to keep their same premium brand, while moving into a completely new market. What was once yesterday's lowly iPhone 5, is now today's affordable iPhone 5C; and the iPhone 5S-ers can still maintain their superiority. Plus with the new leather jacket, you practically can't tell the difference.\n\nOne more thing that let's me sleep well at night as a shareholder - Apple's vision, the one true inheritance from the heydays of Steve Jobs. At the close of every event, both Steve Jobs and his successor Tim Cook close with one consistent statement: Apple's Vision: To Build Great Products. Apple isn't chasing short-term revenue streams from an ignored market to satisfy its shareholders demands. It's taking a realistic view about how they can continue providing a great user experience, security of purchase, and peace of mind to loyal appreciating *customers*. It's trying to build a product which will be loved and celebrated by the masses, something which will be useful to those who buy it, that will make a difference in their lives. And as long as they focus on building great products, I'm happy to stand behind them.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The point was that the price is barely different to the cost of the premium phone, so what difference will it make?
