{"title": "I would like a critique of the volatility ETF trading strategy I am considering.", "selftext": "Hey guys.\n\nRecently, I've familiarized myself with the mechanics of the volatility futures market, including it's price mean-reversion characteristics, usual state of contango, and use as a hedge against market crashes.  I've also become familiar with volatility index ETF's, and the fact that they constantly lose value due to the futures market's usual state of contango.  I've developed a strategy that I think should work well to take profits based on this situation, and I would like some feedback about it.  So here it goes:\n\nA chart with the SP500 and its volatility index, along with VXX and TVIX is at the link:\n\n\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EVIX+Interactive#symbol=%5Evix;range=5y;compare=vxx+tvix+%5Egspc;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;\n\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  Wait until the next market crash, and observe the volatility index rise to a high level.  Wait until the ETF's appear to have reached their peak post-crash value.  Then wait an extra month, for security, before establishing a position.\n\n2.  Establish short positions in UVXY or VXX or TVIX.  This can be done by simply shorting the stock or using options based synthetic shorts, or simply by buying put options.\n\n3.  As the ETF's depreciate, increase the stake of my short position to match my original margin.  Maintain a trailing stop to prevent destruction of profit or (worse) margin calls.\n\n5.  Take profits after ~6 to 9 months, and wait for next crash before returning to step 1.\n\n\nStep 1 is important to avoid getting caught right in front of a market crash.\n\nI would most likely establish this position using UVXY, because it 1) allows options trading, unlike TVIX, and 2) depreciates much more quickly than VXX.\n\nThis strategy is contingent upon my opinion that consecutive market crashes/ corrections are unlikely to occur near eachother- i.e, once the market crashes, volatility levels are unlikely to reach another peak for a significant period of time, as any bubbly market behavior has probably been relieved.\n\nSo guys, do you have any critiques of this strategy?  Any input?", "id": "1h5byd", "created_utc": 1372295107.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I like this strategy, but I think you might as well go long now instead of just waiting to enter a short position. You are expecting a peak to occur at some point to execute this strategy, so why not put your money where your mouth is and go long, sell, and then sell short?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Going long on volatility ETF's would mean that I would have to know that a crash is going to happen very soon- if it didn't happen within the next 2-3 months, the long position would lose value **hard**.\n\n**if** I ever have a strong enough source of information to have near certainty of an impending market crash, I would go long.  But I don't think I will ever be that informed- timing a crash is damn tricky to do.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Is the market still that volatile? I thought it had settled down a fair bit.\n\nSure, going from 20 to 60 is not as good as going from 5 to 60, but it's still a decent profit.\n\nEdit: To put going long in context: The VIX has not dropped below 10 in over 20 years (since VIX's inception?). So, unless we witness some significant stagnation in stock prices, the worst-case scenario for a long position is losing half of what you put in.\n\nEssentially my logic is this: If you ever plan to enact this strategy, you are planning on a spike in volatility to happen at some point. Just because the long position could lose value in the interim is no reason to shy away from it. You won't need the funds from the long position to enact a short position until volatility spikes anyhow. You might as well make money coming and going, since you are inherently planning on a volatility spike to happen eventually.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The big problem with waiting for a big movement will be the (IV) Implied Volatility in your options.. the premiums will eat up a huge amount of any profit, but I wouldn't do anything but options.. but why not look at LEAPS?

Given the fact that they are options for a volatility-based security, it would be reasonable to expect them to behave differently than most securities.
