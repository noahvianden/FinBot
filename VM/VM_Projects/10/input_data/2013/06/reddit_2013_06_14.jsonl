I'm not sure if I'm just looking at things from a gamers perspective instead from the business side but I still don't understand how anyone can say with a straight face that Microsoft came out of E3 looking better than Sony.  I am admittedly an amateur trader so I would love to hear somebody with more experience chime in and tell me why I'm wrong.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I own stock in Sony because I believe that the PS4 will win over the XB1 for a few reasons:\n\nThe majority of console gamers are teens and young adults. Being young, they likely have little disposable income. Since the PS4 is cheaper by $100, and PS4 games can be traded in, it may be cheaper to invest in a PS4. In fact, this aspect is more attractive to anyone, but even more so to a twenty-something without a ton of money to spend.\n\nThe PS4 has better specs, and a better lineup of release games. The PS4 also has some nice exclusive coming out for it. The XB1 has fewer exclusive titles / release titles than the PS4.\n\nGameStop, Best Buy and other game vendors may give customers a discount or a special deal if they buy PS4 games, or a PS4 console. The employees will also likely be told to discourage customers from buying an XB1 and encourage the purchase of a PS4, since they will be able to sell used games for the console (GameStop makes a ton of money on used games).\n\nAny other thoughts?", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "you have to examine these stocks more then PS4 vs XBOX.\n\nMicrosoft and Sony both have other operations besides gaming consoles. \n\nActually in my opinion, both of these markets are negligable compared to lets so microsoft's PC market.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "True.

But I have a nice PC that I plays games on. I don't use my PS3 for anything other then blue ray movies. My Xbox is used to play some games and watch Netflix, Hulu, HBOgo, I also like using it to brows the Internet and YouTube with friends. I all of this with my iPad on the glass app. \nIf the PS4 is going to be just about games then I guess I don't need it because I have a PC already. If you want to be hooked up to my tv in the living room then you better be bringing me all the things I used Internet for as we'll. Microsoft is a more complete package for me. My girlfriend will us it as we'll to watch tv and movies and she likes the work out games with the connect. \nThe last thing is that the community interface on play station has been very lacking compared to Xbox. If I buy a PS4 what will happen to my 100 call of duty friends and family? I am going to give that up? I do t think so. I think this will be the same for a lot of people. All their friends are on the Xbox live system and you want to keep playing games with them. I don't buy used games and I usually only buy about 10-15 games for a console over 4-5 years at most.
