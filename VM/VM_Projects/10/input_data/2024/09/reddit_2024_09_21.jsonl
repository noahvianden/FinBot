I’ve been assigned early a few times and I’ve exercised a long Put early (only once after INTCs last earnings and the subsequent $11 drop).  As long as you want the shares at your strike (which I assume you do) it’s a win for you.  I agree with a comment above on NVDAs tricky volatility. Drives a good premium if you’re selling but you have to be careful with your positions.  A few months ago NVDA fell through what started as a deep ITM 5 wide bull call debit spread of mine on an active day, which had been working well a few times before, but not that day.
