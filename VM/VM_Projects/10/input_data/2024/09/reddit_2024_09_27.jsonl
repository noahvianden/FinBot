With O, 3.3% of the tenant base is Walgreens, a company that seems to be materially eroding by the day. 6.5% DG/DLTR, which have had a difficult time lately. Is it the worst choice? No, but imo the dividend should not be the primary consideration, the quality of the business/having a fundamental thesis on why something is a good business and will continue to be should be. Also, dividend names don't necessarily = portfolio stability.\n\nRIVN will probably be one of the few EV names that went public in 2020/21 that makes it through this period but I don't think the other side of that is as exciting as people think. Too many people still investing in EVs through the lens of how the theme was viewed in 2020/21, which was a bubble where everyone thought every EV name was the next Tesla and none of them were. Now, a few years later a fair amount of the EV names that went public in 2020/21 are now 0's (some for the second time.) The automobile business - with few exceptions - just isn't a great business for investors and EVs don't change that imo. \n\nAgree with others who have said this is too speculative. It's a bunch of very speculative stocks with the addition of dividends for the sake of dividends and an attempt at turnaround with INTC.\n\nAnd I don't mean any of the above to be harsh; some of these names do feel like the kind of things people were buying up in 2021 when any growth stock was \"only going up\" and were the kind of things particularly obliterated during 2022.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Looks pretty trashy if you ask me, but I respect that you’re going for something different than the crowd!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "1/10\n\nIf you read their financial reports you wouldn't touch these.

{"title": "Nike: A high value play, just do it ", "selftext": "Summary:\n\nNike offers a strong investment opportunity due to its leading market position, solid brand equity, and long-term growth strategies. While facing short-term challenges from competition and changing consumer preferences, Nike's initiatives like product refreshes and significant advertising investments are expected to boost sales recovery. Its transparent cost structure and stable gross margins highlight financial resilience. Given its current valuation, analysts rate Nike as a \"Buy,\" with a target share price of $107.\n\n\n\n3 months ago I posted about McDonald's. The stock was trading at around $250, fast forward and here we are at above $300 a share. If you missed out on this nugget here's your chance. In this write up we'll take a look at my next high value growth pick, Nike.\n\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) represents a strong investment opportunity due to its leading market position, robust brand equity, and strategic focus on product innovation and market expansion. With sales of $51.4 billion last year, Nike operates globally across major regions including North America, EMEA, China, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific. North America accounts for about 40% of its revenue, while EMEA contributes 26.5%.\n\nDespite facing short-term challenges from increased competition and changing consumer preferences, Nike maintains a transparent cost structure and stable gross margins, bolstered by substantial advertising investments exceeding $4 billion annually. The footwear segment drives over 65% of sales, and the company's strategic initiatives aim to refresh its product range to enhance sales growth.\n\nCompetitive pressures, particularly from Adidas and local brands in various regions, are noted, but Nike’s management anticipates a recovery in market share and revenue by fiscal year 2025. Analysts rate Nike as a \"Buy,\" with a target price of $107, citing its adaptability and strong fundamentals as key factors for long-term growth.\n\nNike faces several potential risks as a consumer cyclical company, including:\n\n1. **Economic Slowdown**: A decline in consumer spending due to worsening macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact sales.\n2. **Product Competitiveness**: Failure to launch new models successfully could result in a loss of market competitiveness.\n3. **Trade Tensions**: Ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China may complicate production and distribution.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Nike is viewed as a mature company in a highly competitive market, making significant sales growth challenging. The recent decline in share price, attributed to slower growth and heightened competition, presents an attractive entry point, with the business currently valued below its 2018-2019 levels despite its expansion. Analysts expect a return to steady growth as Nike refreshes its product offerings and consumer trends evolve.\n\nThe target share price is set at $107, based on a 24.9x forward EV/EBITDA multiple and an estimated 5% annual EBITDA growth rate.\n\nIn conclusion, investors should recognize the cyclical nature of the fashion and athletic footwear industry, where short-term fluctuations can lead to long-term growth. Nike, with its stable gross margins and effective cost management, is well-positioned to navigate these challenges.\n\nGiven its current market valuation and anticipated recovery in financial performance, Nike is rated as a \"BUY\" with a target share price of $107. This assessment is based on the company's strong fundamentals and strategic growth initiatives.\n\n**I am currently holding shares in this company**\n", "id": "1fqz4rn", "created_utc": 1727473925.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 56 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fqz4rn) \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chat GPT ahhh post", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "In conclusion 🤓☝️", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "In conclusion, ChatGPT garbage post", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "Suck my 0.5 inch cock", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think it'll break 100 easily if it has a good earnings report.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Doubt it’ll be great.
