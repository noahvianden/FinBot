{"title": "Investment idea Put on DDOG", "selftext": "As you all know, the market is at all-time high levels and popular stocks like the largest of the S&P 500 have an uncharacteristically high P/E rating. According to Howard Marcs, the pendulum is swinging further to the bullish side.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary, stocks are expensive right now and obviously the conclusion is that maybe shorting stocks now would be a good idea  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n But what are the criteria and considerations? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI created a screener that filters out stocks with a P/E ratio above 100 and then searched through stocks. My criteria were that I don't take companies with a strong earnings growth rate because they are more likely to have earned this valuation and can quickly grow into their valuation from the market so I avoided stocks like Nvidia \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase study:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found Datadog inc (DDOG), a company that produces software for companies, which is not a bad company with an average revenue growth rate of 62% over the last 5 years. Nevertheless, Datadog suffers from high operating expenses so that it has been making losses since the company entered the market. And to finance their activities they issue more shares to raise money which makes the individual share worthless. But to understand this case mathematically, let's build a bull case to understand how overvalued the stock is. Let's assume that the company's revenue grows 50% next year and somehow they manage to turn -1.6% net profit margin into 10% net margin which would be 319 million earnings in 2024 and about 0.96 cents EPS with what with the current price 125 dollars would result in a P/E ratio of 125 at the end of 2024 where the company would still grow unrealistically and you can also say that the company simply reinvests a lot in itself but the current TEV/EBITDA is also 65 which is extremely expensive.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in conclusion I would say that I personally think that the problems like an unprofitable company and the risks like stopping growth are just not included in the price at all and therefore I buy a put option which expires in more than one year according to my previous calculation I say that the intrinsic value of the company is maybe 64 and I sell my put when the price is at 110 which should give me a good risk and I think that the price will probably fall below 110 dollar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of my theory let me have criticism and tips", "id": "1bbomnf", "created_utc": 1710113627.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "This is difficult to read.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "What da dog doin?", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Put on some commas in your paragraphs 💀", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm not an expert on options (hence why I follow this sub to learn more) but when a company faces situations like this, isn't it possible that they reduce losses by cutting costs?

That's probably one of the reasons why they're facing high operating costs and losses because everyone gets these features from elsewhere but Datadog continues to maintain the infrastructure for these unpopular services. So they could try to reduce the services they offer and cut costs that way. Who's to say they wouldn't do this? How does your analysis change if you factor this in? \n\nAnother reason their operating costs might be high is they offer a high sample rate of 100 ms for all their services and they charge more for this feature, so naturally most customers use a lower parse rate. But on Datadog's end their servers are running at the higher sample rate just because that's what they offer.
