For example, a long time ago, Tesla was the only company set out to make cars that were fully electric. If you were around back then, old enough to remember, you would know. No one said it was possible. Many years before, and all years leading up to Tesla's first full scale production car - It was commonly thought that, \"We'll never see electric vehicles, it's just impossible. If they could have done it by now, if it was viable, they would have done it by now.\" It was just how we accepted cars to be back then. No one second guessed it. It wasn't even an opinion if it was possible, it was treated as fact for 99.9% of people. Cars will always be gas powered, never electric. Some bullshit about inefficiency. If it was ever discussed or thought of, that's how the conversation went 100% of the time with 99.9% of the people. And now with the luxury of hindsight, we can realize that 99.9% of people really don't know what the fuck they are talking about - at all.\n\nIt takes that 0.1% to say, no. Challenge what we all think to be true, and dare to try something new.\n\nTesla is that 0.1%. And the very thing that they did to shake the world and prove themselves as a 0.1% company is what they continue to press for. Tesla is not about what 99.9% of the people think. It's not about what Wall Street, investors, and everyone else who doesn't have first hand impact at working at Tesla think. We are the 99.9%, we accept things as they are. Tesla isn't worried about Xiaomi, competing with other cars. Tesla is working on something that those cars will eventually have to invest in themselves. And it has been said over, and over, and over, and over again. And most people still cannot even begin to understand what it is until it comes to fruition. And by then, it will be too late for the 99%.\n\nWill Tesla trade down on this news? Maybe. Is this why investors and the street have been jumping ship months leading up to this reveal? Maybe. Buy the rumor (typically calls, but puts on negative rumor) sell the news (typically puts but bad news so calls?) \n\nbut that is short term to what Tesla's plans are.
