I had to take two services I didn‚Äôt want ‚Äì Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro ‚Äì as part of the promotional package.  The list price for these totals $44.90 per month ($14.95 WiFi Pro, $29.95 Connection Pro).  But, that‚Äôs okay, because they‚Äôre provided free of charge.\n\n\n\nI made it clear my needs did not include storefront / public place WiFi / large office building WiFi, and said that Connection Pro might be interesting, but needed details on how it works.  I was told there‚Äôs a 30 day satisfaction guarantee if the Connection Pro didn‚Äôt work out.\n\n\n\nTurns out it can‚Äôt be used with Static IPs, and that is literally all I subscribed this service for.\n\n\n\nNow, I had tried to refuse these services when I signed up.  I said, they‚Äôre free?  Fine, why don‚Äôt you give me the same package without them, but at the same price, then I don‚Äôt have to store your gear, or carry insurance on it, or have liability for its safekeeping, and I don‚Äôt have services Provisioned in my name no one‚Äôs using, like an LTE IMSI tied to my name.\n\n\n\nThey couldn‚Äôt do it.  So, I called up threatening to cancel, and asking them to pull them off to save my business.  Still can‚Äôt do it.\n\n\n\nI can either double my price, to an over-market absurdity, or I can take the services, and store the equipment.  They said a lot of folks are just not using them.  From the sound of it, they get a lot of pushback on this, and they have standard ways of explaining the bulk nature of the offering.  It‚Äôs like Costco.\n\n\n\nExcept one thing didn‚Äôt make sense.  This isn‚Äôt revenue.  The services are free for the duration of the contract.  And, I can cancel them before I start to get charged, as long as I do it on contract expiry day, and as long as I maintain their equipment safely for them.  If I do not return the equipment, it‚Äôs $150 per device, for a total of $300.\n\n\n\nThis got me thinking‚Ä¶.  That‚Äôs a lot of money for equipment to generate no revenue, not even realistic future revenue, being paid for on every single new account, clearly over the marketplace‚Äôs objections.\n\n\n\nNot only did this strike me as absurd, but I can tell (subjectively) they get pushback on it a lot.\n\n\n\nNow, if we just go by the no-return fee, that‚Äôs $300 of equipment, on $207 per month revenue (1.25 GB, high end service, excluding static ips, but otherwise inclusive of any equipment fees).\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs the 1.45 months of the shareholder‚Äôs revenue down the toilet in equipment expenditures, to, again, not actually increase actual cash in the door, as customers are being forced to take this stuff for free even when they don‚Äôt want it.\n\n\n\nI was unable to source the actual cost of the hardware or MSRP, so the most reliable figures I have are Comcast‚Äôs replacement price.  I did ask ChatGPT for an estimate, and two bounds, given varying discounts to that estimate.  Those bands are included in the supporting spreadsheet, and you can replace those numbers with any values you have, if you have better data, to see the ROI figures.  Again, the figures I base this analysis on are the Comcast provided replacement charges.\n\n\n\nThe ROI is 6.68 months on just the list price for the two services, today, which is basically almost never actually billed to a customer.  ($44.90, as detailed above, is the revenue figure there.)\n\n\n\nHow do the shareholders benefit from buying all this gear no one wants and forcing it upon literally every account?\n\n\n\nThis led me to a wicked speculation, and a question I do not know the answer to.  In three parts.\n\n\n\nAre these bundled services used to establish any financial metrics that the Board relies upon for financial reporting purposes? If so, could you clarify how these metrics are calculated and their impact on reported figures?\n\n\n\nIs there a possibility that these promotional items and services are factored into executive compensation packages? Specifically, are performance metrics that influence executive bonuses or incentives linked to the inclusion of these services?\n\n\n\nTo what extent do either of these two sets of metrics factor in revenue excluding term-limited promotional pricing, which this model would fall under?\n\n\n\n-----------------\n\n\n\nSo, reddit, I have to ask, as this is my first time, and I‚Äôm basically just a pissed off customer, do I have a live one here?\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve never gadflied before, but I would like to see the termination of this practice.\n\n\n\nI am told the directive comes from the Marketing silo, and no one has the authority to do anything about it anywhere else in the company.\n\n\n\nI believe the Board should be asked this question, because I simply do not see how this reflects the fiduciary interests of shareholders.\n\n\n\nMy evidence can be found at the following links:\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJGBPc-XGnIS9SH3Abm1ozmpyaDUss\\_AnRpVh3HXukQ/view\n\n\n\nSource for revenue figures: https://youtu.be/KJ4LyuqM\\_fI\n\nSource for cost figures: https://youtu.be/yJMJyTUBpJM?t=655s\n\n\n\nAll this information is based on figures communicated directly to me in my capacity as a Comcast customer by Comcast itself.\n\n\n\nAgain, really just a customer with a home office who‚Äôs really annoyed.\n\n\n\nBut, I think there is a valid shareholder concern here, and I encourage someone to ask these questions at the meeting.  I didn‚Äôt find out in time.\n\n\n\nIf you get an answer, I still have two weeks to decide if I want to keep my service.\n\n\n\nSincerely Thanks,\n\nAubrey Ellen Shomo\n\n\n\nFinancial Disclosure: I own one share of Comcast, CMCSA, purchased for $38.78 on May 30, 2024 at 2:57 PM ET.
