With it's meteoric rise and profitable quarters, this could change.\n\nFor S&P500 (SPY) inclusion there are two very important requirements (among others):\n\n>  A company must have a market cap above $12.7 billion.\n\n>  A company must have positive earnings in the most recent quarter and year.\n\nThe two stocks that are potential candidates for inclusion are SMCI and ELF according to this article:\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-stocks-brink-joining-p-081308939.html\n\n> Super Micro reported $640 million in net income in Fiscal 2023 and continues to deliver profitable quarters. Supermicro also fulfills the market cap requirement with a healthy margin of safety.\n\nLike with TSLA back when that was cool and doing regarded +10% moves, SPY inclusion means all those passive funds are forced to buy into stock already going parabolic.\n\nThis could basically be smart money buying now to sell the bag to dumb passive money later. The catalyst was the last ER that made the inclusion more likely and some hedge funds figured this shit out. Look at the chart, that's when the parabolic run started and volume ramped up.\n\nBut there's also these two requirements for inclusion:\n\n> Its shares must be highly liquid.\n\n> At least 50% of its outstanding shares must be available for public trading.\n\nIs SMCI fulfilling those?", "id": "1as86db", "created_utc": 1708088893.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|8113|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sa2b8l/missed_the_nflx_er_a_look_at_upcoming_earnings/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "/r/agedlikemilk", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Wrong", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Didn’t age well", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It literally did though", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I haven't even said uppies or downies.
