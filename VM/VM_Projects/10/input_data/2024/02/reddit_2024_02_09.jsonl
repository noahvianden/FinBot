This move aims to capitalize on the booming market for custom AI chips and safeguard Nvidia's dominant position against increasing competition. Currently, Nvidia controls approximately 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a dominance that has significantly boosted its market value.  \nThe company, known for its H100 and A100 chips, is responding to its major customers'—including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms—shift towards developing their own internal chips for specific needs to reduce energy consumption and costs. Nvidia plans to assist these companies in creating custom AI chips, thereby competing with companies like Broadcom and Marvell Technology that have entered this space.  \nNvidia's new custom unit, led by Dina McKinney, aims to make its technology accessible for cloud, 5G wireless, video games, and automotive applications. Despite not disclosing prices, Nvidia's H100 chips, which are more expensive than the A100 models, can sell for between $16,000 to $100,000. Meta plans to increase its H100 stock to 350,000 this year.  \nMeetings with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI have been held to discuss the development of custom chips. Additionally, Nvidia is exploring opportunities beyond data centers, including telecom, automotive, and video game sectors. Talks with Ericsson for a wireless chip and plans to target the automotive and video game markets indicate Nvidia's broader ambitions.  \nThe custom chip market for data centers is estimated to reach $10 billion this year and double by 2025, with the broader custom chip market valued at about $30 billion in 2023. Nvidia's entry into custom chip design poses a potential threat to Broadcom and Marvell's sales in this sector.  \nFor Nvidia investors, this expansion into custom chip design represents a significant strategic move to diversify its product offerings, enter new markets, and maintain its leadership in the AI chip industry. This initiative not only targets growth in the burgeoning custom AI chip market but also positions Nvidia to leverage its technology across various sectors, potentially driving further growth and solidifying its market dominance.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Nothing about it cutting into their margins and competing with their off the shelf gpus?

Indications that inflation in 2022 rose more than anticipated drove Treasury yields higher and sparked worry from investors that the Fed might keep monetary policy more restrictive.\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller, in particular, had called attention to the 2022 revisions, sparking market attention for the latest round.\n\nExcluding food and energy, so-called core CPI increased 0.3% for the month, the same as originally reported. Fed policymakers tend to focus more on core measures as they provide a better indication of long-run movements in inflation.\n\nAlso, the headline November reading was revised higher, up 0.2% versus the initial 0.1% estimate.\n\nIn aggregate, the revisions indicate that headline CPI accelerated at a 2.7% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the initially stated figures, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe revisions amounted to “a damp squib,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, though they could exert some influence on the Fed.\n\n“Since some Fed officials were apparently worried about a repeat of last year — when the revision pushed up the monthly changes in core prices in the final few months of last year — the lack of any meaningful change this year, at the margin at least, supports an earlier May rate cut,” Ashworth added.\n\nThe Fed priorities the personal consumption expenditures price index as its main inflation gauge. CPI readings feed into the Commerce Department’s PCE calculation. The difference between the two gauges is essentially that CPI reflects what items cost while PCE adjusts for what consumers actually buy, accounting for changes in behavior when prices rise and fall.\n\nFutures market pricing was little changed after the data release.\n\nTraders still largely expect the Fed to hold its benchmark overnight borrowing rate steady when it next meets in March, then cut in May, to be followed by four more quarter percentage point reductions by the end of the year, according to CME Group projections.", "id": "1amqd6z", "created_utc": 1707491651.0, "score": 105, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's going to cause speculation involving it and may still trigger a rally by stocks. \n\nBut the Fed does have another opportunity to put the kibosh on this, which did not occur in December (and obviously they did not do enough with January with the S&P trading at 5k). They can, if they find it necessary, drop back to a 2-cut average, up the split between policy rate and core PCE, and specify that if employment doesn't take a real spill, we'll see 0 cuts.\n\n(I honestly don't think all of this occurs)", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Looks like Powell may pull this off after all", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "What?

{"title": "Bloomberg is losing within a week this time ...", "selftext": "S&P 500 reached 5K milestone last evening and steps into 5,020 level today .......\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stock Market’s ‘Rah-Rah Mob’ Confronts February’s Weak Record**\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-04/stock-market-s-rah-rah-mob-confronts-february-s-weak-record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-04/stock-market-s-rah-rah-mob-confronts-february-s-weak-record)\n\n* This month is historically among the three worst for equities\n* Building bullish sentiment, Fed signals also raising red flags\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*With the S&P 500 Index coming off its best stretch in nearly four decades, the road gets tougher for investors as the calendar flips to February — historically one of the rockiest times of the year for US stocks.*\n\n*After a torrid rally of almost 20% since October that took the S&P 500 to its first records in two years, there’s ample reason for concern: Artificial-intelligence hype came in for a reality check with the latest batch of big-tech earnings; fevered speculation that the Federal Reserve would start easing next month has gone cold; and valuations remain elevated relative to history, evoking memories of the dot-com bubble for some strategists.*\n\n*And then there’s February’s rough history — it’s the third-worst month for the S&P 500 in the past 30 years, behind September and August, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*\n\n*Some of Wall Street’s biggest optimists are growing worried that the enthusiasm that drove the surge to all-time highs is sending a contrarian signal. In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*\n\n*“There’s a ‘rah-rah’ mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,” betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. “That’s totally unrealistic. If you keep buying Big Tech stocks at these levels, you’re asking for trouble.”*\n\n*This month is off to a banner start, with the market wrapping up its 13th gain in 14 weeks. The S&P 500 hasn’t seen a streak like that since 1986.*\n\n*Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*\n\n*February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. That’s particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January — like they often do — following tax-loss harvesting in December.*\n\n*For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*\n\n*Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn’t about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday’s blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*\n\n*For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who’s left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*\n\n*“I really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. “A selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.”*\n\n*She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*\n\n*At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market’s advance over the past year, but he isn’t adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*\n\n*Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&P 500 — Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*\n\n*Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks — even months — before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader’s Almanac, who correctly called the S&P 500’s double-digit rise in 2023.*\n\n*Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*\n\n*“Stocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,” said Hirsch, who sees the S&P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 — or a 4% drop.*\n\n*“Market breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.”*", "id": "1amvgxm", "created_utc": 1707504572.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Investor Intelligence Survey....God I wanna see that crowd.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bloomberg, marketwatch are up there with Morgan Stanley and JPM—all have a poor track record.\n\nit’s okay for sentiment, big picture macro analysis, counter arguments.

{"title": "Learning from Pain", "selftext": "First-time poster here. I’ve notice some smaller Gain Porn on here, so I figured I’d take my turn at tooting my own horn (my gambling it is heavily itching and I have no way to scratch it bc I’m out of day trades and horribly scared of leaving my money to this wicked world’s ability to fuck everything up over a weekend)\n\nI started playing around with investing in college after noticing some friends who had custodial accounts handed to them to go wild with. I used my money I would work for over the summers and try to make it into something more. As you can see, it took me losing $7500 over 2 years to realize I didn’t know “shit about fuck”. This doubled down when I started playing with options. I had no idea what these were, but I was going to play with them anyways. I started by gaining $100, +$300, then a long series of losses. \n\nFast forward to graduating, I decided to start investing my money again since my job focused heavily on market conditions and I could sit in front of a monitor all day. Yet again, I lost heavily (relative to my overall capital). Finally, I decided to pick a single stock and really dig my toes in with regard to understanding its volatility patterns. This started with trading TQQQ options. After my appetite surpassed this, I moved to Apple, then it recently turned to NVDA. I’ve been able to ride the green wave and reap some profits, and I’m thankful for that.
