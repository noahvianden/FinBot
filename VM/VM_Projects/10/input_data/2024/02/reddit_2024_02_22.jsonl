It's a little roundabout from your question, please bear with me.\n\nEvery day at before close I've been buying far-OTMs 1DTE condors—yes BUYING condors, long—because they have only about 1-in-50 odds of winning but pay about 100-to-1 when they do. Buying long far-OTM condors (or just OTM spreads, you can do only one side if you want) are the only spread where the risk/reward ratio is of higher than the likely OTM/likely ITM ratio... where, for instance, you might have a max $10 loss and $990 win, and the odds of winning are only 1:50, so you'll likely lose $490 before you win anything, but when you do win, you'll get $990, for a net $500 gain.\n\nYesterday afternoon, for the very first time, I couldn't get a fill. When it sat there not filling, I knew today was finally the day it would have had a big enough more to go ITM. And it was. Well, it's not quite ITM, but close enough that I could sell for most of it's max potential value.\n\nSo now I see on those days when there is a realistic chance they will beat the odds, I'm just not going to be able to buy them, the market makers just won't fill them. So those 1-in-50 odds of ending ITM are actually 0-in-49. I've been putting money in to beat the odds, and the day when I finally would've gotten my payoff, I couldn't even get in.\n\nThe only way I would have gotten a fill would be to have bought spreads where the odds of losing outstrip the risk/reward ratio, like, just off the top of my head, 20% odds of ending ITM with a 3:1 payout, so if you have $30 reward for $10 risk you'll lose 4 out of 5 trades, or $40, to make that eventual win of $30 on 1 out of 5 trades. If the delta is at all a reasonable estimate for likelihood of ending ITM, you'll find most options positions have these kinds of odds. (I use the outer leg's delta as an estimate of the odds of ending ITM, with the assumption that the puts will be slightly less likely to end ITM and the calls slightly more in accordance with a long-term historical chart I saw, and do it on SPX, which the theoretical figures should be more accurate for since it's European style.)\n\nSo, I'm not saying that the people who made money today are likely to lose it all and more if they follow a consistent strategy, I'm just saying, I myself haven't found any way to avoid that. It may be that with trade management the odds get better, but with just buying option spreads and using the inherent max loss as your stoploss, as many people do, I see no mathematical way for a consistent strategy to make money. They're just priced so that most spreads will probably eventually cost you more than you're likely to make, and for the rare exceptions, the market makers just won't take the other side of your trade.\n\nNow, as to your specific question: I know you asked about strangles but near as I can tell, far OTM long condors are the only way to ever get even close to a position where the odds of ending ITM are bigger than than the risk:reward loss ratio. (Assuming you can get your fills every single day, and not only on the days when you're more likely to lose.) Strangles and straddles, with long-only options, cost more net premium than credit or debit spreads, so your risk:reward is worse. Although, yes, on very big moves you can make more than with limited spreads... unfortunately working out the overall profitability over time for that would involve calculus and is beyond me, but, question: do you think if the odds of long term-profit were in your favor on a given trade, the market makers, who do have people in their employ who know calculus, would step up to take the likely losing side? They know the same math we do, and while they are trading against plenty of fools, we're only trading against them.\n\nSo, I gotta say: until yesterday at about 3:50 pm EST I was basically an optimist, I believed it was possible to systematically make money at this without depending on luck. Today, I'm not so sure that ANY systematic strategy. Can be profitable. I found a real outlier, a mathematically provable profitable strategy, and when my likely payday came, no market maker would fill my orders, so I couldn't be in the market on the day I'd get the win I'd been playing the odds of getting.\n\nSo I don't know if any option position is ever actually good. Over time, the odds are against you, and when they're not, they just won't take your trades.\n\nI still think it's possible to get an edge, by understand the market or the fundamentals of a stock, I suppose. I'm sure people out there are doing it. But it has to be a reliable enough edge to overcome the fact that the only way they'll let you play is when the deck is statistically stacked against you. \n\nOr maybe, as I said above, trade management can tilt the odds mathematically in your favor. Monte Carlo simulations are flawed, it's going to require extensive backtesting to figure that one out. Good like getting the backtesting data if you're not already rich. (NB I did try every backtester mentioned in the FAQ. They're all either expensive enough that I haven't been able to try them, or give clearly wrong data, such as the Tastyworks web app that sometimes inexplicably ignores stoploss and take profit settings.)\n\nSorry if the frustration in my tone is evident. I recently read someone saying that us retail traders are only here to feed our money to the sharks, today was the first time I've felt like maybe that was true.\n\nI can't believe I've been putting my money in waiting for this day, and when it arrived, for the first time I suddenly just wasn't allowed to participate, they just never filled my orders. The entire odds calculation is bogus if you can only get fills on the days when it the odds work against you.

You have to go in with a big enough bankroll to handle very long strings of losses and deep drawdowns. But the reason this strategy still looked good was because of the huge disparity between risk/reward and odds of ending OTM... the positions were so very cheap and the risk/reward so good I was able to limit the size of my daily buys to what I can very easily afford to lose on an ongoing basis, but still have an acceptable likely payout over long periods of time.\n\nBut knowing now that even getting the fills on the day I need them is a crapshoot, I'm abandoning this strategy.

I'd recommend anyone entering the option market to use the break even as the gauge for where profitability lies (i.e for long calls : premium+ strike= break even). This is a simplified concept since IV can spike the contracts to become profitable, but it at least gives a rough gauge for where profitability is in the trade. \n\nHowever i'd argue the premium consists of greeks and market sentiment for the underlying. Sky high premiums just indicates certain greeks are elevated (Vega mostly here), but also buyers are more willing to over pay for contracts. It is not necessarily a bad thing if price action meets and exceeds the implied move. I agree SMCI options are extremely expensive, but the volatility on the underlying does warrant extreme premiums.

On the other hand if you have a stock that is always going way up and down (like Tesla for example) then there's a pretty good chance it will move $10 one way or the other. If I'm going to sell someone options on a volatile stock like that then I better charge a lot of money for those options because there's a good chance it hits that price point if only for a short time, otherwise it's not worth the risk.    \n   \nThat volatility (or \"chance for big movement\") plays a big part in what those options cost/are worth. Certain events play a huge role in volatility, in this case earnings reports. Before the report people don't know if the stock is going to swing way up, way down, or somewhere in between and by how much. That volatility is a huge risk for someone selling options so the options are high priced. Once the event happens, the stock moves where it's going to move and then is likely to move that much again in the near term. It has lost volatility. It might have moved up $40 in price that day, but it's much MUCH less likely it will move up another $40 since there's nothing to trigger such a big move. That means it's less risky to sell options after that event, less risk of those options hitting their target price, so the value of those options may plummet even when the stock when up closer to the target price.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So why pay that premium if even a huge boost/drop in the call/put will still make it lose value?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "People pay it because if that massive boost does happen and their calls are in the money, it can mean a LOT of money.

A lot of people don't even know the option has been priced up in expectation of earnings, or at least they don't know to what degree (so how much) it's been priced up due to earnings. You'd have to have watched the price of a contract for weeks to know. Maybe they don't care because they think the move will be so big that nobody had priced it in correctly so they'll still make money.
