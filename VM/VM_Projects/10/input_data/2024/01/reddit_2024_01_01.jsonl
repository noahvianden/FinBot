ITM puts have an effective cost of carry. If the holder of the long side looks at their cumulative cost over the course of the year+ to expiration and it's more than the profit they would make compared to exercising now, they will instantly exercise and buy a call to end up with synthetically the same position.\n\n[Ken on MMs point of view about early exercise](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/16g0kc0/comment/k0u0noy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, puts, as you might have guessed.\n\nThanks a bunch for the explanation!\n\nSo selling ITM or ATM puts is never a good idea?\n\nHm, if I make it a requirement that both legs of vertical bull put spread must be OTM, that makes it much harder to construct a spread that's not as sensitive to any downside price movement.

Assuming you've accounted for the higher risk of early assignment, it may sometimes make sense to do so. I generally don't sell ITM, because every dollar of intrinsic value I sold is like a loan I took from the buyer, and I don't like to be in that much debt to anyone. I'd have to be very sure I'd make up the balance of the loan of intrinsic value in a rise in the underlying share price, before I get assigned.\n\n> that makes it much harder to construct a spread that's not as sensitive to any downside price movement.\n\nI understand what you meant, but what you wrote is more wrong than right. Sensitivity to price movement, in either direction, is the net delta of the spread. That might be higher or lower for an ITM spread vs. an OTM spread. One is not necessarily better or worse than the other, assuming all else equal. Certainly, the *wider* spread of the two would be more sensitive, because it will have a higher net delta.\n\nYou should worry less about your leverage (I think this is what you meant) and more about how much credit you are getting for the probability of profit your spread represents. If you are getting less credit per dollar of spread than the loss rate of the spread, it's a bad trade. For example, if the probability of loss on the spread (100% - probability of profit) is 30% but you only got $.25 on the dollar in credit, that's a losing proposition.\n\n> And shorter timeframe increases broker fees as a trade requires more maintenance and rollovers.\n\nYou don't have to roll spreads. I rarely do and I trades dozens per year.\n\nBut you're essentially right. Higher frequency increases overhead, that's a fact. So far, my overhead hasn't been too bad, less than 1% of my dollar volume. For example in 2023 my dollar volume was $26k but my overhead was only $47 (not including taxes). So as a percentage of dollar volume, that's 0.2%.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I'm looking to buy some LEAPS and was wondering if anyone has noticed/bought anything that you think is relatively cheap for a LEAP?
