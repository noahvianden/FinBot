{"title": "Offices Around America Hit a New Vacancy Record", "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/offices-around-america-hit-a-new-vacancy-record-166d98a5\n\n* A staggering 19.6% of office space in major U.S. cities wasn’t leased as of the fourth quarter, according to Moody’s Analytics, up from 18.8% a year earlier. That is slightly above the previous records of 19.3% set in 1986 and 1991 and the highest number since at least 1979, which is as far back as Moody’s data go.\n\nAmerica’s offices are emptier than at any point in at least four decades, reflecting years of overbuilding and shifting work habits that were accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nThe new record shows how remote work has upended the office market. But that is only part of the story. Much of the market’s current malaise traces its roots to the office-market downturn of the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nThat surge in office vacancies in the 1980s and early 1990s followed years of overbuilding. Easy lending fueled a construction boom, particularly in the South where land was cheap and red tape sparse. Banks often financed speculative office projects that didn’t have any tenants signed up.\n\n“The building I built was almost a million square feet—100% empty,” said developer Bruce Eichner, who built the Manhattan office tower 1540 Broadway in the 1980s.\n\nThe result was a glut of office buildings that couldn’t find tenants when the economy went into recession in 1990 as the country suffered from the savings-and-loan crisis, when many S&Ls failed.\n\nThat glut weighs on the office market to this day and helps explain why vacancies are far higher in the U.S. than in Europe or Asia. Many office parks built in the 1980s and earlier struggle to find tenants as companies cut back on space or leave for more modern buildings.\n\n“The bulk of the vacant space are buildings that were built in the 1950s, ’60s, ’70s and ’80s,” said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York tri-state region at real-estate brokerage CBRE.\n\nAnd just as in the early ’90s, it is the overbuilt South that is hit hardest. Today, the three major U.S. cities with the country’s highest office-vacancy rates are Houston, Dallas and Austin, Texas, according to Moody’s. In 1991, Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale in Florida and San Antonio held those positions.\n\nCompanies, eager to cut costs, also began ditching spacious private offices for open floors and cubicles, meaning they needed less space per employee.\n\n“You had a shift away from the ‘Mad Men,’ Don Draper era of some of these large, large offices,” said Thomas LaSalvia, head of commercial real-estate economics at Moody’s Analytics.\n\nThat helped push up vacancies and started a gradual shift toward smaller offices that continues to this day. The Covid-19 pandemic merely sped up the shift as companies realized they needed even less space per employee because of remote work.\n\nFor all the similarities, there are also important differences between the two downturns. The crisis of the early 1990s ended abruptly after the economy started booming again. Vacancies plummeted, and companies gobbled up space. This time, most analysts expect offices to stay emptier for longer because vacancies have less to do with economic cycles and more to do with the growing popularity of working from home. \n\nMeanwhile, winners and losers have switched places. In 1991, San Francisco had the country’s third-lowest office-vacancy rate, according to Moody’s. Today, the city has some of the country’s emptiest offices, partly because its large tech sector has enthusiastically embraced remote work.\n\nPalm Beach and Fort Lauderdale had the highest vacancy rates among major U.S. markets in 1991. Today, they are among the lowest. Palm Beach’s vacancy rate fell from 28.8% in 1991 to 14.2% in 2023, the steepest drop among major markets. Fort Lauderdale saw the second-steepest drop during the period, from 28.1% to 18.9%.\n\nWest Palm Beach, Fla., had a “growth spurt” in the 1980s as developers plastered the city with giant office buildings, said Kevin Probel, a senior managing director at real-estate brokerage JLL. It took a long time to fill all that space.\n\nToday, the area is once again in the middle of an office-construction boom. Developers are building high-end, hurricane-proof offices with landscaped outdoor terraces and pickleball courts. But unlike the 1980s, West Palm Beach is now a destination for major finance companies seeking low taxes and warm weather.", "id": "191y0f6", "created_utc": 1704752694.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe they can redevelop these buildings into affordable housing.

It benefits as long as apple is above 150.\n\nA \"hedge\" in the traditional sense is a way to reduce losses if you are incorrect on your bet. Which would mean that the hedge has to pay you out if apple is above 200.\n\nIf apple tanks by Sept expiry, to 140 or lower, you're correct on your initial bet, but your hedge wipes out your profit and then some; A short 150 long 140 put has a max loss of $1,000, so if apple is below 140 by then, you will lose a net of $800 (winning the bet against your friend, keeping the short put spread premium, but experiencing max loss on the put spread)\n\nI took a look at some long call strategies for september, and basically concluded that there isn't really that many options (pun intended) for a good hedge here. Your bet is too far out, and 200 is pretty close to the current price for a play that goes out 8 months. Apple only has to rise roughly 9% in 8 months for you to lose here.

I checked out the buying power on my TDAmeritrade margin account and buying 10 shares would take $1500 in buying power, which is better that a non-margin account.

If AAPL blows through $200, I break even (I lose $100 on the bet, but make $100 on the option premium sale). But that's less than a 40% chance. If it stays between 150 and 200, I get $200 ($100 in premium + $100 in the bet; which is roughly a 20% return), and that's a 45% chance. If it tanks below 150, I own 100 shares at 150 (pretty cheap), or I can roll the put out to keep the dream alive, and there's a 15% chance of that happening. So, 85% chance I break even or make a profit. Worst case is I have 100 shares of AAPL at $148 which is the breakeven (actually $147 because I'd have the $100 from the bet), which ain't so bad.

However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why.
