{"title": "An Exploration of Analyst Ratings and Stock Market Bias", "selftext": "TLDR - Potential heavy bias on aggregated ratings towards buy/outperform ratings with virtually no sell/underperform ratings on aggregate. Is this justified in your opinion?  \nHello everyone,  \nI‚Äôve embarked on an interesting project recently. I wanted to build a neural network model. The goal? To analyze stock data (fundamentals and price data) from Thompson Reuters and respective analyst ratings.  \nThe idea was to identify companies that are either unrated or not followed by analysts, and use the model to assign them theoretical ratings. Additionally, I wanted to spot companies with changing fundamentals that are likely to be re-rated soon, potentially leading to significant price movements.  \nMy dataset primarily consists of US-listed stocks across major exchanges and pink slips. However, it also includes stocks listed on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges, as these are the three regions where I trade/invest. For more international exposure, I use ETFs.  \nIn total, my investable universe comprises around 17-18K stocks, with 7624 of them having an analyst following. Thompson Reuters provides a ‚Äúscore‚Äù from 1-5 for each stock, where 1 is a strong buy/overperform and 5 is a sell.  \nTo quickly clarify and avoid any confusion this initial test is only for aggregated ratings for stocks for example AAPL was recently given a downgrade by Barclays which led to it losing a considerable amount of market cap. However, the aggregate rating given for AAPL is still a \"Buy\".  \nOn aggregate, there‚Äôs a heavy skew to the upside, as seen below:  \nRating Number Percentage  \nHold 1488 19.5%  \nBuy 3882 50.9%  \nOverperform 2120 27.8%  \nUnderperform 117 1.5%  \nSell 17 0.2%  \nThis leads me to question the validity of these results. Should nearly 80% of stocks have a buy or outperform rating? Especially in a market that is relatively/historically quite expensive, this seems incredibly high.  \nWhile I wouldn‚Äôt trade/buy based on any given analyst ratings, this project was more of a fun side venture. However, I‚Äôm somewhat disappointed with the results of this data-gathering stage, as any model trained in this way will be heavily biased and statistically insignificant unless you believe that the analysts on aggregate are correct.  \nI plan to start gathering this data over time, but unless something significant happens to the economy, I‚Äôm not sure if the aggregate data will be that interesting, other than indicating a potential heavy bias.  \nMy next step is to examine the individual numbers for each stock in terms of the number of buys/holds/sells, etc., and see if I can derive something more meaningful to model as well as maybe try and explore the validity of the aggregated ratings. I enjoy creating models, even if they‚Äôre not always for practical purposes.  \nThis exploration has shown why downgrades seem to hit a company a lot harder than upgrades.  \nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on analyst ratings/reports in general as well as if you think that analyst ratings are justified or not.", "id": "196rajd", "created_utc": 1705268992.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Looking forward to the results.

However, my background work-wise was in investment banking and so I never really got to work with equity analysts to ask them due to the barriers in place to stop insider trading etc. \n\nI'll definitely have a look at your incorporating your suggestions however although most likely adjusting for the individual ratings as a whole as I would like to get some \"useable\" data out of this or at least something slightly more interesting than what I found so far as 0.2% Sells I think is unusable no matter how you cut it!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Simple answer is companies don‚Äôt like to have a sell rating and you need a good relationship to offer corporate access to clients.
