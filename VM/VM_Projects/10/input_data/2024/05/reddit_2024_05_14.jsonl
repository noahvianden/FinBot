Discovery announced a bundle of its streaming services ‚Äî Disney+, Hulu and Max.\n\nComcast‚Äôs offer follows a model similar to several bundles from Verizon: Its streaming bundle will be offered to existing Comcast subscribers, which could help prop up its pay-TV subscribers.\n\nThe company lost 487,000 cable TV customers during the first quarter, Comcast reported during earnings on April 25. The company‚Äôs wireless business, however, saw a 21% jump in customers to 6.9 million total lines.\n\nComcast did not disclose the price of the upcoming bundle. Peacock subscription plans start at $5.99 per month, though that‚Äôs increasing to $7.99 per month this summer. Comcast broadband customers typically receive a discount on the company‚Äôs streaming service.\n\nNetflix plans start at $6.99 per month, and Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,‚Äù Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said Tuesday. ‚ÄúAnd so this is the latest iteration of that.

Either way today's index is the same, its just the prior month's baseline we're measuring from that's changing.\n\nWhen Powell was asked today if he thought PPI came in hot, he expressly said it was \"Not Hot\" because of the revisions.  The bonds also rallied considerably after initially selling off.  Maybe this had something to do with it; although other theories certainly contributed, such as CNBC pushing the idea the PPI categories that flow into CPI, which we get tomorrow, are rumored to be Bullish.", "id": "1cs2b5l", "created_utc": 1715718559.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 1917 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 6 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "cpi will come in 4% and market still moons", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "True, it is not a make sense market, or it never did ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Moderate inflation as always been good for the stock market...it's priced in $", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They are trying to make it sound like everything is okay but is not- cpi tomorrow coming in at 3.6", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Classic rug", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Rug to the upside?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs a flying rug", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "ALL TIME F'ING HIGHS BABY!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dude, I actually learned something on WSB.
