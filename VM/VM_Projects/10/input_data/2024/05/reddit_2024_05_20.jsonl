The Schultz letter to the company outlined fairly considerable, \"this won't be fixed overnight\" issues. The energy drink market continues to take some caffeine share away from Starbucks - they announced that they are working on something, but it's many years late at this point. The new CEO had a fairly terrible interview on CNBC and that last quarter was pretty bad. \n\nDid it get oversold/overdone in the low 70's, right as we're heading into Summer (and a large majority of Starbucks sales % are now cold drinks)? Yes. I don't think that there's that much of a growth story - and the China growth story that they were so excited about had comps down 11% this past quarter.\n\nSo, I agree it got oversold and it's bouncing into a prime time for SBUX. \n\nJust because it bounced, does that mean everything is a-ok with the company? Definitely no. I don't know how anyone could read the Schultz (who may have to come back to the company yet again if it continues like this) letter and look at that last quarter and think that. Short-term it could continue bouncing. Beyond that, it really has to show some improvements after that last quarter and some consumer names in what one could argue would be in the same \"basket\" (ULTA, LULU) have tanked lately perhaps in anticipation of that consumer slowing.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Great analysis sir.  Thanks for sharing!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No problem and hope your investment goes well. It's definitely not that I \"hate\" Starbucks or even dislike it; it's a matter of I'm just looking for something with more of a growth story/attachment to theme and there's already more names that I'd like to invest in then I can. \n\nI do think that Starbucks still has a strong brand but it has eroded a little over the years. The level of customization for drinks has gotten out of hand imo, and needs to be curtailed at least moderately in order to speed up orders. Or further automation perhaps but I don't know how much that can address at this point.\n\nStarbucks needs to steer focus back a bit towards product quality and not quite so much on product customization imo - Schultz talks about refocusing on the experience and premium branding - he \"also called for an overhaul of the company’s go-to-market strategy “with coffee-forward innovation that inspires partners and creates differentiation in the marketplace.”\n\nFrom the last conference call:\n\n\"What's interesting though, despite strong Mobile Order & Pay sales, **we saw a mid-teens percent order in completion rate within the order channel this past quarter. In other words, customers using MOP put items into their cart and sometimes chose not to complete their order, citing long wait times of product and availability**, here lies opportunity.\"\n\nSchultz said in his letter that online ordering needed to be reinvented.\n\n Food could be better, but that's always been something that they've never gotten quite right.\n\nWith downtowns not coming back as quickly as hoped in some instances, how many urban stores might have to close? As of last year, the company was talking about opportunities in smaller towns so less focus on urban and perhaps suburban is fairly well saturated at this point. https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/starbucks-sees-opportunities-smaller-towns\n\nI think if people are playing for a bounce into Summer (and the stock got oversold) great, I just think - especially after last quarter - that there's fixing to be done and people have to determine whether this new CEO is capable of that or not. So far, he's not inspired that much confidence. Schultz is already writing letters about major improvements that need to be made; he keeps leaving and then coming back. \n\nSchultz said in his letter: \"It's not the miss that matters. It's what comes next. What's the diagnosis of the problem? What's the impact on morale? And what's the strategy to fix it?\"\n\nSo bounce into Summer is certainly understandable but I don't think a bounce affirms that everything is a-okay; some issues have to be addressed after that last quarter in order to sustain a move higher imo.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "How does the company have a \"wide moat\" as you state?
