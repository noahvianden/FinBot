{"title": "Crocs Inc (CROX) DCF Analysis", "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nCROX was introduced in the early 2000s, It was an instant hit with consumers despite CROX's unconventional designs. However, the company got too greedy and started introducing multiple products that diluted the core branding of CROX coupled with the financial crisis of 2008 led to the stagnation of CROX in the early 2010s. However, CROX had a huge boost in popularity during COVID-19, as people stayed home and prioritized comfort, purchasing a lot of athleisure products including Crocs. CROX learned from its past failures and capitalized on its resurgence through limited edition releases and collaboration with famous artists, this combined effort allowed CROX to reach nearly 4 billion in revenue in FY23.\n\n\n\n# Market:\n\nAccording to the 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference, management sees strong growth potential for China, the UK, South Korea, and Australia. There are also a few large but challenging markets such as Japan and India.\n\nIn Korea, CROX‚Äôs products are popular, especially clogs due to the current fashion trend ‚ÄúY2K‚Äù. Y2K is a fashion trend that celebrates the fashion trends of the early 2000s and that coincidentally happens to be the era where clogs were popular.\n\nIn Japan, CROX‚Äôs products are popular due to Japan‚Äôs strict culture around the removal of footwear in certain places e.g. Onsen, Restaurants, and Temples. This emphasis on the removal of footwear makes CROX the ideal product for Japanese consumers as CROX‚Äôs are¬†easy to slip in and out.\n\nIndia is a market with a large potential for CROX, this is due to the warm weather in India which leads consumers to prefer wearing sandals over covered shoes. However, the largest issue with CROX is that it is too expensive for the Indian consumer. A Clog costs about 3000 Rupees but the average median household income in India is 22,000 Rupees. This large price tag on CROX‚Äôs products limits the number of consumers who can afford CROX‚Äôs products.\n\nBirkenstock is CROX‚Äôs closest competitor, creating shoes that are designed for comfort. However, Birkenstock is pivoting to becoming a luxury brand at a higher price point compared to CROX and is much less personalized to maintain its luxury look. Birkenstock is committed to maintaining its brand image as a luxury brand, even going so far as to leave Amazon. This brand image was further solidified as Birkenstock was acquired by LVMH in 2021. However, this is good for CROX as it has a significantly larger total addressable market compared to Birkenstock.\n\n\n\n# Revenue:\n\n***Shoes Sold***\n\nWhen forecasting the total number of Crocs sold, I assumed that CROX‚Äôs growth rate will grow at an elevated level for the next 5 years as CROX expands its presence into the new markets coupled with the rise of jibbitz, CROX's products that allow for personalization. The growth rate tapers back down.\n\nWhen forecasting %DTC, Crocs is taking a leaf out of Nike and Adidas‚Äô books by reducing their reliance on wholesalers ([SOURCE](https://shop-eat-surf.com/2021/04/crocs-following-in-nikes-footsteps-with-wholesale-cuts/)). Even their closest competitor Birkenstock is pivoting towards DTC. I assumed that %DTC would grow to 60%.\n\n\n\n***Crocs Physical Revenue***\n\nWhen forecasting the number of company-operated Crocs stores, I assumed that the growth rate would pick up 3 years into my forecast as the interest rates environment improves which allows for CROX to expand its physical presence easily before the growth rate tapers back down.\n\nWhen forecasting Revenue/Store, opting for less granularity I forecasted growth rate as a % of historic averages tapering towards the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n\n\n***Crocs Digital Revenue***\n\nWhen forecasting the %DTC Digital sales, opting for less granularity I assumed it remained constant as a % of historic averages.\n\nWhen forecasting Price/Shoe, opting for less granularity I forecasted growth rate as a % of historic averages tapering towards the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n\n\n***Crocs Wholesale Revenue***\n\nWhen forecasting the price/shoe, I assumed that over time as CROX becomes more independent and less reliant on wholesalers they will be able to negotiate for more favorable terms from their wholesale partners. So I assumed that the price/shoe would grow at an elevated rate before tapering back down to the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n\n\n***HEYDUDE Revenue***\n\nWhen forecasting the total number of shoes sold, I assumed that the total number of shoes sold increased to a great extent in the earlier years of my forecast to reflect CROX breaking into newer markets. However, I believe that for HEYDUDE to successfully take off and become a multi-national brand it would take a long time and hence I did not reflect that in my valuation.\n\nWhen forecasting the price/shoe, I assumed that the price did not grow at a fast rate in the earlier years as CROX has to appeal the HEYDUDE brand to more consumers through a lower price point. In the later years, as CROX gains pricing powers they can increase the price it charges per shoe.\n\n\n\n# Cost:\n\n***COGS and Others***\n\nWhen forecasting COGS and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of¬†historical averages.\n\n\n\n***SG&A***\n\nWhen forecasting the total number of employees, I assumed that the number of employees per store remains constant with historical averages for CROX to maintain high-quality customer support in each store.\n\nWhen forecasting cost per employee, I forecasted it as a % of historical averages before tapering wage growth rate at a rate in line with the perpetual inflation rate.\n\n\n\n# CapEX and D&A:\n\nWhen forecasting CapEX and D&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages.\n\n\n\n# WACC:\n\n10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.49%  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CROX/)) = 2.04  \nStable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  \nCOE = 13.87%  \n  \nCROX‚Äôs bond is rated ‚ÄúBB‚Äù ([SOURCE](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3126924))  \nCOD (1M Avg) = 6.56%  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  \nAT-COD = 5.18%  \n  \nStock Price (5D Avg) = $140.16  \nShares O/S = 60.50M  \nMarket Value of Equity = 8479.68M  \nWeighted Average Maturity of Debt = 6 Years  \nFY23 Interest Expense = $161.35M  \nMarket Value of Debt = 2077.25M  \n  \n%Debt = 19.68%  \n%Equity = 80.32%  \n%WACC = 12.16%\n\n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nUltimately in my base case, I value CROX at $158.15 per share. I believe that CROX is undervalued by the market due to the market's wariness about the success of the HEYDUDE brand and whether CROX will be able to continue pushing higher growth rates now that the athleisure trend is over. I believe that CROX's brand will continue to improve in value given how management embraces the same scarcity strategy that elevated Adidas and Nike to legendary status. CROX is also pivoting into other core products beyond the clogs in a bid to serve the diverse needs of consumers.\n\nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/y6qFawe)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/PWXGNbb)\\]  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/zp3qr4n)\\]  \nRevenue Model Part 1: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/lcKBXiQ)\\]  \nRevenue Model Part 2: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/h3ytgeR)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/W7hkaeU)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/8h37FA8)\\]  \nDebt Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/UdIB85f)\\]  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "1cslh0o", "created_utc": 1715781488.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "CROX is already up 50+% YTD and 20% in the last month.

{"title": "NYCB Sells Off $5B Loans to JPMorgan", "selftext": "NYCB tonight reported that they have agreed to sell $5B of warehouse mortgages to JPMorgan. \n\nThis company is shorted HEAVILY and it could squeeze soon. \n\nThe disposal of these so-called mortgage warehouse loans will bolster NYCB‚Äôs capital and improve its liquidity, with proceeds to be held in cash and securities, the company said Tuesday in a statement that didn‚Äôt disclose the terms. NYCB had told investors about two weeks ago that it was poised to do a deal of that size at par, minus a transaction fee.\n\n\nReasons why they are looking to shed these mortgages:\n\nNew York Community Bank Faces Headwinds: Heavy Loans and Short Sellers\n\nNew York Community Bank (NYCB) has found itself in rough waters recently. The bank's stock price has plummeted, and analysts point to a confluence of factors behind the struggles.\n\nCommercial Real Estate Exposure: A significant contributor to NYCB's woes is its heavy concentration on commercial real estate loans. This vulnerability stems in part from its 2023 acquisition of Signature Bank, which significantly increased its commercial real estate portfolio. The pandemic's work-from-home shift has dampened demand for office space, putting a strain on borrowers and raising the risk of defaults.\n\nRent-Regulated Multifamily Woes:  Adding to the commercial real estate woes is NYCB's sizeable portfolio of loans tied to rent-regulated multifamily buildings in New York City. Rising interest rates and inflation are squeezing these landlords, making it difficult to refinance loans or raise rents to cover increased expenses. New York's strict rent stabilization laws further limit their ability to recoup costs.\n\nInternal Control Issues:  Further complicating matters, NYCB identified weaknesses in its internal loan review processes. This raises concerns about the bank's ability to properly assess risk and manage its loan portfolio effectively. These issues led to a credit rating downgrade, further eroding investor confidence.\n\nShort Sellers Circle In:  With these vulnerabilities exposed, short sellers have piled on. Short sellers aim to profit by betting a stock price will fall. The factors mentioned above provide them with ammunition, as they believe NYCB's loan portfolio will lead to significant losses. A declining stock price can then trigger a self-fulfilling prophecy, as negative press and investor panic accelerate the fall.\n\nNYCB has taken steps to shore itself up, securing a capital infusion from outside investors. However, the bank faces an uphill battle. The health of the commercial real estate market and its ability to navigate the challenges of its rent-regulated loan portfolio will be crucial in determining its future.", "id": "1csbxzr", "created_utc": 1715745827.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 14 hours ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Interesting will check this out at open", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey, do you have a source?

{"title": "SABR - Solid and Undervalued Company(buy cheap calls + AI)", "selftext": "**About SABR:**\n\nNo this isn't the company from The Office, but if that is what does it for you then sure they sell triangle computers. \n\nSabre Corporation operates as a software and technology provider in the global travel industry. It's the backbone for booking and distribution systems for airlines, hotels, and travel agencies. In other words, it is boring and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. If you understand the travel industry, you know they use a ton of legacy providers like SABR. In other words, they are a plumbing company for the travel industry and make money on volume. Volume will go up and SABR is cheap as hell right now.\n\n\n**Some History**\n\nOf course SABR got curb-stomped during COVID, coming down from a high of almost $25 to where it is now at $3.15.\n\nDespite being kicked repeatedly while down, SABR has continued to invest in its GDS offerings, even partnering with GOOG to leverage **AI** to improve its hotel and retailing systems (something AI is very good at btw). We are just starting to see efficiency improvements and cost savings as a results - check out their latest earnings beat.\n\nOther recent partnerships such as the recent one with Taiba Investments to enhance hotel distribution in Saudi Arabia, position it as a potential outperformer in the near term\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nJust look at this baby the last ~3 months and tell my line isn't going to continue to go up. It shrugged off CPI data looks healthy. \n\n**Options Interest**\n\nA ton of insider buying right after a large drop. Not super relevant on its own but taken together with other information paints a picture of a company that insiders believe in. Tons of open interest July and onward. However I'm going to guess the stock pops more in the next 30-60 days as Summer travel heats up.\n\n**News**\n\nSummer travel baby. Check out these articles from just a few days ago.
