Tesla has done it twice, I believe, one was a 3-for-1 split, and one was a 5-for-1 split. So, in theory, whatever Tesla's stock price is today, you can multiply it by 15 and that would give you the \"supposedly real (but not really real)\" price of 1 Tesla stock.\n\nCompanies do stock splits to encourage more people to buy the stock; it can be hard for many people to stomach buying 1 share of a company for $1000, but the same people could convince themselves to buy 10 or even 20 shares for $100 each.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon did a 20:1 split, which is notable because stock splits are often 2:1 or 3:1. For each share an Amazon investor already owned, they received 19 additional shares.\n\nI would say it's better not to sell shares before a split, because if the stock market likes the idea of the split, then your \"pre-split\" shares will go up in value due to the market's approval, and then your \"post-split\" shares will also go up in value because more investors will be able to afford to buy the now-cheaper shares, meaning there'll be fewer outstanding shares.

{"title": "I know when the rake cut is going to append (for real, not clickbait)", "selftext": "I don't know if you know, but the fed can buy the debt of the government. So print paper (dollar), give to gov and gov give back paper (debt). Simple?  \nThe funny thing is that when you do this you are becoming a little bit more like soviet union (or japan if you are kind, but i am not üò§).\n\nBut what is the relation with rate cut? If you print money faster than you print wealth, you get inflation right? and how you counter inflation? with rate hikes! (you can't print wealth in fact, unless you are Jensen Huang and pronounce the letters \"A\" and \"I\" in this order).\n\nNow some big brain: you get inflation if the rate is way lower than growth, so everyone is borrowing money and do stupid things with it (more money, same wealth). So the fed get in, do the rate hike, and all the regards that borrowed money go bankrupt, money go low, inflation go low. Rate cut back to normal. All good.\n\nBut now who is borrowing too much money since 2008? The gov you got it.\n\nHere the chart ü•∞:\n\n[Federal debt held by federal reserve bank \\(you need good eyes, I know... or use zoom while you still can\\)](https://preview.redd.it/uu5g3p1ek73d1.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=64244a34bbb16279979a335f4926b35ac194a413)\n\nYou can see that from 1970 to 2007 everything goods, capitalism at his best, nothing to report.\n\nThen 2007, rate hike (maybe because it was too low before?). The fed also take advantage of this time and sell its gov bond on the market (the free one).\n\n2008 üí•üìâ capitalism collapses, the gov come, lower the rates, and saves all his good friends (but not Lehman, bad friend üëé). You can note that is it the beginning of the soviet unionüü•, from now on the gov solves everything with money (printed by the fed if necessary): europoor crisis (i'm europoor üò≠), whatever happened in 2014 (the russian again?) and the covid, all solved like this, but we are going too fast...\n\n2018-2019 rate hikes (I don't remember why, I was in college at this time, but whatever rate hike). The fed can sell a little bit of its gov bond and come back a little bit closer to free capitalism üí∏ü¶Ö.\n\n2020, you know what happened, soviet union on whole earth üá®üá≥, money printing going brrr, etc. üòî\n\n2022: big inflation, rate hikes to make the bad companies goes bankrupt as usual and kill inflation, but what? the company to destroy to reduce the inflation is the gov now? can the gov go bankrupt? (it can't) So the free market is scarified to reduce the inflation? nooooo üò≠ what? Jensen Huang is coming to save us all with AI üò±  (sadly this is not going to last).\n\n  \nAnyway, there is two options I see here:\n\n1. Soviet union (or japanese) way: the rate stays highs, the only companies that survive are the one receiving subsidies from the government, which is the only one still able to borrow money without going bankrupt. So full soviet union and no more free market... (or a pelosi like market?) And maybe there is gulag or zombies, or both; didn't guessed yet ü§î, but a lot of snow and gray filter for sure.\n\n2. The \"we tried our best\" way: Joe Pow the ununderstandable come and say we tried but it didn't worked (since the inflation is due to the gov this time, and it cannot go bankrupt). This thing should happen, according to my crayons, around **Q1 2025.** Basically when the poor will stop buying gov dept and the fed will have to buy it themselves instead. Lowering the rate at this point will lower the speed at which the gov dept capitalizes itself, and inflation will make it easier to pay back (and why sacrifice the free market for free?) basically the same thing that happened in 2008, but this time its only gov fault üò§.\n\n  \nWhat do you think my fellow regards? Are we all going to the gulag? or is it capitalism and free market again? Did I eat too much crayon?  \nLet me know in comment (or not idc)\n\n  \nTL:DR look at the chart, obvious Q1 2025 rate cut amarite?\n\nbest regards", "id": "1d2spwo", "created_utc": 1716926040.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 67 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You're very knowledgeable about rakes! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|51295)", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "cannot edit the title lol", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ik, sorry.
