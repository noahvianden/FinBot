Let me break it down for you: Domino’s (DPZ) is about to make a major move, and I’m all in on calls. Here’s why:\n\n\t1.\tDomino’s Is the New Tech Stock: Forget software, AI, and semiconductors – Domino’s has become the delivery platform of the future. With their investment in delivery tech (self-driving cars, drone deliveries, AI-enhanced kitchens), they’ve quietly become a logistics powerhouse. They’re not selling pizza anymore, they’re selling infrastructure. Who’s going to compete? Uber Eats? LOL.\n\t2.\tEveryone’s Broke, Everyone’s Ordering Pizza: Economic downturn? Who cares. When people get laid off, they’re not fine dining – they’re getting Domino’s two-for-$6.99 deals. Domino’s thrives in both bull and bear markets. If the economy tanks, pizza demand soars. If the economy booms, pizza is still a staple. Heads we win, tails we win.\n\t3.\tShort Interest and Bear Sentiment: DPZ is undervalued right now because the bears are too fixated on labor costs and inflation, but here’s the thing – the margin squeeze is temporary. Domino’s has an ace up their sleeve: they’ve been raising prices sneakily through new fees, and consumers haven’t blinked. Inflation’s peaked. Watch those margins skyrocket again.\n\t4.\tInstitutions Are Sleeping on DPZ: These clowns are sleeping while Domino’s keeps expanding internationally. Delivery demand is exploding in Europe and Asia, and Domino’s is one of the few Western brands already set up to dominate. Global domination incoming, and nobody’s pricing this in.\n\t5.\tEarnings Beat Incoming: Mark my words: Domino’s is about to crush expectations in the next earnings report. They’ve been aggressively cost-cutting, plus their digital app growth is through the roof. You heard it here first – next earnings call, DPZ prints.\n\nConclusion: Stop throwing your money at meme stocks with no revenue and start looking at DPZ. I’m loading up on October  calls. You’re either riding this pizza rocket with me, or you’re stuck bag-holding the rest of 2024.\n\nTL;DR: Domino’s is the next Amazon of pizza logistics.

After work, he’d read about trading on forums. His favorite things to trade were options on [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) stock.\n\nThen he went on what has to be one of the hottest hot streaks in the history of financial markets, according to a legal filing. At the end of 2019, his account, with the brokerage division of [Royal Bank of Canada](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RY:CN), was worth C$88,000. Within two years, he’d turned that into C$415 million ($306 million), he says.\n\nSome people would have cashed out. DeVocht didn’t. And when Tesla stock fell in 2022, he lost it all, according to a lawsuit he filed this week against RBC Dominion Securities, RBC Wealth Management and accounting firm [Grant Thornton LLP](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/4102548Z:CN). The filing, which is an initial notice of claim that doesn’t require evidence to be provided at this stage, didn’t include brokerage statements or other proof of his gains or losses.\n\nDeVocht now claims that the advice he received, geared mainly toward minimizing taxes, was negligent and failed to take into account his level of financial sophistication. His Tesla investment strategy involved loans from a Royal Bank margin account.\n\n“RBC considered Mr. DeVocht to be a sophisticated investor,” according to the complaint. “While this was true in respect of his strategies for put and call options in the trading of Tesla shares, RBC failed to appreciate that Mr. DeVocht’s knowledge of investing more generally, of financial planning, and of tax was in fact limited.”\n\n“The only statement we can provide at this time is that we’re committed to providing quality services to all our clients in accordance with professional standards,” Grant Thornton said in an emailed statement.\n\nDeVocht was good at trading Tesla shares and options, he said in the lawsuit, but he was in his 20s, struggling with “significant respiratory and other health issues” and had limited understanding of financial issues. When he first went to Royal Bank in July 2020, he wanted a loan so he could move out of his rental apartment and buy a home. At the time, his portfolio was worth about C$26 million “and rising rapidly,” according to the notice of civil claim, filed with the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\n# ‘Worth Nothing’\n\nTesla shares suffered a series of declines and periodic rallies throughout 2022 and DeVocht tried to recoup some of the losses by borrowing C$20 million from the corporation and using it to make shorter-term trades in his personal account. That strategy failed, and the money was lost, he said in the complaint. When Tesla shares saw even steeper declines in October 2022, DeVocht’s corporation had to sell its Tesla holdings to repay loans from a margin account it held with Royal Bank, according to the suit.\n\nDeVocht and his corporation tried to mitigate these losses but, in time, their “securities holdings were worth nothing,” he said in the complaint. If not for the “inadequate advice” DeVocht received, he and his corporation “would have preserved a substantial portion of their wealth and implemented financial planning that would not have resulted in the loss of their entire net worth.”", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I hope this guy is on here we need to make him a mod.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh my gourd! \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
