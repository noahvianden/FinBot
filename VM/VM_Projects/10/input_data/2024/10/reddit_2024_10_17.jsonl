{"title": "What is happening in the uranium sector? + Break out of uranium price starting now (2 triggers) + uranium spot and LT price just started to increase ", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n**A summery of a couple important points**\n\nThe uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:\n\n* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.\n* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)\n* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.\n* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)\n* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.\n* Google signing nuclear energy contract with Kairos PowerKairos Power (October 14th, 2024)\n* Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactorsAmazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors (October 16th, 2024)\n* Uranium demand is price inelastic\n* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)\n\n**A couple points more in detail:**\n\n**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\nLet me explain\n\na) The gas price represents \\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\n\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\n\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\n\n**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future\n\nFrom 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)\n\nSince early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X\n\nBut now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024\n\nA good month ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.\n\n300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe\n\nSo now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to be solved with a lot of new production that is't available.\n\nHow come?\n\nDuring 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.\n\nAn example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.\n\nThe production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:\n\n* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026\n* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest\n\nWhile producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024), UR-Energy, ...\n\nAnd at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.\n\n**C.** Recently, Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\n[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/p1r4r8o2gbvd1.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4966e48a3ef2a484e7ec40726be933c4483d3f35)\n\nKazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.\n\nHere my previous post explaining this more in detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom\\_17\\_cut\\_in\\_expected\\_production2025\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1f4usq8/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)\n\nConclusion of my previous post:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nAnd the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nAnd that while uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nAnd before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\n[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/296cyxmggbvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75a342266e636b38894d9a9d6a4e76d54bb6e917)\n\nWith all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last couple of weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\nWe are at the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**D.** On Sunday: The Zuuvch uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!\n\nThis was an important uranium project.\n\nThat's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\\*7Mlb/y)\n\n[Source: @z\\_axis\\_capital on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xt83g4skgbvd1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c87f248dacacb1030cb7992d892dd35757cfbc3)\n\nOrano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.\n\nThey lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.\n\nOrano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket\n\n**E. UR-Energy and Olympic Dam also producing less uranium than promised**\n\n[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/6lyulp7mhbvd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cba60ff5ac957274a5544159219499eef410b833)\n\n[Source: Olympic Dam](https://preview.redd.it/pys6ctc9ibvd1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=466e0992a03bd1f7000c8e3bee84c974621df551)\n\n**F. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting now imo)**\n\na) On October 1st the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.\n\nWith all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.\n\nb) The last \\~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \\~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.\n\nNow there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying\n\nThe upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly\n\nOn October 2nd we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!\n\n**G. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\nAlthough the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.\n\nHere the evolution of the LT uranium price:\n\n[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/yr1qk8nngbvd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5296a0df1d8d0edca64ced1306d1f6bae041c307)\n\nThe global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!\n\nDuring the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price\n\nThe official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.\n\n**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\n=> an average of 105 USD/lb\n\nWhile the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.\n\nBy consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.\n\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:\n\n[Source: Cantor Fitzgerald, posted by John Quakes on X \\(twitter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zjxstfaqgbvd1.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f77ac4be79a8d4bf9934ec8db306f24d6e420c98)\n\n**H. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**\n\nAfter the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \\~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium\n\n[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)\n\n**I. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started 3 weeks ago is now going to accelerate**\n\nAlthough the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.\n\nThe uranium spotprice is now at 83.25 USD/lb\n\n**The ingredients for a uraniumsqueeze in the spotmarket are present**\n\nWhat happens when uranium spotbuying increases, while the pounds of uranium available for spotselling decrease?\n\nCauses:\n\na) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot\n\nb) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)\n\nc) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\nInvestors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.\n\nUtilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\n**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!** => Consequence: soon potential squeeze in spot\n\nBreak out higher of the uranium price is inevitable\n\nAnd if Putin goes through with his threat, than the squeeze will be very big, knowing that uranium demand is price inelastic.\n\n**J. A couple investment possibilities**\n\n**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\nThe uranium LT price just increased to 81.50 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last couple of trading days of previous week.\n\nUranium spotprice is now at 83.25 USD/lb\n\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 28.14 CAD/share or 20.46 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 83.25 USD/lb\n\nFor instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.50 CAD/sh or \\~29.50 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\n\nI posting now, in the beginning of the high season in the uranium sector that started in September and that will now hit the accelerator (Oct 1st), and not 2 months later when we will be well in the high season\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

His golden ticket to the easy life? Writing out-of-the-money covered calls. He wasn’t greedy—nah, just raking in that sweet, \"free\" premium. “Why sweat it?” he’d say to anyone who would listen (which was just his dog, Murphy). “Worst case, the stock stays flat, and I pocket the premium like a goddamn king!”\n\nBut this time, Frank wasn’t just writing calls. He was writing calls like a maniac—calls so far out of the money that he couldn’t imagine anything going wrong. “I mean, who’s gonna push Tesla 15% higher in two weeks? Fucking nobody, that’s who.” He chuckled to himself, poured another whiskey, and sold those suckers like he was giving away candy at a carnival.\n\nDay one, Frank was feeling like an undiscovered Wall Street legend. “Free money,” he whispered to himself between sips, feeling smarter than Warren Buffett on a bender. His portfolio was fat with that premium, baby. All was right with the world.\n\nBut then the market decided to remind Frank that he, in fact, didn’t know shit.\n\nTesla didn’t just go up. It skyrocketed. The stock blew past his out-of-the-money strike price so fast it made his head spin. Frank stared at the screen in a stupor, watching Tesla climb like a caffeinated squirrel on a power line. The gap between his strikes and the stock price closed faster than his last credit card after his wife found out about the \"day-trading funds.\"\n\nBy week’s end, his calls were deep in the money, and Frank was in deeper shit than he’d ever been before. His portfolio was the Titanic, and those premium pennies he’d scraped up were the lifeboats—way too small to save him from the sinking reality.\n\nThe margin call hit like a freight train. “WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!” Frank bellowed, nearly spilling his whiskey. He stared at his phone, a new reality dawning: those out-of-the-money calls were now deep in-the-money nooses around his neck. He had two choices:\n\n1. Eat shit in broad daylight and buy back the options at a catastrophic loss, or\n\n\n2. Let his beloved shares get called away, basically giving them away to whoever had the pleasure of buying up his idiotic contracts.\n\n\n\nFrank, ever the optimist, took a big swig of whiskey and chose denial. “The market will pull back,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else. “It’s too high, it’s gotta crash.” But instead, it kept going up like the universe was personally messing with him.\n\nHis Amazon shares? Gone, at a laughably low strike price. The stock had shot up 25% since he sold the calls. Frank sat there, slack-jawed, realizing he had basically handed over his portfolio to some random degenerate who was probably sipping mai tais on a yacht right now. Tesla? Same story—he’d practically given it away for the price of a fucking Taco Bell combo meal in stock market terms.\n\nFrank, in a sweaty panic, called his broker. “What can I do?” he pleaded, as if this guy had a magic wand. The broker, in his cold dead monotone, explained there was nothing to be done except pay up and shut up.\n\n“What about my premium?!” Frank yelped, clutching the last shred of dignity he had.\n\n“Your premium,” the broker replied, “doesn’t even cover the transaction fees, buddy. Better luck next time.”\n\nFrank hung up and stared at the ceiling, wondering if this was how it felt to get hit by a train made of regret and stupidity. All that work, all that “genius” trading, just to end up broke and stockless. His wife didn’t even bother yelling—she just shook her head, packed a suitcase, and left to “clear her head” at her mother’s.\n\nSo there Frank sat, clutching his whiskey bottle and muttering to himself. His brilliant out-of-the-money calls had turned into the world’s most expensive self-inflicted wedgie.\n\n“Maybe next time,” he slurred, “I’ll just… buy the dip instead.”\n\nMurphy, his dog, stared up at him.
