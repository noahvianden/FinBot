Nvidia’s PEG (Price-to-Earnings-to-Growth) ratio stands at 0.9, suggesting potential undervaluation compared to other major tech firms. For instance, Apple’s PEG ratio is at 2.6, while Tesla’s is slightly lower.\n\nThe discussion notes that valuation for tech stocks can lag behind real growth potential. In some cases, higher multiples may signal stronger growth prospects, as seen when Nvidia's multiple was higher on November 30, 2022 (the day ChatGPT launched), than it is today.", "id": "1gaqf8f", "created_utc": 1729731397.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Nvidia’s product is capex for its buyers.

When Facebook was released, it was extremely common to see multifold increases in new users even on a daily basis. 2 probably became 20. 20 probably became 3000, which ended up 50000.\n\nBut remember, there’s a limited number of people on earth. So after a while, that growth is really going to slow down. You’ll begin to see growth rates go from, let’s say, 10x, to 5x, to 2x, and eventually become a fluctuation between -2% and +2% YoY.\n\nSimilarly, Nvidia’s growth cannot keep growing like it currently does, which also means after a point, it’s P/E ratio might begin to stabilize at a slightly lower point than we are at right now. And that’s a good thing because sustainable growth is key to a good business. \n\nNvidia is GREAT business. They have proprietary tech that’s patented, and is arguably the uncontested hardware designer and developer of high performance parallel compute chips. But demand is not infinite. It’s not a perishable good or a necessity like bread or milk. People or businesses aren’t going to keep coming back every day for a new GPU. After a point, customers will only come back every few years/decade with such large orders for new chips. These are products that are used for a decade long period. Companies only have a limited amount of cash. \n\nMeta isn’t going to keep ordering 600k GPUs like they have been. And neither will Elon with his 150k GPUs. No, after a point, they’ll probably come back every 3-5 years for the latest chips.\n\nI don’t know why you brought up the fact that you work in AI. It doesn’t add any value to the conversation. Doesn’t suddenly make you an authority on the subject matter. You impulsively got triggered when I called out your intellectual abilities. I on the other hand provided facts, used logical deduction, and came to a conclusion. \n\nThis is also really basic stuff which tells me the tag that you have that ‘I work in AI’ is just you compensating for your lack of intelligence. Machine Learning is a field that requires the most intuitive understanding of Math. Which in and of itself has rules, logical flow, problem solving, and critical thinking.

That’s what will drive providers to upgrade their data centers not some imaginary glass ceiling. \nYou are correct ML does require math but it also requires data and what that data means.

Companies have a finite amount of money. The world has a finite amount of money. Demand will stop growing after a while and will settle at a stable point. Key point being *demand will stop growing*, not *stop*.\n\nI work in high performance compute in ML. I breathe this stuff. Just go through my comment history if you don’t believe me. So please stop flashing your balls, you’re just exposing yourself. I’d go band for band in anything ML with you but I’ve got better things to do.\n\nEdit: none of this is accounting for current/future competition from other/upcoming hardware developers, which in and of itself is a totally different thing to think about from a business standpoint.

And 5 Other Things to Know Today.", "selftext": "\n\nIt may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.\n\nSure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.\n\nBut the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.\n\nMusk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.\n\nAt the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.\n\nOf course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.\n\nThere’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.\n\nElon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future.

Lets get right into it:\n\n* **DXCM**: DexCom, Inc. is a company that develops, manufactures, and distributes continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetes management (source: Google). When you look around and compare people today with 10 years ago, don’t you notice how fucking fat everyone is today? A salad costs more than a cheeseburger, these days, I see people wearing glucose monitoring patches like they’re a fashion statement. Diabetes is booming, so expect green dildos today.\n* **DECK**: Now, the people who actually work out and don’t have diabetes, I keep seeing them running outside wearing HOKA. A couple of years ago, if you asked me if I knew the brand, I would’ve said it’s some random aliexpress shoe, but now I see more and more people wearing HOKAs. I actually dig the design and colorways. But that’s not the **sole reason** (ba dum tss) I expect DECK to perform well today. Deckers doesn’t just own HOKA; they also own UGG — yes, those boots your mom wore in the early 2000s. Fast forward to 2024, and I see every girl at my college wearing them. All those snowflakes have been stocking up last quarter, so I expect UGG and HOKA will bring this stock to valhalla.\n* **SKX:** Theyre dogshit (respectfully)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wk1gi19bfpwd1.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce0370ca13f7086e9168c6c4d4f9d85cbf1921e\n\n**tldr:** **DXCM & DECK go up , SKX go down**\n\nMy positions:\n\n[total position: $22.5K using 5x leveraged CFD's \\(europoor\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1dv8uw1fspwd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=32d6cbd6cfd7a16120e5876b6aa0748fcc972f62)\n\n*This is not financial advice, pleas do not sue me, do your own due diligence.*\n\nGod bless America\n\n  \nResults\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/egtjzs7lnwwd1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e423108b95c4dc7262cbf61a186e09c585e2e0\n\n", "id": "1gb2e3r", "created_utc": 1729775814.0, "score": 122, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 30 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 9 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I lost money following you last time so only makes sense to lose more", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Me somehow I pick his losers every time![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is the DD we are looking for.

However, it’s clear that if Trump wins the election on November 6 a vastly disproportionate amount of resources will be allocated towards combating “the bad hombres”. Trump has  stated that illegal immigration will be his highest priority (even bigger than the economy/inflation).\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/trump-immigration-closing-message.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/us/politics/trump-immigration-closing-message.html)\n\nTo that extent, GEO Group ($GEO) is one of the few publicly traded companies that stands to massively profit from it.\n\n# Geo Group monitoring system for ilegal immigrants\n\nCurrently, the US has over 7.000.000 unsupervised ilegal immigrants. Under the Biden administration (who's has been very pro open border and very lenient towards ilegal immigrants), only 175.000 immigrants have been under what is known as the Intense Supervision Appearance Program. This is an alternative to detaining the immigrants by forcing them to wear a GPS tracking device before they appear in court (usually they are on it for 18months).\n\nA large percentage of those trackings are being done by GEO after winning a 5 year $2.2B contract bid in March 2020 under the Trump administration.\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200324005145/en/The-GEO-Group-Announces-Five-Year-Contract-With-U.S.-Immigration-and-Customs-Enforcement-for-Intensive-Supervision-and-Appearance-Program-ISAP](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200324005145/en/The-GEO-Group-Announces-Five-Year-Contract-With-U.S.-Immigration-and-Customs-Enforcement-for-Intensive-Supervision-and-Appearance-Program-ISAP)\n\nIn the fiscal year 2020, during the last full year of the Trump’s administration, the company received 87 new contracts, a record high.\n\nThis was before the huge migratory influx experienced during the Biden administration.\n\n[Currently only 175.0000 immigrants are being supervised under the ISAP program](https://preview.redd.it/33509hy7fqwd1.png?width=1658&format=png&auto=webp&s=acfd00bd97cdcba2bce1dacdf9a4f63cb9b481a2)\n\nAccording to statistics from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as of July 21 (2024) there are 662,566 ilegal immigrants on ICE non-detained pocket who are criminals or have pending criminal charges.

Price is trending above 890 and a break of 900 would be great. \n\nThat’s what’s on the surface. Taking a look at higher highs and lower lows. Costco has been making lower highs and every time it made lower highs it dumped huge in selling volume. Might be distribution who knows? But that’s not the point. It’s that there is huge volume at the top and recently selling picked up again.\n\nMust be consolidation for a breakout higher right? Maybe…\n\nHowever, a naughty naughty trader introduced some volatility into Costco this week. They thought they were smart and because Costco def can’t go under 870 they sold some put spreads for this week 20k contracts and next week 12k contracts. 0.13 spread and 0.33 spread. That nets $550k given that Costco doesn’t go below 870. But opening these contracts they introduced down side pressure. \n\nI welcome you down side pressure. I will take some nice ATM put.
