Long term confidence remains high, with management highlighting new opportunities derived from the complexity of inference scaling exponentially with \"long thinking\".\n\nWill post entire takeaways from Morgan Stanley in comment section:", "id": "1g0okso", "created_utc": 1728582267.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "**PART 2. Morgan Stanley**\n\nOther shorter term comments include:\n\n* HBM 3e supply is not a concern, even as we are constrained near term. The company remains highly confident that they will qualify their 3rd HBM3e supplier (Samsung, covered by Shawn Kim), and with or without that incremental supply the company sees an HBM3e ramp that will not be a bottleneck after the first couple of quarters. HBM3e will commoditize somewhat with more suppliers and a lack of shortage.\n\n* Air cooled racks - NVL36 - will be shipping in volume as a large portion of January quarter revenues. Liquid cooled progress is good, with all the building blocks coming together, but it's a major transition that takes a bit longer. Longer term liquid cooled NVL72 is expected to be the main workhorse of the blackwell lineup.\n* While our Asia team has heard of roadmap adjustments to products that were never officially announced, such as B200A or NVL36x2, we were told there are no major changes to the roadmap; our sense is that any tweaks are simply designed to optimize around the products that customers want most. Confirmed the name change from Blackwell Ultra to GB300, but that's strictly a name change with no implications for the roadmap.\n\n* Foundry sourcing remains heavily focused on TSMC, covered by Charlie Chan, with less Samsung dependence and Intel projects small and a couple of years away.\n\n* Gross margins, per CFO commentary, are as described, with modest pressure this quarter and next around the ramp of newer lower yield products; we model next year's gross margins at the same level that we exit this year, but we maintain the belief that this may prove conservative.\n\n* Management does not know if there will be incremental export controls on the China-based H20, but it does not seem to be a major concern. The choice to ramp H20 at lower price points when there is plenty of Hopper demand elsewhere was negative for margins, but NVIDIA wants to serve demand in all regions. If they are forced to move Hopper supply to higher price points it does not appear to be a meaningful earnings variance.\n\nThoughts on the stock: The stock has been very robust of late, and we are almost back to the all time highs. We have seen sentiment swing back to the positive levels as well, as the very strong supply chain commentary is being matched with obvious hyperscaler demand, and our incoming call volume on NVIDIA (at least up until this NDR) had dropped, which tends to indicate complacent and positive views.\n\nWe remain very bullish longer term, but would concede given the rally that shorter term upside from here raises the bar on earnings somewhat. Our enthusiasm for the stock remains highest when there are short term debates that can be quickly resolved, such as the gross margin pressures around the quarter, lead time issues, or product ramp issues. When consensus shifts to very high CY25 expectations - where we are right now - the debate tends to shift to CY26 and beyond. While we are optimistic on longer term prospects, those debates are harder to resolve.\n\nThe company has very clearly been coming in $2 bn ahead of their guidance each quarter, with gross margins 1 point or more above guidance, with regularity, and that has become the expectation. (The one exception on gross margin was last quarter, where gross margins were only slightly higher than guidance, which caused some consternation - but a large number of Blackwell rev 0 wafers were scrapped, which seems a one time event). At some point, the magnitude of upside is likely to climb, and there are some indications that this could be a quarter with more upside, but we would expect very conservative revenue treatment, and are not ready to drive up expectations just yet. So we would keep our near term expectations for more of the same, rather than a breakout to a new level.\n\nAll those caveats having been said, this is still an exceptional situation, with AI the most important trend in technology, and NVIDIA unquestionably the biggest beneficiary of those investments; we would be careful about applying commodity cyclical frameworks when the pace of investment continues to elevate.\n\n**As a result, NVIDIA remains our top pick in semis, Overweight rated, with a $150 target.**", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "> The company has very clearly been coming in **$2 bn ahead of their guidance each quarter, with gross margins 1 point or more above guidance**, with regularity, and that has become the expectation.  . .

Long term confidence remains high, with management highlighting new opportunities derived from the complexity of inference scaling exponentially with \"long thinking\".\n\nKey takeaways\n\n* Every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle\n\n* Newest element is the much more complex inference coming from \"long thinking\", inference interactions requiring substantially more computation\n\n* Blackwell systems NVL36/72 remains the best solution for those challenges, providing systems level differentiation vs. merchant and custom alternatives.\n\n* **Shorter term, Blackwell ramp progressing on schedule with that product sold out next 12 months, pointing to continued strong conditions**\n\n* Remain OW, remains our Top Pick in semis\n\nThis week we hosted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress and other members of the management team for a three day NDR in New York City. It's no surprise that management enthusiasm remains high both short term and long term, with the strong sense that there is still material growth ahead. Perhaps the newest element of the story is the view that inference is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware - with NVIDIA's upcoming rack scale products as an optimal solution. The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of \"digital AI employees\" that can execute challenging tasks.\n\nThe high cost of scaling training clusters has been an element of the positive trends in the last 12 months, and the explosive adoption of higher end GPUs in Gen AI inference has also been a positive. But the notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA's full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company's considerable lead.\n\nWe share some detail on those evolutions below, but the clear view continues to be that we are set up for an exceptionally strong 2025 that management characterizes as an early stage of a long term investment cycle - Jensen did make it clear that he expects growth again in 2026, though he did not quantify.\n\nCould inference compute scale exponentially with \"long thinking\"? Throughout our meetings Jensen frequently referenced the recently released o1 model (also known as strawberry) from open-ai, which can produce a chain of thought before responding to queries. Unencumbering model output from latency constraints and enabling the model to \"think\" as long as it needs to before responding. Per Open-AI: \"We have found that the performance of o1 consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute)\". Open-AI has never been explicit about the cost differential from o1 inference, but some sources suggest it could be somewhere in the 10x range vs GPT-4. And more importantly for the Nvidia growth story as exciting as the capabilities on the o1 preview are the model is simply too slow and too expensive for developers to see it as a viable option for building a consumer facing applications that have any kind of latency concern (with the caveat that OAI has smaller o1-mini model which is more competitive).\n\nThe bigger picture is the Nvidia team is excited about what a model trained on a Blackwell or Rubin system will be able to enable two three or four generations from now. With o1 a GPT-4 class model (GPT-4 was trained in 2022 on A100s) the advances we've made in hardware over the last few years haven't really shown up in their entirety yet. And for inference we can only speculate as to the incremental compute will it take to serve a GPT-6 class model with these advanced capabilities at low latency. But it seems likely that its going to be an order of magnitude more compute intensive than what we consider leading edge today. And Nvidia is not talking specifically about open-ai, the o1 model just serves as an example of where the company thinks LLMs are headed and the new inference scaling law they see as a huge boon to the business over time.\n\nWhat does a more thoughtful inference enable? The NVIDIA long term vision articulated here is that all enterprises ten years from now will have thousands of \"digital employees\" doing very difficult tasks - programmers, circuit designers, marketing program managers, paralegals, etc. will be treated like humans. Businesses will be run with humans talking to AIs, AIs talking to AIs, humans talking to humans.\n\nScaling up this agent intelligence requires both more sophisticated training, but also increasingly more sophisticated inference. Inference comes more than conversational transactions, more about doing highly complex tasks that can require multiple attempts.\n\nEven workloads that seemed solved a few years ago will now require much more complicated compute with these approaches. Computer vision was considered to be \"computationally solved\" a few years ago, but the ability to take that image recognition and apply human or superhuman thought/interpretation still eludes us. In Jensen's words, computer vision has been solved for the fruit fly brain as image recognition improves, but to get to the understanding human brains we still have a long way to go. That is even more the case when it comes to the most complex multimodal generational AI tasks.\n\nAll of this drives much more complex inference which implies significantly higher investment requirements into inference hardware.\n\nNVIDIA is positioning Blackwell - in particular the rack scale systems - as breakthrough technology for solving these problems. Blackwell brings a much more capable processor to the AI markets, but the most important innovation could come from the GB200 systems incorporating a \"full rack\" approach. By introducing the Grace CPU into the system, as well as a much higher complexity NVLink chip to chip connectivity, the company is enabling 36 or 72 GPU racks that have each GPU talking to all of the other GPUs at the same time, putting all of the GPUs in the same NVLink domain and dramatically enhancing the ability to treat the entire rack as a massive GPU.\n\nOf course, all of that has been known since GTC in March, but the company insists that other solutions that lack this system integration capability - including all merchant competitors and most custom silicon competitors other than Google's TPU - will struggle to meet the new requirements of these new models.\n\nOur view continues to be that NVIDIA is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year. Everything that we heard this week reinforced that.\n\nIn the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks. Issues with initial Blackwell silicon are now totally behind us. Management did give some color on the initial ramp issues with Blackwell; the first version of silicon was functional, but had very low yields; importantly, the yield problems were mostly discovered post packaging, which meant that scrapped product would require a loss of CoWoS and HBM3e, both overall supply constraints at the moment. But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter.\n\nAny new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year. While there was no new short term revenue or margin commentary, this view obviously portends continued high growth in shipment trends through the year.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": ">implies significantly higher investment requirements into inference hardware.\n\nThe **long thinking** part is interesting to consider from a competitive standpoint.  \n\nThere was some thought inferencing was going to get done with low cost/jelly-bean type solutions from a plethora of competitors.  The take away here is long thinking needs tight integration and great networking so all the GPUs can act as one working on the same problem.  Maybe that will be solved on a number of different computation devices (CSPs etc) over time.  But for now its only Nvidia and Google TPU.   With the apparent Blackwell order book filled 15 months out, Nvidia appears to rule the roost not only in training, but might be well on their way to owning the LLM inferencing problem too. \n\nI wonder how many Blackwells Google has on order. . .", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So this gives incredible detail from Jensens team about what most of us (those of us who are analytical) have been seeing.\n\nI’ll summarize:\n\n1. Agents will be huge, the tasks they work through. Basically a massive increase in AI inference here.\n\n2. Thought time. Another increase in AI inference.\n\n3. Scaling. GPT4 to GPT6 will be orders of magnitude. More GPUs.\n\n4. More and more complex applications. We saw this in, what was it called, Computex? Weather simulations, physics, biochemistry, genetics, proteins, pharmaceuticals. They just had an article the other day about simulating semiconductor photolitho mask designs. Insanity. All of this will need even more GPUs.\n\n5. Nvidia’s lead is not decreasing, it’s increasing. They’re not just innovating the GPUs. They’re innovating the entire production of intelligence. The racks (the new massive chip, call it Silicon-in-Rack), the connections, the cooling, the design of the chips, the software, etc. it’s easy to see where they are headed: an entire data center of entirely interconnected GPUs. One massive GPU consisting of thousands or even millions of Blackwell equivalent chips.\n\nBottom line is this AI boom is just starting and it will never end. It’s really a “compute” boom, and we know the trend of compute. What we are seeing is the transition from CPU to GPU as the general purpose compute system and Nvidia has the reigns.
