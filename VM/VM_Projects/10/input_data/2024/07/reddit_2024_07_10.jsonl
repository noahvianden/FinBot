Any option experts have tips on what might be a good one? I‚Äôm considering Dec 2026 expiry since this‚Äôll be a long-term hold and I have no plans to sell until H2 2026.\n\nSome things I‚Äôm unsure on:\n\n* $250 and $280 Dec 2026 calls have way more open interest than others. Is it generally a good idea to follow the demand and buy ones with large open interest? It seems like the % gains for today are relatively lower than calls w/ similar strikes, so wasn‚Äôt sure if that had any effects.\n   * EDIT: per [AscendedMeister](https://www.reddit.com/user/AscendedMeister/)'s comment, looks like Robinhood is using Ask price to calculate % gains. Here's when I switch to using Last Trade price. The phenomenon still exists but isn't as bad now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8rqciwunlbd1.png?width=2904&format=png&auto=webp&s=19769907670076e270db74aa3365147aa69a03c0\n\n* What‚Äôs the best way to determine how much to buy if I want 3x the upside as normal shares? Basically want 3x my current $600k shares so 1.8m notional, but not end up losing 900k if a 50% correction were to happen. Today the $250 calls gained 7.6% while NVDA gained 2.5%, so roughly 3x upside. Would then putting in $600k into these calls be a good rough approximation? With this I‚Äôm hoping to minimize my downside to only lose my entire stack of $600k instead of $900k if a 50% correction does happens.\n\nThank you, apologies for the noob questions.
