{"title": "I found the catalyst for the 2024 crash 2", "selftext": "If you are not familiar with my thesis, it can be read below: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ad9qme/i\\_found\\_the\\_catalyst\\_for\\_the\\_2024\\_crash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ad9qme/i_found_the_catalyst_for_the_2024_crash/)\n\nThe TLDR of that thesis is that based on previous rate hiking, pausing and cutting cycles, we to some degree can predict the overall shape and potential time window markets have to rally then correct. \n\nIn the last phases of the tech bubble and the housing bubble, the rate hiking cycle ALWAYS produced new all time highs. In my opinion anyways, the only reason markets stumbled at all in 2021 was the war. This unquestionably set in motion what was needed to accelerate what was going to become a building inflation problem anyways. \n\nYour pause phase ALWAYS ended higher. During the housing bubble, the pause phase saw a face ripping 22.5% rally from the date they last hiked rates to the 1st day they cut them. So many people are sitting around wondering how we got here and its just math/history/algos using all that. \n\nAs per my last post, there were two metrics. Time and price. Oct 16, 2024 (this was based on how long the fed held rates during the housing bubble). The expected price if we rallied 22.5% was SPY 557.51 (based on July 26, 2023's closing price when the last rate hike took place). \n\nWe have accomplished one but not the other. Interestingly enough it just so happens that apparently markets dont like going above this number. But I think this is psycology because any imbicile could calcuate what I calculated without much elbow grease at all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9q8ojoh4zbd1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ccbf034545544cf13ef70e83fc7753e05449a2\n\nYou will notice as well that volume lately is a little light. For being excited about new all time highs, those recent selly days seem to be sporting more volume if you catch my drift. \n\nIn my opinion, CPI was good today. Markets got what they were looking for in terms of expectations. The soft landing appears to be in tact. Theres really no other reason to sell up here aside from being over a pre calcuable number associated with the last market crash. No one wants to lose 60% from here like they did in the past so why risk it? \n\nI still don't think however this is the all time high. I lean more towards this coming sometime in Sept or Oct. The fed has to cut rates before we can start heading lower. Even when they cut, we have to expect retail traders will misread this as good news and push markets up a good 3-5% from whatever that number is. But that will be a really good crowd to sell your holdings to. SO I think theres more gas in the tank. No bearish positions until  after the cut, this to me is the way. \n\nSomething has to happen right? You can't just have the economy fall apart for no percise reason. Some event usually happens. Like in the 2008 financial crisis, that big send down in Oct can be pinpointed to news congress did not pass a rescue bill but chose to delay it with further debate. So something has to break and get some awareness to it. \n\nI'm not going to go super deep into CRE aside from them loans are due at the end of this year. Whats going to happen when they have to refi? It's not like the values consistently declining year over year helps their loan to value at all:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tb0l6xf6zbd1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3bd25b8fdf90e8f818fcaa881682f30180f019e\n\nThis is wildly stark contrast to residential real estate. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6gm943x6zbd1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=6593e8a8cb95c7a0396da1e06728edc002cf30a9\n\nSo the problems still cookin, but its not due yet. October or sometime further out there seems more likely to be a time that will mark the top out. Certainly in the near term, people appear scared of these higher prices in the markets. \n\nIts not like we are even out of the woods on the presidential front either. I just heard Biden legitimatley call Trump his vice president when he was supposed to refer to Kamala Harris. Theres all the legal stuff with Trump being a felon and Biden coming accross as having dementia that is really stirring up the pot. I mean I can't remember a time when a presidents own party was actively advocating for him to not run again so close to the actual election. So all this is new stuff! It's very intersting. I don't care about politics or who wins at all, but I know its going to make for volatility. \n\nWe go out to October, how do people feel about the election then? Theres going to be alot of people who want to be risk off for the outcome of this election. So when are they going to go risk off? It'll be in advance of it. \n\nIn my opinion whoever wins is going to inherit the mess that turns into 2025 (assuming 2024 is basically 2007 and 08 is next year). We already got a bunch of retail  stocks getting nuked out here. LULU and NKE both are getting the business right now and thats a direct window into consumers not buying stuff they don't need anymore. Which can only mean people are becoming more poor. Which  can only mean profits will shrink and future values will have to be revised lower. \n\nIt's all just a cascading domino. I dont know whats going to happen to the banks when CRE blows up or how long that blow up is going to last. Maybe we are due for a multi year pull back or its a nice 12 month 60% decline. Either way Its commin. \n\nWhat I will say is that ironically in the past these big bubble bursts see 60% declines. If you price out a 60% decline from our newest all time high of 561.67, you would get 224.67 for SPY. This would place you at pandemic lows. I say this is possible because in my prior posts, You can see how the housing bubble lows actually went to the tech bubble lows. Wild stuff. \n\n[Monthly chart](https://preview.redd.it/ukvcm2em9zbd1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d660c45ffe3973d744101e8191cc3af6a0c8c89)\n\nThis post is a little more about commentary than the data as much hasn't really changed. I still expct a higher all time high. Say SPY got to 600. Well 60% off of that number still places you back to 240. being at 240 is still within the march lows and lower than April 2020's low of 243.90. Why do I like to work backwards for price targets?

{"title": "The 8 \"secrets\" of when to sell stocks. Do you have any other ideas?", "selftext": "1. **Everyone makes mistakes. Just be sure to cut all losses short.** Even the best investors get hit with a loss from time to time. But they don't indulge in worry as the stock drops even further. They¬†[cut their losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/)¬†and move on. Leave your ego and pride at the door. Don't let a loss get to you ‚Äî either mentally or financially.\n2. **If you don't sell too early, you'll sell too late.** To lock in solid gains, sell while your stock is still going up. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil has said, \"Your objective is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger.\" Following the¬†[20%-25% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/)¬†can help you do that. In a strong bull market, leading growth stocks like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Apple can, of course, run longer than expected. But locking in some profits along the way allows investors to safeguard a portion of those gains, while still maintaining a position to take advantage of a continued run. It also reduces the risk of giving back too much in an extended pullback.\n3. **Have a sell plan in place**¬†***before***¬†**you buy.** The real drama kicks in when it comes time to sell. If you don't have sell rules and an exit plan, it's easy to freeze and not take action when needed. If your stock is soaring, you might get greedy and ignore certain sell signals and warning signs. Also, if you're sitting on a loss, you may do the \"hold and hope\" routine. You pray it bounces back ‚Äî while it continues to drop. Stay grounded and keep your emotions at bay by having a selling plan in place ahead of time. Write down your target sell prices for both taking profits and cutting losses.\n4. **Don't let a decent gain turn into a loss.** If you have a nice gain of, say, 10%, 15% or more and the stock begins to decline, don't let that profit disappear completely. It's much less frustrating to see a 15%-20% gain turn into a 5%-10% profit than to see it turn into a 10% loss. You can always buy the stock back if it shows renewed strength and forms a proper¬†[buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).\n5. **Don't marry your stocks. Just date them!** \"For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer\" is a noble and time-honored approach to marital fealty, but it's a bad idea when it comes to¬†[investing in stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors). In most cases, it's better to take a good gain while you have it. And never hesitate to separate and protect yourself from a bad relationship if there are clear signs of trouble.\n6. **Sell your losing stocks first.** When building a winning basketball team, you wouldn't trade away all your top players for a bunch of benchwarmers. Yet many investors do just that. They sell stocks in which they have a good gain and hold those showing a loss. Further, they think a big gain is just around the corner. That's usually just wishful thinking. Do the opposite. Sell your losers and use that money ‚Äî provided the¬†[market trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends)¬†is favorable ‚Äî to add winners to your roster or invest more money in the top performers you already own.\n7. **When buying a stock, focus on both the fundamentals and the stock chart. When selling, focus on the chart.** They say the view is great at the top, and that often applies to stocks as well. The warning signs typically show up in the¬†[stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis)¬†‚Äî i.e.,¬†[technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/)¬†‚Äî before they appear in the company's fundamentals. It's crucial to use both technical and fundamental analysis when¬†[buying stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener). The same is true on deciding when to sell stocks. Focus on the chart and technical analysis, like¬†[price and volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/)¬†action and behavior around key¬†[moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).\n8. **The most important sell rule is to buy at the right time.** A very common mistake, particularly for¬†[beginning investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors), is buying at the wrong time. Some will not pay attention to¬†[market timing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends)¬†and buy during a market correction when most stocks go down. Or they'll ignore the technical action in the¬†[stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis)¬†and either buy too soon or too late.

Since you like your AI answers here is my low effort answer:**\n\n\n\n\nHere are additional pieces of advice and refinements to the existing ones to enhance your investment strategy:\n\nDiversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different sectors and asset classes can help mitigate risk and smooth out returns over time.\n\nStay Informed: Continuously educate yourself about the market, sectors of interest, and specific companies you invest in. Knowledge is power in investing, and staying updated can help you make informed decisions.\n\nUnderstand the Business: Invest in companies whose business models you understand. This allows you to better grasp their potential and the risks involved.\n\nSet Realistic Goals: Have clear, achievable investment goals based on your financial situation and risk tolerance. This helps you stay focused and avoid emotional decisions.\n\nRegularly Review Your Portfolio: Periodically assess your holdings to ensure they still align with your investment strategy and goals. This helps you stay on track and make adjustments as needed.\n\nWatch for Sector Rotation: Be aware that market leadership can shift from one sector to another. Stay agile and be prepared to adjust your portfolio accordingly.\n\nManage Taxes: Be mindful of the tax implications of your trades. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help you manage your tax bill more effectively.\n\nBe Patient: Successful investing often requires patience. Avoid the temptation to frequently buy and sell based on short-term market movements.\n\nHave an Emergency Fund: Ensure you have a cash reserve to cover unexpected expenses. This prevents you from having to liquidate investments at an inopportune time.\n\nLearn from Mistakes: Analyze your past trades, especially the unsuccessful ones. Understanding what went wrong can provide valuable lessons for future decisions.\n\nFollow a Consistent Investment Strategy: Whether it‚Äôs value investing, growth investing, or a hybrid approach, stick to a consistent strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.\n\nStay Disciplined: Emotions can cloud judgment. Stick to your plan and avoid making impulsive decisions based on market hype or fear.\n\nUtilize Dollar-Cost Averaging: This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market conditions. It reduces the impact of volatility and removes the guesswork of trying to time the market.\n\nKnow When to Take Profits: Set profit targets and stick to them. Taking profits at predefined levels ensures you lock in gains without getting greedy.\n\nUse Stop-Loss Orders: Implementing stop-loss orders can help you manage risk by automatically selling a stock if it falls to a certain price, protecting you from significant losses.\n\nFocus on Total Return: Consider both capital gains and dividends when evaluating the performance of an investment. A high dividend yield can provide steady income and reduce the reliance on capital gains alone.\n\nBy integrating these additional tips into your investment approach, you can create a more robust strategy that helps you navigate the complexities of the stock market more effectively.", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "9.

Rather than doing homework, traveling the Amalfi coast on a yacht, ripping bongs, and eating thongs, I‚Äôd rather spend a moment sharing my thoughts on HOOD. Not your boyfriend‚Äôs wife‚Äôs husband‚Äôs HOOD. I‚Äôm talking about Robinhood, the innovator for the investor. Not Cuckles Schwab or Fuckidtly.  I hope you‚Äôre ready for a highly regarded DD supporting my 160k tuition bill. To get in front of the dildo in the room, in 2021, Robinhood screwed me and many others over on a lot of money, but look, just because your hoe makes a mistake, you don‚Äôt get rid of your hoe. You train and teach your hoe so that next time, your hoe buys you the proper sauce for your tendies. Also, idk if any of you fellow regards spent some time on certain stock subreddits, but holy cow‚Ä¶ Since I‚Äôm limited to pictures now, bear with this wall of text ‚Äì I know you can't read, so I‚Äôll do a TLDR at the end. \n\nThe stock has rocketed this year, but Vlad has plenty of room to take this verdant Hood to Pluto. You will experience a soft leather embrace with a whisper of ancient forests reflecting a sanctuary against your losses. Unlike other experiences with Vlad‚Äôs, we know. Below is an outline of the platform appreciation from 1Q23 to 1Q24.\n\n***Funded customers have gone from 23 million to 24 million over the past year.***\n\n***Gold subscribers have gone from 1.2 million to 1.7 million.***\n\n***AUC ‚Äì Assets under Custody have gone from $78billion to $130 billion.***\n\n***Net deposits have gone from $4.4 to $ 11.2 billion.***\n\nAs of Q1, Robinhood has grown its user base with additional headwinds to keep people happy and to attract consumers. IDK about you, but I‚Äôm about AUC. AUC is the lifeblood of the Hood. It drives everything else and signals positive investment performance, acquisition of new customers, and expanding geographic and product footprint. To keep you in mind ‚Äì this is data as of March 31, 2024. Over the past 4-5 months, the market has gone crazy, and who benefits ‚Äì Hood. Expect these numbers to increase significantly within their 2Q24 report.\n\n***Outline of LTM (last twelve months) financial statistics from 1Q23 to 1Q24 ‚Äì I‚Äôm drooling and wet. Some may call me mango man.***\n\n***Total net revenue grew by \\~40% or $177million -$441 to $618***\n\n***Operating expenses grew by \\~12% or 46 million‚Äì your mom likes this ratio - $352 to $398***\n\n***Net income went from a negative $511 to a positive $157 million ‚Äì holy balls, batman ‚Äì this growth ratio looks similar to RK's return on a certain stock***\n\nFinancial Health ‚Äì this company has finally turned a profit and will continue to do so. 2Q24 I was glued to my phone, physically calling and putting stocks left and right. We all know the 2Q24 results will be similar, and we can thank our boy RK / RC for hyping all you clown up. Robinhood's cash runway is over three years if it maintains its current positive free cash flow level and many of its costs are fixed. It currently has $9.3 billion in cash and $6.6 billion in stockholder equity. We know these guys are M&A heavy with the current purchase of Bitstamp catering towards Crypto Chads and Shirley Temples. The next play for Robinhood for M&A could be health, auto, and home insurance for the boyfriend's wife's husband's insurance. (we know the terrible insurance companies are faltering, and private equity is scooping these bad boys up). By by by insurance agents / \"financial representatives,\" hello Robinhood\n\nNow let's talk about the Credit Card. I'm canceling my Amex Reserve, that's if I don't die in a Boeing airplane first. This gold trophy from Hood will fuel my casino playing, and to top it off, it has no annual fees outside of Robinhood gold and 3% back on all purchases. Now I can reinvest the cash I spend on my boyfriend's and wife's Gucci sleds and buy more Otm calls. Buying alcohol - boom, Otm calls on Grinder, and the 5% back on travel is just icing on the cake. No longer are we locked into buying off-brand apple air pods for a 50% premium or getting a free trip to Gary Indian with perks from American Express, Chase, and other shit cardboard.\n\n Currently, 1 million people are interested in a gold card, and we all know we love to gamble, eat, and consume way beyond our abilities. \"According to a Bankrate survey in November 2023, 49% of credit card holders in the US carry a balance from month to month, which means they could be charged interest on their purchases. This is up from 39% in 2021 and **47%** in July 2023. The average credit card debt for those with a balance is **$4,773**\". We know the number is increasing due to printers, mango man, and handicap Joe. Besides additional members joining the platform, Robinhood will use your balances to generate extra monthly income.\n\n1,000,000 users \\* **47%** \\* **$4,773** \\* (20 ‚Äì 30%)/12 APR \\* a 20% discount for people that can't pay = we are looking at an additional $29.9 million to $44.9 million per month.\n\nThat doesn't even include the Fees merchants pay to accept the card. The way my boyfriend's wife and husband eat, we know that these fees are no joke.\n\nIf that didn't help, they also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program, with the process taking place over two to three years, beginning in the third quarter of 2024. And we all know what happens with share buybacks.\n\nWhile many of you gents and ladies yolo your wife's boyfriend's paycheck into Otm spy or Nvidia calls or buying doge on margin. Who is the real winner here? Robinhood. With all this in mind, the subsequent earnings will be massive in the first week of August. I'm betting my left nut, tuition, and a party in the Alps that Robinhood will crush earnings due to all you knuckle grinders buying CHEWY, SiriusXM, Telsa, GRINDR, and Nvidia. Robinhood will announce a new tiered subscription to leverage their newly acquired AI Fintech, Pluto, to let us simple folk play with Legos (algorithms) and trading AI tools in the coming months. The current Gold Subscriber is offered a robust product offering and is sticky, with churn of \\~0.8%. Most of us here wouldn't bat an eye if Robinhood bumped this up to $10 a month, doubling Robinhood's current gold member income of $90 million to $180 million.\n\nIn the past, Robinhood stock has been associated with crypto movement and volatility. However, if we were to come to stock prices today vs the past. Feb 2024\n\n**Bitcoin ‚Äì \\~58k**\n\n**Robinhood - \\~$16 a share**\n\n**July 2024**\n\n**Bitcoin ‚Äì \\~58k**\n\n**Robinhood - \\~$22 a share**\n\nRobinhood is slowly decoupling its downward movement from crypto.\n\nAll ‚Äì positions below the share price of $32 by the end of the year. I‚Äôd expect a nice climb to the mid-high 20s after earnings and break $30 by October. Positions below. **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE! I‚Äôm just cranking hawg. I‚Äôm buying every dip until earnings**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jnytxcb9wbd1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc58da4073f9fa8a2eff9911d5f6bb3a1bf86268\n\nI‚Äôm just trying to apply what I learned in class and provide some helpful DD. Also, what no one is telling us, poors, is that private equity is chomping at the bit to get retailer money so they can charge us sexy management fees/carry and continue to serve us degens. I bet in a year, there‚Äôll be new private equity offerings to us simple folk through brokerage firms like Robinhood.\n\n**TLDR: Robinhood is undervalued; they are printing money and doing shit with it, unlike a certain stock, with multiple new product offerings, and has massive market penetration with young generations. If you want to play earnings - calls 8/9, calls with a break-even of $23-$24 will make you rich. If you don‚Äôt want to play earnings, consider mid-August or anything at the end of 3Q24-4Q24. You‚Äôll thank me later. Once again this is not financial advice ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know shit but I‚Äôm a strong believer - ban me if this doesn't hit $25 a share by August 9, 2024.** ", "id": "1e0plai", "created_utc": 1720706279.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 week ago\n**Total Comments** | 1 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If someone claims to be from a T10 MBA, then they are in an MBA ranked 8-10, otherwise they‚Äôd say the more common T7 lol", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "This guy definitely didn't go to some shit school like OSU.

Currently, this ratio stands close to its all-time high, surpassing the levels seen during the 2000 dot-com bubble crash and the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nHowever, corporate EPS growth remains strong, suggesting that although companies may appear overvalued now, these multiples could align with reality as earnings continue to rise. Forward earnings expectations have consistently increased over the past few years, potentially explaining why investors are willing to pay high premiums for stocks at current prices.\n\n**Shortcomings for Buffett Indicator**\n\nDespite its strengths, the Buffett Indicator also has limitations. One significant issue is that many large companies derive substantial profits from international markets, which could make GDP a less relevant measure.‚ÄÇ\n\nAnother current concern is that a few dominant mega-cap stocks have driven most of the market's gains over the past 18 months.
