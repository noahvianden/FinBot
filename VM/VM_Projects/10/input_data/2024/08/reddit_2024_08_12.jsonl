The cost scales quadraticly with context tokens.\n\nNew breakthroughs in alternatives that scale linear like RNNs with expressive hidden states [TTS-Linear]\n(https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04620v1)\nmay cause Transformers to not be the end architecture that will take as further (although there's a lot more to squeeze out of them imo). Leading to big advancements in cost efficency in the future. This would cause an impact on GPU usage, obviously impacting Nvidia's revenue. And this is just one example of future optimazation.\n\nThe good thing is that anything new has to be trained again, even if it's more efficient at it. \n\nWhat do you think? Is it possible cost efficency would just up the usage and usability while keeping the demand for chip's high or may it really bottleneck NVIDIA in the future, like in a 10-15 year perspective?\n\nedit: language, text formatting", "id": "1eq9dpf", "created_utc": 1723455432.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "As long as West Taiwan doesn’t invade Taiwan, NVDA will be fine.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "There’s a West Taiwan?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "West Taiwan, China, same thing", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "r/whoosh", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Cute.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "It's hard to say.
