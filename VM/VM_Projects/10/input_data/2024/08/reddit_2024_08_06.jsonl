No reason they wouldn't be able to continue doing so. \n\n>How many have they built so far?\n\nVehicles? I dunno man, like hundred million or so maybe? Probably more, tbh. It's a big company. \n\n>What factory(ies) will these millions of vehicles be built at?\n\nProbably the ones in Beijing first, I would guess.

Pretty clearly, this is a company capable of financing technology programs same as it always has. Again, treating Mercedes of all companies like it's a YC prospect is... just odd. \n\n>I think you‚Äôre vastly underestimating the scale of the hardware problem\n\nI think you're dramatically overestimating how hard it is for an automobile manufacturer to build automobiles..?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I didn‚Äôt ask how many vehicles they‚Äôve built.

I‚Äôm well aware Mercedes is a century old and has built millions of vehicles per year.\n\nSure, it seems pretty obvious. We're in agreement there. It's a weird question to ask, as you've asked it. \n\nIf you're well aware Mercedes is a century old and has built millions of vehicles per year, then you shouldn't be fegining concern over whether they can build a few million more. \n\n>I asked how many robotaxis they‚Äôve built.\n\nAgain, it's a weird question to ask. The only companies which have built any robotaxis at all are Stellantis-Waymo, Jaguar-Waymo, General Motors, Toyota, and I think.. BAIC, maybe? I think FAW has some operational via Apollo? \n\nBut like half of those robotaxis are just... regular vehicles with computers added to them. Waymo's Jaguar robotaxis are arguably the best in the world and also just old D7 vehicles with some TPUs in the trunk and a sensor package glued to the roof. \n\nI dunno. Again, the way you're asking the question is very weird. It's clear you're trying to form some sort of badly thought-out gotcha. \n\n>They‚Äôll need sensors and expensive processing units to build their robotaxis. Who will be supplying those?\n\nUh, probably NVDA in abstract, like anyone else. Packages built by TSMC or Samsung Foundry, like anyone else. Then any number of board manufacturers, again like anyone else. Renesas, Bosch, Valeo, Forvia... whomever. \n\nAgain, the question you're asking here is really weird. There's a well-established supply chain for chip fabrication and packaging, it's basically just ARM-NVDA-TSMC or similar. I think Thor is TSMC 3N but I can't recall if that's confirmed. \n\n>Do they have contracts in place to receive millions of them every year?\n\nSure? I'm really not sure what your concern here is, do you doubt the ability of TSMC to make...chips? Or Mercedes to... intake automotive parts?\n\n>And once they‚Äôre building these robotaxis, what will happen to them?\n\nThey'll probably go into service, I would assume. That's theoretically the objective. \n\n> Who will be buying them?\n\nCustomers.. looking for robotaxi rides? \n\nOr are you asking who would be holding the ownership documents of these vehicles? Presumably Mercedes' financing arm or another similar entity. \n\n>If the answer is they‚Äôre not selling them, then who‚Äôs paying for them to be built?\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure why you think this is a novel question. Who pays to get anything built? Capital is generally financed, but there are dozens of different financial structures for building things. \n\nAgain, a very weird question to ask. \n\n>Every company in this space that isn‚Äôt Tesla (perhaps barring Chinese companies) lacks an actual plan for how they‚Äôre going to go from having a prototype to having a profitable robotaxi network.\n\nHow are you aware of the financial plans of every company in this space which isn't Tesla? \n\nBy which mechanism have you acquired this proprietary insider information?

{"title": "How Terrifying is the Start of August?", "selftext": "Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading.\n\nAlthough the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50!\n\nSub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas.\n\nüëâ As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut!\n\nHence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sg4274tnvxgd1.jpg?width=1471&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=567f2381222aa22bc63542527bab39f99fa94ba5\n\n", "id": "1el42sg", "created_utc": 1722904543.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1el42sg/how_terrifying_is_the_start_of_august/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I didn't read your text but that picture is glorious.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I like that in the sea of red, AMD and CRWD is green of all stocks¬†", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "This. \n\nThe market isn't even at a 3 month low. \n\nThe \"crash\" is bullshit.\n\nNow maybe it'll actually crash, but it hasn't at this point.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The only thing terrifying is that I didn't YOLO my entire account on SPY puts on the 1st.
