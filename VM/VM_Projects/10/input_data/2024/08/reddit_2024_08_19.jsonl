{"title": "Levered Trade That Blew Up in 2008 Gets a $600 Million ETF Redo", "selftext": "A leveraged strategy for diversifying investments that crashed spectacularly in the financial crisis is back. This time, the designers say they’ve ironed out the problems.\n\nThe offering, known as portable alpha since the 1980s but recently rechristened “return stacking,” has caught on in exchange-traded funds sold by Newfound Research and ReSolve Asset Management. Cash is creeping into the ETFs billed as one-stop shops for cross-asset diversification that use borrowed money and derivatives to amp up firepower.\n\nWhile the math is thorny, the core principle is that if you package up enough uncorrelated bets, it’s no sin to use leverage to juice the overall return. Creators bill them not strictly as standalone products but building blocks in even larger portfolios, boiling down multiple tasks of diversification to a single button click.\n\nIt’s the latest attempt by Wall Street to market sophisticated investment concepts to the masses. While portable alpha strategies have delivered solid risk-adjusted gains in good times, they burned pensions and endowments alike in 2008 when leveraged and illiquid wagers backfired.\n\nRodrigo Gordillo, president and portfolio manager of ReSolve, says the disastrous outcomes of the past were the result of too much leverage concentrated in too few bets. By stacking uncorrelated assets at a time when stocks and bonds are more inclined to move together, he expects the new breed of ETFs to better weather market rough patches.\n\n“We focus on systematic macro as a sprinkling of tail protection and as a recognition that there’s a flaw in an equity-bond portfolio,” he said. “We want to increase stack returns, but we want to keep risk at bay. And you can do that if you’re stacking diverse things that are zigging when the underlying is zagging.”\n\nInvestors learned the benefit of spreading out bets during the summer equity rout. When the S&P 500 sank more than 8% for its worst correction since October, a plain cross-asset portfolio as tracked by the RPAR Risk Parity ETF (RPAR) lost only 1%, buttressed by gains from Treasuries. Yet since stocks started bouncing back, RPAR’s edge has been almost reversed.\n\nWhile sound in theory, return stacking is not risk free. For one, leverage works both ways and margin borrowing will work against investors in a downtrend. Further, the stacked return is typically selected based on a historical relationship that may or may not last, particularly over shorter periods. Like other asset-allocation models, the benefit tends to manifest over longer stretches than retail investors may be willing to endure.\n\n“Investors should view returns stacking and capital efficiency as tools to help make the inconsistent return profiles associated with portfolio diversifiers like managed futures and commodities more palatable and easier to live with,” said Michael Crook, chief investment officer at Mill Creek Capital Advisors. “But they have to understand the underlying composition of each fund in order to make sure they are using them correctly within a portfolio context.”\n\nIn less than a year, RSST has garnered $200 million assets. Along with three other funds, including one launched in May, total assets under the return-stacking umbrella now exceed $600 million.\n\nMost of these funds hold either equities or fixed income as the core and seek stacked returns from dissimilar assets. For now, it’s often a strategy that makes bullish and bearish wagers via futures based on an asset’s price momentum. Picking from a pool of 27 diverse markets, ReSolve and Newfound try to duplicate the performance of a widely tracked index of trend-following trades.\n\nThe tactics don’t come cheap. RSST, for instance, has an expense ratio of about 1%, well above the average ETF. Still, in the eyes of the managers, that’s reasonable considering funds specializing in managed futures usually charge 1.7%.\n\nReSolve and Newfound plan to introduce two more funds this year with bonds working as the base in both cases. The stacked returns will originate from strategies focused on futures yield and merger arbitrage, respectively.\n\n“The ambition ultimately is to make this a nine to twelve products suite,” said Corey Hoffstein, chief investment officer of Newfound. “It’s all about getting the Legos out the door and letting advisers pick and choose how to combine these building blocks.”\n\nThe introduction of return-stacked ETFs is occurring alongside a debate about whether diversified portfolios were ever the right prescription for buy-and-hold investors, an old claim that got a new airing in November when three researchers claimed a wrongheaded devotion to bonds had cost retirees trillions of dollars in lost profits over the last century.\n\nHoffstein and Gordillo’s products reflect the long-standing academic rebuttal to such arguments: that adding a dash of leverage to the mix is a reliable way to push a blended portfolio past just stocks on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nThat idea was adopted in 2018 by WisdomTree Inc. in its leveraged version of the widely followed 60%-share, 40%-bond allocation, which was then labeled 90/60. The ETF, later renamed as WisdomTree US Efficient Core Fund (NTSX), beat the S&P 500 in the first three years before tumbling 27% during the pandemic bear market.\n\nBehind NTSX’s bad year was a breakdown in the historic relationship where stocks and bonds tended to move in opposite directions. In 2022 when inflation raged, however, the two assets sold off together and leverage made things worse.\n\nStacked returns aren’t immune from drawdowns, either. Since RSST’s inception, the trend-following strategy has suffered losses amid swift market reversals. As a result, the fund is behind the S&P 500 by 8 percentage points.\n\nStill, the approach may appeal to today’s diversified investors, who’ve had to sit and watch as gains in a handful of technology stocks made anything other than owning a simple S&P 500 ETF a distant second in terms of portfolio gains.

{"title": "Gitlab (GTLB) is going to show a profit for the first time on 9/3", "selftext": "Gitlab reports Q2 earnings on 9/3. In their [Q1 earnings](https://ir.gitlab.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gitlab-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial-results) they showed lots of good news, including earnings (loss) beat, 33% YoY revenue increase, and for the first time ever, positive cash flow. (This was due, in part, to short-term investments, which I like to think means they're gambling on FDs.) They're already showing a non-GAAP profit, and are very close to a GAAP profit.\n\nThey've beaten guidance every quarter, but they're not giving weak guidance IMO. So they're legit beating expectations, not just on paper.\n\nMore than that, though, they're very stable. Their margin is constant YoY, their R&D is pretty constant, their acquisitions are reasonable for their cash, etc. To me that means they're making \"honest\" money: stable revenue growth without accounting tricks, whipsawing budgets or other line items, or other signs that they're trying too hard.\n\nThey're name-dropping AI for the buff, but they're not wasting money on it, which I think is smart. Their acquisitions have been things that make sense for their product offerings, not AI BS.\n\nTheir competition is mainly Azure, RH, and I think AWS has something too. In my opinion, only Azure is a real risk. Gitlab is tightening up their relationship with Google, so they've pretty much drawn the battle-lines versus MSFT. Long-term I'm not sure I'd bet against Azure, but short-term, like the next couple years, I think there's *lots* of room for Gitlab to make money.\n\nTheir PE ratio is -35 and they're very close to profitability. Their EPS guidance for Q2 is 0.09 - 0.10, so if they even get close the market is going to need to figure out the new, positive PE ratio, and that probably means a sharp jump and a lot of volatility. PE ratios near 0 are poorly defined, so as they cross that boundary in Q2 there's going to be some spikes.\n\nPost-earnings calls are sitting at between 75% and 85% IV, with theta about double vega. That's not great, not terrible, but IMO we're going to see a run-up as hype builds for their first profitable quarter earnings.\n", "id": "1ew4xt3", "created_utc": 1724081866.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 426 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ew4xt3/gitlab_gtlb_is_going_to_show_a_profit_for_the/) \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "We've been using GitLab for 10 years.
