{"title": "AI in advertising - can it justify the cost?", "selftext": "Here’s a question:\nGen AI costs a lot. It will inevitably change the world, but the question is how much money it will be able to generate.\n\n\nBack then when internet came and reformed the world, it has opened a completely new market.\nLet’s talk big here - advertising.\n\n\nOf course AI is opening a lot of new markets, but small markets. It is essentially an improvement on the internet. But how will it disrupt the advertising market? \n\n\nPopulation growth is slowing down. Almost everyone has a smartphone now, and almost everyone spends as much time on the internet as they can. Maybe there is growth until gen X gets completely replaced, where really almost everyone will actively use the internet for everything.\n\n\nMy question is at the current status of the world, is it the case of large companies stealing each others share from the market, or there are still parts left from the cake?\n\n\nIn limited people in the world, with limited people left to conquer, everyone having smart phone, watching the maximum amount of ads people tolerate, what’s left to get? The only way I see here is to sell more expensive ads. How can companies keep up with the extreme growth rate we seen in tech so far?\n\n\nMaybe AI can create even more accurately targeted ads, with extremely high conversion rate, in which case ads can be sold for more, but still there won’t be that much more people to show more ads to. Can the ads performance justify the massive costs of AI, or it’s just the case of every large company burning up their money on AI just to cover their existing shares from the market, in which case I can’t see uptrend there, just a massive bear market.\n\n\nIn any case, I see Meta a very strong player here, the disruption of making LLAMA open source was just brilliant, strong on ads, and one of the earliest players in the ai game.\n\n\nWhat do you think?", "id": "1f0t0n7", "created_utc": 1724580528.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "This looks like a Chatgpt post.

Strategists don’t have to spend as much time looking for specific data now that Ai can find some of the “patterns” much quicker. I’ve also seen them create the target market persona pages using Ai. There is still a lot of human input required to create a working strategy, but Ai has sped up the process. (Take this section with a grain of salt since it’s not what I interact with the most, just what I’ve heard from friends).\n\nCreatively, Ai has mainly sped up a lot of the behind the scenes work. Pitch theater if you will. I used to work in an agency in which art directors were photoshop gurus and could mock something up to elevate a concept. That is now a thing of the past, generative Ai can do that so much quicker. It’s not perfect, but when you’re trying to just pitch something internally, Ai is more than good enough. Also, why use stock images when you can get Ai to create much more custom imagery to represent your idea. It’s not uncommon to use Ai as the foundation and then incorporate photoshop to truly hone the visual. All in all, you don’t need as many people to be part of pitches now.\n\nWhen we hire external production companies I now see countless Ai images. A production company had one of their character concept artists run their 2D drawings through Ai to show how they would look in 3D. These were still flat images, not renders, but I was incredibly surprised by quality of mock. You would’ve NEVER gotten to see 3D visuals of a character before getting client approval on the concept art, but with Ai you can now accelerate things that were further down the pipeline.\n\nCopywriting. I mean, not much to add here. Long scripts and ideation still gets a lot of love from my coworkers, but the quick tweets and captions that they used to hate, that’s Ai work now. \n\nThis is probably simplifying A LOT of things, but I can’t deny that Ai is already altering the workspace. Mainly by making everything move a lot faster, and if there is one thing that advertising clients LOVE, it’s fast. The pace of advertising has always been relentless, and in some way, Ai has come to both alleviate and exacerbate the problem. If your agency can produce more ads that target more people, you can bring more clients. \n\nThe industry has changed and many clients are \ndoing “one off projects” instead of signing annual contracts with agencies, but that’s not to say agency of record is not a thing anymore. An advertising agency is not just selling individual ads, it’s selling a whole suite of creative and strategy services.

{"title": "How many of you \"chase\" a stock?", "selftext": "Been selling options for the past 4 years and still learning. Started with selling CCs on AMC (got lucky when I bought 300 shares AMC really cheap during Dec-2020) and it ended up as a 10x bagger for me over it's life time. I was selling weeklies for 4 months in 2021 (IV was insane and I was getting $500 average premiums per week) until meme stock frenzy died and AMC lost it's juice. Having tasted success accidentally on CCs, stupid me though it's the name of the game and acquired bags of other meme stocks in hopes of earning weekly income. I bought 100 shares of BB, CLOV, WISH, NOK, BBBY, GME, and some more meme stocks that I can find in Reddit (WSB). Well! Party is over very quickly and I am left holding these bags with 90% drop in price. Lesson #1: always bank on stocks that are reliable and have good fundamentals.\n\nI had a quiet time in 2022 when the markets went down. I felt itchy and desperate and sold a CC on my META stock with a 45 DTE close to the stock price. META had an insane run in Jan-2023 and it quickly went out of my grasp. I have been wheeling TSLA since then and it is a very good one for me so far. My cost basis is almost down by $100/share but I am no longer desperate. Because of the wild nature of the stock, I just hang in there without doing anything until it comes up. Just trying not to repeat the mistake I did with META. I did get assigned on TSLA a couple of times, but I basically sold CSPs and wheeled it.\n\nLesson #2: be patient and not to be overly desperate. Also, I sell CCs only 1 0r 2 weeks ahead and let the theta work on my favor. I stopped selling 45 DTE CCs.\n\nApart from selling CCs on the stocks I own, now a days I mostly sell CSPs. I pick puts about 45 DTE with and sell anywhere between 0.30 to 0.50 delta. I close the position once I get 50% return and repeat it. Due to this bull market run, I constantly find myself needing more money to sell a CSP because the underlying stock is growing. I have a bunch of examples over the past year  (AMZN, GOOG, CAVA, ARM). I funded my RH account with 50K and have been selling CSPs. CAVA for example went crazy, my first CSP was for $55 SP and now it is around $120. I just leave stocks like these after a while because I cannot keep pumping money and chase the stock. I realize that I cannot beat the market by selling options but I am in for the long haul and also want to generate passive income. I started withdrawing money that I earned from my premiums to cover taxes and also for extra cash. That weekend dinner with family in a nice restaurant, a small home improvement project etc are now being funded from my Options money and that brings smile to me :) \n\nLonger term though, I am thinking of splitting my account into 2 categories - one for long term investment on ETFs to help boost my retirement savings and another for just weekly Options trading.
