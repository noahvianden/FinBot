This gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.

However, it's crucial to understand the equally important concept of gamma risk. \n\nGamma and theta go hand in hand; option sellers benefit from theta decay, while option buyers are compensated for that decay through gamma and the convexity it introduces. This is how most WSB regards make it. As options approach expiration, gamma risk increases, introducing convexity that makes options highly sensitive to price changes. \n\nThis convexity works against you, especially when the price moves towards your strike. When the price moves away from your strike, your delta declines slowly, and your P/L increases slowly. However, if the stock starts moving towards your strike, your profits can quickly turn into losses very quickly.\n\nFor example, suppose you've sold a -10 delta put option at $80, and the stock is trading at $100. When the stock moves away from you say to $102, your delta goes from -10 to -9 or -8 slowly, and as it goes further away, your delta declines, and your P/L increases slowly. But if the stock moves from $100 to $98, the gamma risk and convexity can cause your delta to shift from -10 to -20. Now, a $1 move in the underlying translates into a higher loss.

I think what got me down that road is sourcing info from the web: that in some back testing that selling options and holding them near or to expiration is more profitable.  (Option Alpha I think is one who states this explicitly).  But understanding the relationship in practice like you mentioned is hugely helpful.  In my mind I am trying to play risk reward for selling 90 DTE closing at 50% vs 20ish DTE at 80-90%.  I don't mind wheeling it if I get assigned in some instances, but at the same time don't want to take un-necessary risk, but I'm also fine being on the aggressive side.  I've found some success with using technicals to bias my trades in that scope, so I've found that shortening duration and selling closer to the strike price in the direction I think it might move can make sense.  For instance I'll sell shorter duration puts closer to the strike, or slightly ITM, particularly if the RSI is <20 or something like that.  But I def don't have enough experience to say I am doing it right and I want to make sure I'm just not getting lucky before I get crushed.  Ha. \n\n  \nSo just interested.  Is my thinking flawed there?  Would I still be better off selling 90ish DTE options and biasing my direction on selling those closer to the strike and collecting 50% vs shorter duration collecting at 80-90% all else equal?  I feel like when I have lengthened the duration I have had to have a much greater move (time / price) for the same profit, and I've felt like I've had to roll those longer duration positions even if I get the short term direction right, because of the inevitable counter move, when I would have been out of a shorter duration trade all together.  So my swing trade that would have been profitable, inevitably becomes a buy and hold, or takes forever to get out of. \n\nJust interested in what you guys have experienced?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Theta decay is going to get faster the closer you get to expiration.

You do this with lower costs to you over real-time and, if you so choose, can even get that extra $1 out of it without the gamma surges and rapid adaptation costs as expiry closes in. \n\nBasically you're just taking risk because you can see the outcome not because it is a great idea.

The Chinese data center company's share price was down 26.5% as of 2 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nGDS published its fourth-quarter earnings results before the market opened this morning, and there's a lot that investors aren't happy about. In addition to mixed sales and earnings performance, the company announced a new leadership appointment and fundraising move that indicate it will not sell its international segment.\n\nGDS serves up mixed Q4 results\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue increased 6.3% year over year to reach roughly 2.56 billion Chinese yuan -- or roughly $360.1 million. While the company's growth rate ticked up, the business still posted a net loss of roughly 3.16 billion yuan -- or roughly $445.7 million. For comparison, the business recorded a net loss of 177.9 million yuan in the prior-year quarter, which works out to roughly $24.9 million based on today's exchange rate.\n\nOn the other hand, the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 5.7% year over year to roughly 1.13 billion yuan -- or roughly $159.5 million. While the company's adjusted EBITDA margin dipped from 44.6% in the prior-year period to 44.3%, the sales increase was still enough to power mid-single-digit EBITDA growth\n\n\n‐--------------\n\nAlso, from Guru focus:\n\nBreaking Down GDS Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score\n\nA dissection of GDS Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals GDS Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total earnings ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating GDS Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.05; 2022: -0.06; 2023: -0.08, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates GDS Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.\n\n‐----------\n\nBut anyway, I don't like to buy companies making a loss.  It is why I buy BYD and not Nio, Xpeng or Xiaomi.
