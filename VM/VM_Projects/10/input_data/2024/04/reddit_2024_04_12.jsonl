Sometimes you can just print money.\n\nThe earnings reports show what I've been saying - good earnings will be rewarded and the market will continue to grind higher. Yes, it's a little lower right now, but we'll be higher coming out of this earnings season as companies keep reporting strong results.\n\nThe key points:\n\n* JPM, WF, and C all beat earnings expectations\n* Only Citigroup (C) stock is up on the reports\n* I think JPMorgan (JPM) is a good buying opportunity here\n\nLooking ahead, I expect the \"rate cuts\" narrative to return once the next inflation print comes around.\n\nThe bottom line is to keep buying the dips. This market is giving a great opportunity to make money, so take advantage of it.\n\nPS - yet again some folks reaching out to ask where to put money to work.

Buying DEEP ITM puts with an expiry of 5/24 or perphaps a bit longer\n\nMy questions and confusion are:\n\n1. what is more important in protecting against IV crush - purchasing ITM beforehand or having a longer expiry date?\n2. Does it matter how ITM I should be? Is there any big difference between purchasing 5 dollars ITM or 10 dollars ITM?\n3. I am confused about theta's impact on IV crush, especially since I plan on only holding my options for 1 day\n\nIf theta/time is extrinsic value, and IV crush only affects extrinsic value really, plus the fact I only plan on holding for 1 day or so, shouldn't I go with the weekly option?\n\nI have advised some people saying a longer expiry is better to defend against IV crush, but I don't understand that because longer expiry = more extrinsic value = more value to be killed during IV crush, right?\n\nEssentially, if I want to play the 4/23 earnings, and sell on 4/23, what combination of ITM + expiry should I use? How far in the money and what expiry would you advise?\n\nThanks.", "id": "1c2nkuy", "created_utc": 1712964491.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 31 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The fact that everyone is going for PUTs on Tesla, Musk going to come and announce something and stock will soar LOL", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nobody tell him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Since you want to de-risk IV crush, the best play IMO is a call credit spread.  If the stock goes down - you win, if IV goes down - you win.  If the stock goes up, you have a predefined loss and may be able to mitigate some of it as IV goes down as well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I sold 4/26 $160 calls.
