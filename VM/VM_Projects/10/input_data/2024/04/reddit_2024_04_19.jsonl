{"title": "Is the Fed's Restrictive Monetary Policy Really Doing Enough to Cool Inflation?", "selftext": "It seems like the Fed's aggressive rate hikes over the past year haven't been as effective at cooling demand and taming inflation as many hoped. Despite the most rapid tightening cycle in decades, the economy and labor market remain remarkably resilient. This has led to a growing debate among Fed officials and economists about whether current monetary policy is actually restrictive enough.\n\nMany policymakers, like Chair Powell, have signaled they expect rates to remain at their peak for some time. But there's increasing concern that high borrowing costs aren't sufficiently reining in demand to get inflation back to the 2% target. Some, like Boston Fed President Susan Collins, have warned that without cooling demand further, prices will continue facing upward pressure.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is the fact that much of the inflation progress in 2023 was due to easing supply chain issues and strong immigration, while demand chugged along unfazed. The economy grew rapidly in the second half of the year and retail sales continue exceeding expectations. This has skeptics questioning just how much policy is really constraining things.\n\nFinancial conditions have also played a confounding role. The market rally and drop in Treasury yields late last year, spurred by Fed hints at eventual rate cuts, may have worked against the central bank's tightening efforts. Some worry this easing of financial conditions could cause inflation's decline to stall out above target.\n\nThe situation has a growing number of Fed officials, like Governor Michelle Bowman, warning that policy may need to get more restrictive and stay there longer than anticipated. Cuts are looking both slimmer and further out on the horizon. Some are even coming around to the idea that the post-pandemic economy may simply run with permanently higher rates than we've been used to.\n\nAt this point, it seems the Fed has little choice but to wait and see if their medicine is working. But don't be surprised if rates stay higher for longer or even climb further if inflation remains stubbornly elevated in the face of resilient demand. Buckle up, because this inflation fight looks far from over!\nThoughts? Do you think the Fed is being restrictive enough or will they need to get even tougher to win the war on inflation?", "id": "1c7yrbq", "created_utc": 1713538167.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 8 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 20 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Money printer go brrrr.¬†", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "\nMoney shredder go shghthrhrhhrhrhr", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Not the fed that's the issue, it's government spending and then them going back to dad for more money cuz they can't pay the CC bill. \n\nGet out of running a deficit.  \n\nUntil then, we have BTC.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "This.
