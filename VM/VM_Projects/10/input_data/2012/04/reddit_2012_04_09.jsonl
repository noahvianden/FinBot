I'll try to list a few:\n\n- Classic game theory, if all carriers collude to reduce iPhone subsidization, inevitably one carrier will break off and offer original subsidy programs and steal a boatload of customers. People are far too hungry for iPhones.\n- Apple's staggering cash hoard; they could just acquire Sprint if the carriers piss them off. Sprint's bloody balance sheet won't put a dent in Apple and I'm sure they'd love to have their own national 4G network. \n- Current subsidy programs are profitable. They just are. Probably not as profitable as selling Android handsets, but profitable nonetheless. Why risk pissing off Tim Cook just to be more profitable?\n\nBottom line is, people want iPhones, they want them really badly. This is especially true for existing iPhone users who are upgrading to the latest and greatest. Tim Cook has all the leverage right now and there is nothing the carriers can do until some other company builds a more desirable handset. \n\nYou rarely see ATT, Verizon, etc pushing iPhone in their ads, mostly Android phones, because they want to raise awareness about iPhone alternatives. So far, these efforts have failed to unseat the iPhone as Apple's numbers show that the market has spoken.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think what's actually going to happen is people will have to serve the full 2 years of their contract before the carrier will subsidize another iPhone. AT&T used to give you an upgrade to the newest iPhone every year, then it was based on how much you paid a month. Verizon's will also make you wait. \n\nThe iPhone will still be $199, but if you want a new one every year, it's gonna be $399. People that get a new one every year is a small percentage of the customer base. Which is a percentage of worldwide iPhone sales, which doesn't work on subsidizes. Which is a percentage (although large) of Apple's business. Hence, while I see it as a definite possibility, it's effect is minimal, and doesn't whatsoever singlehandedly warrant a Hold rating.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "also, Apple will not acquire Sprint.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Won't declining subsidies equally effect all phones, including iPhone competitors?

I'm hoping to see the next iPhone available on all carriers (T-Mobile and small local carriers included); it'd open up to a huge new audience.  I know tons of people on small local carriers who desperately want an iPhone but can't get one because it will double their wireless bill and lock them in to a 2 year contract at that rate ($90 a month is AT&T's minimum; you can get a smartphone with data for $50 from T-Mobile and small local carriers).\n\n\nI dunno, I feel like the iPhone's growth has been heavily capped by the limited carrier availability so far, as well as the difficulties unlocking, and that stuff is starting to resolve itself.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPad is a rocketship.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Out of curiosity, how did you come up with this $700 target? Gut feeling or a model?\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't be so confident that Apple will blow out on 4/24 given how AAPL has surprised both to the downside and the upside the past two quarters. AAPL is priced for perfection, be careful, especially given the realistic possibility that consumers delayed iPad purchases for most of this quarter (iPad3 only came out towards the end).

I've been long since 110 (although I'm down to a fraction of my original position). While the valuation on a price to earnings basis is below its historical mean, obtaining this multiple is contingent upon Apple blowing out earnings without the help of massive holiday season spending and a delayed iPhone launch. My concerns pertaining to the valuation of the stock stem from outsized expectations. After last quarter's massive beat, an in-line quarter to a moderate beat will likely see the momentum in the stock halt. \n\nI'm by no means arguing that Apple is a bad stock: far from it.  However, it's going to need a huge quarter (which it might not get) to propel this thing to new highs in the short term after earnings. I look forward to an overblown pullback in the name, preferably to the mid-400's, where I can load back up. Full disclosure: I have every intention of buying weekly put spreads going into earnings because of the stock is quite apparently priced for perfection.
