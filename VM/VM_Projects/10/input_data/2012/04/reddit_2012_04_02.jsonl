{"title": "Here we go! AAPL $1001 target", "selftext": "Topeka Capital Management has put a new target of $1001 on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the firm continues its reign as the worldâ€™s most valuable company. Topeka said that the company should meet the price target in the next twelve months. The price target is one of gigantic proportions. The analysis sees the company taking in around $160 billion in revenue this year and having an earnings per share of around $44.61. Apple at $1000+ has been talked about before though those estimates are usually in a longer range, most suggesting a 2015 date.\n\nhttp://www.valuewalk.com/2012/04/apple-inc-aapl-target-now-1001-says-topeka/", "id": "rpq2y", "created_utc": 1333385691.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "This reminds me of shades of 1998....
