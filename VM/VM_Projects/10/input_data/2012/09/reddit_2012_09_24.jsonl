While researching these terms, you're going to run into a shitload of things you don't know about. Look them up too. \n\nIt's important to realize that companies move up and down for reasons. It's also important to realize not all of these reasons may be available to you at any point in time. \n\n[AMD's CFO leaves and their stock flips a U Turn on a perfectly good upward trend.](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AMD+Interactive#symbol=amd;range=1m;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;)\n\nLesson: Some of the biggest factors can't be reasonably planned for. Shit just blows up. Will they recover? Check the balance sheets. Do people still want their products? \n\n[Also, when they actually make stuff, their popularity matters](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RIMM+Interactive#symbol=rimm;range=1y;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;)\n\nLesson: RIMM is dying or is going to dramatically alter its business model and revenue streams. Either way, bad news. Short it, if that's your thing. I prefer to only let my money touch strength. \n\n[Some companies you buy and you hold](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=2y;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;)\n\nLesson: Anyone who tells you that \"Buy and Hold\" is dead is a mouth breather. It may be dead for banks trading billions, but putting 15,000 into Apple in 2009 would buy you something very shiny. \n\n\nAlso, understand adults. We're liars. We're addicts. We're greedy. We're stupid. There's ***NOTHING*** about growing older that ensures you are smarter or better at decision making. If you make shitty decisions at 15, you're going to make shitty decisions at 25 and 55. Unless you figure out why you make shitty decisions and change it. \n\nSometimes I get anxious and I have bad ideas.

But I knew it would hit at least 31.55. I did the opposite of what my anxiousness said, and I waited. It doesn't seem like a lot, but volume. \n\nLast bit of advice: Stay the FUCK away from anything you don't understand unless you're willing to learn. Don't know anything about oil refining?
