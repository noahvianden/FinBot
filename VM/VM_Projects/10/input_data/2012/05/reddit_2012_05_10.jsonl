I'm a big fan of his, I like the innovation he's created, Tesla sells batteries and prop. tech to other companies, and also it will take years to get off the ground.. I'm a long term optimistic. It will be a niche company in a niche industry, where they should have the top quality and other companies may have lower and cheaper quality products on a more massive scale. Tesla is about innovation, futuristic technology, style, and exclusivity. Watch the documentary revenge of the electric car! And yes my bet is a bit of a long one but I think possible pros outweigh the immediate short cons.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Lol do you work for the company?  That looks like it came straight from the Investor Presentation. JK. I agree.  I just don't see how they plan to lower price and be profitable.  Doesn't make sense?  They need to make a decision whether they are going to be  luxury brand or make a $30,000 EV.

Musk has spent most of his fortune trying to create TSLA as a successful company. Definitely an up hill battle.
