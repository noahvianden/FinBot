Good yield, solid business, and that's despite utterly failing in the mobile chip department. I expect them to make significant gains now that Paul Otellini is retiring.

Let's not forget Intel is the **dominant** producer of x86(-64) chips, which is a market many many times larger than the mobile market. The closest competitor is AMD, who is light years behind Intel in terms of technology and market share. Nobody else is willing or capable of competing with Intel for that market. I don't foresee that changing in the near future, which makes Intel a fairly low risk buy.\n\nThe fact that Arm is the de facto standard architecture for mobile and embedded devices has really helped Intel by siphoning away would-be competitors from the x86 market. I think they're perfectly poised now to really attack the mobile industry. It's worth noting that Apple is currently trying to make a deal with Intel so they can ditch Samsung. Should that go through the news alone is going to bolster the stock. \n\nI see so many positive indicators and very few negative indicators. I think in an absolute worst case scenario the stock continues to decline gradually. In my mind that's a more than justified risk given the timing and yield. \n", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You may be right.\n\nThat said, Intel employs some of the most brilliant people on the planet.
