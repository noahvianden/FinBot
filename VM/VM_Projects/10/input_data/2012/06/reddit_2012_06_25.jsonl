I'll simplify the math a little:\n\nI own 500 shares of BAC at a cost per share of $7.00.  Right now, I could sell and profit, but because BAC has a decent amount of volatility, there are some good opportunities to write covered calls.\n\n* I wrote five July 21 covered calls with a strike price of $8.  \n\n* In turn, I was paid was paid a premium of $0.22 a share for selling the rights to buy my shares at $8 should BAC exceed $8 by 21 July (this allows the person to get my shares a discount if BAC is at $9 by then, for example)  \n\n* Five contracts at $0.22 share equals $110 I get paid now (this is considered a short-term gain, FYI).  \n\n* I paid my regular commission of $4.95 + $0.75 per contract for a total of $8.70 in fees.\n\n* In the event BAC is below $8 on July 21, I get to keep the money *and* my shares.\n\n* If BAC is at or above $8, my shares will be called away (sold), though I'll still get to keep the premium plus whatever I made at selling BAC for $8.\n\nIf you handle options properly, particularly covered calls, it's feasible to repeat this process on regular basis with minimal risk, taking profits, and lowering your overall cost basis.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "So the only way to lose money on this is if BAC falls enough below $7 to offset the $110 premium on the contracts, right?

For example, if you expect BAC not to reach $8 in the next month, sell July $8 calls. You'll make money immediately upon selling the options. Then, if the stock price every passes $8, your shares will be called away for $8 each.\n\nIt's a great way to make a fixed income every month for doing nothing. Plus, it obligates you to sell your shares (if they get called away), forcing you to realize your gains (which is a good thing for sentimental-minded investors).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "A large amount of volume (frequently more than 50%) on the exchanges is computers placing the trades. The \"why BAC\" question then becomes a question about the algorithms, what inefficiency they are chasing and so on.

Bunabhucan is onto something though. Let me warn you that this will be a long winded answer. Furthermore, the fact that it is the most actively traded stock in gross volume doesn't really mean anything.\n\nIn short, it is a large company with high market cap, large share float and low stock price. \n\n(i) Lots of people own this stock. It is part of so many indexes and mutual funds. People all around the world trade it and go in and out of the stock everyday.\n\n(ii) there is a float of 10B shares. There are so many shares to trade everyday, far more than many companies. \n\n(iii) Low stock price means more shares need to be bought and sold to satisfy how strong it is weighted in a portfolio. If I have a portfolio of 2% BAC and 2% MSFT I will have 4x the number of gross shares in BAC simply because its about 1/4 of the price of MSFT.\n\n(iv) Liquidity incentives known as \"Maker/Taker\" pricing structures encourage people to make markets in stocks. They pay people to post bids and offers and charge people 'taking' or 'crossing' those quotes. That is they reward people adding liquidity and charge people for taking it.\n\nNow we get to Bunabhucan's comment. Because of (i) there are actually people who buy and sell this stock for investment reasons. They need liquidity to get in and out of their large positions. Computer programs have come to  dominate market making and are looking to make short term gains off large trades and off stupid traders. The programs do end up trading a lot with each other going back and forth for pennies. Now consider (iv). These incentives are typically a flat rate so it makes more sense (financially) for firms to deal with lower price stocks that they can trade more volume with their finite buying power. \n\nSo all in all there is no significant reason why BAC is the most traded stock. At one point it was WorldCom, another, Enron. Low priced stocks just get traded heavily in todays market environment. I hope my explanation is coherent.

Citigroup when they were trading below $10 was the most traded stock until their reverse stock split, which increased the cost of option premiums, and they even said they split to get the speculators off their stock price as they felt they were depressing the share price.
