{"title": "DWAC Puts - Thoughts? Seeking to make my very 1st option trade one that breaks every responsible rule I set.", "selftext": "Literally never traded options before and I want to throw a few thousand at making money from DWAC dropping off a cliff. Why? Because there are very few things that would bring me greater joy than Tweeting a picture of my brand new Tesla that I purchased with the profits I made betting against the MAGA financial army and the late to the game bandwagon bag holders who followed them. \n\nI am absolutely ok with losing every penny of this play. How can I do the most damage? \n\nFor context, this is absolutely out of character for me. I’m a middle aged, middle class father of 2 with about 4 years of investment experience. I buy and hold. About 5/6 of what I hold is moderate risk, market growth equities and ETFs. Nothing really exciting at all, except that I bought into 4 Chinese tech companies when everyone said to get out. I’m up some and down others, but doing better than average so far. \n\nI do research into the companies I buy, determine what I think a fair value is, and set rules for entry and exit. After a few very silly decisions in the opening days of my investing, I no longer panic or FOMO buy. Its about the process, the structure, and the research.\n\nExcept for this….\n\nI’ve wanted to take some of my income and make more aggressive plays for bigger returns.
