How can I do the most damage? \n\nFor context, this is absolutely out of character for me. I‚Äôm a middle aged, middle class father of 2 with about 4 years of investment experience. I buy and hold. About 5/6 of what I hold is moderate risk, market growth equities and ETFs. Nothing really exciting at all, except that I bought into 4 Chinese tech companies when everyone said to get out. I‚Äôm up some and down others, but doing better than average so far. \n\nI do research into the companies I buy, determine what I think a fair value is, and set rules for entry and exit. After a few very silly decisions in the opening days of my investing, I no longer panic or FOMO buy. Its about the process, the structure, and the research.\n\nExcept for this‚Ä¶.\n\nI‚Äôve wanted to take some of my income and make more aggressive plays for bigger returns.
