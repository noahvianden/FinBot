And it wasn't magic, but it's also mostly positives for Tesla:\n\n> Tesla knows how much their factories can produce pretty well so they put advanced orders in. They already can't meet demand because of other constraints so they know much they will consume. So, they put contracts usually years in advance with chip demands.\n\nThis is one of the big ones. When the pandemic hit and the stock market tanked, basically every other automaker canceled or reduced a lot of parts orders on the assumption that demand would be way down and they wouldn't need them. And also because everyone is doing \"just in time\" manufacturing, so they didn't want to have a bunch of extra parts lying around. Because Tesla is production constrained they didn't reduce orders when everyone else did, so they actually ended up at the top of the list when everyone came back looking to order parts again (most parts it was relatively easy to place new orders, but it turned out chips were in short supply)\n\n> The demands they have in place for 250k cars a quarter (granted it's not 1 chip per car) is not an extreme ask of current foundry capacity\n\nBut conversely, it's usually the little guy that gets screwed when supplies are tight. It's certainly what happened to Tesla when they were getting started (and part of the reason they brought more part production in house). If a part supplier has the choice between pissing off their biggest customer or delivering nothing to some little startup, they're going to screw the startup. Fortunately Tesla is growing fast enough now that it seems like many big suppliers aren't willing to screw them.\n\n> Lets take an example in isolation (Using figures in point 3): When the foundries are allocating chip demand for cars and hypothetically slash 10% across all customers, VW would lose 200k cars worth, Tesla would lose 25k worth.\n\nEVs need a lot more chips than most cars, especially the way Tesla designs their battery packs. Those are probably smaller/cheaper and higher volume chips generally, but obviously much more critical.\n\n> Tesla also custom designed their chip to handle a lot of functions that would traditionally need multiple chips.\n\nThat's for custom chips, which they should never have a shortage of, unless there's serious supply chain disruptions (and we might be/been flirting with that). But there's tons of chips in the car that aren't Tesla custom chips. What's interesting about Tesla though is that they don't buy \"black boxes\" from suppliers, they buy chips and do all their own design for things like circuit boards, connectors and firmware.\n\nFor most automakers, if one chip is out of stock, then their supplier can't get it, can't put it in the module, and so there's no modules. So for example, GM can't get the little box that controls the power seats from their supplier. If Tesla can't get the chip they use for their power seat controls, then they can maybe find someone else selling a similar chip, maybe even redesign the circuit board, and then rewrite the firmware to run the new chip and put it in production. Telsa's manufacturing is also much more agile than basically anyone else, so switching in an entirely new part number (potentially with new connectors) is normal for them. Whereas most automakers basically never do that outside a model refresh.\n\n> So even if Tesla asked for 275k worth of car chips and got 250k the other constraints they have wouldn't show large dents. (I know 1 car is not 1 chip).\n\nThe other big US manufacturers saw sales drop 30-40%, and manufacturers were stopping production of entire factories and or entire model lines. If Ford can't make one model, that's bad. If Tesla can't make one model (probably the 3 or Y), that's a disaster,\n\nAnd Tesla probably was slowed down by parts shortages, they were \"only\" up 20% QoQ (or 70% YoY) they might've grown more if they didn't have to work around these issues. And if they were making 2 million or 4 million cars a year, it might've been harder?

In contrast, Legacy vehicles continue to require more and more chips per vehicle.\n\n\\- custom firmware/software which allows Tesla to use chips fabbed under modern processes/die sizes, whereas legacy auto is running on chips fabbed with old processes/die sizes.  The issue here is that although existing chip producers will continue to support the old chip fabs so long as they already have the resources to do so, they are on the other hand unwilling to invest in ramping up supply by investing in more old style fab equipment.  Thus, as time goes on, supply of old style chips (and thus, the chips legacy OEMs require) will continue to slowly dwindle as equipment breaks or producers go under, while supply of new style chips (like the ones Tesla uses) will continue to grow with our increased use of modern electronic devices.\n\n\\- Tesla as you said did not cancel contracts while other manufactures did, thus disturbing their supply chains (which due to the nature of the chips they were producing, may actually never fully recover).\n\nMore info in [this article](https://jalopnik.com/i-asked-experts-why-carmakers-cant-just-transition-to-n-1847739665) which I saw jpr007 on twitter share.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Global vehicle production peaked at around 97 million per year in 2018.

Yes, everyone plans out what they'll need and secures supply. Manufacturers give you lead times so you know how much advanced notice they need.\n\nSo, what happened is suddenly the lead times went from 6 weeks to 46 weeks.  I had parts go from 5 weeks to 52 weeks.\n\nIt is not practical to have years supply of everything, just in case 5 week lead times go nuts. That's the difference between say 200k in inventory and 1.5M.  Inventory gets taxed, it's really not a good thing to have any more than you have to.\n\nYou can have allocations, so you have plans off in the future without holding actual taxable inventory... big boys like Tesla allocate everything possible, probably.  However, Tesla is changing designs constantly.  They are actually both incredibly adapted to handle sudden supply problems and at significantly elevated risk of having supply problems in the first place. Overall, it's a significant advantage as all the extra supply failures can just be handled by delaying some changes or redesigning thier approach.\n\nManufacturers really try to advertise lead times they know they can meet long term.  They rarely change for any particular part outside of a defined lifecycle.  12 years ago when I was designing an ARM processor board for my main product, the brand new chip had documents describing exactly how many years the different variants would be available for.

Does it not mean that, or does it mean both things?\n2. When you say IV reverts to the mean - how do I know the mean IV for a particular stock? Or is that always 50?\n\nThanks!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Generally speaking, IV is expected move of an underlying in upcoming 12 months. IV is derived from Option prices. If option market expects an extraordinary event (e.g. election, earnings, etc.), it offers options at a much higher price. So options become expensive and IV rises. As short premium sellers we love expensive options and hence we trade during high IV levels. Additionally, when market drops, IV levels rise. That's why we have seen unusual levels of IVs during covid crash or crash of 2008. To make it more clear, let's look at the following example:\n\nE.g. TSLA has an IV of roughly 50%. This means that Option market is expecting a 50% move in price of TSLA in next 12 months. This means TSLA can go +/-$390, given it's current price of $780. But in reality, the actual move is mostly less than $390 giving option seller an edge. \n\n>When you say IV reverts to the mean - how do I know the mean IV for a particular stock? Or is that always 50?\n\nTo find out if 50% is TSLA's mean IV or not, we look at IV percentile (or IV rank). Looking at TSLA case, it's IV percentile is at 30%. This means that TSLA's IV has been more than current IV levels (50%), 70 percent of the time in the last 12 months. This means that TSLA's IV has a higher chance of rising (70%) than dropping (30%). However, as a general rule of thumb for short premium strategies, we are ok trading any underlying having IV percentile of 30 or higher. This makes TSLA an OK candidate for trading.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Great examples, thank you again!\n\nI'm still struggling to confirm my understanding of this statement: *\"Higher the IV, higher the difference between expected and actual moves.\"*\n\nLet me set up an example to help ask the question...comparing something with low IV vs. something with high IV.\n\n1. XLF currently has an IV of 21% and is trading at $38.56. So in theory the market is projecting a price between 30.46 and 46.65 in the next year.\n2. TSLA currently has an IV of 50% and is trading at $780. So in theory the market is projecting a price between $390 and $1170 in the next year.\n\nLet's say I set up a 45 DTE PCS on TSLA. At the 675 and 670 strikes, the PoP is 70%, $70 of potential upside, $428 of potential downside.\n\nCompare that to a 45 DTE PCS on XLF. At the 37 and 36 strikes, the PoP is 70%, $20 of potential upside, $80 of potential downside. If I did 4x contracts, that'd be $80 of potential upside, $320 of potential downside.\n\nSo, from my newbro perspective, the XLF trade seems better. Same PoP, more potential upside, less potential risk. But, the common wisdom seems to be that TSLA is the better bet, because it's higher IV. The only way I can square this is if there is something important I'm missing about the value of high IV.\n\nWhen you say the higher IV, the higher the difference between expected/actual moves - does that mean that even though the PoP of these two trades are the same, I can expect that TSLA is less likely to go ITM because IV is higher (and thus overstated)? Or is it because we think some event will crush IV in the future?\n\nBasically looking for the reason why the TSLA trade would be better from a thetagang perspective than the XLF trade. Thanks again!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "To put it simply since TSLA has higher IV (not rank or percentile), it's options have higher value. If there is an hypothetical underlying (XYZ) that has a price same as TSLA's and if it's IV is at 60%, then it's options would have higher value than TSLA's options. \n\nHowever, if IV at 60%, XYZ's IV percentile is 20%, it's IV has higher probability of rising towards mean as compared to TSLA which has a higher IV percentile (30%) as mentioned in my previous comment.\n\nIn a nutshell if all the given factors remain same, higher IV means higher option prices but higher IV percentile determines probability of IV rising which can be translated into probability of option prices rising or dropping. \n\nAs you rightly mentioned option price is made up of intrinsic factors like underlying price and extrinsic factors like IV, days to expiration, etc. \n\nWe as premium sellers, are focused on collecting as much extrinsic value as we can.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You got it!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Hold on, I took a walk and I think I had a lightbulb moment.\n\nOK, let me see if I have this right.\n\nIn broad strikes, there are three big things that make an option price at any given moment: asset price, time left to expiration, and IV. The important thing that I wasn't tracking on is that IV is an important factor to options price \\*separate from asset price\\*.\n\nThat is to say, an option's price can rise even if the asset price doesn't move IF IV moves. And, IV can move because of lots of things, including external market factors.\n\nSo, the value of IV to this strategy isn't that it gets you juicy premiums really, it's just that if the IV is high and the IV rank/percentile is high, then there's less likelihood that IV will rise higher. And IV rising is bad if you sold, because IV rising will also raise options price (again, separately from what the asset price is doing).\n\nSo, IV is sort of a separate concern from PoP, which only tells you the likelihood of the asset expiring ITM. If you think you will sell earlier than expiration, than you want IV to drop while you own the option to drive down options price.\n\nDo I have that right now?\n\nIf I do, then I guess we're in the game of trying to pick when we think IV has risen to a point that it won't go any higher, the way that a regular trader tries to pick the top/bottom of a particular trend line.
