{"title": "I scanned 150 charts this weekend to buy the dip (or sell CSPs), here are some growth stock names I'm looking at: MELI, DLO, GLBE, DKNG, PENN", "selftext": "Growth names were taken to the slaughter house this week. Why? Inflation headlines and rates are SPOOKING the market. Growth stocks and high-beta names are more effected by ‚Äúrates-headlines‚Äù due to the fact that these companies need to maintain exponential revenue growth in order to maintain their expensive valuations.\n\nThese are risky times in the market with a lot of uncertainties and if you follow Reddit or Twitter you‚Äôll probably see many posts about how the next crash is coming, but is it really? The dip last week may have provided for some opportunities in several of the higher-end growth names.\n\nAlthough these uncertain periods create volatility in the market, time has shown that buying the dip is a strategy that works and those who do it are usually rewarded. That‚Äôs not to say markets don‚Äôt crash or go through corrections, but playing the long game and cost-averaging positions is one of the most profitable strategies. On the other end of this, and the most risky, is *day-trading* where 97% of day-traders end up losing in the long-run.\n\nI‚Äôve never been into day-trading myself, but swing trades (1 week to 6 month timeframe) with the mentality of HODLing your position forever has been my personal sweet-spot of both finding winners and having fun in the market.\n\nIf you wanted to really play it safe you could simply buy index ETFs and never look at your account, but we want to *feel* like stock market savants, and that is what we will become.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Let‚Äôs get into this week‚Äôs charts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MercadoLibre (MELI)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez3xa7sxlqs71.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=d366654b4f20a4724c20cc049c887f40418c8cf4\n\nFirst off, this is an expensive stock at $1,500 per share. MELI is known to be the Amazon of Latin America and is down 8% this week with the rest of the growth-stock gang.\n\nMELI is seeing QoQ sales growth of 90% and trades at price/sales of 14x, which is somewhat high. The company‚Äôs last earnings in August was very strong and shot the stock up nearly 10%. At the current stock price we are able to get in on a discount relative to what the share price was before the big move up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Global-E (GLBE)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9eyv46gxlqs71.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc9b80d85a830114659ccd96b3d1811a459e5880\n\nGlobal-E is an international e-commerce enabler that has only seen positive news, positive headlines, and very solid QoQ growth of over 90%. They are trading at a premium valuation of 50x price/sales, but premium is what you pay for this kind of growth.\n\nThe share price is sitting at the 100 EMA, and I might look for a bounce here. We are trading close to June/July levels and IMO could be an entry for a long-term hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**D-Local (DLO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/je0ctcaylqs71.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a0a7baae9d778f5cc8b4b4c3930cec3e9a4cf3\n\nD-Local is a payment processor for emerging markets and had a blowout quarter back in August. The stock price saw a huge gap-up of over 30% in a single day. Since then the stock has been sluggish, but like the other names mentioned this week the recent (15%) dip might prove to be a solid entry for those that have been waiting for this ticker to take a breather.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DraftKings (DKNG)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orf0q3qylqs71.png?width=2418&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7bcd9f45b554f45c2b0f08008a93ab6834853f\n\nI‚Äôve always been a fan of DraftKings and thought they were a market-leader in the growing Online Sports Betting (OSB) industry. DKNG is seeing solid growth mainly due to the fact that online gambling is being legalized throughout the United States. Additional markets = more opportunity and their strong branding has enabled them to take capture a good chunk of new revenues.\n\nI like investing in leaders and when it comes OSB DraftKings is one of the top 3 that comes to mind. For those of you that are Portnoy fans, PENN is also trading at a discount and the chart looks ready for launch.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhidvi9zlqs71.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b1b763be43e596cf5eb64801719d31adfefc978\n\nPeople compare PENN to DKNG frequently, here‚Äôs how some of their stats add up.\n\n* PENN trades at 12b market cap on 5b sales and a price/sales of 2.4x.\n* DKNG trades at 20b market cap on 1b sales and a price/sales of 20x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe difference? DKNG owns a much larger piece of the online sports betting market-share pie and has lucrative investors such as Cathie‚Äôs ARK ETFs accumulating shares. It is estimated DKNG‚Äôs market-share of the industry is roughly 32% while PENN‚Äôs sits at 7%.", "id": "q5mu5d", "created_utc": 1633921509.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I scanned 150 subreddits, and found this post on all of them...  but still interesting", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Hahahahahah ....

Square makes it easier for customers to pay for products and services. Square‚Äôs biggest product currently is a card reader that enables businesses to offer credit card payments instead of solely using cash. Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don‚Äôt have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can‚Äôt build up your credit score using Square. \n\n**News Timeline**\n\nJuly 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking))\n\nAugust 1, 2021\\[Source\\](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-plans-to-acquire-afterpay)\n\n* Square announces plan to acquire Afterpay\n   * Aimed towards a younger generation\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france))\n\n* Square plans to enter France market\n\nSeptemeber 28, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html))\n\n* Square partners with TikTok\n\n\\[Source\\]([https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187))\n\n* Mastercard announces plan to enter BNPL market\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* PayPal\n* Fiserv\n* Global Payments\n* Affirm Holdings\n* Shopify \n* Clover\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/)\n\n**Bullish Case**\n\n* BNPL industry has global potential to grow \n* Small business lending is increasing\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin \n\n**Bearish Case**\n\n* Strong competition in the BNPL industry\n* Speculation of future revenue reliant on Bitcoin\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin\n\n**Management** \n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy.

I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square‚Äôs P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square‚Äôs ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

In my eyes, Square has dominated the small business and B2C e-commerce space, but I'm fairly certain it's priced in and may even struggle to maintain its record growth over the next year or two.\n\n  \nI work closely with clients in the revenue billing/payment processing space, specifically with respect to strategy development and market opportunity research, so I've looked into Square before and have worked directly with their competitors. I never looked into the BTC side of their business during my work, so I won't comment much about that other than to say that I suspect they are using BTC transactions as a way to prop up financials (specifically sales volume) and that it is serving primarily as a hedging instrument.\n\n  \nFirst, I'd consider avoiding grouping BNPL into its own industry. It's really just a service segment of the larger revenue billing and payment processing industry and has existed for a long time. It's a popular service provided to merchants, especially in e-commerce, but it's always been popular - people just didn't know what it was. The only recent change has been how the service has been marketed and the fact that companies are willing to provide BNPL financing to average people through cards. The statistics surrounding BNPL are pretty misleading, because you have to separate BNPL payment processing for merchants and BNPL payment processing for consumers. Regardless, consumer-side BNPL financing is definitely growing in popularity but it is the riskier segment compared to the larger merchant market.\n\nYou're absolutely correct that there's strong competition in this space. Investors are attracted to these companies because they can quickly generate revenue early into their lifespan, which makes them a prime target for VCs looking to enter early and reap substantial rewards before profits begin to stagnate. \n\nThe reason profits stagnate is because, while it's profitable to charge a percentage of revenue pass through (the most common payment model), scalability becomes a major issue. Because clients can use payment processing services hundreds and thousands of times a day, the rate of services rendered is viewed as a multiplicity of the number of current clients. As a result, these companies often have to grow at an exponential rate to satisfy demand, especially if they occupy both B2B billing and B2C financing, which causes logistics and operating costs to inflate. **This is why, as market cap and revenue explode, you see P/E sharply correct at a magnified rate of P/S.** There's also very little regulation with BNPL financing and it leads to issues with reporting, *especially with liabilities.*\n\nMost new entrants are situated in the B2B space and focused on providing niche services pointed at specific industries. From what I've seen, Square is struggling with securing larger B2B contracts and these are the clients that are needed to maintain significant growth. This may have changed in the last year, but I would find that hard to believe given the amount of new competition that has entered the scene. Naturally, churning is a huge issue in this industry and it often results in unstable growth patterns.\n\n**In short: I don't think consumer BNPL financing is really a reliable path forward for Square as they are at the point where larger contracts and B2B payment processing is far more important for stabilizing their recent growth trends. Until analysts favor BTC in a less speculative light, I also struggle to see crypto helping them break through the current price ceiling. By no means are they in a bad spot, but growth is difficult to maintain in this industry - especially in the last year.**", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wait to sell Square shares until Bitcoin reaches $100k.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don‚Äôt have a square share to spare", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}

Most real estate debt is held by Chinese state banks and insurers, who are forbidden from using CDO derivatives, so the contagion risk is much smaller than what people imagine. This is very different from what Western banks did in 2008.\n\nThe Chinese government has more than enough money to refinance the debt, but they want to make an example of Evergrande in order to discourage excessive risk taking. There will be an orderly default of Evergrande, which will probably be split into pieces and sold off to various state enterprises in return for refinancing. The CCP wants to cool off the housing bubble in China and to direct Chinese retail investors toward the stock and bond market, which is being opened to them by the Wealth Connect and Southbound Bond Connect initiatives.\n\nIt is only Western institutional investors (who hold a tiny part of Evergrande's debt) who will be left holding the bag, but that is way too small a part of their holdings to lead to international contagion.\n\nIt is interesting that major Western institutions (Fidelity, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs) have been buying Chinese tech stocks while the press keeps fear mongering in order to keep Chinese stock prices depressed.

{"title": "I scanned 150 charts this weekend (or sell CSPs), here are some growth stock names I'm looking at: MELI, DLO, GLBE, DKNG, PENN", "selftext": "Growth names were taken to the slaughter house this week. Why? Inflation headlines and rates are SPOOKING the market. Growth stocks and high-beta names are more effected by ‚Äúrates-headlines‚Äù due to the fact that these companies need to maintain exponential revenue growth in order to maintain their expensive valuations.\n\nThese are risky times in the market with a lot of uncertainties and if you follow Reddit or Twitter you‚Äôll probably see many posts about how the next crash is coming, but is it really? The dip last week may have provided for some opportunities in several of the higher-end growth names.\n\nAlthough these uncertain periods create volatility in the market, time has shown that buying the dip is a strategy that works and those who do it are usually rewarded. That‚Äôs not to say markets don‚Äôt crash or go through corrections, but playing the long game and cost-averaging positions is one of the most profitable strategies. On the other end of this, and the most risky, is *day-trading* where 97% of day-traders end up losing in the long-run.\n\nI‚Äôve never been into day-trading myself, but swing trades (1 week to 6 month timeframe) with the mentality of HODLing your position forever has been my personal sweet-spot of both finding winners and having fun in the market.\n\nIf you wanted to really play it safe you could simply buy index ETFs and never look at your account, but we want to *feel* like stock market savants, and that is what we will become.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Let‚Äôs get into this week‚Äôs charts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MercadoLibre (MELI)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ok5wut0qlqs71.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a669201d35881290d59e17bbe54aac071d3cba2\n\nFirst off, this is an expensive stock at $1,500 per share. MELI is known to be the Amazon of Latin America and is down 8% this week with the rest of the growth-stock gang.\n\nMELI is seeing QoQ sales growth of 90% and trades at price/sales of 14x, which is somewhat high. The company‚Äôs last earnings in August was very strong and shot the stock up nearly 10%. At the current stock price we are able to get in on a discount relative to what the share price was before the big move up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Global-E (GLBE)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0k6a3yqlqs71.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4a6571209bbc5777fcdf6452aab14c4b53c8368\n\nGlobal-E is an international e-commerce enabler that has only seen positive news, positive headlines, and very solid QoQ growth of over 90%. They are trading at a premium valuation of 50x price/sales, but premium is what you pay for this kind of growth.\n\nThe share price is sitting at the 100 EMA, and I might look for a bounce here. We are trading close to June/July levels and IMO could be an entry for a long-term hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**D-Local (DLO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cypgx7nqlqs71.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5fd3a9df891a35135769cdab18a3893f4fa7e1c\n\nD-Local is a payment processor for emerging markets and had a blowout quarter back in August. The stock price saw a huge gap-up of over 30% in a single day. Since then the stock has been sluggish, but like the other names mentioned this week the recent (15%) dip might prove to be a solid entry for those that have been waiting for this ticker to take a breather.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DraftKings (DKNG)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kb3xezctlqs71.png?width=2418&format=png&auto=webp&s=67006f6d77bf51e067d31678526bcfaab0854536\n\nI‚Äôve always been a fan of DraftKings and thought they were a market-leader in the growing Online Sports Betting (OSB) industry. DKNG is seeing solid growth mainly due to the fact that online gambling is being legalized throughout the United States. Additional markets = more opportunity and their strong branding has enabled them to take capture a good chunk of new revenues.\n\nI like investing in leaders and when it comes OSB DraftKings is one of the top 3 that comes to mind. For those of you that are Portnoy fans, PENN is also trading at a discount and the chart looks ready for launch.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzmzarwslqs71.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=0252ee26b16f180de11ce61471e912b3138ed61d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople compare PENN to DKNG frequently, here‚Äôs how some of their stats add up.\n\n* PENN trades at 12b market cap on 5b sales and a price/sales of 2.4x.\n* DKNG trades at 20b market cap on 1b sales and a price/sales of 20x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe difference? DKNG owns a much larger piece of the online sports betting market-share pie and has lucrative investors such as Cathie‚Äôs ARK ETFs accumulating shares. It is estimated DKNG‚Äôs market-share of the industry is roughly 32% while PENN‚Äôs sits at 7%.", "id": "q5mtru", "created_utc": 1633921471.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I scanned 150 subreddits, and found this post on all of them...  but still interesting", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "DKNG is down cos of their announcement to purchase some companies.

{"title": "[DD] $AA - Alcoa earnings play,", "selftext": "Sunday night BEARS r FUK'T bed-time reading edition.\n\n**TL;DR:** Aluminum futures will breach a psychological level of $3,000. Technical analysis shows a nice RSI, MACD and triple bottom formation for a positive move upwards this week. Additionally, buyers stepped in at the final triple bottom with significant volume and a $3,000,000 OTM call sweep looking for another 30% upside. Alumina division is the most significant of $AA, their pricing also hedges on transportation & energy costs, passing those onto the customers. \n\n\n**Overview**\n\nEveryone is focusing on those boring bank earnings play (zzz...) but there is one company that caught my eye when I was looking for potential baggers. $AA, Alcoa a US based company is one of the worlds largest producers of aluminum.\n\nMaybe you have been hearing about oil & lumber futures skyrocketing, well so has Aluminum after being heavily beat down during the coronavirus.\n\n[Aluminum Futures looking to breach $3,000 for the first time in over 13 years](https://www.investing.com/commodities/aluminum)\n\nAnalyst firms are looking bullish on $AA with more upside as the materials crisis skyrockets prices. Just this past week, $AA was hit with some more upgrades and has a median price target of $55 - or 18% from its current market price. \n\nHere are some lame analyst technicals: EPS growth is up over 100%. Revenue growth is up over 20%. Market cap $6.53 billion. AA has plans for greener production, which is part of the reason Goldman Sachs just upped their valuation. Of 13 firms with opinions the overall analysis is very bullish; 3 outperform, 4 buy, 3 neutral, and 0 sell. \n\n**What happened last week is what made me jump in at the EOD on Friday**.\n\nA week before earnings, the $44-$46 support was tested during a decent streak of red for $AA, this support has been tested twice before over the past 90 days. The worst dip caused $AA to touch around $45, but so far it has bounced off that twice and I think Thursday/Friday of last week will be the third & final bottom. This is called a **triple bottom** folks, that's a very powerful bottom. On Friday, $AA dumped at market open going below $46 briefly, over the course of the next 15 minutes, $AA spiked to $47.25. It swung from -2% to +1% in 15 minutes, someone big stepped in and loaded shares and over $3,000,000 in call options dated for 6/17/2022 at the $55 strike expecting the share price to reach $60.\n\n[Here's some shitty technical analysis.](https://i.imgur.com/MuWOaCM.png). As you can see by those pretty channel lines, we have our support being hit and short volume has dropped by the end of the week. Additionally, RSI is indicating oversold territory & our MACD is primed for a cross-over event.\n\n**What happens next..** well $AA is reporting earnings after-close on Thursday, as long as this fake & gay market avoids \"correction\" then I suspect increased volume and aluminum futures breaking $3,000 lead to a decent positive move towards $50+. Selling pressure was realized last week, the triple bottom was formed and big buyers stepped in with another $3 million dollar OTM call sweep. I expect a decent move upwards to push $AA towards $48-$50 by Thursday \n\n**Now lets talk about oil... How is crude oil price related to aluminium price?**\n\nCrude oil is not just a commodity, itself, but also an asset closely followed by commodity investors. Rising oil prices make investors move money into commodity markets and, of course, industrial metals like aluminium. In addition, crude is the main benchmark for energy prices. Given that energy accounts for up to 50% of the production cost of many commodities, a rise in the oil price means higher transportation costs and higher cost of production, especially for those energy-intensive metals like aluminium. As a result, aluminium becomes costlier. **However**, $AA hedges on transportation and energy costs by passing these along to the customer on their contracts. Aluminum is costly, but $AA is still reaping those benefits.\n\n**Bear Case**\n \n* yes $AA has risen almost 100% YTD, however the reasons for the spiking aluminum costs are here to stay through next year, analyst firms still see significant upside. big buyers clearly see another 30% upside based on the OTM contracts they've bought.\n \n* Bauxite prices might hurt margins, i think it's safe to say with Aluminum prices for this quarter being what they are, this will clearly offset those impacts.\n\n\n**Bull Case**\n \n* selling pressure was realized, short volume is dropping, volume is picking up and a triple bottom was formed this week. a strong move upward this week will confirm the ability to test $55.\n\n* China's energy crisis is going to strengthen US based Aluminum producers. Aluminum is in heavy demand and China's output is dropping. Strong demand should trigger strong prices and record earnings this quarter for $AA.\n\n* US gov't tariffs strongly support and remain a beneficial move for $AA.\n\n* Alumina division is the most valuable for $AA and like the numbers show, Aluminum is about to break $3,000.\n\n\n**Positions**\n\n* 200 shares\n\n* October 29 $50 calls\n\n* Nov 19 $52 calls\n\n* June 17 2022 $55 calls (followed the $3m buy)", "id": "q5nhni", "created_utc": 1633923956.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Senators bought puts saying it's going down.

{"title": "Nio Investment Update (Recent Events)", "selftext": "Hello again,\n\nIt has been a long time since I posted my original $NIO analysis (found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/NIO--Nio-Inc-Investment-Update?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=WSB)), and since then there have been several developments that I felt needed to be addressed. As a result of this, I have decided to create this Nio update for all of the people who read my previous analysis, and also for people who just want a quick rundown of current/recent Nio events.\n\n**Recent SEC Filings:**\n\n*Q2 2021 Delivery Update:*\n\n¬∑ Nio delivered 8,083 vehicles in June, which is a 116% increase YoY\n\n¬∑ Nio delivered 21,896 vehicles in Q2, which is a 112% increase YoY\n\n¬∑ Culminative deliveries (between their ES8, ES6, and EC6 models) totaled 117,597\n\n*Appointment of Independent Director:*\n\n¬∑ On July 12th, 2021, Nio announced their appointment of Ms. Yu Long as an independent director.\n\n¬∑ Ms. Long is the founding/managing partner of BAI Capital and has an outstanding track record of investing into technology and internet companies.\n\n¬∑ Ms. Long was also governor of China VC and Private Equity Association Ltd., CEO of Bertelsmann China Corporate Center, and managing partner of Bertelsmann Asia Investments.\n\n¬∑ Furthermore, Ms. Long is a board member of $TPR ‚Äì Tapestry Inc. and $LX ‚Äì LexinFintech Holdings Inc.\n\n*July Delivery Update:*\n\n¬∑ Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, which is a 124% increase YoY, however it is a net decrease month-over-month.\n\n¬∑ Culminative sales increased to 125,528 vehicles.\n\n*Q2 2021 Financials:*\n\n¬∑ Vehicle sales totalled $1.225B (USD in Q2 2021, which represents a 127% increase YoY, and a 6.8% increase QoQ\n\n¬∑ Their vehicle margin was 20.3% (compared to 9.7% Q2 2021) and their gross margin was 18.6% (compared to 8.4% in Q2 2020).\n\n¬∑ Gross profit was $1.3B (USD) in Q2 2021, which represents a 402% increase YoY, and a 1.2% increase QoQ.\n\n¬∑ Net loss was $90.9M (USD), which is a decrease of 50% YoY, and a 30% decrease QoQ. This decrease in net losses shows that Nio is trending in the right path and may be able to report a net gain in the next couple of earnings reports.\n\n*August Delivery Update:*\n\n¬∑ Nio delivered 5,880 vehicles in August, which represents a 48% increase YoY, however, once again their deliveries are decreasing month-over-month. However, they noted supply chain issues as a major contributor to this decrease, which makes sense.\n\n¬∑ Culminative deliveries totalled 131,408.\n\n\\*More information found in [full analysis](https://utradea.com/positions/NIO--Nio-Inc-Investment-Update?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=WSB)\\*\n\n**Recent News:**\n\n*Lotus Partnership:*\n\nOn September 9th, 2021, Nio announced their partnership with the famous European Luxury Automaker ‚ÄúLotus‚Äù. Lotus was recently bought out by Geely, who is a Chinese Automaker, and they are looking to bring their own ‚ÄúLotus‚Äù branded EV to the market with the help of Nio Inc.\n\nFurthermore, Lotus is looking on going public soon, and Nio is expected to receive some of the proceeds of this listing. The news of this partnership led Nio to gain 4%, which could be the result of Nio being trusted with assisting such a trusted and historic automaker.\n\n*Nio in Norway:*\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of hype around Nio expanding their operations into Norway (their first expansion outside of China.\n\nOn September 30th, 2021, Nio opened their first ‚ÄúNIO house‚Äù in Europe. This Nio house is located in Norway‚Äôs capital city, Oslo. Nio is expected to roll out their ES8 electric SUV, as it is vehicle that Nio expects to be most widely adopted in Norway, due to customer needs.\n\nThis expansion into Norway was not random by any means, Nio strategically planned to expand into Norway de to Norway‚Äôs heavy investment and acceptance of green technology. Approximately 70% of all new cars sold in Norway have been electric, which makes them the perfect market for Nio to penetrate. If Nio is able to build their infrastructure quickly, it is likely that we see them become one of the biggest EV competitors in the country.\n\n*Battery Swapping:*\n\nThere has been a lot of competition to arise in the EV space over the past couple of years, but little stand a chance to the market leader, Tesla. However, among all of Tesla‚Äôs competitors, Nio seems to be the EV company that is giving Tesla the best ‚Äúrun for their money‚Äù.\n\nOn September 29th, 2021, Nio announced that they have completed 4M battery swaps. This is so significant because Nio has pioneered battery swapping technology, and Tesla has refused t implement this idea. However, the fact that this idea is so widely accepted and practiced in China is great news for their business, as they are able to generate revenue from the ‚Äúbattery as a service‚Äù business model associated with these swaps.\n\nNio‚Äôs battery swapping technology is far quicker than the likes of Tesla‚Äôs ‚ÄúSupercharging‚Äù, as a battery swap takes approximately 3 minutes to complete, and ‚Äúsupercharging‚Äù takes around 40-50 minutes.\n\n*Nio in Germany:*\n\nOn September 20th, 2021, Nio presented their ET7 model in Germany, and announced their intentions of expanding their line of cars into Germany sometime in 2022. Germany is another fantastic market for Nio to expand into as 30% of German adults are considered to be ‚Äúin the market‚Äù for a fully electric vehicle. Furthermore, the German government is one of the most forward counties in terms of their transition to green energy, which makes them another obvious candidate for Nio‚Äôs expansion into Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the German market for EV‚Äôs is subsidized with a tax credit between ‚Ç¨7,500-9,000. Over time, this subsidy should contribute to sustained growth in Germany‚Äôs EV market and helps Nio to capitalize in this market.\n\n\\*More information in the [full analysis](https://utradea.com/positions/NIO--Nio-Inc-Investment-Update?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=WSB)\\*\n\n**Investment Summary:**\n\nOverall, I think that my conservative comparable price target of $47/share (achieved in my previous analysis, found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Nio-is-properly-valued-and-has-the-potential-for-large-growth)) is very fair for the short term. Overall, I think in the upcoming years we may see my original price target of $60/share being hit. However, due to their current situation, I think that the conservative comparable makes more sense in this case.\n\nI think that the new developments in Nio as a company (since my previous analysis) bode well for Nio‚Äôs stock and have put the on the right track for future growth. It will be interesting to see how their European expansion turns out in the next few years, and how aggressive they get with it.\n\nRight now, I believe that Nio is a well-position EV company, that has recently became a bargain, but is susceptible to lower valuation due to the complexities between China and the USA.\n\nIf you found value in this post please consider following me [here](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=WSB).", "id": "q5nhqd", "created_utc": 1633923963.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "I just wanna be back in the 40s again.", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "üèôüöÄüí¶ \n\nBlue Skys Cumming!!!", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Big fan of NIO, used to buy from IPO and to drive one.
