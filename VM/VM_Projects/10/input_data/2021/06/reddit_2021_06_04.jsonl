How being wasteful and not caring about the environment saves the environment and earns you tendies because in 2021, down is up ($CLNE)\n\nHappy  Friday all, NrdRage here.  You might remember me from such hits as  \"boy, that semiconductor DD was perfect except for the fact that the  market is a casino\" or \"thank god I bought those Boomer cruise stonks or  I'd be giving handies behind a Jack-in-the-box right now because I  wouldn't have gas money to make it to Wendy's\" or maybe \"shit, turns out  $PLTR $23 wasn't a joke\".  And definitely \"why is every Friday DD this  mother fucker writes telling us to buy leaps?\" Today let's talk about  how you can take money the government siphons from you to give to clean  energy companies, get it back, and....feel good about yourself for NOT  recycling?  It's true.  I present to you:  Clean Energy Fuels Corp  ($CLNE).\n\n# Let's see if I can scare you away first:\n\nLittle  preface to this:  I invested heavily into this company in 2008 at the  behest of T. Boone Pickens, whom at the time I considered a brilliant  man and mentor, only to find out he might have been the bad kind of  retarded.  It, to this day, represents one of the absolute most face  ripping, multi-million dollar losses I've ever incurred (losing over 75%  of my investment in less than 3 months).  So I'm trying to put my PTSD  on this behind me and assume my therapist would say this would be  healthy for me.  Anyhow....\n\n# Still here?  OK, let's talk:\n\nSo  who are these guys?  Essentially, they're the only natural gas play out  there that isn't currently under assault by environmentalists of a  certain ideology who somehow consider being able to still use your  rangetop or heat your home even if there's no electricity (supposing you  have a fireplace) being literally like Hitler.  Why?  Two reasons.  1,  they're natural gas INFRASTRUCTURE for the heavy duty transportation  sector, which means they get a pass.  2, through some sort of weird ass  voodoo and probably compromising photos of Jesus snorting a line of blow  off a 400 pound hooker who may or may not be tucking a dong, they've  actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG  or LNG to something they call \"Renewable Natural Gas\" (RNG).  RNG is,  get this....*carbon negative.*   For enterprises that care about being carbon neutral (Ben &  Jerry's), those who want to pretend they care (Amazon), or those who  just fear being hit with heavy taxes (literally everybody), this is an  amazingly cost efficient and positive optic way to take those steps.\n\nIn  short, CLNE makes a carbon negative fuel and has created an  infrastructure of refueling stations across the nation for vehicles that  run on this stuff - mostly commercial and heavy transport.\n\n# OK,  that's bullshit.  I mean, I know I learned nothing in my science  classes because I spent them rubbing myself under the table imagining  what having Mrs. Renfroe ride me cowgirl would feel like as she bounced  her sagging tiddies off my face while she openly sobbed about how her ex  husband was fucking a 24 year old model and all she got was my punk  ass and 2.4\", but even I know that sounds like some perpetual  motion machine nonsense.\n\nOK,  so hear me out.  Picture a landfill.  Take a good, looooong whiff.  Oh  don't act so disgusted - we all know your wife walks around smelling  like a mixture of really bad fish sauce and the urine troughs at Yankee  stadium, you can handle it.  What are landfills amazing at producing?   Methane, and lots of it.  The same methane your vegan sister-in-law  keeps preaching about every time you try to eat a hamburger as she  claims that cows are literally Hitler because their methane farts are  ruining the environment.  I'm not going to go too deeply into the maths  because I know you smoothbrains can barely read, but there's a measure  out there called \"Global Warming Potentials\".   The higher the number,  the worse the gas is as we ignore the fact that Mother Nature can decide  to facefuck us any time she wants and regulate our shit.   Methane  comes in in the mid term at about 30 GWP.  That's a bad number.\n\nSo  what the fuck do we do with it?  Well, most landfills today have built  infrastructure under the landfills to harness it to power the landfill  itself, but the landfills still produce WAY more than can be burned off  for energy.   Enter $CLNE.  They've figured out a way to harness methane  and convert it into RNG, which has a GWP of....about 1.1-1.3, if I  remember correctly?  I don't feel like going to the EPA site to check on  it, but it's a monster drop.  AND on top of reducing its GWP, it  provides fuel. That's some Star Trek shit right there.   And since the  landfills have no use for anything beyond what they need to power the  landfill itself, they just give this shit away so they don't have to pay  carbon taxes.  **So, $CLNE takes  gas nobody wants, converts it into transportable fuel, fills tanks full  of it, and charges trucks to fill up with it.**\n\nTL:DR:   The more you don't recycle and throw shit into landfills, the more  methane that can get created, therefore the more clean energy that can  be produced = math says stop recycling.\n\nThere  is, of course, another way to collect methane:  You could just put butt  plugs in every cow out there that trails back to a collection facility.   But the tubes get all tangled up and if they clog, it blows up the  cow.  It's not really catching on for those reasons.  Or you can take  cow/pig shit or, more accurately, your own shit from the wastewater  recycling plant and turn it into this stuff.\n\n(Just  remember that even if you do recycle, in most major cities it just ends  up in the landfill anyways, they just don't advertise it because it  took them so long to condition you to do it).\n\nAs  to scalability, this is the most recent data on where you convert this  stuff, so there's a lot of room to scale these operations out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fart and rotten Wendy's collection](https://preview.redd.it/ywiw0jt798l61.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ec41c3303e80382da17bffdc6fbe7946393156)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fuck this, man.  ELECTRICITY is the futurez!  Nobody's gonna buy this voodoo sauce\n\nOK  first off, I own a fucking Tesla.  You know how long it takes to  recharge that thing even at a supercharger station?  That might be fine  for a commuter vehicle, but when you're talking long-haul trucks and  delivery vehicles that have to be on the road constantly in order to do  their job, stopping for 3 hours to recharge just isn't fucking feasible.   You pull into a Clean Energy station, you're in and out in less than 8  minutes and back to forging your driving logs because you're getting  paid by the mile and if you run some soccer mom in a Mormon Assault  Vehicle off the road, killing her and her 14 fucking crotch droppings,  well, that's just the cost of getting 38 cents a mile beyond the 8 hours  you're supposed to drive without a break.\n\nOh,  let's also not forget that states like California can't even provide  enough electricity for the people already there, let alone trying to put  the entire transportation sector on their shit ass infrastructure, as  well.  Hollywood celebrities can tell you to suck it up in your shitty 2  bedroom apartment in Carson City while they go for a dip in their  Olympic swimming pool, but that shit ain't gonna fly in the business  world.\n\n# OK, enough science, fucker:  TENDIES MAN, how am I getting them?\n\nFor  their full year their EPS came in just below 0 on 241 million in  revenues.  They're projected to do about 330 million this year.   Historically, this company has been a huge money loser.  Everybody  thought they were going to change the world in 2008-2012, but nat gas  powered vehicles never took off because the infrastructure was just  never there to make it something viable.  That was before the taxman  started skullfucking industry and before they made magic go-juice,  though.\n\n$CLNE  is (as of this writing) trading at a ridiculous price of 12.20 for a  market cap of 2.4 billion dollars.  In the last month, the stonk is down  over 33%, dragged down largely by the fallout in all things renewable  because everybody lost their shit when Texas's windmills froze over and  it turned out solar panels don't work with a foot of snow on them.  The  last week or so they've been getting dragged down by the broader market  for no god damned good reason whatsoever, which is why I'm picking today  to talk about these people - the entry point is just too damned good.\n\nLet's examine some of their recent wins:\n\n* Amazon  recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG  powered vehicles for their fleet.  $CLNE did something brilliant a few  years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel  these machines by building their refilling stations right next to  Amazon's warehouses\n* In  February, they signed a contract with the Los Angeles Metro system to  provide over 47 million gallons of RNG to their bus fleet\n* Their lobbyists successfully got congress to pass an alternative fuel tax credit\n* They've  partnered with $BP to not only expand their development of RNG fuel,  but to also commission BP to put RNG fillers at their existing gas station  infrastructure, to be managed and operated by BP but with most of the  revenue coming back to $CLNE.  BP gave them something like 50 million  dollars for the privilege (that number is close; I don't feel like  looking it up)\n* They  partnered with Total just yesterday and got t hem to do the same thing  with regards to creating RNG production facilities and help build out  the refueling infrastructure.  Total is going to give them 50 million  dollars to assist in this, and will be providing fillers for RNG at their  stations.  These two companies have also created a \"Zero Now\" program by  which the price of RNG is tethered to the cost of diesel, thus making  it no more expensive to use RNG than it would be to use traditional  diesel powered big rigs.  This project is expected to be finished by  2025.\n* In December alone, they signed contracts to deliver 58 million gallons of RNG.\n* Not  directly related to CLNE, but Cummins Westport recently came out with  the ISX12 G RNG engine to go in its heavy trucks to further growth and  demand in this segment.  CLNE, as the only provider out there with a  nationwide infrastructure to deliver this fuel, stands to receive the  lion's share of the money that goes into fueling these vehicles.\n\nThe  Total and BP contracts, in particular, haven't had a chance to be baked  into the stock price.  Further, the scalability of this product .\n\n# Technical analysis:\n\nIf  we look at the daily chart since it started moving last year, we see a  couple of indicators.  Pardon the unclean line drawing, but I don't care  enough to spend 10 minutes getting it exact.  These charts are as of  about 2 o clock Friday morning, so they will be slightly outdated by the  time this posts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1f6kqpl898l61.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=55a2b1fa716281b3d9ae054dc23ccf65ab1799a9)\n\nDaily\n\nCouple  things we see here.  Ascending support and resistance during its move  up, a large gap up which went into a descending triangle pattern.  If  you look at the second-most circle from the right on the upside, you see  it hit the wedge of the consolidation which typically would have  signaled a breakout to the upside.  However, Melvin and the rest threw  the market into chaos, and it broke hard to the downside to where it's  now testing support levels from months ago which - thus far - have held,  bouncing right off of them twice now.  The light blue line represents  the 20 day exponential moving average, the dark blue line represents the  50 day SMA.  As you can see, the stonk has been consolidating in  another wedge pattern entered in from the top which, again, in normal  circumstances would signal a break to the upside.  In this clown car  though, who knows?  If this selloff continues much longer, don't be  surprised to see this thing fall all the way down to about 10.50, at  which point I'd recommend selling off your children to go all in on it.   But if there's any sort of end to this correction, it's going to rocket  northbound.\n\nAnd  if we go from a daily to a 4 minute chart, you see flat support and  descending resistance in a period of consolidation, which is usually a  pretty good bull flag.  However, I would put zero faith in it holding  because of this extended selloff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[4 minute](https://preview.redd.it/0xtzpni998l61.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=6842a210e7198dd34eb9b1832c5deed7a55bfa05)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n* $CLNE  is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the green energy wave, and will  undoubtedly be given a fuck ton of cash from Joey Buyden and the rest  of the smooth brains controlling our money as part of their agenda\n* They've  solved their free cash woes that have hampered their ability to scale  by hitching their wagons to cash-soaked oil companies who want to stay  ahead of the curve in the demise of their product and also want some  good PR points\n* They've  got big vendors like Amazon and the California Republic of Union  Corruption to give them piles of money for their product\n* They  have a product that legitimately addresses global warming concerns, not  just makes up some shit and slaps a green label on it.\n* The  reason your wife doesn't have a boyfriend is because you've really  gotta show her a Massengill commercial.  You kinda smell like dogshit,  too.  Maybe stop flinging poo.\n* One  potential headwind this stock faces is that the transport industry is  notoriously slow to adopt new technologies.  Converting fleets from  diesel to RNG is going to be a lot like asking your boss for a 2% bump  in salary after they fire 4 people and give you all their work and  expect you to say thank you.  If the government properly incentivizes  fleet upgrades to where everybody gets on board, though?  Look the fuck  out.\n\n# Price Targets:\n\nAgain,  this is hard to peg right now because the market is flat-out broken,  but if sanity returns....I'm thinking $17 by late May.  One year price  target...31?  That places it at a premium compared to the sector, but  every sector has a stonk with a story good enough that the fundamentals  stop mattering quite so much.  This would very likely be a strong  candidate for theirs.\n\n# How do you play it?:\n\nIn a perfect world,  I'd say go balls deep in short term calls and just let it melt up - and  that was 7 dollars ago.  But again, this market isn't normal.  Aim for  June expiry outside the money.  Those 13's I have (well, that you'll  know I have in about 10 seconds) are really, really nice and at the same  price I bought them at a week ago.  Given where it presently sits right  at its support level, if you wanted to gamble it, I'd watch it on the  opening bell the next few sessions and see if it just absolutely spikes  off that support, which would be a good sign it's going to continue  ripping.  This is not financial advice.\n\n# Position disclaimers:\n\n* 600 6/18 13c's I bought on the dip of the dip of this dip that I'm presently at dead even money on\n* 500  6/18 20c's that I'm 66% under on but am not willing to write off  because I think a rebound is in play.  Which is unusual - usually when I  get this far underwater on a trade, I cut bait.  But I also don't  consider them free money like I did the day I got them.\n* 50,000 shares at an average price of $8.23.  I peeled off 10,000 shares recently to cover some of these options.\n* I  am not presently looking to expand any of these positions, nor will I  average down on any of the calls, as while I have a lot of faith in this  particular company, I lack that faith in the market and I've seen good  companies dragged down into the abyss for no reason far too frequently  recently.\n\nAll my love,\n\n\\-Chad Dickens", "id": "ns6h3z", "created_utc": 1622816980.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Dumbest shit I ever read.

{"title": "GTHX a DD; note this DD is about 3 months old, no changes have been made for events of the past 3 months", "selftext": "G1 Theraputics\n\nHistory:\n\nG1 Theraputics is a newer drug company that develops and commercializes various therapies primarily relating to the treatment of cancer and cancer related symptoms. It was founded in 2008 and went public in May 2017.  \n\nG1 has three main drub candidates; lerociclib, rintodestrant and trilaciclib; plus one newer as yet unnamed drug. \n\nLerociclib (a drug with no current assignable value, but possible future payments):\n\nThe first drug candidate, lerociclib is being tested for multiple possible uses, however G1 has entered into agreements with EQRx, Inc and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc, such that these companies with test and commercialize the drug. Genor Biopharma Co. Inc has rights to commercialize this drug in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan; while EQRx Inc has rights to the rest of the world, including the USA. In return for ceding the testing and commercialization of lerociclib, G1 received payments of 26 million and could receive up to $330 million in additional milestone payments in the future. \n\nIt is unclear at this stage in G1 will ever receive future payments for this drug, it is unclear when these payments might occur, and furthermore the amount of money under consideration ($330 million) is fairly small when compared to the possible funds from G1's other drug candidates.  However, the companies that purchased the rights to the drug did already pay 26 million for those rights, so its likely they see significant possible future value in the drug.\n\nThus, taking all these pieces of info into account, this report assigns this drug a fairly conservative future value of 20-30% of the possible future payments, or 67 to 133 million dollars. This payment must be discounted as it may not start for 3-5 years and would likely continue over several years. So, if this possible future revenue is discounted by 8% for 8 years (0.54 multiplier) this gives a current value to G1 of 36 to 72 million dollars.\n\n\nRintodestrant (G1's 2nd drug, some possible future value):\n\nWith regards to the 2nd drug candidate, rintodestrant, G1 is currently testing this drug for use in patients with  ER+ or HER2- breast cancer. Beast cancer accounts for about 30% of all cancers in females, in the USA.  About 65% of breast cancer is ER+, which means that estrogen mistakenly signals the cancer to grow and sometimes even protects the cancer from the body's own immune system. To combat this there are several possible treatments but for many of the cancers, a class of drugs called SERD's has proven to be very effective often when other treatments fail.  SERD's promote ER degradation which can have many anti-tumor effects, again primarily in use with cancers that have shown a resistance to other drugs.\n\nCurrently only one SERD, fluvestrant (a competing drug sold by AstraZeneca) is approved for use though several other SERD's, including the G1 candidate, rintodestrant, are being tested.  G1 began a phase I test of rintodestrant in 2018 and presented data from this test in 2019 and 2020. Based on the results of the phase I test, rintodestrant is likely (though as yet, not proven) to be more potent in binding and degrading ER, which would lead to faster and more complete degradation of tumors.  Additionally, rintodestrant has been observed to have a lower incidence of adverse effects, no severe side effects as well as no observed toxicity or bradycardia (bradycardia refers to an abnormally lowered heart rate). Furthermore, rintodestrant is easier to administer as it can be given orally (fluvestrant is administered by injection).\n\nBased on the successful phase I results, G1 is now conducting a phase II trial of rintodestrant when used in combination with another drug, Palbociclib.   Palbociclib is a drug developed by Pfizer and the trial is of course being conducted with agreement from Pfizer.  The results of this trial should be made public in the 2nd quarter of 2021 ie within a few months.\n\nRegarding assessment of the current value of rintodestrant, there are several problems.  First off, there is a competing drug, fluvestrant, currently being used and other competing drugs currently being tested. While rintodestrant appears to have various advantages over fluvestrant, the main possible advantage would be that its is more potent and though rintodestrant does appear to be more potent (based on the completed phase I trial), this has yet to be fully proven. Additionally further testing of rintodestrant will take several more years and finally, the current testing of rintodestrant is for use in combination with another drug, Palbociclib, and its unclear how revenue would be shared between these 2 drugs if any revenue ever occurs.\n\nThe current drug being used in these cases of breast cancer, fluvestrant, had 2020 worldwide sales of 580 million.  In a best case scenario, rintodestrant would take over most of these sales, and these sales have room to grow. However, even in the best case this would not occur for 3-5 years or more, and much of the sales would likely still go to Pfizer if their drug, palbociclib, was used in combination with rintodestrant.  \n\nIt seems likely that rintodestrant is a more potent drug than fluvestrant (based on the phase I trial) and also seems likely that rintodestrant has no major side effects and fewer side effects than fluvestrant. It thus seems fairly likely that rintodestrant would eventually replace fluvestrant in large part if not completely, if no additional drugs show up that are even more potent than rintodestrant.\n\nThus I am estimating an optimistic assessment of the future income stream for this drug (if there ever is one) at about 350 million per year starting in 3-5 years. This represents the current revenue stream (with room to grow),  but discounted for the possibility that the income is shared to some degree with Pfizer.  I am further estimating the likelihood that G1 is able to realize this income stream at about 30% (of course there is also a strong possibility they will realize a lesser amount of income).  This 30% represents the chance that rintodestrant is more effective than fluvestrant (it probably is), is well received and able to mostly or partially replace fluvestrant (it probably will, if it is proven to be a better drug), and finally that no competing drugs quickly emerge that are still more effective than rintodestrant (unlikely, but who knows).\n\nThus, 30% of 350 million means a expected future income stream of about 105 million, starting in 3-5 years or more, but of course, taking some years for the income stream to reach full strength even if everything goes well.  Discounting the income stream at 8% for 6 years (0.63 multiplier) leads to a present value of the income stream of about 66 million, which equates to a current value to G1 of between 133 million and 200 million (assuming a revenue multiplier of 2 to 3).\n\nTrilaciclib (G1's third drug which has far higher potential)\n\nThough G1 has a few other possible drug candidates (one in particular) they are considering, its difficult to assign any value to these currently untested drugs. Thus, G1's third and final drug of note is Trilaciclib. \n\nTrilaciclib has been tested and continues to be tested as a drug to be used to reduce myelosuppression (ie protecting the bone marrow which can be greatly suppressed by chemo) in patients receiving chemotherapy to combat diagnosed cancers in the body.  Trilaciclib has already been fully tested (thru phase 3) and proven to be effective in reducing myelosuppression in SCLC (small cell lung cancer) patients. Based on this SCLC testing, G1 has received from the FDA a positive PDUFA decision on February 21, 2021 (3 weeks ago).  This means that patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for SCLC can now receive Trilciclib (which is marketed under the tradename Cosela) as part of their treatment.\n\nRegarding the positive effects of triciclib as proved through testing, by protecting the bone marrow from chemotherapy, triciclib reduces the rate of hematologic adverse events including neutropenia (a condition caused by a reduction in certain types of white blood cells which in turn reduces the body's ability to fight infection), anemia (reduction of red blood cells), and thrombocytopenia (reduction of platelets in the blood).  This means patients can receive longer duration chemotherapy treatments and often still have fewer side effects. Also, the immune system functions better than chemotherapy without triciclib and thus the body's own immune system is sometimes better able to help combat the invasive cancer and its effects.  Also, the reduction of chemotherapy side effects equates to generally shorter hospital stays with fewer problems which can save considerable money for the patients and insurance providers.\n\nTo see how widely used triciclib would likely be, G1 interviewed prescribers and found that 77% were extremely enthusiastic, very enthusiastic, or somewhat enthusiastic about the possibility of using triciclib with their patients.  \n\nIn their testing, G1 found that patients living with SCLC and receiving Cosela took 100% to 200% longer to report adverse symptoms including extreme fatigue (7 months with Cosela versus 2.3 months with a placebo), tested anemia (7.2 months with Cosela versus 3.8 months with a placebo) and overall functional well being (7.6 months with Cosela versus 3.8 months with a placebo).\n\nFinally, the average treatment cost for a patient with chemotherapy who does not experience a grade 3/4 hematological event is a whopping $67,800; while the cost with a grade 3/4 event is approximately $90,100 (with Thrombocytopenia), $96,000 (with Anemia) and $131,000 (with neutropenia).  Thus, the helpful effects of Cosela might be such that the insurance companies would be happy to pay $8500 (the approximate cost each cycle of chemo) for the Cosela treatment to hopefully greatly reduce the average treatment cost and the incidence of a grade 3/4 hematological event which carries even greater costs which are enumerated above.\n\nRegarding the approved SCLC treatment for triciclib and the income G1 can expect from it.  Approximately 30,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC every year and of this number about 22,000 receive chemotherapy treatment. Patients who receive chemotherapy need an average of 4 cycles of chemotherapy treatment.  Cosela costs $1417 per vial, but patients require 2 vials per dose, 3 doses per chemotherapy cycle, and 4 chemotherapy cycles, on average. Thus, the total cost is $8502 for the average patient for one cycle of chemotherapy, which equates to $34,008 total average cost (with the average 4 cycles of chemo), per patient. With about 22,000 people being treated for SCLC, this equates to a potential income stream of about 770 million per year (this assumes most SCLC patients will eventually be using Triciclib which is what G1 appears to be projecting or at least hoping will come to pass).  This, in turn, equates to an approximate value to G1 of between 1.54 billion to 2.31 billion assuming a revenue to value multiplier from 2 to 3 (which might be a very conservative multiplier considering the drug is approved and sales have commenced).\n\nIn addition to approval for use in patients with SCLC, G1 is now testing, or has announced testing, for triciclib with patients of several other types of cancer including first line colorectal cancer, triple negative breast cancer, neoadjuvant breast cancer, bladder cancer, and non small cell lung cancer. Some of these tests are well underway, some are recently started and some have been approved but not yet started.  \n\nThough G1 has to test its drug on each type of cancer seperately, the mechanism by which triciclib protects the bone marrow is the same regardless of the type of cancer and for almost all types of cancer (and all types that G1 is currently testing) the drug functions in a completely different part of the body (the bone marrow) as where the cancer is located. Thus, if triciclib works well for SCLC cancer, then it is likely it has approximately the same effects and symptoms as with other types of cancer, with the exception of cancer which is specifically located in the red bone marrow - a small subset of all cancer types.\n\nFurthermore, since G1 has already received approval for triciclib with one type of cancer, testing on cancers in other parts of the body can be somewhat sped up as some of the results/ information from the SCLC testing can be easily applied to testing for other types of cancer. Thus, so long as G1 tests carefully and receives no unexpected results (again they know what the results will probably be from the SCLC testing), it will probably be easier to get future approvals for use with other types of cancer.  Essentially G1 has to simply run similar trials to what they ran for SCLC and prove that they get similar results, but its already expected that this will be the case since the functioning of the drug should have nothing to do with the type of cancer being tested (so long as the cancer is not in the bone marrow, where the drug functions).\n\nCurrently, G1 is in phase 3 testing for one type of cancer (colorectal).  They have recently begun or will soon begin (within the next 3 months) two separate phase 3 tests for 2 types of breast cancer. They are in phase 2 testing for an additional type of breast cancer, and they recently began or will soon begin phase 2 testing for bladder cancer and Non-SCLC lung cancer.  Several other studies, for more types of cancer are planned for 2021.  Though some of these studies (at least the one for colorectal cancer) will likely complete in 2021, drug approval and thus revenue from these studies may not begin until 2022, but all of these studies may be completed and approved within 3 years, possibly less.\n\nIn aggregate these trials that are underway or soon to be underway are for cancers diagnosed far more frequently than SCLC, with patients of these types of cancers receive chemo at the rate of about 470k per year, while SCLC patients receive chemo at a rate of about 22k per year.  However, its not clear that all patients receiving treatment for these cancers would qualify for treatment via triciclib and other problems could emerge so to be safe it would be best to ut this number by about 1/3rd, so 313 thousand patients per year. Thus, the potential revenue stream from these other types of cancer, combined would be about 313.33/22 = 14.24 times as large as the potential revenue stream from SCLC alone. This could (using the same numbers as for SCLC) eventually amount to income of 10.96 billion per year which would in turn equate to a value to G1 of between 21.92 and 32.88 billion.  \n\nFinally, people in other parts of the world also get cancer, and G1 has many patents and several agreements with other companies for these companies to commercialize triciclib in other parts of the world, though G1 themselves still have the rights for most of the world, outside the USA.  It will likely be years before triciclib reaches much of the rest of the world, in fact it will be years before triciclib is accepted for most types of cancer in the USA, assuming this approval even comes.  Still, there is huge potential for this drug outside the USA, as well.\n\n\nOther G1 Data\n\nLooking at other data beyond G1's current drugs, G1 had 207.3 million cash on hand at the beginning of 2021 and said that they expected their cash on hand to last them through 2022. Of course, if triciclib sales are well underway for SCLC by the end of 2021 then they may never need to raise additional cash.  G1 has also raised some licensing revenue in 2021 and this would further reduce chances they need to raise additional cash, down the road. Because the entire 207.3 million will likely be used to fund future drug testing, no credit will be given for it in this analysis of the value of G1, but this does mean there may be no concern about G1 having to raise more money and dilute there stock in the future.\n\nOne other interesting item of note regarding G1.  Some of the earlier founders of the company have moved on to pursue other goals and the whole process of getting their first drug approved has taken years (G1 was founded in 2008, and went public in 2017). Thus G1 may be open to a takeover from a larger drug company, though G1 must realize the vast potential of triciclib. So, there is a chance that G1 could be taken over by a larger drug company, though G1 shareholders might actually be better served if that never happened, possibly making far more money by simply holding on and waiting for the revenue from triciclib to start arriving.\n\n\nValuation Summary\n\nSo, in summary, G1 has an estimated value of $169 million to $272 million from lerociclib and rintodestrant.  They have an estimate value of 1.54 billion to 2.31 billion from the approved use of their primary drug, triciclib, though sales of this drug just started so it make take a year, or so, for this revenue to show up.  \n\nHowever G1 has future potential future value of between 21.92 and 32.88 billion from the additional currently underway tests for triciclib, though they probably won't receive any additional revenue from these other types of cancer for a year, possibly more, and won't realize this entire revenue stream for 3 years, possibly more.  They have even more potential revenue from still more testing of their drug with other types of cancer and from commercialization of their drug overseas.\n\nG1 has a current share price of $20.43 and a current market cap of $857 million.  Assuming a 1 year value of 1.7 billion to 2.58 billion (the estimated current value for lerociclib, rintodestrant plus revenue from the SCLC approval for triciclib at a multiplier of 2 to 3), this computes to a current stock value of about $40.50 to 61.50, within about a year (as the revenue for use of triciclib with SCLC starts coming in).  So, about a 98% to 201% return in 1 year. \n\nHowever, if all current triciclib tests go well and everything moves along without problem, then G1 may be able to grow triciclib's revenue such that their stock value is from 21.92 and 32.88 billion in 5 to 7 years (assuming about 3-4 years to complete all testing and an additional 2-3 years for revenue to reach its full potential).  Additional revenue from overseas sales is possible but that would just be icing on the cake and its difficult to make an educated guess at what that revenue might be within 5 to 7 years. This gives G1's stock an estimated 5 to 7 year value of about 25.6 to 38.4 times its current value (857 market cap divided by estimated future stock value).  \n\nThis last number may actually be conservative, but there are also quite a few things that can go wrong in 5 to 7 years.  Also, there is a decent chance the company will be taken over which would mean an excellent short term return, but nowhere close to a 25.6 to 38.4 bagger.\n\nPossible Near and Distant Catalyst to G1's stock price going up.\n\nAt any time they could be taken over by a larger company that sees potential in their Triciclib drug (and other drugs to a lesser extent).  Longer term (1 year) they should see revenue growth from their one approval for Triciclib. Down the road (probably 5 to 7 years) they may get approval for Triciclib for many other types of Cancer and could see massive revenue from this which could cause their stock to go up many times over its current price.\n\nThere are risks to this investment as with any other and there will be up's and down's and its not clear if any price movement will occur for as much as 9 months, or more, but I personally think this stock will eventually rise to many times its current valuation, if everything goes well.  You do need a 5-7 year time horizon (possibly more) for this one, and even then its a risk.\n\nDisclosure: I have taken a long position in GTHX.

{"title": "Joann Fabrics - Short DD. I am a bull for 'JOAN'", "selftext": "Ladies and Gents, \n\nI have modified my investing approach and am now a value investor. My goal is to always buy good companies at bargain prices. \n\nThis is my short DD for ticker symbol “JOAN”, the underlying company is Joann Fabrics. \n\nThis company recently went public again after a ten year hiatus where they were taken private. Currently they have approximately ⅓ of the shares outstanding available for purchase to the public. The remaining ⅔ is owned by Leonard Green & Partners which was the firm that took them private about a decade ago. The ⅔ of shares are currently in lock-up and will remain in lock-up until September (180 days after IPO). \n\nRevenues \n\n2019 - $2.314 Billion / 2020 - $2.241 Billion / 2021 - $2.762 Billion \n\nNet Income \n\n2019 - $35.3 Million / 2020 - \\*(546.6 million) \\*/ 2021 - 212.3 Million\n\nA major driver of the negative profit in 2020 was due to 486.8 million goodwill and impairment charge. From the 10-K, “We did record impairment charges of 486.8 million in fiscal 2020, which were predominantly the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, driven primarily by the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season” Ref. (1) \n\nNow, you may see the 2020 numbers and say, well that seems terrible. You’d be right. \n\nHowever, fiscal 2021 was a BLOWOUT year for them. Why? Well, COVID of course, that was the year that all were at home and couldn’t do anything out in town. Because of this they are currently trading at a 2.81 TTM P/E. Now of course, I do not believe they will generate as much top and bottom line in fiscal 2022. However, they have had a lot of favorable trends go their way and likely will continue into the future. Based on the analysts that currently report on JOAN they see it trading at \\~5.8 forward P/E which essentially means they think profit will be about half as much as it was last year. That is fair that it will be less, but HALF?\n\nLet’s take a look at their most recent quarterly results which posted yesterday (Q1 Fiscal 2022) \n\nNet Sales - 574 million vs. 499.4 million in the year prior. \n\nNet income - 15.1 million vs. (23.6 million) in the year prior.\n\nEPS of $0.39…. Did I forget to mention Q1 and Q2 are traditionally their worst performing quarters? If we assume this EPS sticks for the next four quarters it is currently trading at \\~11 FWD P/E. That would also be ridiculously stupid to do, considering net income was 47.7 Million in Q3 ‘fiscal 2021 and 38.3 million in Q4 ‘fiscal 2021.\n\nNow the argument could definitely be made that stimulus and covid played a one-time role in some of these revenues and profits. That would be impossible to calculate so I personally always like to have a margin of safety which is also why I think analysts predicted a forward P/E of about twice as much as it currently trades for on a TTM. So based on that, I will just continue the argument on the \\~5.8 Forward P/E. \n\nAnalysts were predicting earnings of $0.18 per share, turns out Joann Fabrics destroyed that and made over double. \n\nIf you take a look at ref (3) which is the highlights from the earnings report or listen to the earnings call on their investor relations page on the website it highlights some significant growth opportunities and long-term trends they see. I will just speak about a few and feel free to check out the others in your own additional DD. \n\nThe arts & crafts business has been reinvigorated because of covid, and it’s here to stay. Look at etsy for example, there are hundreds of thousands of arts and crafts items being crafted every day by people like you and me. (Long term growth potential)\n\nThe gross margin improved by 23.1% (that is \\*\\*\\*\\*ing huge!) They are able to generate higher tickets, more often. The omni-channel growth was 186% over the past two years (only represents 13% of sales as of now). \n\nI feel like I’d just be retyping the entire earnings transcript trying to say why this company is going to do phenomenally well in the coming years.\n\nComparatively, Michaels was taken private in November of last year in a 5 billion dollar deal, which would be one of the closest competitors based off this deal it would value Joann at about $40 or a valuation of 1.8 billion (based off of sales). However, Joann products have higher margins and personally I believe Joann has better growth prospect stories, in store sewing lessons, revamping the Joann consumer experience in new look stores (only a few stores are being re-done a year). \n\nDid I mention the dividend…? It’s not much, but $0.40/year or $0.10/quarter. Not bad, currently a yield of a little over 2% as of today’s stock price \\~$16 ish. \n\nSome negative things about Joann - They do have \\~700 M in long-term debt, all of the IPO money they received went directly to paying down debt and one of their goals this year is to continue to reduce leverage and expect to reach \\~650 M in long-term debt by the end of the fiscal year. (I see this as a positive). The CEO clearly has a long-term plan on how this debt will be repaid. \n\nHeadwinds - Shipping cost has been rising significantly due to the economy reopening, this will likely play a key role in margins in the coming quarters. Next quarter will also be the worst of the year on a traditional basis, due to them having to prepare product wise for Q3 and Q4 which traditionally are the best quarters. \n\nMy Bull Thesis - This company is trading at 2.81 TTM P/E, these “expert” analysts think it’s at a 5.8 forward P/E, which I think they are low-balling JOAN, but let’s say they are right. The current market average for P/E is 36.8 and traditional average is 19.6. This is a smaller company and should be trading at a discount compared to a bigger obvious great company like Apple or Johnson and Johnson which both have P/E’s of about 27-29. However, should it be trading \\~5-6X cheaper!? I would not be typing this if I thought that was the case. This company has several growth prospects in the future and seems to be run by a solid team that has growth in mind. I think this company should be trading at a forward P/E or TTM P/E (whichever is higher) of about 15 which would lead me to my price target of $44.00. That is assuming I believe the analyst FWD P/E which I think it is low balling. I feel comfortable buying this stock below $30 and I have a personal price target of $50.00\n\nDisclaimer - I am a BULL for JOAN, I do own 2000 shares at an avg price of $14.60. I also have some November calls. \n\nNow, while I obviously want any of you reading this to look into the company and invest if you think it’s a value play. I do fundamentally believe in this company and their future. My plan is to hold for several years, unless the story somehow goes sour, I do not see that happening in the near-term. If the stock some-how reached above $70 I would likely sell, if it reached above $55 (10% above my own price target) I would likely reduce my position in half. \n\n\\--- I welcome any feedback, I do recognize I have a bias towards this company. If I didn’t, I probably wouldn’t invest in it. \n\nI hope you find this at least useful in determining whether or not to do your own DD into the company.\n\n1. \\- [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834585/000156459021017323/joan-10k\\_20210130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834585/000156459021017323/joan-10k_20210130.htm)\n2. \\- [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001834585/000156459021031683/joan-10q\\_20210501.htm#CONSOLIDATED\\_BALANCE\\_SHEETS](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001834585/000156459021031683/joan-10q_20210501.htm#CONSOLIDATED_BALANCE_SHEETS)\n3.
