Past 6 months, the Transocean director paid 40.7 million from June 7 to June 22 to purchase 9.9 million shares on the open market, which along with a rising oil price, could potentially be another AMC in the making.\n\nShorts: Currently there are 569 million shares floating with 7.5% held by insiders, 54.52 held by institutions,s and well over 14% short of float, which accounts for almost 75 million shares of outstanding shares. Given the rising oil price and domestic market recovery, there is an increase in the demand, in addition to the cyclical summer demand for gas.\n\nInsider: Insiders have been scooping up shares, which is an indication of confidence in the stability of oil prices and demand moving forward. \"Transocean director Frederik W. Mohn paid $40.7 million from June 15 through June 22 for a total of 9.9 million shares, a per-share average price of $4.11. Mohn made the purchases through Perestroika AS, a Norwegian investment firm of which he is the sole director and owner, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perestroika now owns 77.6 million Transocean shares. **It was Mohn‚Äôs first purchase of Transocean stock on the open market since 2018**.\"\n\nTechnical Outlook: Resistance at $4.81 as a 52-week high. Currently, the stock is looking to break out and breakthrough that resistance. I expect the stock will go higher and potentially retest the $4.81 as the new support and then reaches new highs.

{"title": "$TSP: The best way to play self-driving today (up 84% since my post a month ago)", "selftext": "TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. \n\n[TuSimple Stock: The Driverless Truck Stock That Counts NVIDIA and Cathie Wood as Investors](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/979f72e4-7022-3f0e-a9a5-e20306d3e48e/tusimple-stock-the.html)\n\n# Why not Robotaxis?\n\nRobotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. \n\n## Why not Robotaxis: Technical\n\nRobotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. \n\nPick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible.\n\n## Why not Robotaxis: Operational\n\nWith Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did.\n\n## Why not Robotaxis: Business\n\nThe cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers.\n\nFurther, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. \n\n# Why Trucking?\n\n## Why Trucking: Technical\n\nHighway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below.\n\n## Why Trucking: Operational\n\nTrucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure.\n\n## Why Trucking: Business\n\nThere is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). \n\nGiven the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis.\n\nIn short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today.\n\n# Why TuSimple? \n\nThe players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies.\n\nTuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that.\n\nTuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. \n\n## But, but, aren‚Äôt they Chinese?\n\nThey definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? \n\nThis actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGiven all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $15B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. \n\nIn other words: TSP to the moon, apes!", "id": "oabuml", "created_utc": 1624984323.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oabuml/tsp_the_best_way_to_play_selfdriving_today_up_84/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnsnmx/tsp_the_best_way_to_play_selfdriving_today/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/GreenTeaOnMyDesk, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why is this better than $HCIC which is going public via spac with better revenue projections and a quarter of the market cap?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "TSP had a real IPO, with all its associated due diligence.

Its current PE ratio is 14 which is unheard in the common e-commerce space.\n\nAlso,  JD stock has come down in anticipation of anti-trust crackdown of  chinese tech companies by chinese government. As we all know, this  started because Jack Ma could not keep his mouth shut and publicly said  that China rules are not every conducive for growth.
