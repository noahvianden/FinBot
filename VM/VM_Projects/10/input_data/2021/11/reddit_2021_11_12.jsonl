Covavax product no sales as the company report third Quarter loss of $321 million. The stock is being priced in to have billions of doses finished 2022 by preorder, and hasn’t come close to meeting 1% of the target.  Instead, competition of NVAX have excess 2.5 billion doses left in storage.  Novavax working with India manufacturing does not export outside India and does not have approved vaccine. Why would Novavax future sales be relevant when Pfizer and Moderna have excess vaccine doses already in inventory storage? The CEO, President, and CFO sold $200,000,000 of company stock recently. NVAX will almost certainly fall short of its hopes by adding vaccine alongside their other failed product called Synagis, a Novavax failed vaccine in 2017.  The event was devastating to the stock price as if someone was in the last week of construction on a dream home only to have a natural disaster blow through and knock down the entire home in a day.\n\n[Phase III Nanoflu failure](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/12/19/novavax-shares-fall-on-rsv-vaccine-nanoflu-vaccine.html)\n\n[Gates admits Nanoflu vaccine doesn’t stop transmission of Covid](https://youtu.be/Tlx8WTKAgVY)\n\nThe company failed virus events in the earlier Covid 2006 & 2017. CEO said he will submit to FDA by year-end, attempts to lure investors with pipe dreams and a mirage future.\n\nLeaders using a failed FDA vaccine from 2016 as global sales?  Low quality vaccine made in India manufacturing will not make any product until next year with no clarity to when orders will actually start being sent out.  The company is at a crossroads.

In 2017 company made deferred prosecution agreement and penalties and forfeiture totaling $16 million and a civil settlement under the False Claims Act (FCA) with the federal government totaling approximately $2.158 million. In a criminal information filed today in the Western District of North Carolina, the government charged that, between July 2011 and November 2012, Baxter introduced into interstate commerce drugs that were adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) because Baxter did not follow cGMP when making those products. At North Cove, Baxter manufactured large-volume sterile intravenous (IV) solutions in a clean room that had high-efficiency particulate absorption (HEPA) filters installed in the ceiling. Air was pushed into the clean room through the HEPA filters. Baxter employee reported the presence of mold on the HEPA filters to plant management. However, Baxter continued to manufacture IV solutions in that clean room for months while the filters the employee had identified as moldy remained in place. Subsequent testing of the filters following an unannounced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection revealed several mold species on the filters. Baxter admitted that it distributed products in interstate commerce that were adulterated in violation of the FDCA. Under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Baxter will pay a total of $16 million in monetary penalties and forfeiture.", "id": "qs48ej", "created_utc": 1636694610.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Reads like a shitty bot wrote it, or it was translated from another language.

{"title": "(11/12) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the final trading day of this week. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Dow futures up nearly 100 points after J&J shares pop on split news](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/stock-futures-inch-higher-as-wall-street-looks-to-avoid-losing-week-amid-high-inflation.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures moved slightly higher early Friday morning as Wall Street looked to end the week on a positive note after a historic inflation report.\n*****\n> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 90 points. S&P 500 futures added 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.\n*****\n> Dow component Johnson & Johnson saw its shares pop about 3% in premarket trading following a Wall Street Journal report that the company is splitting in two. Johnson & Johnson is reportedly breaking off its consumer health division into a separate publicly-traded company.\n*****\n> The move in futures comes after the stock market appears to have withstood the hottest inflation report in 30 years on Wednesday. The major indexes are on track to snap five-week winning streaks but are still within striking distance of their recent records.\n*****\n> Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that year-over-year comparisons to an abnormal 2020 and rising wages may have dented the reaction to the inflation report.\n*****\n> “Big numbers get big headlines, and yes prices are higher, but you’ve got also wage increases that are just about to the same amount as inflation is. So inflation is definitely real, but the impact isn’t quite as severe as people think,” Frederick said.\n*****\n> The inflation report was the latest complication from economic data that investors have sorted through in recent weeks, with some professional investors looking optimistically toward 2022.\n*****\n> “We’ve probably reached maximum supply chain disruption and I think the labor market is going to free up a bit as we saw with the jobs report last Friday,” said Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual.\n*****\n> This week has seen more dramatic action in the bond market, where the inflation report led to a sharp reversal from the recent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield on Wednesday. The bond market was closed on Thursday for Veterans Day.\n*****\n> On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 edged slightly higher. The Dow dropped nearly 160 points, dragged down by Disney’s post-earnings slide.\n*****\n> Through Thursday, the Dow is down 1.1% for the week, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.7%, respectively.\n*****\n> After a busy week of earnings and economic data releases, Friday is relatively light for investors. The preliminary read for November consumer sentiment and the September report on job openings and labor turnover will be released Friday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mJmUPRZ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/09DFOkF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/J32k3Hy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/FUuBep2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/n3TC8PY.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/wwQtXwc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ECT25GM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/S5R3N8P.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0fBrVz3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/J3adNC3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-johnson-johnson-rivian-lordstown-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Johnson & Johnson** — Shares of Johnson & Johnson rose nearly 4% in premarket trading on Friday after announcing plans to split its consumer health business off from its pharmaceutical and medical device operations.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** JNJ\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=JNJ&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Rivian Automotive** — Shares of the newly public electric carmaker continued to rally in premarket trading on Friday after rising more than 22% in Thursday’s session.

Your contracts won’t pay if you hold to expiration, but they do force shares to be tied up in those contracts. Add to your position if you believe in AAPL going up and you want to see some gains you can keep, but buy some “in the money” contracts while holding those others. You won’t see massive gains, but those 3-4 more expensive contracts with always be less risky. Playing options that have a higher sticker price can be a safer way to get involved.
