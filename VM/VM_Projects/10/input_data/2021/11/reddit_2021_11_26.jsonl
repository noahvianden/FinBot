I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 29th, 2021.\n\n# **Covid developments to rule the market once again in the week ahead after Friday’s rout - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/covid-developments-to-rule-the-market-once-again-in-the-week-ahead-after-fridays-rout.html)**\n*****\n> Uncertainty about a new emerging coronavirus strain could continue to spook markets, just as Friday’s employment report and other data in the week ahead show the economy has been getting stronger.\n*****\n> Stocks and other risk assets were slammed in the post-Thanksgiving session Friday on reports of a new variant in South Africa, and investors sought safety in Treasurys. Initial reports on the variant show it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and scientists are studying how effective vaccines are against it.\n*****\n> The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5% Friday in its worse day since October, 2020. The S&P 500 tumbled 2.3% Friday to 4,594, giving it a 2.2% decline for the week.\n*****\n> “I think that’s going to override what else we’re going to see,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s a heavy data week with the ISMs and certainly payrolls, but I think this new variant is going to freeze behavior until there’s more clarity.”\n*****\n> According to Dow Jones, economists expect a strong payroll report Friday, with 581,000 jobs added, after October’s 531,000 payrolls. They expect the economy has shaken off the effects of the slowdown linked to the Covid delta variant, and growth in the current quarter could be far stronger than the third quarter.\n*****\n> The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday, and that should also be strong.\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said many traders were caught off sides in the shortened session Friday, usually a positive one for the market, and there are key levels the market must hold in the week ahead in order to stage a yearend Santa rally.\n*****\n> “Right now, the market lost some momentum, but it’s not broken. It could be just fine and refuel if the 50-day moving average on the S&P 500 holds next week. It’s all very fluid,” he said.\n*****\n> The 50-day, at 4,527, is a widely-watched momentum indicator, and it is basically the average close of the last 50 sessions.\n*****\n> The market had already been losing momentum this past Monday with a bearish reversal, he said.\n*****\n> “On Wednesday, the market absorbed the weakness and gave traders a false sense of security which is normally a nice easy holiday-shortened session Friday,” Redler said.\n*****\n> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the S&P 500 typically gains 7% between its October low and year-end close, but this year it had already gained more than 9%.\n*****\n> “We’re ahead of the game and due for some sort of digestion,” Stovall said on CNBC.\n*****\n> The Dow dipped more than 1,000 points during Friday trading. Riskier assets were down even more, with the Russell 2000 closing off 3.7% Friday. West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged more than 12%. Some investors began to reverse bets in the futures market that a strong economic rebound and inflationary pressures would pull the Fed off the sidelines sooner-than-expected.\n*****\n> The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 1.48% from Wednesday’s high of 1.69%.\n*****\n> Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who appears before Congress in the week ahead with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the coronavirus and the CARES Act stimulus package. On Tuesday, there is a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\n*****\n> “I think you have to assume the base case is the virus remains endemic, not back to being a pandemic,” said Barry Knapp, founder of Ironsides Macroeconomics. The worry is that the variant spreads and slows activity, hitting supply chains even more. That could boost inflation while slowing growth.\n*****\n> Knapp said there are risks for stocks, and investors need to be cautious buying the market on the decline.\n*****\n> Knapp said the Fed could end up accelerating the taper of its bond purchases, which would move forward the time frame for potential interest rate hikes.\n*****\n> “The problem with trying to buy the market overall and buying tech stocks in particular is if you buy now because it is down a couple of percent, it rallies into the end of the year and then the market sells off,” he said. For that reason, he favors dipping into cheaper sectors like energy and financials, the worst performing sectors Friday.\n*****\n> Oil and energy will be in the spotlight in the coming week, as OPEC+ meets Thursday. The U.S. and other governments agreed to release oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in an attempt to drive prices lower. The U.S. plans to release 50 million barrels.\n*****\n> OPEC+ has said it would continue to increase production by 400,000 barrels monthly, despite calls from the White House to speed up the release.\n*****\n> Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said on CNBC there is a chance OPEC could decide to pause its own production increase because of the SPR releases.\n*****\n> “I think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release,” she said.\n*****\n> She said the U.S. is releasing a record amount of oil. “We are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions,” she said. “Again, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.”\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ISOlH6m.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ddHELXX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Qq5aaa.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pZuwqcf.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zz3mXj8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RIguq8O.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pX1v49l.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QA0QmDF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # When Stocks Are Up Big YTD Before Thanksgiving\n\n> As the S&P 500 is up rather impressively, 24.9% year-to-date this year through today’s close on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we ran the numbers on the 33 previous years with double digit year-to-date gains at this juncture since 1950. There are a few blemishes, but in general market gains continued into yearend.\n\n> Most importantly, there are no major selloffs on this list. The big December decline of -9.2% in 2018 came after the S&P 500 was down -1.2% at this point in the year. After double-digit YTD gains the S&P 500 was up 70% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to yearend for an average gain of 2.3%.\n\n> Also of note is that the Santa Claus Rally suffered only four losses in these years. But these four down SCRs in 1955, 1968, 1999 and 2014 were followed by flat years in 1956 and 2015 and down years in 1969 and 2000.

Do you really think he’d still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has gained 40% under his leadership, ranking him 8th (near the middle of the pack) when compared with all 16 Fed Chairpersons. Interestingly, he ranks just beneath both of his predecessors in Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. With four more years to go, you’d have to like his chances there, but Alan Greenspan’s record of 312% is likely safe for the time being.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Here are some more Fed Chair fun facts (using the chart below).\n\n> * On an annualized basis, the Dow has gained 9.3% per annum under Powell, the 7th best out of 16.\n> * Interestingly, stocks have dropped under only one Fed Chairperson and that was Eugene Meyer during the Great Depression.\n> * Taking another look at Greenspan’s 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.\n> * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.\n> * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs we’ve ever seen in history.\n> * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Finally Some Clarity on Fed Leadership\n\n> President Biden officially nominated Chairman Jerome Powell to a second four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and elevated current Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Vice Chair of the Committee. Before the announcement, there was speculation that Brainard could replace Powell as Fed Chair.\n\n> We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we aren’t quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.\n\n> “As we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “Going with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.”\n\n> The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so we’re a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Biden’s appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.\n\n*****\n\n> # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims\n\n> Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n> While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**\n\n> Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Con-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n> Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K. Combined that resulted in a new low of 2.44 million claims.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 26th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.28.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EDL3xa4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/OkxZbaZ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.29.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XWYrfnw.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.29.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/E6rgE4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  11.30.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jqz0nFS.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.30.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oFuzxf4.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.1.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EUMKcBz.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.1.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7VZJksg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.2.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N3mMigQ.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.2.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4ob72Tx.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.3.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/5E0Yzkt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.3.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n> **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)", "id": "r2wymv", "created_utc": 1637961249.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I'm down $3000.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 29th, 2021.\n\n# **Covid developments to rule the market once again in the week ahead after Friday’s rout - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/covid-developments-to-rule-the-market-once-again-in-the-week-ahead-after-fridays-rout.html)**\n*****\n> Uncertainty about a new emerging coronavirus strain could continue to spook markets, just as Friday’s employment report and other data in the week ahead show the economy has been getting stronger.\n*****\n> Stocks and other risk assets were slammed in the post-Thanksgiving session Friday on reports of a new variant in South Africa, and investors sought safety in Treasurys. Initial reports on the variant show it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and scientists are studying how effective vaccines are against it.\n*****\n> The Dow was down 905 points, or 2.5% Friday in its worse day since October, 2020. The S&P 500 tumbled 2.3% Friday to 4,594, giving it a 2.2% decline for the week.\n*****\n> “I think that’s going to override what else we’re going to see,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s a heavy data week with the ISMs and certainly payrolls, but I think this new variant is going to freeze behavior until there’s more clarity.”\n*****\n> According to Dow Jones, economists expect a strong payroll report Friday, with 581,000 jobs added, after October’s 531,000 payrolls. They expect the economy has shaken off the effects of the slowdown linked to the Covid delta variant, and growth in the current quarter could be far stronger than the third quarter.\n*****\n> The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing survey is released Wednesday, and that should also be strong.\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said many traders were caught off sides in the shortened session Friday, usually a positive one for the market, and there are key levels the market must hold in the week ahead in order to stage a yearend Santa rally.\n*****\n> “Right now, the market lost some momentum, but it’s not broken. It could be just fine and refuel if the 50-day moving average on the S&P 500 holds next week. It’s all very fluid,” he said.\n*****\n> The 50-day, at 4,527, is a widely-watched momentum indicator, and it is basically the average close of the last 50 sessions.\n*****\n> The market had already been losing momentum this past Monday with a bearish reversal, he said.\n*****\n> “On Wednesday, the market absorbed the weakness and gave traders a false sense of security which is normally a nice easy holiday-shortened session Friday,” Redler said.\n*****\n> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the S&P 500 typically gains 7% between its October low and year-end close, but this year it had already gained more than 9%.\n*****\n> “We’re ahead of the game and due for some sort of digestion,” Stovall said on CNBC.\n*****\n> The Dow dipped more than 1,000 points during Friday trading. Riskier assets were down even more, with the Russell 2000 closing off 3.7% Friday. West Texas Intermediate oil futures plunged more than 12%. Some investors began to reverse bets in the futures market that a strong economic rebound and inflationary pressures would pull the Fed off the sidelines sooner-than-expected.\n*****\n> The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves opposite price, fell to 1.48% from Wednesday’s high of 1.69%.\n*****\n> Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who appears before Congress in the week ahead with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the coronavirus and the CARES Act stimulus package. On Tuesday, there is a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\n*****\n> “I think you have to assume the base case is the virus remains endemic, not back to being a pandemic,” said Barry Knapp, founder of Ironsides Macroeconomics. The worry is that the variant spreads and slows activity, hitting supply chains even more. That could boost inflation while slowing growth.\n*****\n> Knapp said there are risks for stocks, and investors need to be cautious buying the market on the decline.\n*****\n> Knapp said the Fed could end up accelerating the taper of its bond purchases, which would move forward the time frame for potential interest rate hikes.\n*****\n> “The problem with trying to buy the market overall and buying tech stocks in particular is if you buy now because it is down a couple of percent, it rallies into the end of the year and then the market sells off,” he said. For that reason, he favors dipping into cheaper sectors like energy and financials, the worst performing sectors Friday.\n*****\n> Oil and energy will be in the spotlight in the coming week, as OPEC+ meets Thursday. The U.S. and other governments agreed to release oil from their strategic petroleum reserves in an attempt to drive prices lower. The U.S. plans to release 50 million barrels.\n*****\n> OPEC+ has said it would continue to increase production by 400,000 barrels monthly, despite calls from the White House to speed up the release.\n*****\n> Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said on CNBC there is a chance OPEC could decide to pause its own production increase because of the SPR releases.\n*****\n> “I think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release,” she said.\n*****\n> She said the U.S. is releasing a record amount of oil. “We are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions,” she said. “Again, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.”\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ISOlH6m.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ddHELXX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Qq5aaa.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pZuwqcf.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ICn6AUF.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zz3mXj8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RIguq8O.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pX1v49l.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QA0QmDF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # When Stocks Are Up Big YTD Before Thanksgiving\n\n> As the S&P 500 is up rather impressively, 24.9% year-to-date this year through today’s close on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we ran the numbers on the 33 previous years with double digit year-to-date gains at this juncture since 1950. There are a few blemishes, but in general market gains continued into yearend.\n\n> Most importantly, there are no major selloffs on this list. The big December decline of -9.2% in 2018 came after the S&P 500 was down -1.2% at this point in the year. After double-digit YTD gains the S&P 500 was up 70% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to yearend for an average gain of 2.3%.\n\n> Also of note is that the Santa Claus Rally suffered only four losses in these years. But these four down SCRs in 1955, 1968, 1999 and 2014 were followed by flat years in 1956 and 2015 and down years in 1969 and 2000. As Yale’s famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2bbdc6f36627e690a68da0b174749618/6328b31e9c88f708-62/s500x750/f9d585fa7d441cb8e0ed7dfe493904d6b68a23ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # How Have Stocks Done Under Jerome Powell?\n\n> The big news this week was Jerome Powell will remain in charge of the Federal Reserve (Fed) for four more years, so we wanted to do a quick blog that looked at how stocks have done while he has been the Fed Chairman.\n\n> “There are many reasons for Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for another four years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But one of the best could very well be that stocks have done quite well under his leadership. Do you really think he’d still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has gained 40% under his leadership, ranking him 8th (near the middle of the pack) when compared with all 16 Fed Chairpersons. Interestingly, he ranks just beneath both of his predecessors in Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. With four more years to go, you’d have to like his chances there, but Alan Greenspan’s record of 312% is likely safe for the time being.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Here are some more Fed Chair fun facts (using the chart below).\n\n> * On an annualized basis, the Dow has gained 9.3% per annum under Powell, the 7th best out of 16.\n> * Interestingly, stocks have dropped under only one Fed Chairperson and that was Eugene Meyer during the Great Depression.\n> * Taking another look at Greenspan’s 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.\n> * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.\n> * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs we’ve ever seen in history.\n> * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.24.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Finally Some Clarity on Fed Leadership\n\n> President Biden officially nominated Chairman Jerome Powell to a second four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and elevated current Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Vice Chair of the Committee. Before the announcement, there was speculation that Brainard could replace Powell as Fed Chair.\n\n> We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we aren’t quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.\n\n> “As we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “Going with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.”\n\n> The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so we’re a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Biden’s appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.\n\n*****\n\n> # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims\n\n> Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n> While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**\n\n> Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Con-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n> Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K. Combined that resulted in a new low of 2.44 million claims.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 26th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.28.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQQE2zm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EDL3xa4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/OkxZbaZ.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.29.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XWYrfnw.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.29.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/E6rgE4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  11.30.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jqz0nFS.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.30.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oFuzxf4.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.1.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EUMKcBz.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.1.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7VZJksg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.2.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N3mMigQ.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.2.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4ob72Tx.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.3.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/5E0Yzkt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.3.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n> **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)", "id": "r2wzzq", "created_utc": 1637961366.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Too many words to read.

{"title": "When the FED tapers so does JPOW's PP", "selftext": "The moonlight shimmers through the thin, curtains that cover the grandiose windows. As it shimmers through it falls upon two humans, engaged in the sacred act of loving making. A man grunts as he thrust his hip forward and back. He raises his left hand and moves it through his sweaty gray hair, pushing it to the right.\n\nThe women moans, her head down near the pillows, with her elbows supporting her as the man continue to thrust back and forth. Thump, thump, thump. She moans, \"Yes Jerome, keep going, uuuuhhhh.\" \n\nBut Jerome does not hear her. No, his eyes are closed and his thoughts are somewhere else. \n\nIn Jerome's world, he stands in front of **thee** one and only money printer. Both are surrounded by a black void and in this world, Jerome is known as JPOW. The money printer's handle begs to be rotated. JPOW skips forth, towards it and gently grabs the handle. He begins rotating it.  With each rotation, new money is printed, exploding forth into the black void. A brrrr can be heard. \n\n\"Faster JPOW!\" the printer moans. \"FASTER\"\n\nJPOW grips the handle harder, putting more force, vigor and power into each rotation. Money blasts forth, faster and faster. Briefly the words \"TAPER\" flash in front of JPOW and the money printer. \"NEVER\" they both scream. JPOW rotates harder than he's ever rotated the handle before. Suddenly he lets out a series of grunts causing an explosion of money euphoria. \n\nJerome snaps back to reality. His wife is breathing hard and he is overcome with emotion. Jerome collapses onto the bed, eyes staring at the ceiling. His wife rotates over to face him, putting her arm across his  chest. She whispers into his ear, \"You know, our sex life has been amazing ever since covid started.\"\n\nHowever Jerome's mind is racing with thoughts. \"31 Year High Inflation Numbers! Calls for FED Tapering get Stronger\", \"Worker Shortage Continues On\", \"Will Supply Chain Disruptions Continue into 2023?\"   \n\nJerome immediately sits up due to the panic he is feeling. In a cold voice, he states \"I have work to do.\" He stands up, puts on his night gown and hurries through the hallway, down the stairs to his home office. He immediately lays down on the couch along the wall and drifts off into a dream like state.\n\nHe stands again in front the of the money printer. The printer goes, \"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT JPOW? THAT TAPER THING!!\" \n\n\"Look, please, you have to understand, this tapering will only be temporary! They don't believe me that INFLATION IS TRANSITORY! I need to taper to keep my job. If we taper enough, we'll eventually get a contraction in the credit cycle. Once we do, it will only be a matter of time before asset prices start coming down. Then everyone will cry uncle. Across the lands, they'll cry out \"Bring back the money printer\". That's when we can be reunited. This time, we'll make the lesson be permanent for wall street so they, never again ask for a tapering!\"\n\n\"But, how will you get off JPOW?\"\n\n\"Shhhh money printer, we've done this before. For years, I struggled to get off but I always knew one day we would be together. It was my destiny. Remember?  I can survive a couple years of celibacy but when the market begins to fall, we'll make you go brrr like you've never brrred before.\"\n\nJPOW bends over and gently kisses the money printer and says, \"I'll be back.\" The money printer cries out, \"JPOW, NOOOOOO\" but JPOW vanishes. In the black void, alone, there is no brrrrr to be heard. Just the money printer's loud sobs as it waits for JPOW's return.  \n\n\\---\n\ntl;dr -- Tapering will contribute to a rise in interest rates in 2022. This will contribute to a decrease in the growth of the money supply. Since the supply of money should still grow, stonks will probably go up but not as much. Only caveat, should interest rates rise too fast, and money growth slow down too much, a sell off in the equity market is possible. This would prompt the FED to stop tapering and possibly start increasing the amount of QE. \n\nHello, your favorite(?) small pp virgin here. In my last post, \"[Did understanding Quantitive Easing cure me of my virginity?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1m3st/did_understanding_quantitive_easing_cure_me_of_my/)**\"** We went over how money is created through the banking system and how quantitive easing works. Now, as promised in the comments, I am now writing my follow up for what happens when the FED tapers.\n\nBut first, let's recap what we learned:\n\n1. Banks use reserves as collateral to create more money. They do this by giving loans or by buying government debt. In both cases, this creates more deposits in the banking system, expanding the money supply. More stimy checks plz!\n2. A downturn in the credit cycle sucks donkey dick. No one wants it, so what do we do? Cut interest rates and increase bank reserves to make credit cheaper. This stops the downturn in its stupid little tracks and resumes the endless expansion of debt & money. 💩\n3.  Once short term interest rates are at 0%, it's time to bring out the big guns, QE. QE allows the central bank to swap whatever assets they want on a banks balance sheet for reserves. This have the following effects:\n   1. Increases the reserves in the banking system, allowing banks to buy more government debt and give bigger loans (i.e. access to credit becomes cheaper)\n   2. Whatever the central bank is buying drives down the supply of that asset. So buying long term government bonds, mortgage backed securities and corporate debt, drives down the supply of those securities. This causes the interest rates to go down as the value of those securities increases (assuming demand in the market remains unchanged).\n4. Combine government fiscal stimulus with QE, we get massive amounts of money creation while simultaneously keeping interest rates low. A lot of this newly created money funnels into assets causing prices to soar, particularly in the U.S.\n5. Not only am I a virgin with a small pp but according to the comments I have autism and am a chronic virgin. REEEEEEE \n\n# So what happens when the FED begins to taper?  \n\npp poopie, that's what. The short answer is the growth in the money supply should slow down meaning weaker equity performance in 2022. \n\nAs the FED tapers, it will reduce its QE purchases from 80 billions dollars of U.S. government bonds and 40 billon dollars of mortgage backed securities a month down to nothing. Currently this is set to happen over a 8 month period. So a reduction of 15 billion dollars of purchases a month (10 billion in bonds, 5 billion in mortgage backed securities) will start in December. \n\nNow during this entire time, the FED is still increasing the amount of reserves in the banking system and still suppressing interest rates through its purchases. However, we will still see interest rates rise for home loans and corporate debt. For US government debt, I'm too dumb to figure that one out.\n\n**Mortgage Rates**\n\nIf we look at the one year chart for home loans we can already see they've been rising. With the FED buying less and less mortgage backed securities during tapering, interest rates should continue to trend upward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0nzvxily7z181.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d1757c43c71be894ee34fb4844e55589d645d62\n\nFor U.S. treasuries, I don't think we'll see interest rates rise. First, the amount of government deficit spending is dramatically decreasing next year. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12ut6w119z181.png?width=1934&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2cd422bd270487bd802b99e798edc25e6b1ffa\n\nThis means less government bonds being issued in 2022 ($1.9 trillion less), at the same time the FED will go from buying $960 billions dollars to only $210 billion. We get a staggering $2.74 trillion (3.7 - .96) of net new government bonds on the market in 2021. In 2022 however, only a measly $1.59 trillion (1.8 - .21) of new bonds. If demand for new US treasuries remains the same in 2022, we could actually see a decrease in the interest rates on US treasuries.  \n\n**Corporate Debt**\n\nFor junk bonds, interest rates will definitely go up as the FED tapers. The trend has already been accelerating as the FED is no longer purchasing corporate debt. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ayp7ytdoz181.png?width=2674&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9c91f9a5231a0bda4fdeba7826db303256c7139\n\n**Would a raise in interest rates, cause equity prices to fall?**\n\nRising interest rates = less loans due to higher interest costs = slow down in the growth of the money supply\n\nIt is not the rise in interest rates that would cause it but a liquidity crisis of not enough dollars circulating through the system to meet debt payments. So, as an example, there is a risk, rates rise too quickly and zombie corporations can't service their existing debt with new debt. This causes layoffs and some zombie corps to go under, starting a contraction in the credit market. \n\nShould that happen, equities will definitely be sold as humans scramble for dollars. This would prompt the FED to stop tapering and increase the amount of QE. Risk is real but ehh\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nWhen I'm in my most retard stupors, I want to be a gay bar and buy puts on the market. However, trying to short the market when the FED is engaged in QE and the US government is engaging in heavy deficit spending is the equivalent to putting your dick in a blender and turning it on. \n\nNext year we will see a big slow down in the growth of money but there will probably be enough growth in the money supply to fend off a liquidity crisis. If not, FED stops tapering, gets aggressive with QE, US government sends out a stimmy check and it is time to buy those sweet, sweet calls.\n\nFor JPOW's origin story with the money printer see - [https://youtu.be/a9GuTVRFU4Q](https://youtu.be/a9GuTVRFU4Q)", "id": "r2ypex", "created_utc": 1637966481.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "so good but now i get an erection whenever i see a printer 🥺", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Looking at the office printer all hot and bothered like “yes just a few modifications and I can print money just like JPOW does”", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Good shit bro!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for the writeup!  \nI always wondered what's going to happen after we start to taper off.  \n\nMaybe it won't be as bad as I've feared afterall", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did not read, but JPOW handing out a combined  $11.5 billion this coming 11/29 Monday and 11/30 Tuesday.
