But I'm not an expert like that so my opinion is not a financial advice and definitely not an investment advice/recommendation.\n\nLast year in 2020, professor Aswath Damodaran put a price tag of about $426 for Tesla.

We‚Äôve got meme week ahead of us, meaning that we‚Äôre likely gonna see some fun price action combined with thousands of OTM calls getting turned to ash in an instant. Overall, I don‚Äôt see too many appealing plays this week, but I‚Äôll still be sitting on the sidelines eagerly watching. Those who decide to trade this week are braver than I. Let‚Äôs get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BysxbNDCeUhukPrkM7rwv-mg10e_wIIqkHonMJikEcs/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **There aren‚Äôt many appealing plays this week.** Everything is priced nicely, and there isn‚Äôt any edge to be gained from the historical numbers. If you want to gain some edge, you‚Äôll have to get a little creative and actually look into other forms of alternative data like user growth projections relative to google search density or something like that. I‚Äôll likely let Hungry Bot take the reigns this week since it‚Äôs the easier solution and has been extremely accurate this earnings season, generating [back to back 30 baggers](https://imgur.com/a/v5NLArJ) just last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Lemonade has ONLY missed on earnings since it‚Äôs inception.** Across five quarters, $LMND has delivered five straight misses. Obviously past performance doesn‚Äôt indicate future results, but the sample size is starting to stack up meaning we‚Äôve got fairly nice odds on this trade. Options are priced to perfection so you‚Äôve got no edge on the buy or sell side. Look to run debit or credit spreads to increase your potential profits and avoid IV crush if you decide to play. If I feel like lighting some money on fire, I may roll the dice on this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There‚Äôs no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see any insane moves. Options prices are jacked up, and you‚Äôre just going to get robbed by theta gang if you buy anything. I can literally sell a 50% OTM call/put on any of these meme stocks and collect 30%-50% of the premiums given by an ATM strike. To outline the insanity of this, $BBBY announced that they‚Äôre buying back 60% of their entire float during their ER, and the stock only moved 20% the next day, meaning we have insane margins of safety when selling. Even if there is some insane announcement, the large number of bag holders looking to ditch their positions combined with institutes looking to rob newly minted apes will ensure that price doesn‚Äôt go too haywire too quickly allowing us to gracefully exit our positions anyways.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAlthough I‚Äôm sitting this one out, I hope you all end up having an awesome week of earnings!

{"title": "Investor Note - 2022 Summary", "selftext": "Times have certainly changed. In hindsight we underestimated a number of critical factors impacting the financial markets. A perfect storm of global economic shocks has led to a precipitous drop in the worldwide equity markets.\n\nSignals had been growing that a collapse was possible. As inflation began to ravage American purchasing power, people sought to buy more tangible goods as supplies dwindled. Digital assets, especially if thought of as currencies, were known to be poor allocations during rising inflation. People cashed out of cryptocurrencies in favor of actual goods, which began dropping its value dramatically at the end of the year. Meme stocks were next, as retail investors quickly realized that the companies had turned a good deal of their strategy toward digital assets tied to cryptocurrencies. Or that they were stuck hopelessly in the past like the AMC facing the growth of convenience of in-home-streaming. Many finally figured that these companies may not be the best positioned for the future after all. In fact, both GME and AMC were delisted after crushing exodus from their stock. No private suitors emerged as the companies as sophisticated investors were not enthralled in what made out to be venture capital plays at best. These strategies had potentially exciting returns, but were most likely to fall dead before something interesting would come to pass.\n\nThe first market wide indication of trouble came as the Fed began its tapering programs. When announced the market was unmoved. However in early December, a small correction was triggered as the 10 year treasury began to rise slightly faster than expected. It was later learned that this caused a large portion of the market trading on automated risk-return algorithms to quickly exchange assets into the fixed income market, causing the first equity leg down.\n\nProblems then compounded around Christmas and the New Year. The holiday season was plagued by ever increasing supply issues. Surging retail demand coupled with an already heavily disrupted supply chain created a number of shortages. Now feeling more of the direct impacts of the supply chain, the American public began to pay closer attention to their leaders. Many Republicans cite hardline policies on vaccine mandates as the final domino in the supply chain disruptions. In truth it had little bearing on the situation, as panic buying had already built a huge bullwhip (Forrester) effect long before the holiday selling season. A strained supply chain began to completely logjam as persistent over purchasing had built so much excess in the system. A tired workforce was unable to keep up with crushing backlogs. Many quit their jobs under the immense pressure to fulfill holiday demand. Even record overtime pay wasn‚Äôt enough to keep people working in the growing pressure kettle of the large online retailers grueling supply chain. President Biden‚Äôs approval rating dropped to the lowest in recorded history.\n\nThe more significant impact to the market came late January as waves of companies that were unable to fulfill their typical holiday volumes missed earnings estimates substantially. Juxtaposed to record volumes in earlier quarters, firms depleted inventories couldn‚Äôt keep up with the demand. Most illustrated by Apple Corporation who could only get 85% of its normal holiday volumes to market. Rising supplier costs continued to hollow out bottom lines to add other concerns to the sustainability of record profits seen throughout the pandemic. This added momentum to the market decline, heavily spooking investors who began to pay closer attention to price/earnings ratios.\n\nMore bad news followed from inflation readings. As retailer shelves had emptied early from heavy promotion of ‚Äòpre black friday‚Äô deals. Many had scrambled online in fear of missing out on the most popular holiday items, causing price setting algorithms to rapidly increase prices. As the inflation readings skyrocketed throughout the end of the year and into the new year, the entire Federal Reserve Board had been called in front of congress. The Board was lambasted for the instability in the financial system. Many calls were made to accelerate the tapering process, even as those came at the expense of Washington insiders' massive financial portfolios. Many elected officials had become too scared to sell and be caught in another stock market scandal. Powell was reluctant to heed the calls, but eventually relented. Alarmingly when accelerated, the tapering exposed that other countries had their own growing debt burdens and the American public's diminishing confidence in their government had left demand for US bonds severely overestimated. Additional tapering exposed a severe lack of demand for the notes, driving the 10 year treasury several percentage points higher.\n\nConcern started to rise about corporations' ability to fund debt in a higher interest rate environment. Inflation was seen as the only option as the rate could rise no higher without wrecking havoc on the global financial system. Many companies, over-leveraged by the decade of cheap money, now risked default as a large portion of debt funding was tied to floating rate instruments.\n\nMeanwhile overseas, a cascading impact was starting to be felt when Evergrande and a growing number of other Chinese property developers were unable to repay billion dollar notes due in early 2022. This signaled that most of the bonds of Chinese real estate developers were completely worthless. Evergrande‚Äôs CEO fled the country in an attempt to avoid the heavy pressure from the Chinese government to use his own diminished wealth to repay the bonds. Additional press reports of the true magnitude of the debt crisis emerged as the defaults uncovered how much debt was hidden off balance sheet for Chinese developers. While believed to be mitigated by China‚Äôs central bank, the magnitude of the problem was underestimated and China faces a significant financial crisis akin to the 2008 financial crisis in the US. Most impacted are those that held debt outside of China, as all focus of the CCP has been to mitigate domestic damage.\n\nTensions within US-China relationship had grown considerably during this period as China faced its number of nationalistic crises. The Chinese public surprisingly outwardly grew more concerned with Xi leadership as they faced significant losses from property values and homes never completed. In desperation to distract from the problems, signs indicate that he was getting closer to using military conflict to reunify Taiwan, accelerating worries of a new and more complicated full blown cold war. This cold war that would have been far more dangerous with China‚Äôs economic power entwined with the US, unlike previous superpower conflicts of the past. However, an angry Chinese population had overthrown the government before any more dangerous conflict could arise. The US hopes a Democratic government may be formed in its wake, focused on basic human rights and freedoms.\n\nBack in the US, a group of angry Reddit investors confronted Elon Musk after Telsa dropped 95% of its value as states started to step in to regulate Self Driving car technology as a series of high profile mishaps finally forced the regulatory agencies to step in to control the rollouts of these technologies. Those bodies indicated it could be several years before they would have the framework in place to allow for a regulated self driving market. Elon tweeted after the incident: ‚ÄòYou win some, you lose some‚Ä¶ Cybertruck still looks really cool‚Äô\n\nLabor relations problems in the US continued to escalate as employees wanted more control of the companies they work for, ensuring these problems don‚Äôt happen again. Wage inflation pressures continue despite the market correction, as more workers demand a fairer distribution of compensation from their executives.\n\nJanet Yellen resigned as secretary of the treasury, citing family issues, joining a long list of economic leaders in the administration who resigned over the financial meltdown. Concerns of the stress of the mounting cash flow requirements of the treasury department are speculated as the true reason for her departure.\n\nBanks currently face the difficult decision of how to approach floating rates agreements at current levels as most businesses were over-leveraged and could not support the rapid increases in interest rates. The Libor rate has risen considerably while the Fed has kept the fed fund rate at 0. Congress hastily passed a law limiting interest rates banks can charge on any loans for a two year period to curb a rash of potential defaults as the Fed struggles to reverse policy and regain stabilization by restarting pandemic level bond purchasing programs. However, with the true problem exposed, many wonder if this program will have the same effect it did previously.\n\nThere are reports that the drastic price movements in individual shares across the market had been exaggerated by pay for order flow algorithms. It is speculated that the algorithms behind the scheme had prioritized and accelerated volatility which drove more dramatic price movements to drive additional profit for the market makers. As the pay for order flow consolidated due to high retail activity in online brokerages stoked by the pandemic, the competition that would have minimized these effects had been drowned out, allowing only a few algorithms to dedicate stock prices. The SEC has opened a wide ranging investigation into this phenomenon. The largest market makers currently have not responded publicly to the allegations.\n\nAll the news is not completely bad for the stock market and the economy. Reasonably priced securities with tangible business models were least impacted by the drawdown, losing only half the value compared with their higher valued peers particularly in the technology space. Companies that also did not rely on an import dominated offshore supply chain escaped the brunt of the pain. Supply chains have begun to ease as record demand has cooled and the shipping industry's new investments began to come online to augment the system.\n\nAll in all, if you were highly invested in high-valued growth equities, your portfolios suffered the most. The ‚ÄòGreat Reset‚Äô as it is now called has reminded people that the financial markets are driven by real companies with real performance trading on a historically reasonable price to earnings ratios. At current the bond yields now offer a reasonable alternative to equity investing, returning a non-volatile asset class into the financial picture for managing risk. Business leaders are already engaging the community to bring home overextended offshore supply chains that while more costly are far more resilient and friendlier to the environment.\n\nSincerely\n\nFrom The Future Asset Management LLC", "id": "qogn3g", "created_utc": 1636257490.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "I thoroughly enjoyed this read", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Honestly it could happen", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tldr.
