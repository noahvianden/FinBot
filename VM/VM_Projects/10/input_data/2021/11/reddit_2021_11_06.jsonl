We leveraged up at the bottom and have been unloading into the predicted rally. Portfolios are still strongly biased towards a continued upmove but the current leverage was reduced to 1.5/1.6. Meaning a 10% move should make us 15-16% overall (it goes both ways). That's why taking profits is king. Those were the profits taken this week.\n\n\nDD +15% (3 trading days)\n\nQCOM +21.2% (18 trading days)\n\nEXPE +8.3% (5 trading days)\n\nGE +9.4% (34 trading days)\n\nSBUX +4.7% (19 trading days)\n\nLeveraged ETFs:\n\n30% of URTY +33% (now I only own 30% of the initial position)\n\nBut let's cut to the chase: Portfolios are up 49 and 40% year to date while the best performing US Index is up 27% (NDX100). An international benchmark mix (60% US) is only up 17.8% because Brazil and Asia were tanking again.\n\nAs always there is no way to post charts on reddit/stocks so I will explain what I see!\n\nNDX100: It all started with the extremely low MACD readings late September and October. I had posted that it was a buying opportunity. Obviously laughed at by redditors but I like being attacked and laughed at because that means chances are I am right. Around that time investor sentiment was net negative 4 weeks in a row. Just 1 year after a recession that is a buying opportunity! Anyhow. NDX100 made 14% since the low and broke above the highs from early September. Because many were left behind we went up in a straight line!\nAs long as we can stay above the breakout area of 15700 we will continue to go higher. Expect a test of the area around 15700 but the minimum target should be 17000. If we make it in a straight line or not depends on how much FOMO all the bears from September have.\nI am a swing trader so I already took a profit of 15% on TQQQ. The main reason was to deleverage on the way up.\n\nDisclaimer: I own QQQ, FB, Amazon longterm. \n\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 15700\n\nDJI: Same is true for DJI as for NDX100. Watch the 35500 level. I also realized already a 13.8% profit on UDOW. \nMinimum target 37250.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 35500\n\n\nS&P500: Watch 4550 level. Also broke above and confirmed bullish bias. Minimum target 4800.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 4550\n\n\nRussell 2000: Russell 2000 is my favorite US Index right now and the only index I still own leveraged ETFs on. It had a rough 2021 trading in a trading range for at least 8 months but it finally woke up and it could run at least 10% from here still. This week alone it made 6%. I predicted the Russell to outperform NDX, S&P, DJI until end of year and I still think more money can be made with small caps.\nFor deleveraging purpose I had sold another 30% of URTY. Gain was 33%.\nMinimum target 2580 but will likely go much higher.\n\nDisclaimer: I own IWM and URTY plus many individual small cap stocks that were sold off brutally into October.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 2360 area.\n\nSpecialty Indices:\n\nToday I mention one specialty Index that I think has potential\n\nXBI (Biotech):\nBiotech had a rough time for months now but came back big time breaking a months long downtrend. It hit the 200 day average and is in the middle of retesting that broken downtrendline. XBI could be a buy from here.\n\nDisclaimer: I own LABU (leveraged ETF on XBI). Up 14% as of today.\n\nIf you are only interested in US investments stop here!\n\n\nInternational plays.\n\nFEZ: Eurostoxx had a great comeback like the US Indices and also made new highs after months of sideways action. Minimum target is the 51.5 are or FEZ\n\nDisclaimer: I own FEZ and DB\n\n\nChina (FXI): China is in the middle of a medium-/longterm bottoming phase. It retraced the recent upmove by a little bit more than 61.8%. It could turn any time here. If we really break down to the 37.5 level again it is definitely a buying opportunity.\n\nDisclaimer: I am currently overweight the regular 10% allocation to Asia\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish although choppy because we are in the middle of a bottoming phase (only index I think is in a longterm bottoming phase)\n\n\nSpeculative:\n\nBrazil: I had mentioned last week that Brazil was in dire straights!\n\nHere is the article again:\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-reeling-brazil-deficit-fears-005715131.html\n\nI speculated that like with the Evergrande disaster it might be worth looking at trading opportunities here.\n\nBrazil was sold off with high volume 10-21 and a hammer formed with higher volume 10-22. We were in the middle of retracing the 10% upmove last week. Dropped below the 61.8% retracement but made a double bottom at 29. Friday's candle needs to be be confirmed but I think it has potential. I bought more call options around the $29 area.\n\nExtremely dangerous situation.\n\nDisclaimer: 7-9% of my portfolios are call options on EWZ\n\nOutlook: Possible bottoming phase. Highly speculative.\n\n\n\nOverall positioning:\n\nTime in the market is key and therefore I am almost always 100% invested. This way you get the skeptics out of the way and really don't miss out on opportunities.\n\nHowever timing the market CAN absolutely be done. One can beat the benchmark without ever being out of the market with margin loans, leveraged ETFs and options trading by finding bottoms. My specialty is finding bottoms. The maximum leverage at the lows early October was 3. Now portfolios are at 1.5/1.6 and the goal is to unleverage on the way up to a goal of 1 again when we are closer to a neutral/bearish signal.\n\nThere is a good possibility that a huge rally internationally just started but because one never knows for sure we will continue to unload our positions because we are still overleveraged due to the fact that we anticipated the bottom about 1 month ago and loaded up on stocks then.\n\n\nHappy to discuss as usual. Just post in comment section.\n\nHappy Trades and have a great weekend and trading week!\nGo out there and make money with the tip of your finger!\n\nSee you next week.\nChart-trader", "id": "qo3v5n", "created_utc": 1636216255.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "There seem to be 5 comments but I can not access a single one of them.

(BRK.A) reported Q3 FY 2021 earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. Earnings per share (EPS), while down by 63.8% year over year (YOY), were 15.7% better than analysts' forecasts. Revenue for the quarter exceeded analysts' estimates by 15.2%, despite being down by 0.4% year over year (YOY).\n\nBerkshire Hathaway recorded a pretax net gain of $4.9 billion on investments and derivative contracts that was included in the revenue figure cited in the table above. This was down by 84.5% from the figure of $31.6 billion recorded in the same period of 2020.2 On an after-tax basis, the gain was $3.9 billion, down by 84.2% from $24.7 billion in Q3 2020.\n\nOperating earnings, which exclude these gains, were $6.5 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in the same quarter of 2020. This was an improvement of 18.2% YOY but 7.1% below the estimates. The operating earnings figures that Berkshire reports in the notes to its SEC Form 10-Q and in its earnings release are calculated after income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nBerkshire has not made a large outside acquisition since its purchase of Precision Castparts in 2016, but it has continued extensive share repurchases (stock buybacks) as a means to distribute its huge cash hoard to shareholders. It bought back approximately $7.6 billion in stock in Q3, bringing the total for the first nine months of 2021 to about $20.2 billion.\n\nOver the past year, through the market close on Nov. 5, 2021, Berkshire Hathaway's shares have provided a total return of 39.1%, outperforming the S&P 500's total return of 33.8%.\n\nBRK.A Operating Earnings\n\nFor many years, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett has urged investors to focus on Berkshire's operating earnings from its diversified lineup of wholly owned operating subsidiaries, which stretch across a broad spectrum of industries—most notably insurance, railroads, utilities, and energy. However, as of result of recent changes to GAAP reporting rules, the quarterly mark-to-market fluctuations in the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio must be reflected on the company's income statement, a rule that Buffett has decried as introducing misleading volatility into the company's reported financial results.\n\nOperating revenues increased from $63.0 billion in Q3 FY 2020 to $70.6 billion in Q2 FY 2021, an improvement of 12.1%. Meanwhile, operating expenses rose by 11.2% YOY, from $57.0 billion to $63.4 billion.\n\nThe biggest drivers of the $7.6 billion YOY improvement in operating revenues came from an increase of $2.3 billion from Berkshire's manufacturing segments, $1.9 billion from insurance, and a $1.4 billion improvement in its service and retailing segments. Its railroad and energy segments also posted YOY revenue gains, reflecting the conglomerate's widespread participation in the economic expansion.\n\nAs noted above, after-tax operating earnings of $6.5 billion represented an improvement of 18.2% from the same period in 2020. However, insurance underwriting was a drag on results, posting a loss of $784 million in Q3 2021, versus a loss of $213 million in Q3 2020. Insurance investment income was up by 14.4% YOY; railroad, utilities, and energy by 10.6%; and \"other businesses\" (manufacturing, services, and retailing) by 15.3%. \"Other\" (which includes goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges) swung from a loss of $412 million in Q3 2020 to a profit of $349 million in Q3 FY 2021.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's next earnings report (for Q4 FY 2021 and the annual report for FY 2021) is expected to be released on Feb. 26, 2022.6 A highlight of each annual report is Warren Buffett's accompanying annual letter to shareholders, which traditionally is eagerly anticipated by investors in general, not just Berkshire shareholders.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "News posts **must be market moving** and contain **new** information.
