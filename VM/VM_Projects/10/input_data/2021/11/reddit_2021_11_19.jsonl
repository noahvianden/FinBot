The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 outperformed after global chipmaker Nvidia raised its outlook, while Apple surged after it was reported the corporation is accelerating the development of its electric automobile. Macy's Inc. and Kohl's Corp. led retail advances after indicating that consumer demand remains strong.\n* According to Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, the S&P 500 might reach 5,200 in the next six months in an environment of less monetary stimulus and outperformance by cyclical companies. That would imply an 11% gain from Wednesday's close.\n* JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists said they now expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in September, becoming the latest on Wall Street to abandon a forecast for the Fed to remain on hold until 2022. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted a Fed rate hike in July last month. Morgan Stanley analysts believe officials will continue to hold steady on interest rates for the rest of the year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3l0807elig081.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ec3819c931abbc36b68795daed1581531efbe6d\n\n[üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA - Thursday Nov. 18, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qwcih2/i_spy_ta_thursday_nov_18_2021/)\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 18\n\n* *Micro support - 467.50*\n* *Micro resistance - 469.10*\n* *Bullish targets - 470.49 - 471.34 - 472.99*\n* *Bearish targets - 466.68 - 465.60 - 463.78*\n* *Major support at 465*\n* *Consolidation around 20 SMMA*\n* *Best case for bulls is we gap above 469.10*\n* *Best case for bears is gap below 467.50*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6ols2cqig081.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43eeb8f06d5a17688fe3a588a15915a3d17b688\n\n## SPY - Nov. 18 - Price Action\n\n* *Open: 469.24*\n* *High: 470.01*\n* *Low: 466.34*\n* *Close: 469.73*\n* *Volume: 47,079,937*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pttopqtig081.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=532bb4e0cb21939e950515e2a4be398b749b9207\n\n# SPY - Nov. 19 - Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdohk7nvig081.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f6781726bf9a8bc302cbd12f9f9878ebdacee0\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (11/18)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,787,639\n* Call Volume Total: 1,559,174\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.15\n* Put Open Interest Total: 14,344,434\n* Call Open Interest Total: 7,266,012\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9h5ggexig081.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f38368ee4cea9079afdc33a2642f7f0cec367355\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcm43p8yig081.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f7de8062f599d961d519d53a0b47679baf1de\n\n## Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Support - 468.00, 466.52\n* Volatility trigger - 467.00\n* Resistance - 470.49 - 471.00\n* Call wall - 470\n* Bullish targets - 472.37 - 473.86 - 474.68 - 475.89\n* Bearish targets - 465.81 - 462.80 - 460.92\n* Put wall support - 463\n* VWAP at 468.82\n* Riding upperband\n* Lower band at 468\n\nNotes:\n\n* Can Bulls finally push us over 471?\n* Opex tomorrow\n* Looking for a dip to VWAP or lower band, near 1st support level in AM and reevaluate.

{"title": "I finally have a charting ritual after years of thinking looking at charts was bullshit.", "selftext": "Just listen to conference calls, follow the news, and make good guesses about what the markets will be like a year from now, right? Well, yes, and no. When I invest, that's basically all I do. I don't generally care a whole lot about the chart. My long term thesis is that tech will outperform nearly every other sector, and half my retirement portfolio is in VGT. The other half is in 5 other companies. I've done fairly well as an investor. However, investing and trading are two completely different animals. Investing is all about not giving a shit what the market thinks, over time share price will go up, or dividends will. Buy and hold a good investment. \n\nHowever, trading means spotting trends. You're not trying to figure out which companies are good, you're trying to figure out which companies other investors are going to buy. I've finally accepted that I need some technical analysis for that. I'm not chart wizard. However, some basic chart reading has been so helpful in cycling in and out of investments. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7w0kmgiqpg081.jpg?width=1881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a57ce818f6449a355d9a269b5f4ad776e51f3a6\n\nEvery night after work I open up TOS after work and looking through charts. It takes me about an hour to go through all the charts most days, sometimes I spend more time. Sometimes I spend less. This is part of my daily homework. The other half of my homework is listening to conference calls, keeping up with political and economic news. A few months ago I had a shotgun wedding for DD and TA, and I can say now that they're living happily ever after.   \n\n\nDD is how I come up with theories and themes in the market. I'll read news. Take for example the question of interest rates. As an investor, I don't mind what interest rates do. As a trader, I care what the rest of the market thinks interest rates will do. How do I gauge that? I look at a financials ETF. If the markets think interest rates are going up, financials would be going up too. But if you look at the chart for XLF, the price and volume are kinda stagnant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gczv058i0h081.jpg?width=1782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3dc6ab67a47926909b952b39aeb0b5d889b9eed\n\nDoes Wall Street think inflation tapering off?   \n\n\n[Material companies are falling. ](https://preview.redd.it/8kigf8bp0h081.jpg?width=1785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b719ddc7e7ead2685391d618520eba0fe0092a6f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The price of energy is falling.](https://preview.redd.it/7a228js21h081.jpg?width=1788&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=325b5882fd16cda5a5d6dfbbfd058a9fc042e6b3)\n\nI'm going to go ahead and guess that Wall Street thinks inflation is either tapering off, or about to fall a little bit based on these two charts. \n\nThis information let me ask some great questions. If inflation is leveling off or falling, and interest rates are stable, what goes up? Tech, home builders, maybe some grocery stores get some better margins? Okay, let's check out some tech companies.  \n\nI start scrolling through my tech watch list, the kind of companies that would benefit from interest rates staying the same.

Labor shortage ends in about 12-18 months from now as younger workers enter the workforce, corporations innovate their way to less labor intense operations, (Starbucks Grab 'N Go Kiosks) and people run out of stimulus money  \nSemiconductors: This will remain a problem for sometime.   \nShipping: Shipping costs will level off over the next six months or so. Government will step in, or private industry will unclog the bottlenecks. There will be fewer COVID related kinks in the supply chain. \n\nWho Benefits? Who Suffers?  \nThe big winners are going to be the companies that drastically reduced labor costs through automation, but also have huge input costs that are going to stay the same or fall significantly. Starbucks is on my radar starting mid-2022.   \n\n\nShipping Companies will not be getting those juicy delivery fees forever.

This is actually ideal for strategies like the wheel and many times very high quality stocks can often be traded for a fraction of their current cost.  Think of trading AAPL for 20% or less than it cost today.\n\nThe biggest problem with any trading is surviving the crash without being forced to take too many losses and wiping out a good part of the account.  This is why it is a good policy to keep 50% of an account in cash.  One of the best places to be during a crash is holding high quality stocks which is yet another good reason to trade these with the wheel.

You can do it weekly making it almost impossible to be called away and if you only make .5% in premium a week that is still 26% returns in premium a year allowing you to eat a pretty steep drop should the market go against your position. Had I known about the wheel strategy earlier in life I would be retired now. Also since the wheel strat kicks of sooooo much cash as you build larger portfolios, you can more comfortable be highly invested because premiums are perpetually rolling in. Have an emergency, sell a few covered calls or puts.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The issue with your figure of 26%, is that it is 26% of the FD value...and if your FD/Stock tanked...you are not going to be pulling in anything near 26% of your portfolios original value to offset your losses, and a big pump can potentially call your stock away and end up making you lose months or years worth of wheelstrat gains quite swiftly.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Getting them called away at an OTM strike means you make even more profit. If you make 10-15-20% returns over a few months on selling the CC's then you can eat a drop in the market, a correction is usually 20% drop. If you have 26% returns  from the premium alone (easily doable) then you can eat that 20% drop and still have a profit. It is a DERISKing strategy not a RISK FREE strategy. No matter what you come away with either shares bought at a price you want (you pick it when selling a put), or you walk away having them called away are a price you want again you pick it as a seller. The only other option is you keep premium which is just income you would not have had otherwise). No matter what you win. I've have 2 of my stocks tank over 20% this past week and guess what I'm still in the green... why is that? dollar cost averaging down and writing more CC's to offset those loses. Each time it fell my CC broke me even on the way down, one of them is now going up and guess what I'm still collecting premium. If it gets called away oh well I walk out of the deal with 25% profit on the share appreciation + all of the premium collected to bump it higher. The wheel strategy is a wonderful tool and it works in all markets bull/bear/neutral. Does it work 100% of the time in any of them no it does not, no strategy does. There are pros and cons to all of them. But the wheel is a wonderful way to reduce risk while holding shares. If you are selling your CC's below your cost basis, you're doing something wrong. I don't understand how you could ever LOSE money on a pump and having your stock pulled away.

At that point you can adjust duration to continue earning the premium or just forgo selling the CC or PUT for a bit until premiums are favorable.

Most of my strike prices are out far enough that if I do get the shares called away it locks in 30-90% returns depending on the security that gets called.

Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.\n\nNotable Numbers Today\n\n* SPY: -0.19%\n* QQQ: +0.56%\n* DIA: -0.76%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.70%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%\n* Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%\n* PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%\n\nMarkets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. \n\nJim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said ‚Äúalthough all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.‚Äù\n\nIn particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said ‚ÄúJust like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.\n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nYesterday, the Labor Department‚Äôs Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low.

The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.\n* As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025.

If there is a cascade of supply shortages there will likely be another panic like the toilet paper shortage but potentially much worse because everything will be out of stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wht0115vfk081.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfeae1e00e4d1c1d3664cf813cc0105cd4519b94\n\n**Stock estimate:**\n\nWhen covid hit the stock tanked to around $68 but this would probably hit easier than covid. Covid took down revenue for 2 quarters in 2020. This will last 1 quarter probably. A slight difference is that the pandemic did not cause infrastructure damage. The floods have caused major damage that needs damage assessed, repairs to be deployed, repair inspections, and approvals on top of any covid protocols, weather delays, supply shortages, and personnel or equipment logistics. If this DD gets popular a drop may happen fairly soon. If this remains fringe knowledge then the drop will probably happen after Q4 earnings on Jan 25, 2022, so keep that in mind.\n\nI am more bearish on the rail companies over trucking or ship companies, I imagine they can find an alternative route. Even if supplies lines are completely taken over by trucks. This is money not going into CN or CP.\n\nI predict large stock gains and new ATHs before a plunge just like the pandemic. Everyone is partying it up right now.\n\n**CN vs CP**\n\nCN and CP operate separate routes. CN can probably handle this better since they have access to 9 ports including Vancouver. While CP only has access to 4 ports. Even if they got ships to unload at their other ports they are all effectively on the Eastern side adding at least 7 days of delay for CN and 11 days for CP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkmufgpvfk081.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=922a9aa022dbe5cc2f64eb566b5882e97da27b50\n\n[https://www.cn.ca/-/media/Images/Our-Business/photos/Ports/ports-Connecting-the-Dots-en.jpg?la=en&hash=2AFA798D023E1C3546A84DB3ED44F659D3173696](https://www.cn.ca/-/media/Images/Our-Business/photos/Ports/ports-Connecting-the-Dots-en.jpg?la=en&hash=2AFA798D023E1C3546A84DB3ED44F659D3173696)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wll0076wfk081.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=2485311b16d6af1d05f058f80f2e1f5bae96d1d0\n\n[https://www.cpr.ca/en/choose-rail-site/PublishingImages/map-asia-web.jpg?&width=800&height=370](https://www.cpr.ca/en/choose-rail-site/PublishingImages/map-asia-web.jpg?&width=800&height=370)\n\n**Risks**:\n\nIt could all be a false alarm ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ but are multi week long delays good for the economy?
