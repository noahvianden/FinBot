Moderna stocks performed better when compared to Pfizer Chart. A look at both of their chart shows that they are looking for a reversal to hit higher highs. The differences between Modern and Pfizer is that Pfizer actually pays dividends and have a higher share float 402M vs 5.6B. This is one of the reason why Pfizer is unable to catch up with MRNA price action. Another factor affecting the price action will be the dividend payout. Unlike Moderna, Pfizer actually pays dividends and it's a norm for stock prices to fall after announcing dividend payouts.\n\n[Pfizer Chart](https://preview.redd.it/1e3tc794u6m71.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=40af5152b7c005c9a23fe2fe47508ccdcaf9e3f6)\n\nStrong Buy Moderna too as it reverses to hit ATH. \n\n[Moderna Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nmefs9icu6m71.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f555e2f86ec1e4df3acf634dc8b8234928550b5)\n\nI believe the fair value for Pfizer would be in the 70-80s range and Moderna to be at 600+ by the end of the year .
