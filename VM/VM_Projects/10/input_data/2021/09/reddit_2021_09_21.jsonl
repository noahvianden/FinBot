{"title": "Lock in Profits without a Day Trade Available", "selftext": "Let me set the scene right now. You’ve just spent three hours doing intense research finding the perfect stock to buy and hold for the next couple of days so you can reap in the wonderful profits. The market opens you find your option contract - exact strike and date - set your limit sell and BAM! You’re in.\n\n>***Market’s moving.You’re suddenly up 10% within minutes.A few minutes later your stock has increased eighty cents and you’re 30% up. Wow!Five minutes later you’re sitting at 65% gains.This is unbelievable.What’s going on!?You tell yourself you need to sell.But you can’t. You have no day trades available.Oops.***\n\nHow many times have you found yourself in a similar situation? Of course, those profits may be exaggerated but there might be a time when you expected to hold overnight for 10-15% and suddenly find yourself above that. It can be frustrating because what happens if you hold? What happens if the stock pulls back and the sellers start taking profit. Are you going to be left behind? In many cases you will. However, it doesn’t have to be that way!\n\nWe can actually lock in profits right now even without a day trade available.\n\nSay whaaaa????\n\nYep! You can do this by opening a Vertical Spread. Now because we aren’t buying together it won’t be 1 contract. However, it acts as the same.\n\n**So how do we do this?**\n\nIt’s simple! Let’s look at an example:\n\nLet’s say we purchased a put on BAC with the $38 strike price and a April 1st expiration and we got in with an 65 cent buy. Now our option is trading at $1.10 and we want to lock in gains.\n\n**So what we do is the following:**\n\n1. Go to the April 1st expirations for BAC.\n2. Instead of looking at the BUY options look at the SELL\n3. Since we purchased the $38 Put we want to SELL a put contract and decide to sell the $37.5 Put for 46 cents.\n4. We now receive a $46.00 credit\n\nSo as of right now what have we done? Well, we are up $45.00 per contract on our original buy. We have now sold our second contract and received a credit of $46.00. Assuming nothing more happens and tomorrow the stock opens up exactly the same we may lose a little value to theta and the morning spread but essentially you’ll be up about the same amount.\n\n**Now, whenever you go to cash in the next morning you have to do the following:**\n\n1. **BUY** back the contract you sold. To do this all you have to do is go to the $37.5 Put and **BUY** the contract. This will relieve you from the contract you sold.\n2. Once you have bought back the contract you sold you will be left with your original option contract that you bought. So now you need to close out this original contract.\n3. Do your happy dance and make it rain dollar dollar bills!\n\nOpening a Vertical Spread can help lock in money. It doesn’t always work though. If the stock begins to decrease in value overnight you may end up losing money on the original contract but because you sold a contract at the higher price as it decreases in value the more money you get to keep from it. However, let’s say something dramatic happens and the stock gaps down well below your original entry. Sure, you may be up on the credit sell you made but you might be down so far on the original contract that overall you’re now losing. The great thing is though even if you hadn’t opened the Vertical Spread you would have been down so essentially by doing the spread you limit the loss a bit.\n\nNow, let’s say the next morning BAC continues to rise and has gapped up and your original contract has increased by another 20%. Well, you’re going to be down on the contract you sold as it has increased, but the original option is going to be worth more so by hedging with the **SELL** contract you have essentially safely locked in gains without risking too much of your capital overnight.\n\nHopefully this helps!

Stock gaps up to $55 and now your option is worth $5.50 \n\nNow- you can GAURANTEE profit as long as the contract you short is worth more than the contract you originally bought (also the short strike must be further out of the money than your long) \n\nLet’s look at 2 different scenarios. \n\n1) short the $54 strike for $1.75 credit. Since you paid $1.15 for the long contract, your MINIMUM Profit is 1.75-1.15= $0.60. This occurs if both of these calls expire worthless. Even if the stock tanks to 0, you still get this profit.  \nYour MAX profit occurs if both contracts expire ITM. this would be the $.60 of net credit you got for entering the position plus what is generated from execution-> buy at $50, called away at $54. So max profit = 0.60+4.0=$4.60! \n\n2) short the $60 contract for $0.50. The difference here is there is no Guaranteed profit. But, what you have done is lessened your max loss compared to just holding the long call which risks $1.15.  $1.15-$.50=$0.65 max loss by adding the short call. Why would you want to do this compared to option #1? cuz your max profit is now much higher. Max profit occurs if both calls expire ITM, just like before. Max profit = ($60-$50)-0.65= $9.35. \n\nImportant notes-\n\nMax profit for these scenarios only occurs if both strikes are ITM. This is less likely in scenario #2 since the short call is further out of the money. \n\nMax profit only occurs at or close to expiration. \n\nDONT EVER actually let your spreads expire.

On Monday, European and U.S. benchmark stock indexes sold off on fears of financial contagion, while credit default swaps, the costs of insuring against Chinese sovereign default, surged. It’s about time.  \n>  \n>An Evergrande bankruptcy and correction in the local real estate sector will be painful, and not only for commodity suppliers. If a full-bore housing crisis ensues, it could cause an unprecedented contraction in the world’s second-largest economy, with implications for every company that invests in or exports things to China.  \n>  \n>Short of that, the risk of financial contagion seems limited. Evergrande dollar bonds were downgraded to junk long ago; high-yield issues by Chinese developers are mostly traded by speculators. Evergrande’s biggest lenders are domestic banks like China Minsheng Banking **(600016.SS)** and Agricultural Bank of China **(601288.SS)**, **(1288.HK)**. Much of its recent credit was raised by paying suppliers commercial paper instead of cash. During the U.S. subprime mortgage crash in 2008, the difficulty in establishing who held how much junk prompted banks to stop lending. Yet a similar liquidity crisis is next to impossible in China, where the financial system is controlled by the state.  \n>  \n>Some foreign trading desks will take a hit. Fund manager Amundi said it still has $25 million of exposure to Evergrande. Investment bankers who sold the developer’s bonds to clients may have uncomfortable conversations with lawyers coming up. It’s possible too that overseas institutions have been taking on default risk without knowing it, given founder Hui Ka Yan and peers’ fondness for exotic and opaque funding channels like wealth management products.  \n>  \n>There may be some silver linings. The historical outperformance of property compared to every other Chinese asset class has overheated demand for mortgages and shadow loans. It has warped Chinese consumption and investment, cannibalising capital from the securities markets, mutual funds and insurance. That has played poorly to the strengths of overseas wealth managers trying to lure China’s retail investors.

You have AFRM going to the moon, SQ buying AfterPay, Klarna, PYPL buying Paidy, GS buying GSKY etc. Even MQ is joining the party.\n\nBut Discover Financial ($DFS) will be the first major credit card network to go BNPL on all their merchants. As most of us are aware, $DFS has always been one of those large traditional banking companies, and the large banks are starting to feel the pressure from BNPL encroaching on their domain. \n\nThey mentioned back in February that they were partnering with Sezzle (one of the second-tier BNPLs) and looking into launching a BNPL offering. In this [Nilson Report](https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1369/sezzle/) about Sezzle (that has been relatively obscure), we can see that they are trying to add a BNPL solution for all their US Enterprise Clients on the Discover Global Network. Enterprise clients refer to all the giant chain-stores. \n\nThen in July, they invested a [further $30M into Sezzle](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/discover-backs-sezzle-with-30m-to-offer-shoppers-buy-now-pay-later-tool/). As Sezzle is currently listed on the ASX, the announcement was made there instead of at DFS.\n\nNow if negotiations go smoothly, which I imagine they are, then Discover could become one of the largest BNPL providers in the US, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with Affirm's offering, on top if its current financial services.
