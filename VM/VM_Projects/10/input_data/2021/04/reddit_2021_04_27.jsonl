{"title": "Important quotes from today's earnings call (without Q/A)", "selftext": "**Elon Musk, Technoking**\n\n>*Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels as Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Model 3 became the best-selling mid-size premium sedan in the world. In fact, I should say, the best selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for a lot of the time the best-selling premium sedan. It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 years into production and was just two factories.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and — probably next year. So — I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely. I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*So with respect to Model S and X, there are more challenges expected in developing the Plaid Model S or what’s called the Palladium Program which is the new version of Model S and X which has revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has reasonable PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*We do expect to ramp Model S production and stop delivering probably next month. So — and then to be in sort of high-volume production for DS in Q3 and start delivering the Model X in Q3 as well.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*We’re going to aim to produce over 2,000 SX per week, perhaps, if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well. And we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year. At this time we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Zachary Kirkhorn, Master of Coin**\n\n>*Auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentioned for S and X and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we’re experiencing start to be resolved.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overheads.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*On energy gross margins, these remained negative for the second quarter. This is driven by Solar Roof related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We’re working as fast as we can to increase production and this will aid in profitability of this business as test volumes increase.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technology and growth. In particular for R&D this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells, investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*On the SG&A side, we’re setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there. And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*On cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials. Taking a step back, we’ve generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past four quarters.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually and we believe we’re on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we’re driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on S and X as we’ve discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements. And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there is certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to.*\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "mzdmuc", "created_utc": 1619487811.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Really happy with the earnings, just a shame that aftermarket was able to cover the doubters asses", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "4680 development is slower than expected.\n\nI think the share price will go down a bit today.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Is it slower?

{"title": "COVID's Massive Effect on the Semi-Conductor Market: What This Means for Electronics Manufacturers on Earnings Week", "selftext": " Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. \n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\\[take\\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. \n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. \n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. \n\nMicrosoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.", "id": "mznbvw", "created_utc": 1619526463.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "STRIKE\n\nDATE", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thank you sir, we should have more posts like this on the front page.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Really appreciate it!
