Open calls, heavily weighted towards safer strikes because I'm a pansy. Position is understated both in total and net return by about $20k because Ally is hot garbage.\n\n[Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160](https://preview.redd.it/yi7nbd77wbu61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=6142da6e4ab288faaa88e7058edc9848fdc2a7fd)\n\n**TL;DR yet again** \\- Quest performed over 10.4 million COVID tests during Q1 and base case testing has rebounded. They are still executing over $900 million in share repurchases over the next 3 months, which equates to a buyback of roughly 5% of their float. Then they have another $ BILLION of repurchases authorized for the back half of 2021 as well. Additionally, the technicals are some of the most bullish I've ever seen. And yet, the company still trades well behind their top competitor, Labcorp $LH. **I'll say it until I'm blue in the face from wearing these 6 masks, $DGX remains the safest trade in this market.**\n\n**$DGX vs $LH** \\- Look, I think I've beaten this comparison to death over the previous DDs, so I'll just add this quick table reflecting DGX share price as a % of LH. Note that prices are somewhat smoothed within each month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btoa28l3wbu61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=b235d50ba4006fec1b716cb230ee610e035b3a5c\n\nThat's a pretty damn consistent trend isn't it? And don't worry, I know you aren't here to do math. If $DGX was trading at a conservative 60% of LH, it would be $156. Right now. Now, people can argue the LH Covance acquisition makes their growth prospects better than Quest. Maybe. But it certainly shouldn't drive this large of a variance.\n\n**Charting / Technicals** \\- Virtually all technicals are neutral or **VERY bullish** at this point. I also encourage those who like charting to checkout the 1-2 year trend. Then for more fun, take a look at the intraday trading over the last 60ish days. Look, I think charting is worthless 95% of the time as are technicals without a lot of context, but there are some obvious patterns in trading over the last couple months specifically. To me, it's clear institutions have been deliberately chasing out retail and consistently repurchasing at a lower price. On-balance Volume is soaring, which when combined with other metrics, is a great indicator of large \"smart money\" bets. This happens all the time. It's why stocks like Apple unexpectedly flatline for substantial periods of time, then make a huge move upward on \"info\" or \"results\" that you thought were easily foreseeable long ago.\n\n**Institutions** and other big boys (or, conversely, dbag hedgefunds) - **13F filings** in Q1 and Q2 (so far) were absurdly bullish on $DGX, buying the stock at nearly a $4 to $1 rate. This is a much higher rate than usual for $DGX and VASTLY higher than the ratio of $$$ intuitions are putting into $LH.\n\n**Shorts/shorting because this is WSB after all -** The amount of shares short is surprisingly interesting right now. Sure, an increase in shares short to nearly 4m doesn't seem like a lot on a float of 132m at face value. But $DGX has 90% institutional ownership, the majority of which isn't being moved (Vanguard is largest owner and Quest has a solid dividend). So the public/retail is really playing with 16m shares or so. Then factor in $DGX is repurchasing around 14 million shares this year, depending on buyback price. **Now that 4 million shares short becomes VERY material.**\n\n**$DGX Q1 Performance -** I still expect a big beat, projecting over $4 EPS on a lower than expected drop off in COVID testing, substantial increases in base testing (core business), increasing acquisition revenue, and additional COVID research projects. Quest continues to flat out tell you they are still crushing COVID testing. Sure, it's down slightly from Q4, but remains much higher than 2020 Q2 and Q3. Adjusted run rate for April remains high as well. And now they will have base testing back again.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 20, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 20, 2021**\n\nStocks fell Tuesday, with all three major indexes dipping for the second straight session. Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  \n\nDespite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it’s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, \"Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it’s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.\n\nWhite House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.\n* Senior executives with Alphabet's Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel said on Monday.\n* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The stock pulled back sharply\n* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\\*\\***\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) from $250 to $285 at Buy.

The Service segment includes the sale of service contracts, spare parts, and related activities. The company was founded by Smith Hansen and Peder Hansen in 1945 and is headquartered in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\nThey look like a solid company. P/E of 40, which I would argue is slightly undervalued. A very established company with a $250 billion market cap. They've increased YOY revenue over the past 3 years, pulling in a revenue of $110 billion. It'd be interesting to know whether they have a monopoly on Wind Power plants though.\n\nEdit: These numbers may actually be in Danish Kronens, which would translate to a $40 billion market cap and $17.8 billion in revenue.
