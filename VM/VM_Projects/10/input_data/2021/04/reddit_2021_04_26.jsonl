{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 26, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 26, 2021**\n\nThe stock traded mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) continuing strong momentum from last week while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly fell. Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.\n\nThis week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. \n\nEighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. \n\nLast week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.\"\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) beat analyst expectations in their earnings report. The stock is modestly down at the time of writing\n   * Revenue of $10.39 billion vs $10.29 billion expected (up from $6 billion a year earlier)\n   * EPS of $0.93 vs $0.79 expected\n* The vaccinations effort continues with over 200 million Americans receiving at least one shot and 90 million adults fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the CDC.\n* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. \"These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,\" White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.\n* In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $157 to $158 at Overweight.

I’m not looking for an actual play, its just I did a lot of research on them over the weekend and I was having a hard time finding one with a good setup. It seems like the most critical factor that I found across different articles is that you want to sell the short option for more than the extrinsic value of the long option. It also seems that most examples buy LEAPS. I understand all of this but found it hard to find one that fit all the criteria.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So for me I only do PMCC on stocks that I feel have strong strong upside and use it to buy LEAPS.  The prevailing wisdom is to buy deep ITM leaps and then sell calls against it to lower your cost basis which is a decent strategy.  \n\nBut I usually look for stocks that are at or near bottoms of strong support.  Then I buy slightly ITM calls long dated expiration.  Like for example I bought AMD when it was at $75 Bc of strong support and I bought 2023 calls at $75.  Then the entire goal is to sell calls via theta decay to lower your break even.  \n\nSo if my cost basis per call is $15.00 on a $75 strike then my break even is $90.  My goal is to sell calls that expire worthless or have to roll out to make back as much of that initial $15.00 cost over the course of a year so that I basically own that LEAP for free and have a break even of my strike.  If you do a really really good job then you may actually make even more profit than it cost which is like amazing.  I only sell monthlies against it with 30-45 DTE calls with a less than .30 delta.  Low probability and usually can close out 2-3 weeks for 50% profit or let it ride for all profit.  \n\nBig thing about near the money LEAPS is that if stock goes down then you lose the ability to sell meaningful calls against it.  Your strike of what you sell always wants to be higher (if possible) than your long strike that way you are still going to make higher profit based on vega.  So you have to find the right setups and find bottoms.  Otherwise you need to go deep in the money in case the deal turns on you.  And make sure you give yourself enough time where you can make $100 a month to lower your cost basis.
