You could sell your 20K worth of stock, and buy 20K worth of leaps. If you buy 20K worth of leaps, with a lower strike price, and a higher Delta, you could very well end up controlling and profiting from a higher portion of the stock, then you have by holding these common shares. However what you propose in your post here of a strike price of $125 or $130, is to risky for my taste.\n\n1. Make profit and leverage less capital\nAdvantage Leaps.\nOkay. Go watch a video about Delta. The Delta of any option will tell you how much of the stock you are leveraging. For instance a Delta of one, .9 means you are leveraging 1:1 or .9:1 ..... This is just the same as owning the stock, when it comes to profits.\nThe advantage to buying leaps, is that sometimes you can buy the leaps *for less than it would cost you to own 100 shares of the common stock*\nSo you can see, if your Delta is something high, like .8 or .9 .... And you are paying less than you would for 100 shares of the stock... Then you are making the same amount of profit, but leveraging less capital.\n\n*However* \nBuying leaps that have a high Delta, is not the cheapest leaps. So yes you are at an advantage, because you are able to leverage the same amount of stock, and use less capital to do it. However it still takes capital.\n\n2. Use far less capital, by leaps with higher strike lower delta.\n*Advantage?... Meh*\nYou will achieve far less profit, as the stock rises. A lower Delta means that you are \"controlling\" a smaller equivalent percentage of 100 shares of the common stock.\n\n*Also* a leaps with a lower delta like this will often have a higher strike price. As in the example you gave in your post, OP, a strike price of $125 or $130 means you are left out in the cold if, at expiration, the stock you chose happens to be in a slight downturn. If that stock is at $100 or $120, you lose it all. Your leaps are worth nothing.\nTo risky for my taste.

{"title": "Tesla 2021 DD", "selftext": "Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA) has been really moving upwards from 2020 March, going up by over 743% and burning hedge funds with short positions on them. It had reached a high of 900 post split coming around a valuation of approx., 880B dollars and then has gone down by over 15% this year. They are aiming to deliver above 800,000 vehicles over the year 2021, and are expected to deliver around 170,000 vehicles this quarter. Extrapolate it and it gives the number of around 680,000 vehicles excluding Giga Austin and Giga Berlin which haven't been fully developed yet and will be starting production for May and July 2021 respectively.   \n\n\nAs per them going to India, there is serious competition from Hyundai, Volkswagen and Maruti Suzuki. India's roads aren't the best for self -driving because you can never see it but there are people who absolutely don't follow rules, and cattle and random animals just keep entering the street when you least expect it. So, self - driving software won't exactly be too much of help in India even if the Government changes the rule that currently prevents any self-driving tech on vehicles due to the less jobs in India. We also don't have the charging infrastructure to support the electric vehicles and also it being a luxury car, only the rich and prosperous can afford it since the people who can afford it are 1% of the working population of the country. This means that Tesla is going to be having a tough time in India and won't be able to sell more than 50-100 vehicles over the next few years.   \n\n\nAs for their fundamentals, their earnings has been down the last quarter with a 15% lower EBIT from the third quarter, and it looks like their third quarter is going to have the most sales this year too. As for the technicals TSLA could be caught in a bull-trap. The stock has been up a good 5% due to high expected deliveries but it is highly likely to underperform and get lesser sales than the expected 170,000 cars. The volumes have been significantly decreasing over the past year and there are strong resistance lines, also forming a bearish pennant pattern and has hit the resistance line 3 times as of yesterday in the daily time frame. There is a strong sign that Tesla might break out downwards over the next few weeks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssuming 90% of their sales this year is also going to be the Model 3/Y sales their average profit being around 15k USD per car their earnings are going to be around 11.34B dollars and 2.6B dollars for their Model X/S, accounting for total earnings of about 14B dollars, and at a P/E ratio of 14 they will be worth around 196B dollars if this is fulfilled only with respect to their automobile sector. In this DD I haven't taken the energy sector into consideration and I assume their energy sector to be around 50B dollars in worth, which results in a worth of around 250B$ and a price target of around 260$ a share. I am also slightly on the optimistic side for tesla where other investors like the Legend Michael Burry says it could go down to below 100$ and other analysts around the 150-180$ mark.

{"title": "Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)", "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

Wish is a baby, and if it follows the trajectory of marketplaces like Aliexpress, Amazon etc., people are gonna look back on this price like it was a joke.\n\nI'm also saying this as a merchant on the Wish marketplace making a substantial amount of money - they're making **BIG** changes to try and improve delivery times + quality assurance. For example, they recently launched 2 programs:\n\n1. **Wish Express** (like amazon prime)\n2. **Warehouses** \\- they are building warehouses in China to collect orders and ship them out first class to international customers. They're focusing HEAVILY on the US, but they also have a huge amount of buyers from low income areas like Brazil, Chile, Lithuania etc.\n3. They're pushing merchants to meet a **15 day shipping time** (and they're doing it via fines if you don't meet that threshold). This addresses one of the biggest complaints about Wish for US customers - slow shipping b/c most merchants are selling / dropshipping from China. Although other countries (brazil, chile etc.) don't complain about longer shipping times because they haven't been exposed to Amazon Prime like the West, this improves experience for US customers.\n\nThey've also gone on an engineering spree, revamping everything about the merchant backend. \n\nEven though they've gone down since IPO, I still think this is a great bet (I mainly say this as a seller). I put in a bunch in there and I expect it to go up.

{"title": "Spongebob vs. Hwang Gang and the Banks", "selftext": "**TL;DR**\nVIACA 4/16 $50c $60c and $70c\n\n\n**The Backdrop**\n\nYou have heard by now that Bill Hwang, who is so crooked he could piss around a corner, and his hedge fund Archegos blew up spectacularly by getting margin called from virtually every large bank on the Street. Goldman, Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and Deutche all got with their pants down. Goldman, MS, and Deutche hit the exits fast while the [others got caught holding the bag.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-morgan-limit-losses-with-fast-sale-of-archegos-assets-11617062028) Ever since the end of last week, everything in Archegos’ portfolio has been getting pulverized while the remaining banks scramble for liquidity. \n\nArchegos doesn’t show up in filings due to arrangements they have with the banks above, so it is hard to know exactly what Archegos was holding. Once people figure out a company in his portfolio, traders shorted the fuck out of those companies to put the pain on forced sellers. Discovery and Viacomm are two companies that was publicly outed and have been [stuffed in a box.] (https://www.thestreet.com/investing/viacomcbs-discovery-archegos-short-selling-stocks)\n\nDiscovery and Viacom both trade with multiple tickers because they have multiple share classes with different voting abilities. I don’t know why the fuck that’s a thing and it's stupid. For Discovery, $DISCB is the voting class, $DISCA is the common class. For Viacom, $VIACA is the voting class, $VIAC is the common class. If this were the SATs, $DISCB is to $DISCA what $VIACA is to $VIAC.\n\n$DISCB/$DISCA found their bottom last Friday. The volume is now slowing which could mean most of the panic selling probably is finished. Not to be caught offsides, short sellers likely covered $DISCA as the trade was basically over and that probably caused the recent relief rally. $DISCB, on the other hand, went apeshit for reasons. \n \nViacom’s selling pressure is still shitty, but getting much less shitty. The reason Viacom has been sadder for longer is probably because the banks above own a metric shit ton of shares and a large part of the total outstanding shares. MS + CS + Nomura + Goldman + Deutche = 20% of total shares (about 120 million). I am guessing there are still short sellers here since the trend is still downward. Viacom also announced a secondary offering at $85/sh that made people sad and may have started this whole Archegos mess to begin with. \n\n\n**The Trade**\n\nI don’t know and I don't care what the fuck happened with $DISCB, but I liked it and I want it. $VIACA has options ($DISCB does not)…so I bought $VIACA April 16 $60-$70 calls to pay homage and really committed to going full retard by buying MORE than my Personal Risk Tolerance. I also want to own enough voting class shares that I can make Patrick SpongeBob’s gimp while Cartman shits on a picture of Cramer’s face by the end of next week...but that’s a post for another sub. \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nVIACA 4/16 $50c $60c and $70c\n\nAMD 4/20 $25c\n\nMost options expire worthless and these probably will too.", "id": "mhp1fe", "created_utc": 1617257522.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "4/16 seems a little soon with a lot of sideways/average trade days recently...\n\nWhat the shit do I know though, that 60c looks tasty as hell.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I find it bullish that the stock started to find a bottom.
