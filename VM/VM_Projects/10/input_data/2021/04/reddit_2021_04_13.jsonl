On one side, you have FUBO stock bulls, who believe fuboTV is building this next-gen interactive betting and streaming platform for live sports.\n\nüì∑Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the other side, you have the FUBO stock short-sellers, who believe that fuboTV is just another commoditized streaming platform that is burning money on acquiring content with no real competitive advantage.\n\nBoth arguments have some merit.\n\nBut, over the past week, the scales have tilted in favor of the bull thesis, as fuboTV has taken some major steps to execute strongly on turning into a differentiated streaming platform with a compelling value prop.\n\nI believe fuboTV will continue to execute strongly over the next few months. As the company does, the bear thesis will drown out, and the bull thesis will come to life. fuboTV‚Äôs subscriber, revenue, and profit numbers will soar. So will FUBO stock.\n\nThe investment implication?\n\nIt‚Äôs time to buy ‚Äî and hold ‚Äî fuboTV stock for the long haul.\n\nHere‚Äôs a deeper look.\n\nFUBO Stock: The Long-Term Bull Thesis\n\nThe long-term bull thesis on FUBO stock is pretty simple, and it boils down to this: fuboTV is in the first inning of building a next-generation streaming platform where sports fans can interactively bet on micro-events in sporting games on a real-time basis.\n\nImagine this.\n\nFast forward to 2025. You and you friend are sitting on your couch, watching the Golden State Warriors basketball game through fuboTV on your smart TV. Stephen Curry gets fouled and goes to the free throw line. You and your friend take out your phones and open up the fuboTV app. You each place a $5 bet on the app that Curry will make the free throw. He does. You both win $5. And you two go back to watching the game until the next ‚Äúbettable‚Äù moment, at which point you pull out the fuboTV app again and place a micro-bet.\n\nThat‚Äôs the future.\n\nIt may not be fuboTV that builds that future. But someone will build that future. And the bull thesis on FUBO stock is that fuboTV will be the company that does build that future, because they are the first-mover in this space.\n\nBut‚Ä¶ a first-mover advantage is only good if the company executes on the opportunity.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs exactly what fuboTV management is starting to do: Execute on this huge opportunity of building an interactive sports-betting-and-streaming platform.\n\n[**LUKE LANGO: ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM STANDING OUTSIDE THE HQ OF MY #1 TECH STOCK TO BUY NOW‚Äù**](https://orders.investorplace.com/?cid=MKT516215&eid=MKT523583&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start)\n\nIt Starts With Content\n\nThe first step in building an all-in-one interactive sports betting-and-streaming platform is acquiring the rights to all sorts of sports content, preferably exclusive rights to develop a content moat. The second step is creating a digital sportsbook that integrates with that sports content.\n\nFuboTV is presently doing both ‚Äî and that‚Äôs great news for FUBO stock.\n\nOver the past two weeks, fuboTV has signed a deal with Marquee Sports Network to bring non-national Chicago Cubs baseball games to its streaming platform, and acquired the exclusive streaming rights to the Qatar World Cup 2022 qualifying matches. These two deals represent a strong continuation of fuboTV‚Äôs ability to build out an exclusive content moat with unique sporting events, including local sports and hard-to-watch international sports.\n\nLong-term, we suspect that fuboTV will be able to leverage its sports-first focus and scale to be able to win content partnerships with most local sports networks ‚Äî like Spectrum Sportsnet for Los Angeles Lakers games ‚Äî as well as most international sports organizations. Some, if not all, of these content partnerships will be exclusive, meaning that at scale, we see fuboTV as being the exclusive streaming home for everything-you-can watch sports.\n\nThis will, of course, make fuboTV a compelling streaming platform option for sports fans.\n\nIt Continues With the Betting\n\nAt the same time, fuboTV is aggressively acquiring the assets and rights necessary to launch a full-fledged digital sportsbook in 2021.\n\nThe company recently acquired sports betting and interactive gaming company, Vigtory. FuboTV expects to leverage the underlying betting technology at Vigtory to create a seamless betting experience for the fubo Sportsbook.\n\nThe company has also secured market access agreements for the fubo Sportsbook in Iowa, Indiana, and New Jersey, and both the NBA and MLB have made fuboTV an ‚Äúauthorized gaming operator‚Äù of their leagues.\n\nIn other words, fuboTV is doing everything it needs to be doing today to successfully launch an integrated digital sportsbooks in 2021, and subsequently scale that sportsbook in 2022-plus.\n\nAgain, this is great news for FUBO stock.\n\nHuge Upside Potential for fuboTV Stock\n\nIf fuboTV successfully executes on its vision, the potential upside in FUBO stock is enormous.\n\nHere are the numbers.\n\nThere are tens of millions of diehard sports fan in America. Against that backdrop, if fuboTV does become an integrated sports-betting-and-streaming platform with exclusive content rights, it will easily attract 10 million paid subscribers by 2030. Average revenue per subscriber per month should exceed $70, driven by a mix of subscription fees, ad revenues and betting commissions. That implies north of $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.\n\nI see EBITDA margins running toward 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.\n\nAssuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030. Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.\n\nBottom Line on FUBO Stock\n\nFuboTV has an uphill battle ahead of it. Building a dominant sports-betting-and-streaming platform will be hard. But if the company pulls it off ‚Äî and I suspect they can, given recent developments ‚Äî the potential upside in FUBO stock is enormous.\n\nThis is a good name to own as a speculative long-term investment.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not the best speculative long-term investment opportunity in the market today.\n\nYou see, the world is rapidly changing. Technology is changing everything about everything. Folks aligning their portfolios with this trend are positioning themselves to score huge returns during the Roaring Twenties.

(Went from 140 range in Feb to 126 in early March due to earnings not meeting expectations. Revenue was actually up in this time, but operating costs brought earnings down, likely due to extra operating costs from covid, this was from the bull post on reddit and it made sense)\n\nSo I picked an Out of the money (OTM) contract after the earnings release date that i could afford and had potential thinking it would rally back up to the 140 range before that and I could profit regardless if it hit 150 by June. (I couldn't exercise if I wanted to,  I dont have 15k to buy 100 walmart shares at that price, so i used optionprofitcalculator.com to map out my expected price by date to guesstimate if I could sell for a profit pre earnings)\n\n2 weeks ago there was a big jump (for a major blue chip like walmart) that was +3.00 in share price overnight. This increased volatility, driving my option up, AND brought it closer to my strike, further driving up the options value.\n\nI got greedy because there is a gap (price range that most share holders dont own shares at) between 141 and 143. Typically if a price has been rising and hits a 'gap' it will quickly move through this gap upwards (at least from what i have read)\n\nI thought my +50% would go to +70-90% when filling this gap and it was on the edge of the gap flirting with 141 when I was up. Instead it has traded sideways since then just below the gap for a week. \n\nThis dropped the volatility (IV) dropping price of the option, and I have 1 less week for share to get to strike (theta decay or time decay) also driving price down. \n\nNow the option is worth less than what I paid a month ago even though it is $7 closer to strike than what I originally bought it for.

On one side, you have FUBO stock bulls, who believe fuboTV is building this next-gen interactive betting and streaming platform for live sports.\n\nüì∑Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the other side, you have the FUBO stock short-sellers, who believe that fuboTV is just another commoditized streaming platform that is burning money on acquiring content with no real competitive advantage.\n\nBoth arguments have some merit.\n\nBut, over the past week, the scales have tilted in favor of the bull thesis, as fuboTV has taken some major steps to execute strongly on turning into a differentiated streaming platform with a compelling value prop.\n\nI believe fuboTV will continue to execute strongly over the next few months. As the company does, the bear thesis will drown out, and the bull thesis will come to life. fuboTV‚Äôs subscriber, revenue, and profit numbers will soar. So will FUBO stock.\n\nThe investment implication?\n\nIt‚Äôs time to buy ‚Äî and hold ‚Äî fuboTV stock for the long haul.\n\nHere‚Äôs a deeper look.\n\nFUBO Stock: The Long-Term Bull Thesis\n\nThe long-term bull thesis on FUBO stock is pretty simple, and it boils down to this: fuboTV is in the first inning of building a next-generation streaming platform where sports fans can interactively bet on micro-events in sporting games on a real-time basis.\n\nImagine this.\n\nFast forward to 2025. You and you friend are sitting on your couch, watching the Golden State Warriors basketball game through fuboTV on your smart TV. Stephen Curry gets fouled and goes to the free throw line. You and your friend take out your phones and open up the fuboTV app. You each place a $5 bet on the app that Curry will make the free throw. He does. You both win $5. And you two go back to watching the game until the next ‚Äúbettable‚Äù moment, at which point you pull out the fuboTV app again and place a micro-bet.\n\nThat‚Äôs the future.\n\nIt may not be fuboTV that builds that future. But someone will build that future. And the bull thesis on FUBO stock is that fuboTV will be the company that does build that future, because they are the first-mover in this space.\n\nBut‚Ä¶ a first-mover advantage is only good if the company executes on the opportunity.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs exactly what fuboTV management is starting to do: Execute on this huge opportunity of building an interactive sports-betting-and-streaming platform.\n\n[**LUKE LANGO: ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM STANDING OUTSIDE THE HQ OF MY #1 TECH STOCK TO BUY NOW‚Äù**](https://orders.investorplace.com/?cid=MKT516215&eid=MKT523583&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start)\n\nIt Starts With Content\n\nThe first step in building an all-in-one interactive sports betting-and-streaming platform is acquiring the rights to all sorts of sports content, preferably exclusive rights to develop a content moat. The second step is creating a digital sportsbook that integrates with that sports content.\n\nFuboTV is presently doing both ‚Äî and that‚Äôs great news for FUBO stock.\n\nOver the past two weeks, fuboTV has signed a deal with Marquee Sports Network to bring non-national Chicago Cubs baseball games to its streaming platform, and acquired the exclusive streaming rights to the Qatar World Cup 2022 qualifying matches. These two deals represent a strong continuation of fuboTV‚Äôs ability to build out an exclusive content moat with unique sporting events, including local sports and hard-to-watch international sports.\n\nLong-term, we suspect that fuboTV will be able to leverage its sports-first focus and scale to be able to win content partnerships with most local sports networks ‚Äî like Spectrum Sportsnet for Los Angeles Lakers games ‚Äî as well as most international sports organizations. Some, if not all, of these content partnerships will be exclusive, meaning that at scale, we see fuboTV as being the exclusive streaming home for everything-you-can watch sports.\n\nThis will, of course, make fuboTV a compelling streaming platform option for sports fans.\n\nIt Continues With the Betting\n\nAt the same time, fuboTV is aggressively acquiring the assets and rights necessary to launch a full-fledged digital sportsbook in 2021.\n\nThe company recently acquired sports betting and interactive gaming company, Vigtory. FuboTV expects to leverage the underlying betting technology at Vigtory to create a seamless betting experience for the fubo Sportsbook.\n\nThe company has also secured market access agreements for the fubo Sportsbook in Iowa, Indiana, and New Jersey, and both the NBA and MLB have made fuboTV an ‚Äúauthorized gaming operator‚Äù of their leagues.\n\nIn other words, fuboTV is doing everything it needs to be doing today to successfully launch an integrated digital sportsbooks in 2021, and subsequently scale that sportsbook in 2022-plus.\n\nAgain, this is great news for FUBO stock.\n\nHuge Upside Potential for fuboTV Stock\n\nIf fuboTV successfully executes on its vision, the potential upside in FUBO stock is enormous.\n\nHere are the numbers.\n\nThere are tens of millions of diehard sports fan in America. Against that backdrop, if fuboTV does become an integrated sports-betting-and-streaming platform with exclusive content rights, it will easily attract 10 million paid subscribers by 2030. Average revenue per subscriber per month should exceed $70, driven by a mix of subscription fees, ad revenues and betting commissions. That implies north of $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.\n\nI see EBITDA margins running toward 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.\n\nAssuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030. Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.\n\nBottom Line on FUBO Stock\n\nFuboTV has an uphill battle ahead of it. Building a dominant sports-betting-and-streaming platform will be hard. But if the company pulls it off ‚Äî and I suspect they can, given recent developments ‚Äî the potential upside in FUBO stock is enormous.\n\nThis is a good name to own as a speculative long-term investment.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not the best speculative long-term investment opportunity in the market today.\n\nYou see, the world is rapidly changing. Technology is changing everything about everything. Folks aligning their portfolios with this trend are positioning themselves to score huge returns during the Roaring Twenties.

{"title": "$URNM is the most risk asymmetric trade I've seen in my 4+ years of active trading", "selftext": "Uranium miners and nuclear as a whole have been covered more and more recently across multiple finance subreddits (for good reason), so I won't bore you with the details. In a nutshell, and most recently, the second largest producer of uranium in the world announced on Friday that they were reopening the largest uranium mine in the world, despite less than ideal Covid-related issues to do so. They are doing this **not** to flood the market with cheap pounds of uranium, **but** out of sheer necessity to fulfill their existing contractual obligations on long term contracts with utilities. This is, according to mining analysts, **the most bullish indicator that the uranium bull market has begun**. In an interview last month, veteran mining investor Rick Rule has said this exact move would be proof that the rally has begun \"in earnest\":\n\n*\"If you see Cameco restart Cigar Lake, then you will know that the game is on in earnest\"*\n\nThis was validated by an upgrade to $CCJ $CCO yesterday by Cantor Fitzgerald, from Hold to Buy, with boosted PT. \n\nOther uranium traders have echoed that this news is not only not bearish for the sector as a whole, but affirms the dire supply situation that the sector has:\n\n\n\"Cigar was always coming back (with estimates ranging from May - July). Timing a BIT strange given the recent COVID case at site and general negative virus headlines from Sask.  but perhaps CL workers have been given priority for vax?  **Doesn‚Äôt change S/D model much at all.**\"\n\nThe price of uranium will have to go up, because unlike silver, gold, or bitcoin, uranium has a real functional use in everyday society. If nuclear reactors shutdown, you get blackouts and/or massive increases in electricity cost. These are not an option, so existing reactors will pay whatever they have to to get the fuel they need. Because ultimately, nuclear fuel is such a small fraction of the cost of running a nuclear power plant, it's never going to be a dealbreaker to shut down the plant. They will pay whatever it takes. And uranium miners will be there to sell them pounds at 100+% markup.\n\nAll the evidence I need lies in the valuations. The combined market cap of the uranium sector was around $200bn in the last bull market peak. Today, it is around $20bn. Clearly, it must go higher. Compare that with a $2 trillion crypto market cap, $700 bn $TSLA market cap, $10 bn market cap of a certain video game retailer, or [insert unprofitable company still in R&D stage of questionable future tech that is somehow still >$5 bn]. Buyer beware, but I'll take the currently unloved commodity with a very hairy supply chain that is undersupplied, relatively difficult to acquire, in demand, and is about to sell for higher prices. \n\nAnd if you think you have missed out on big gains that have happened in the past 6 months, think again. In the above video, Rick Rule said this (in Feb 2021):\n*\"For investors, we haven't begun to see the fireworks that you look for in the uranium market\"*\n\nAnd I hope this post does not get into a debate about your personal opinions about nuclear power. But in case it does, here is the newest video from Kurzgesagt (YT science channel with 14.5M subs, released today) about why we cannot afford to abandon existing nuclear power and why it is beneficial in the long run to develop new nuclear technologies. \n\nIn short: \n\n * renewables cannot do it alone and the grid is not built for 100% renewables anyway; \n\n * the consequences of climate change are too severe and time sensitive, and fossil fuels replace nuclear when it is shutdown; and \n\n * nuclear provides opportunity for producing more than just electricity, but also hydrogen production, process heat (industrial emissions), and thermal propulsion (maritime shipping emissions), some things renewables cannot solve anyway.\n\n\nAlso the public's opinion on nuclear doesn't even really matter anymore. The most important countries (China, India, Russia, EU, UK, USA (advanced nuclear only), and certain very wealthy countries in the Middle East) have already committed to building more nuclear, so atoms for peace are here to stay.\n\nIn summary, this is a long term investment in a sector that has been unloved for far too long and is now suffering from massive undersupply AND growing demand. This massive undersupply was due to happen even before COVID shutdown several of the world's largest mines, so the situation is much worse now. \n\n**tl;dr give yourself exposure to the sector as a whole and buy the ETFs $URNM (more of a pureplay and my personal favorite) or $URA which will each *probably* experience 5x growth from now to the peak sometime in the next 2-4 years. Don't try to time it, just buy and hold, and don't sell until valuations make sense. (Cameco >$30bn market cap)**\n\nDisclaimer: my IRA is probably 75% uranium miners, so I am clearly bullish and not selling anytime soon.

{"title": "Thoughts on Applovin's IPO? ($APP)", "selftext": "Applovin, or $APP (How on earth are these guys the first one to get that ticker?) is being listed in two days. As you can guess from the name, Applovin is a mobile app technology company that specializes in gaming apps. The name is in fact, based off of Mclovin. APP has had notable customers/acquisitions such as Spotify, Machine Zone, Opentable, and Lion Studios.\n\n[The company is seeking a 30 billion dollar valuation](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/applovin-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-software-company-seeking-a-30-billion-valuation-11617836424), the mobile app market itself is 200 billion. apparently, [Applovin made 1.5 billion last year with a net loss of 145mill](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/applovin-files-for-ipo-says-2020-sales-reached-1point45-billion.html) (46% increase). Take note, this was largely due to quarantine. People were bored inside their homes and bought a lot of mobile games. I could not find anything on what they plan to do this year. On their prospectus, they claim acquisitions are a big part of their company, and on their blog there is a post about the future of mobile gaming and Virtual Reality, but thats not really saying much, especially with a shaky field such as VR. I am linking the prospectus at the bottom of the post.\n\n**PPS: $75 - $85**\n\n**Common Stock: 25,000,000**\n\n**Outstanding Shares: 360,000,000**\n\n**IPO Date: April 15th,** according to webull who sometimes get this stuff wrong, lol.\n\n# Pros:\n\n* Excellent company, has a lot under it's belt, acquired a lot of companies, and looks to gain more.\n* Promising growth. The game applications or mobile games are a huge part of application's revenue. They make more money than other apps. [25% of all applications are games. Thats 2x more than the next biggest group, business](https://mindsea.com/app-stats/)\n* Their run in 2020 was amazing.\n\n# Cons:\n\n* The mobile app industry is super competitive, and Applovin claiming they are worth 15% of the entire mobile app market is a little crazy.\n* Notable competitors are Zynga ($ZNGA) Unity ($U) Skillz ($SKLZ)\n* Last year's growth will not be replicated this year, even being stated on their prospectus.\n* Reliant on a 3rd party for distribution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I think I'll buy into this one. Mobile gaming is growing, and I believe other gaming companies (nintendo activision microsoft etc...) can see that as well. I also like Applovin acquiring more companies. I don't think I'll sacrifice a large chunk of my portfolio on this one, and I don't believe I'll hold it for long.
