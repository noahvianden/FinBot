It's above that now so you're going to get exercised and have your shares called away. You have two choices here. 1. You let the share go and you get your money back at 585. How much your profit is (on top of what you sold your CC for) is dependent on what your cost basis is for the TSLA shares in the first place (your average cost). I'm going to assume it's below 585, so you come away with a nice gain. Let's say your average cost for 100 tesla shares is 580, which means  you made 5 dollas per share x100 plus what you got for your CC.\n\nIn normal circumstances, this would just be one step of a wheel, no worries, you sell next week a CSP for 575 and if it hits it hits if it doesn't, whatever.\n\nBut you need to also assess how you feel about the actual underlying stock. I for one am long on tesla and believe in it's future, notwithstanding the current fuckabouts we (and the rest of the market) are experiencing. So in this case, 2. it may make more sense to 'roll it out', meaning to buy back the CC at a loss (but the shares are still yours), and immedately sell another CC for say next friday, or the friday after that at 600 or 605 or whatever. Ideally,  you want to be in a position where this will give you a net profit (eg buy back to close at $50 loss but you sell another CC for $60, giving you $10 profit, aka a net credit trade). The difficulty with this is that sometimes for you to end up with a net credit, you have to roll out for many weeks if not months, which then involves calculating opportunity costs for the capital you have tied up in it etc. So you need to study the options chain and see if you would come out on top, and what timeline you're looking at. If you can get out of this trade with a net credit in 2 weeks, that would be sick - you come out with net profit and you retain the shares. If it takes you 5 months to get a credit, then fuck it, take the cash and get assigned.\n\nOn the other hand, you might think that TSLA will trade sideways or go down, in which case, you just get assigned and sell lower CSPs at lower strikes, so maybe you can enter in TSLA at say 560 in couple weeks time. The only downside to this is that if you believe in TSLA and your average cost is 580 (carrying from previous example), and you want to get in at 560 via CSP but it no longer hits that SP, and keeps going up / trading sideways at 600, at which point you have to buy in at a loss, if you really believe in the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: typos", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ok let me know if this makes sense based on my calculations and what u said..\n\nClosing out the option out net me $448.

What you are doing is selling CCs and CSPs, not buying. For every seller, there is a buyer. You sell a CC contract to someone in exchange for a premium when you have 100 shares in your pocket (or on margin but we skip this for now). You hope contract expires worthless (or worth less than you sold it for like in your case) so you keep your shares and you keep some / all of the premium you received. Rinse and repeat. \n\nOr you sell a CSP contract to someone when you have the cash to buy 100 shares at the SP that you sold the contract at. Again you hope for contract to expire worthless so you just collect premium. Or if you want the shares, you're essentially dictating at what price you'd like the own the shares at. \n\nThese are theta plays because time decay is on your side and works for you since contracts decrease in value daily until expiry. Your max profit is already capped at the beginning of the trade because the best scenario is you keeping the entirety of the premium you received. \n\nWhen you buy a contract, you pay someone the premium for the legal right to exercise should the SP hit. You can see that this its so much cheaper to buy contracts (ie you don't need 100 shares of TSLA or its financial equivalent to play). That's because you're betting that the SP will hit at some point, and it doesn't, you just gave your money away for free. These are clearly very risky but the reward is technically limitless (shoutout to deepfuckingvalue) \n\nIt's much safer to sell contracts although the profits are lower than buying contracts.

This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.\n\nShould you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nTheir drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.\n\n**Ready for Primetime?**\n\nThey didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?\n\n**Sell themselves at any cost?**\n\nHell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.\n\n**Buyout Price**\n\nThis sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.\n\n**Sumiwho?**\n\nSumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.\n\n**Why buy now?**\n\nYa you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.

{"title": "Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  \n\nShould you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nTheir drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  \n\n**Ready for Primetime?**\n\nThey didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? \n\n**Sell themselves at any cost?**\n\nHell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.\n\n**Buyout Price**\n\nThis sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.\n\n**Sumiwho?**\n\nSumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.\n\n**Why buy now?**\n\nYa you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.

Thompson purchase 1.4M worth of share at about $282/share\n   * Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then\n\n# Industry Overview and Outlook\n\n* Low-interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt\n* Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs\n   * Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending\n* Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales\n   * Pandemic-drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006\n   * 5.6% increase YoY for homes sold\n   * Sales in January 2020 were 22% stronger than in December 2019\n* 51% of mortgage lenders are non-banks\n   * 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U.S are non-banks\n* Projected $73.7B in loan origination for 2022\n   * $35.6B from personal loans, $13.6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans, and $24.5B from refinancing student debt\n   * Approx. 79.3% growth since loan origination value of $41.4B from 2017\n* Pandemic-driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006\n\n# Investment Thesis I: Established Leader in the Marketplace\n\nLendingTree’s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison-shopping marketplaces.\n\n* **Speed:** easy-use; apply for loans in minutes and lock-in rates\n* **Convenience:** search and apply for quotes 24/7 from anywhere in the world\n* **Competitive Rates:** average buyer saves $125-$163 per month for interest\n   * LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of $80,211, $77,740 and $73,954 respectively\n   * Even in cities with  refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of $23,409\n\n# Investment Thesis II: Insurance Growth\n\n* The insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage\n   * Refer to chart ‘Segment Revenue’\n   * Insurance segment profit increased 16.5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage\n   * Expected revenue growth of 30% + compared to 2Q2020\n* Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products \n   * QuoteWizard – one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market\n      * This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category\n      * Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition \n   * ValuePenguin – personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards\n      * This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high-quality content and SEO capability – allowing them further scale in the insurance space\n* New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open-enrollment period in the 4Q2020\n   * Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment \n\n# Major Risks \n\n**Consumer Demand Risk –** a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree’s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position\n\n**Interest Rate Risk –** The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID-19. In the long-term, this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD. To combat this, the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts’ recommendations to BUY. Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of $320 (60.7% upside) and a low-price target of $200 (0.5% upside), I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services. Furthermore, I’ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY.\n\n**Originally posted** [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Utradea/comments/ni1mlk/easy_10_upside_on_lendingtree_tree_after_pt/) \n\n**Btw check out** [**Utradea**](https://utradea.com/) **for some investment ideas and insights!** \n\n**And remember to always do your own DD as well!**", "id": "ni1oem", "created_utc": 1621627862.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "This is way too r/investing for WSB, what do you want for apes to get wrinkles on their brains?
