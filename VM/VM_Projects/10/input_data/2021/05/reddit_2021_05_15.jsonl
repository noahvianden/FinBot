{"title": "BTC Tesla Tweet and Doge as an Elon Side Project", "selftext": "Well this didn't age well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Elon's recent tweet about Tesla not accepting Bitcoin payments is a good thing for both Tesla and Bitcoin. Doge is a side project of Elon's now, a strange and goofy foray into crypto, and is one that anyone can invest in. Do not forget the Boring Company was literally started as a joke, and the breadcrumbs are all there suggesting something big for Tesla, crypto, and Doge (or possibly some for of it) in the future.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOk, so I have figured out a way to frame the whole Tesla/BTC/Doge thing.\n\nWith regards to the tweet from Elon about BTC, I actually don't think it is that big of a deal for BTC or Tesla. I was never that excited about Tesla accepting BTC for payments in the first place, always just thought of it as a byproduct of adopting it as a treasury asset. The whole store of value vs. currency thing. So no big deal here. The Bitcoin community's backlash is mostly just overblown and the situation is mostly noise.\n\nThe way the tweet was delivered was also very weird. It was strangely formal for Elon, and also text as an image, which he never does. Using \"we\" etc. This makes me think it was a statement from the board. This would make sense given the tweet's stance on using coal for BTC mining.\n\nI think this shows a woeful misunderstanding of the energy use of BTC for mining and \"kwh per transaction\" which is a stat that will only continue to look worse no matter what because BTC can only handle 7 transactions per second and the energy use will only go up over time. I think this is meant to be one of the most formal PR statements Tesla has done recently, to look good for their application to the EPA's renewable credit market. I think it highly likely that Elon understands Bitcoin and its energy use, and even still sees any of that energy being coal as bad and worthy of a stance. Also, he explicitly said they were not selling. **Overall, I think this was a great move for both Tesla and Bitcoin.**\n\nThis brings me to Doge. I have gone through a bit of a ride on this one, although probably not nearly as dramatic as some of you. I originally thought it was hilarious and trollish and I didn't see it as that big of a deal to crypto or Tesla. Over time I did become quite annoyed by Elon's persistence, but never took it seriously and certainly never had any FOMO. During \"The Dogefather\" I felt quite vindicated when Elon called it a hustle and it dipped hard. I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nWhen he came out with this tweet bashing Bitcoin, and then following up saying he was working with Doge developers, I felt figuratively slapped. However, with realizing the tweet was actually a good thing for both BTC and Tesla, I gained a new perspective on Doge.\n\nThere are few projects of Elon's that we actually get to invest in. Tesla is the only one for a lot of people, and even that can be difficult for some people. How many here wish they could invest in Neuralink and Boring, not to mention SpaceX? Well, now Elon has said multiple times that he is working on Doge. It looks like another side project for him. Obviously it is still a bit of a joke, but The Boring Company was literally started as a joke. Now Elon is talking about sending Doge to the literal moon. He has sent a literal Tesla into a heliocentric orbit. This is all totally in character and may actually lead to something brilliant. This is another one of Elon's small side projects that literally anyone can invest in. I won't be putting in much, but probably bringing up my current position of 2,200 Doge to something like 10k. I look at this as a very contemporary, interactive, cyberpunk kind of entertainment, with gambling involved. To the moon.\n\nAnyway, this was nice to type out, mostly for my own thoughts.

Something like energyweb.\n\nThey are already integrating their energy products so that the flow can be better controlled. You can no longer buy solar without powerwall and Tesla's own inverter, and vice versa. Decentralized energy generation and virtual power plants has always been the goal. For a few years they have been testing the autobidder that automatically sells the energy from your powerwall into the grid based on price and demand. Transactions would simply be done on a token that has a constant value per kWh, and the value of the token (in USD, btc or chickens) depends on energy demand.\n\nBy the same time that Tesla got into crypto they also mentioned opening up the supercharger network. I.e., yes, you can charge your VW here, as long as you pay in Teslacoin. This ensures that tesla does not have to indirectly consume coal to provide electricity to the increased demand on their network.\n\nAs for mining, they have a huge network of computers on wheels, constantly online, and sitting idle most of the time, if not a in-house cluster.\n\nCould they do this on top of ethereum? Maybe. But why bother. Maybe it will be a fork [on the road]. They have the more than enough engineering prowess to make their own Blockchain from scratch, instead of waiting for Ethereum 2.0 or Cardano to prove itself. Instant adoption of Teslacoin is implicit by those who own Tesla products. And for Tesla, decentralization is not a requirement, as long as in Musk we Trust. \n\nThen why crypto and not just some credit in the Tesla app? The only reason why they would adopt ETH/whatever is if Elon is actually a good guy that cares about decentralization and intends it to be a free market where other energy producers can participate, which is actually in line with the company's mission. \n\nDemand for Teslacoin incentivizes green energy production, even if coal is cheaper per USD, instead of relying on a carbon tax to tip the scale.\n\nWhat's the point of BTC in all of this?

These vehicles use the AMD Navi 23 chip. Navi is used in many E-T-H mining cards - these could obviously be used for others as well. You could plug in your Tesla, and you could mine while the vehicle is parked. It would transmit over airwave back to DOJO. Also note the power wall implications. Tesla would charge for this in some way while also utilizing their own facility for mining in some \"responsible\" way.\n\nMining would be another profit generator for Tesla.
