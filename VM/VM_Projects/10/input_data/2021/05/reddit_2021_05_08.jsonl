The Index includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq based on market cap.\n\nQQQ is the most direct way to “invest” into the Nasdaq-100 index as it tracks it and is passively managed. It is heavily based on technology. This seems like it can be a con as it is “less diverse” or a pro if you are bullish in tech.\n\n**Top 10 Allocation: (**[**https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html**](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html)**)**\n\n**AAPL: 10.95%**\n\n**MSFT: 9.50%**\n\n**AMZN: 8.32%**\n\n**TSLA: 4.24%**\n\n**FB: 3.78%**\n\n**GOOG: 3.62%**\n\n**GOOGL: 3.31%**\n\n**NVDA: 2.69%**\n\n**PYPL: 2.31%**\n\n**INTC: 2.11%**\n\n**48.11% of total stocks are in the information technology sector.**\n\n[https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html)\n\nIt consistently outperforms it’s common comparison being the S&P 500 Index.\n\nA 10,000 dollar investment in QQQ on March 31st 2011 would become 61,493 dollars today, compared to 36,756 dollars from the S&P 500 index.\n\nQQQ is considered a riskier ETF than the S&P because of how technology based it is, meaning more of a capital gains ETF where S&P involves more mature companies.\n\nMany people worry about a crash similar to the dot come crash where it took several years for QQQ to recover. If a crash like this happened, is that not a market wide thing? I don’t see why QQQ would be affected any worse than other stocks that crash.\n\nPersonally, I am looking to put extra monthly income in ETFs such as, ARKK, ARKG, VTI, and VXUS along with QQQ and see what that gets me in the next 3-5 years. I just don’t know at what % to balance each to have a well diversified portfolio. I would like to have QQQ be the largest percentage among these, is there a reason why that is a bad idea? Are there risks involved with QQQ that I have not found? Is now a bad time to get into ETFs and QQQ specifically?
