{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021", "selftext": "Goooooood Sunday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021.\n\n# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.\n*****\n> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.\n*****\n> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”\n*****\n> # Big jobs report\n> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.\n*****\n> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.\n*****\n> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.\n*****\n> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.\n*****\n> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.\n*****\n> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.\n*****\n> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.\n*****\n> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.\n*****\n> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.\n*****\n> # Earnings soar\n> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.\n*****\n> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.\n*****\n> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)\n*****\n> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.\n*****\n> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.\n*****\n> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.\n*****\n> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9wZQvOO.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kGnKjBS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xazpmUE.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ceFPlXO.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/N8zkbCl.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EXJdhi8.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3EftWo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OA6dm0N.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UOEq2t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hdAqJr1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IEzICwV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/9nsqXUH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays\n\n> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.\n\n> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.\n\n> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c1485a3ca7e34234ba1f7666450bc23/abec686095f47da5-c9/s400x600/90a50e5d1712125c12d3f5af1efad8228681daa0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October\n\n> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).\n\n> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad49ec327ff1b942a31c993f0a0a82fe/79778de7b3df0abd-1c/s500x750/865ae39798a9e1d8450988b067a15e5a90a7c5bc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Here Comes Sell In May\n\n> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost\n\n> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”\n\n> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-4.30.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021\n\n> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”\n\n> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.\n\n> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.\n\n> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.\n\n*****\n\n> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?\n\n> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.\n\n> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.\n\n> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28.-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Wild Data Close To Q1\n\n> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.\n\n> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**\n\n> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as \"stimulus checks\" or even shorter: \"stimmies.\"\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**\n\n> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**\n\n> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**\n\n> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 30th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjA8Px0K-o))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.2.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aQ1EZJdcmc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$PFE** \n> * **$SQ** \n> * **$ROKU** \n> * **$PTON** \n> * **$GM** \n> * **$DKNG** \n> * **$MRNA** \n> * **$CVS** \n> * **$CRSR** \n> * **$RKT** \n> * **$SKLZ** \n> * **$ON** \n> * **$VIAC** \n> * **$ETSY** \n> * **$PENN** \n> * **$UBER** \n> * **$EL** \n> * **$EPD** \n> * **$TWLO** \n> * **$ATVI** \n> * **$TMUS** \n> * **$FSLY** \n> * **$MRO** \n> * **$GOLD** \n> * **$VSTO** \n> * **$SPWR** \n> * **$AMC** \n> * **$AYX** \n> * **$SPCE** \n> * **$FVRR** \n> * **$LPX** \n> * **$CHGG** \n> * **$NET** \n> * **$REGN** \n> * **$BYND** \n> * **$UAA** \n> * **$QRVO** \n> * **$CRNT** \n> * **$COP** \n> * **$RUN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/q8ttO0Q.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Cw16yIb.jpg))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> #

{"title": "$NVDA: Short-Term Bull Thesis Formulated Synergistically Using Perennially-Tested, Fundamental Trend-Analysis with Harmonic Analysis Based on Fibonacci Symmetry (\"Sacred Geometry\")", "selftext": "Welcome,\n\nIn this analysis, we'll illustrate and explain why we have become quite bullish $NVDA in the short-term using perennial, fundamental trend analysis & harmonics (based on Fibonacci symmetry) analysis synergistically. If you are reading this, we assume you have already witnessed and/or experienced the potentially powerful and remunerative effect of sound technical analysis; hence, if you have only studied classical trend analysis techniques with supportive volume flow analysis, you are in for a treat, because we potentiate the accuracy of these tools with harmonics.\n\nWe will begin with the classical, perennially-tested, fundamental trend analysis. $NVDA has been trading within a channel with the upper rail/resistance extending from Oct '18 and the lower rail/support from Apr '19, as can be viewed in Figure 1.\n\nFIGURE 1: https://imgur.com/a/b4KYX3i \n\nUpon rejection from the top rail/resistance in Sep '20, it entered into a bull flag formation; after a false breakdown from this flag & a test of the multi-year channel support in early Mar '21, it surged into a major rally & broke out of the flag mid-Apr '21. Next it was rejected from resistance extending from Sep '20 above the bull flag, causing it to retest the flag's upper rail (prior resistance) as support, which it did so successfully. All of this can be viewed in Figure 2 more clearly.\n\nFIGURE 2: https://imgur.com/a/a1JgUHT\n\nHenceforth, the fundamental trend analysis has allowed us to understand it's still in breakout region. Now let's thoroughly examine the short-term harmonic setups which may act as technical catalysts to fuel the breakout.\n\nOn the 45-min chart, our team has identified a bullish Gartley harmonic, which acts as the large framework--within the trend's context--of our short-term bull thesis; targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 3. Also note that the volume flow is still positive on this time frame, despite the recent sell-off; hence, such divergence in volume flow supports the bull thesis. \n\nFIGURE 3: https://imgur.com/a/KNiobVi\n\nOn the 15-min chart (Heiken Ashi candles), our team identified a bullish ABCD harmonic, which reinforces our short-term bull thesis; again, targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 4. Volume flow is also still largely positive/bullish, despite recent sell-off.\n\nFIGURE 4: https://imgur.com/a/yV5RIf8\n\nFinally, on the 5-min chart (Heiken Ashi candles), our team identified a bullish Deep Crab harmonic, which is why we believe it will show strength very early next week; again, targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 5. The volume flow is tilted towards reflecting selling, which is expected on this extremely short-term time-frame; however, the selling was not significant enough to be reflected on the previous 15-min and 45-min frames analyzed previously.\n\nFIGURE 5: https://imgur.com/a/Ucu4UCd\n\nTherefore, our short-term bull thesis is frameworked by the trend-analysis (i.e. trend-analysis demonstrates $NVDA's in breakout territory), and reinforced with confluently bullish harmonic internals on multiple timeframes--the ideal, golden setup for which outperforming traders exercise the most difficult element of trading: patience.\n\n\nDISCLOSURE: We do not currently hold any position in $NVDA; however, we will be looking to enter long early in the upcoming week (i.e. Mon morning) if the price remains above the invalidation levels and below the initial targets.

{"title": "Self Driving Cars and Tesla's FSD", "selftext": "Disclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into **perception-planning-control** blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD. Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 2010s). Now it is much better and probably partially \"solved\" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + HD maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people fighting over \"camera is the best\" and \"LiDAR is the dead end\", are still mostly talking about the perception part. As I mentioned, perception is \"partially solved\" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the \"leap of faith\" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the \"right\" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by \"right\". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:\n\n* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.\n* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years.\n* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be \"out of range\" data which the NNs have to extrapolate.\n* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.\n* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago.  There are also progresses of LiDAR in thick snow and fogs, check University Waterloo and MIT media lab's works.\n* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, suppose that Tesla successfully solved this perception problem using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next? We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the hardest part. What makes motion planning hard is the \"semantics of driving\", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents: the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even if the road can be unpaved and covered with leaves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe devil lies in busy urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive? How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc., but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the subtle social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties who may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the main reason behind the \"slow progress\" of Waymo since probably 2015-ish. You can find plenty videos of Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver on YT. They can operate in these scenarios, thought not elegantly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla barely touches this today, as you can find in some beta tester's video of FSD in SF.  It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are officially entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. By \"official\" I mean running their driverless cab services for public, but the tech has been tested in many more cities including SF, and they just did not advertise that. \n\n  \nBTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a \"MultiPath\" approach. Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.\n\nSo, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long: Adding the last \"9\" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  Currently FSD beta 8.2's disengagement data shows 10-20 miles per intervention or complete disengagement (again, from beta testers' own video). This metric for Waymo and Cruise last year is 29000 miles, a few orders of magnitude in difference.\n\nHowever, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales POV).\n\nTLDR: Robo-taxis is far, self driving is fun :)", "id": "n2v4ns", "created_utc": 1619914896.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "6 million cars accidents per year, 16,438 per day and 37,000 deaths per yer\n\nHumans are terrible drivers and these aren't hard numbers to beat...

{"title": "Does anybody else regret ever starting using margin?", "selftext": "I'm 38 years old and didn't realize I could borrow capital on my portfolio until June 2020.  But let me rewind a little bit.  I got into a car accident in 2018 and rather than using the insurance proceeds to buy a new car,  I took all of it and bought NFLX. Keep in mind I didn't invest actively before this at all really. I held NFLX for 12 months, then decided I wanted to buy a house so I essentially used the shares of NFLX for the downpayment.  Once I moved in, after a couple months I decided to go all in on one stock again.  This stock was AMZN at around 1600 a share.  I told my friends once this gets to 2100 I'm selling.  Well it did get to 2100 the beginning of 2020 so I sold and then decided that the next all in move would be ROKU.  Well we know what happened next.  Covid hit and my net worth decreased by 50%.  I didn't understand why ROKU was a bad stock to own during a pandemic, but didn't want to lock in a loss.  I couldn't buy any stocks because I had no free capital and didn't realize I could borrow capital on my ROKU shares.

TQQQ closed at $107.66](https://preview.redd.it/w6myrl1l2sw61.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd13fcfd951f7a4134a39fe1a255c00af8aa10f8)\n\nTaking a look at option pricing after the close on Friday shows that the **\\~3% OTM calls ($111)** have a **delta of 0.3129** and a **bid-ask spread of $1.11-$1.36 (theoretical value $1.24).**  Selling this $111 strike at 5 DTE yields approximately 1 share of TQQQ per contract per week.\n\n**The next two pictures just reiterate my point.**  (Skip them if you want, more info below...)\n\n[Selling this $111 strike at 5 DTE yields approximately 1 share of TQQQ per contract per week. ](https://preview.redd.it/d91m529h4sw61.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=20572120891a1990df05c8726e351c6f281761a4)\n\n**Zooming in at the 3% out of the money 5-day calls ...**\n\n[The bid-ask spread of $1.11-$1.36 is approximately 1 share of TQQQ at $107.66.](https://preview.redd.it/eu2tjvl75sw61.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=033a5ea836fec6be6ed8cd2c5084ac1e9f9715aa)\n\n**TQQQ has a 50.86% annualized return (overall).  Or just below 1% a week.**\n\nSo if we assume it is going to return an average of just under 1% a week (best case scenario), then 3% out of the money catches more of the upside and still gives you padding for the downside.\n\n[TQQQ has a 50.86&#37; annualized return \\(overall\\) because it has only been in existence since the start of this wild bull market.   That's wild \\(if you're in a bull market\\).](https://preview.redd.it/4avww7a36sw61.png?width=2653&format=png&auto=webp&s=3745900b1a90ce0eb3a8dcd0ca5809b633ec9af8)\n\nDisclaimer: I have no idea if this wild bull market will continue.  I have no idea what the next ten years will bring.  But I want to show you how the combination of this wild volatility + current market conditions can generate wild returns by **Theta farming**.  Like if r/dividends was to try to grasp this concept, I'd say **DRIP** on mega-steroids that even Arnold Schwarzenegger would be jealous of.\n\n**If you bought 100 shares of TQQQ right now (at $107.66/share) and theta farmed for a year, with the current conditions** (which I described above)**, you'd end up with $28,649.16** before Cinco de Mayo 2022\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nHoly shit.  That's like a 266% return.\n\nNow there's no way that actually happens, right?  Let's say that TQQQ has a negative annual return this year.  Some shit goes down and it ends up being -26% on the year.  Ouch?  Not really.  Surprisingly, your ending balance would be $13,953.71.  How?\n\nHere are my assumptions:\n\n* Every week you get another share of TQQQ.  Over a year, this is \\~50% growth if the ETF stays flat.\n* With all this volatility, the contract price stays about 1 share of TQQQ at 3% OTM (5 DTE).\n\nSo theta farming essentially becomes a return of **29%** (in the above scenario) DESPITE the horrible return the fund has had.  This works, whether it was a sudden drop or a slow decline.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\n**TLDR: Theta farming is using the premium from covered calls sold slightly OTM to buy additional shares of the underlying.  Over time, it's massively profitable.  It's anywhere from approximately 50% buffer to 200%+ annual returns.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I'm just excited about this ETF and the collar strategy in general.* *I'm long in $TQQQ. Not being paid to write about this.* *Past performance doesn't equal future success (except when job searching). Hit me where it hurts if this DD sucked.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor what it's worth...
