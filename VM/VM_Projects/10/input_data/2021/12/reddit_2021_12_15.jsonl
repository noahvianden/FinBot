{"title": "(12/15) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, December 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)\n\n*****\n> U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday‚Äôs highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.\n*****\n> Dow futures gained 8 points. S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.\n*****\n> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.\n*****\n> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúInvestors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,‚Äù Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee wrote in a note. ‚ÄúTapering is not the ‚Äòhawkish pivot‚Äô that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‚Äòbuy the event.‚Äô‚Äù\n*****\n> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.\n*****\n> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWhile the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,‚Äù said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,‚Äù Paulsen added. ‚ÄúSome of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.‚Äù\n*****\n> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.\n*****\n> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.75%.\n*****\n> The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.1% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.\n*****\n> Also hurting sentiment Tuesday was the hotter-than-expected inflation reading for November‚Äôs producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record. This was above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.\n*****\n> While the Fed meeting is in focus, investors are also monitoring the new Covid variant omicron. The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the new Covid-19 omicron variant is spreading faster than any previous strain, and is likely in most countries of the world.\n*****\n> November‚Äôs retail sales data is slated to release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, compared to October‚Äôs growth of 1.7%, according to the Commerce Department.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/9V5zoVL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2JZE6Tm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2JZE6Tm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BP9RZNE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rmVmGn7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/iF0hbEZ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/FwXIQ6E.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ADBE $FDX $HEXO $ACN $DRI $TTC $CLSK $JBL $WOR $ABM $LEN $PHX $WGO $NDSN $REGV $TCOM $ASPU $IRNT $REPX $BLZE $SCS $HEI $BLBD $SKIL $JILL $SEAC $MMMB $RICK $NX $TNP $CMTG $JOBS $CSBR $LVLU $EXFY)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jciUpQX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CLSK $ABM $TTC $ASPU $RICK $REVG $SEAC $SKIL $MMMB $LVLU)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/FtINEaX.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UX4oxNe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/wt1BIjw.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/OB1AifS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/nydSca7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SlYUj2k.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/KU1ifsS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/Dnnj5ro.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VSIb375.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1t2rUyl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BB\n* CLSK\n* ESSC\n* ADGI\n* BFRI\n* NUE\n* LOW\n* NILE\n* FSII\n* CCMP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-toyota-vir-biotechnology-eli-lilly-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Toyota (TM)** ‚Äì Toyota gained 2.2% in premarket trading, after announcing it would produce a record 800,000 vehicles in January.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Dec 15, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 15, 2021**\n\nThe stock market opened the day but reversed course and bounced today as investors digested the Federal Reserve‚Äôs final monetary policy decision of 2021 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs speech against a backdrop of persistent inflationary pressures. Bond yields rose up in the immediate aftermath of the Fed‚Äôs announcement, rising above 1.46%.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.56%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.28%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): 1.02%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.59%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.84%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.81%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.85%\n* UnitedHealth (UNH): +3.11%\n\nToday, the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed‚Äôs dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. \n\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to boost liquidity during a time of crisis and prevent a credit crunch. In November, the Fed started to taper the pace of those aggregate purchases by $15 billion per month, and will now double that pace to $30 billion per month.\n\nA statement by the Fed said, ‚ÄúIn light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.‚Äù\n\nThe new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.\n\nA quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).\n\nThe updated dot plots, which map out each of the FOMC members‚Äô projections for where rates will be in coming years, shows the median member of the committee projecting three rate hikes next year, another three in 2023, and another two in 2024. Link for dot-plot below\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf)\n\nThe Fed said, ‚ÄúSupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.‚Äù\n\nThe median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation, \n\nclocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed‚Äôs September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy)\n\nThe next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.\n\nArt Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at the National Securities Corporation said, ‚ÄúWhen you have an anticipation of higher interest rates, growth stocks or long-duration growth stocks certainly get hit the hardest. When you do that net present value calculation with a higher interest rate, that implied multiple or ascribed multiple to growth names comes in. So a lot of that's been priced in. When you think about some of those real ‚Äògrowth-y‚Äô names and momentum names and risk assets, they've seen a lot of carnage already.\"\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúWhat the market is trying to tell us here is that when you set your asset allocation plan for next year, you want to have a barbell approach with growth on one side ‚Äî you want to have those growth names that are actually valued at a multiple to earnings, not a multiple to revenues or a multiple to cash flows or a multiple to sales. We anticipate 2022 is going to be very much like 2021, where you really want to have a balance between growth and value.\"\n\nI broadly agree with this perspective, 2021 was a hard year for a lot of people who went too heavy into growth after an insane 2020. It‚Äôs always important to have a good mix between growth, value, and I‚Äôll add safe ETFs.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) jumped to a fresh record intraday high on Wednesday amid optimism over the company's COVID-19 pill, called Paxlovid. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the White House had ordered enough of the antiviral pills to treat 10 million Americans, and that he was \"encouraged by the promising data\" that the drug-maker released on the pill. Pfizer's data showed earlier this week that the drug decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for high-risk adults. \n* Amazon's web hosting platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced connectivity issues Wednesday morning, triggering outages at platforms from Zoom Video Communications to Amazon-owned Twitch and other online services. \n* Retail sales were up 0.3% in November compared to October, [the Commerce Department said on Wednesday](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf). This came in below the 0.8% monthly increase consensus economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. In October, retail sales rose 1.8%, which was upwardly revised from the 1.7% increase previously expected. \n* The office of the U.S. Trade Representative is concerned with Canada's announcement that it will continue to pursue a unilateral digital services tax, a USTR spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIf Canada adopts a DST, USTR would examine all options, including under our trade agreements and domestic statutes,‚Äù it said.\n* Food safety issues were found at over a dozen Starbucks outlets in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, regulators said on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. coffee chain was criticized for violations at two other outlets in another city.\n* The Digital Markets Act (DMA), unveiled by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last December, sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations, a global first.", "id": "rhb8ge", "created_utc": 1639607306.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Anchorage Capital Group Just defaulted was one of the biggest hedge funds shorting AMC", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "do you post your summaries to r/investing?

S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.\n*****\n> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.\n*****\n> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúInvestors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,‚Äù Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee wrote in a note. ‚ÄúTapering is not the ‚Äòhawkish pivot‚Äô that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‚Äòbuy the event.‚Äô‚Äù\n*****\n> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.\n*****\n> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWhile the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,‚Äù said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,‚Äù Paulsen added. ‚ÄúSome of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.‚Äù\n*****\n> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.\n*****\n> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe.
