{"title": "Salesforce’s Mixed Earnings", "selftext": "Shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) fell 6.19% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the technology giant’s future outlook missed expectations, even though the most recent quarter was strong.\n\nFinancials: Salesforce reported earnings per share of $1.27 in the quarter and revenue reached $6.86 billion. Both numbers were better than expected.\n\nThe Future: The problem for Salesforce was its fourth-quarter guidance. The company expects to hit earnings per share between 72 cents and 73 cents. Analysts were expecting the company to exceed 80 cents.\n\nNew Boss: Salesforce announced Tuesday that Bret Taylor was promoted to Vice Chair of the Board and Co-CEO of Salesforce.

{"title": "Here is a Market for today Wednesday, Dec 1, 2021", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 1, 2021**\n\nWhipsaw session today in the market. After opening higher in the morning stocks slid steeply downwards as market participants digested new remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and new concerns surrounding the coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant, with the US detecting its first case in California earlier today. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.10%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.7%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.29%\n* Meta (FB): -4.27%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -4.35%\n* SPY Airline ETF: -3.27%\n* VIX: +3.77%\n* Alibaba (BABA): -4.10%\n\nAt around 1 p.m. ET, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that it identified the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus Omicron variant in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters the person was a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing “mild symptoms.” On November 26, [President Biden’s administration announced it was instituting a travel ban on South Africa ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/)and other African nations in an effort to curb the spread. The US now joins about two dozen countries that have detected the coronavirus Omicron virus. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa on November 24.\n\nvaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. \n\nHe said, “There is no world, I think, where \\[the effectiveness\\] is the same level we had with \\[the\\] Delta \\[variant\\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.\n\nJ. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, ““We tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”\n\nMoreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. \n\nCharlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.\" \n\n\"Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.\" -Ralph Waldo Emerson", "id": "r6ry4d", "created_utc": 1638399732.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "E-Ticket rides for all my friends.

My strategy was to invest for 2-3 years and then buy a house using my gains. I learnt a lot the last year about stocks and strategies. \n\nWhether or not that I made any money was irrelevant.

{"title": "Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!", "selftext": "Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.\n\n>Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)\n\nEven professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.\n\n>This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)\n\nAdding to all of this, we can see that the [Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.](https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f)\n\nWhile it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \\[1\\].\n\nSo what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \\[2\\]\n\n**The Warning Signs**\n\nLet’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)\n\n**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**\n\nThe price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.\n\nThe current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).\n\nThe red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.\n\n**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**\n\n[1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3) While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.\n\n**Increasing use of leverage**\n\nThere are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.\n\n[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \\[3\\]\n\n[Research by Goldman Sachs](https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b) shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.\n\n**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**\n\nMore than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.\n\nSPACs \\[4\\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)\n\nThis is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!\n\n**Investor expectations**\n\nMore than the P/E ratio, **i**[nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.](https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8) The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.\n\nIf you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.\n\nNow that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,\n\n**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**\n\nThere are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.\n\n**Low-interest rates**\n\nThis is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the [historically low 0.25% that we have now](https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446). This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.\n\n**New Investors**\n\nIt’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. [But the data they put out during their IPO filing](https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0) shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.\n\n**401(k) and Index funds**\n\nAs I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.\n\nThe key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \\[5\\].\n\n**What’s the implication?**\n\nAs long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.\n\nBut, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.\n\nThe expected annual return by investors [above inflation is a whopping 17.5%](https://preview.redd.it/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97)(which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.\n\nEven if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.\n\nBasically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.\n\nIt makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!\n\nAs Peter Lynch quoted,\n\n>Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves\n\nUntil next week…\n\n**Footnotes and Existing Research**\n\n\\[1\\] The amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zero-commission trading model was staggering.

Over 80% of them rely on human work only with no automation, 15% us seom automation, while 5% are automated.**\n\n**There is a huge shortage of staff in the warehouse industry is US. The warehouse and transportation industry had a record 490,000 openings in July 2021, a gap that experts predicted will widen in coming months.**\n\n**All this 3 factors are creating a market that is screaming for help.**\n\n**How BGRY is helping ?**\n\nBGRY robots are making all kind of tasks from piking, sorting, packing or smart shelf replenish in regular retail shops. They have a flexible suit of solutions and AI based sofware that can replicate \"robot work experience\" and can import skills as needed. Walmart $WMT, Fedex $FDX, Target $TGT, Bells, Atos and others are starting to use their solutions.\n\n**Why BGRY is the main protagonist in this market?**\n\na.**Is the only pure play stock in warehouse logistics. The means faster access to capital generaying faster growth.**\n\nb. **Has the best list of customers that are switching to automatisation to keep up with the new realities: Walmart, Fedx, Target, Bells, Atos etc.**\n\n**c. Has one of the best teams to ride this wave with 2 names that you should remember:**\n\n**CEO Tom Wagner is the former CTO from IROBOT l**eading the tech efforts in the critical years of growth that made IRBT the company that is today (and also made some investors very happy).\n\n**Chief Scientist - Matt Mason - former director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon** where he supervised all the activities of the Robotics Institute and the National Robotics Engineering Consortium (NREC). Supervised R&D projects for Walmart, ABB, Kuka, etc., and US technology organizations such as the Army, DARPA, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.\n\n**d.** **The AI Entreprise Software is a much ore tasty cookie in all this mix. While selling robots is a good busines to be now, the AI cloud with integrated skils for robots will be a market of its own. BGRY as pioneer in this field is building right now years of robot training and skills ready to deploy anywhere in the world.**\n\n**Why BGRY is so cheap right now?**\n\n**Problem**: The sophistication of Berkshire Grey’s system means that right now only the big companies can access those technologies.\n\n**Solution**: While the workforce is getting more expensive and harder to find, warehouse robotics will be adopted by more and more companies while he pioneers in automatisation will speed up the transformation.\n\n**Problem**: BGRY orders are relatively small for the moment\n\n**Solution**: The industry is changing but the speed up has just started. The orders are increasing at an impressive speed and most of them as reccuring orders (like that 25 M order from a [36 M order in October 2021.](https://www.berkshiregrey.com/resources/press-release/berkshire-grey-secures-36-million-in-new-orders/) Last earnings has shown a revenue of $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $16.6 million or 750% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of $14.3 million or 317% from the second quarter of 2021.\n\n**Total backlog (as nov 2021) was 113M in total (de be delivered some in 2021 and some 2022), a 20+% increase from the last quarter only.**\n\nRevenue growth is set 99% CAGR and judging by the numbers recorded this year, this doesn't seem so difficult.\n\n**Problem:** BGRY is not profitable and an rate hike will make them pay more for the capital needed for growth.\n\n**Solution:** The brake even if projected for next year - pretty much when the interest rate hike is expected by the most howkish at the Fed. Also they had some 200M + in cash in NOv. 2021> So cash wise they are pretty much safe and able to grow.\n\n**Why not waiting until BGRY will prove itself and have meaningful EBITDA ?**\n\nThe initial valuation of 2B this summer was not that attractive as they had to show some numbers first. Now, after very promising earnings and new contracts ad partnerships, we have a 1.2B EV on the table.\n\nCurrent EV/E2025EBITDA gives us a 5.2 result. With a conservative 12 EV/EBITDA multiplier Berkshire Grey's EV would be \\~ 2.77B or $13.8/share, more than double from current price. \n\n**Brooks Automation, Inc. (BRKS)** an established robotics & automation company for example, a ev/ebitda over 100 right now.\n\nThe growth projected by BGRY didn't factor in 3 important cathlysts: The wage increase in many sectors (warehouses included), the staff shortage and the supply chain bottle necks. The market might speed up to automatisation a lot sooner than expected any spark can get BGRY for a rally.\n\nE-grocery and e-comerce has not slowed significantly during the re-opening and the growth trend is here to stay for years to come.\n\nFed gov has money and the political will to finance solutions for fixing the supply chain. Automation maight just be one of those solutions.\n\nAmazon already bought Kinva (2012) and Canvas (2019) robotic and automation companies. Amazon is a trend setter and big players outhere might just put a bid on the table for BGRY and the price will fly an never comeback.\n\nFinally - we might have noticed in the news that some countries are closing borders and there is a new spike in infectins across the globe. The winter ahead wil make all the cathalysts mentioned above even more critical. If the new variant(s) prove to be just as deadly as Delta, all e-grocery/e-commerce and robotics will see a renewed interest.\n\n**And you already know that $BGRY is riding a huge wave.**", "id": "r6nifb", "created_utc": 1638388483.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "I’m eyeing the warrants", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "yup and the calls are pretty cheap.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "thanks for heads up, I’ll take a look (", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for sharing!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "you are welcome :)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've been interested in this stock for quite some time, but I don't like the fact that they don't have any direct competition.

{"title": "Theta gang with far out long strangle to support - key to very low risk profits forever???", "selftext": "Long time lurker first time poster. In fact this is my first post on Reddit ever!\n\nNeed someone to help poke holes in my strategy. I'm buying a long dated (6mo DTE) strangle on QQQ. There's a bit of overlap on my Put and Call so there's a range of max loss, but max loss is less than the cost of the strangle. Then, because QQQ has so many expirations per week, I can sell closer to the money strangles (20 Delta) around the price of QQQ with the shortest DTE (never 0 DTE).\n\nI'm able to collect enough premium selling what are now PMCCs and PMCPs within a month period to probably cover 25% of the initial purchase price of the long dated strangle. At that point I can keep collecting short term premium against that long strangle.\n\nHere's what this looks like with trades I put on TODAY.\n\nBUY 1 Strangle - 385C/415P 17JUN21 @ $72.41 (max loss = premium - overlapping width of 30 = $42.41) \n\nSELL 1 Strangle - 404C/394P 03DEC21 @ $2.11\n\nSo how do I adjust this? If either my short term Call or Put is challenged, I roll it out and up/down until I can collect a bit more premium and give myself a wider strangle to be right. And again I have so much time to play with that I can roll it out a few days same strike or two weeks and 5 strikes.\n\nI hate to say this is guaranteed profit, but I don't get why it isn't. I always roll as soon as the short option is ATM. I'm guaranteed to make more premium than what I lose in premium if the stock doesn't move, and if the stock goes up or down then my long strangle will go up in additional to the premium. And as soon as I can collect $42.41 in short premium I have a completely free long dated strangle. I've also probably collected 50% profits on the trade, and I can exit the strangle and start a new one.\n\nSo my big question is, where is the enormous risk that I'm not seeing? HUGE market crash is the biggest risk I see, QQQ dropping 20% overnight, and my rollout and down on short puts can't keep up. But again the most I can lose is just over 50%. And who knows how much I've reduced my capital overlay selling premiums at that point. Please tell me why I'm being dumb. When something seems too good to be true, it is. But I just can't see why?

And then you can run bull or bear credit spreads on top of it with very little risk.

They are literally soaking up the float which is causing a share shortage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The problem and the hidden benefit!**\n\nthere is literally no buyers, They have been buying between 200-300k per day. average volume is about 1 million. if we assume there is an equal number of buyers and sellers then there is about 500k buyers and they are literally half of those. This might seem bad since no one else is buying aka it lacks publicity but this is a good thing since share lock is active and they cant sell until near the end of December meaning they are mandatory apes who have to diamond hand and as far as I can tell they keep buying more and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manipulation**\n\nThis stock has been downgraded multiple times under the premise of \"inflation\" which is pure lies since management has raised prices not once, but twice. they raised them once to fight inflation but it increased profit margin so much they raised them again.

Sales next year will include the rapid scaling of a higher value, high-volume PCIe Gen4 SSD controller.  \n>  \n>**Our customers have also provided us with purchase orders for the next year, and the order book today already exceeds $1.5 billion.** Our strong order book is a result of many years of hard work. No last minute opportunistic procurement audit of all the shelf parts by customers. We have been building our business pipeline for many years, leading to these purchase orders. Our OEM projects typically kick off one to three years before initial sales, depending on product capacity.  \n>  \n>**Already, our order book for next year is at least $1.5 billion, and our team is currently working to ensure we can deliver this. Next quarter, we will provide an update on our work. And at the start of next year, we will provide our official 2022 revenue guidance**.  \n>  \n>I will say, our client revenue will continue to grow. Although PCIe Gen3 next year growth rate will be modestly, but PCIe Gen will grow very strong to carry because we have a very large design share in PC OEM. We stated almost 50% higher by end of the next year so that we have eight different customer, five on NAND maker with our PCIe Gen4 controller and ramping next year. For eMMC+UFS, we also will grow very, very strongly. It also depends how many wafer we can secure.  \n>  \n>We say it's going not to grow for a certain level, **we guarantee is exceed the $1 billion of revenue next year**. But we think the backlog will continue to pile up by end of this year. But we'll continue to work very hard to secure more wafer, especially in mature technology because many eMMC are in 55, 40-nanometer and 28 meter, these mature technology wafer are in severe allocation from all foundry makers. So this is very critical, how fast we can porting, work with TSMC as well as other foundry that can grow overall the eMMC+UFS business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis guidance was confirmed on SIMO's [Q3 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/28/silicon-motion-technology-corporation-simo-q3-2021/):\n\n>In the third quarter, sales and earnings reached another quarterly company record. **Revenue grew 15% sequentially and over 100% year-over-year to $254 million**  \n>  \n>We expect this situation of demanding excess of supply to continue through next year since foundry capacity will likely only start improving in 2023. Our order book remains strong and continues to be well in excess of $1.5 billion for next year.  \n>  \n>**In the third quarter, we delivered $1 billion in revenue run rate a quarter ahead of when we had previously communicated and expect our revenue run rate to increase further in the fourth quarter** as we focus on managing our product mix, customer allocation and pricing. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022. **That is incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow ourselves next year toward our $1.5 billion order book.**  \n>  \n>I think based on the third quarter revenue and fourth quarter guidance, we are ready at a $1 billion sale revenue rate with our current wafer supply. We have already received foundry wafer allocation for 2022 as we state. **That's incremental to what we have this year, and we are confident we can grow our sales next year to around $1.5 billion.** We believe the demand will continue to exceed supply next year, but I think we definitely will continue to negotiate and discover TSMC to gain more wafer supply. Regarding the $1.5 billion backlog, I think we -- **our backlog remained very solid with the purchase order of 2022, continued to be well in excess of $1.5 billion**. Most of the backlog consists SSD and eMMC+UFS controller order \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:35. An OEM order is strong because our customers have been gaining share, and we have been gaining share of \\[Indecipherable\\] 23:41 as these customers. We believe we have secured about 50% of all PC OEM and PCIe Gen four socket for next year. But we have seen, however, some adjustment in our order book with the softening of order for channel market product and strengthening our product for OEM customer. For example, we are seeing demand for SSD by global PC OEM continue to strengthen, our current client SSD for retail market, especially in China, softening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI repeat: management guarantees that revenue will exceed $1B in 2022.\n\nNow what do the anal(ysts) think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Analyst Estimates**\n\n* Morgan Stanley research: price target of $78 with only $1B of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq7z1bccey281.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe6bf8cde6597ea7db096112c377fa7771dd3c3\n\n* Bank of America research: price target of $80 with only \\~$850M of revenue modelled in 2022 / 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia6skvysey281.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=f326906c0291c5bf0a9323ae7a3f7a1ecb52418b\n\nNeedham is the only analyst properly reflecting $1.5B of revenue in 2022.
