The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, while the Dow climbed about 352 points.\n*****\n> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.\n*****\n> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.\n*****\n> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.\n*****\n> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.\n*****\n> Stocks dipped in late November, in part because of the rise of the omicron variant of Covid-19, but have since rebounded as governments have largely shied away from reinstating lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.\n*****\n> Airline stocks did struggle on Monday, however, as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of flight cancelations around the Christmas holiday. Apple also announced that it was closing its New York City stores to customers due to the spike in Covid cases.\n*****\n> Stocks tend to rise in light trading during the final days of the year, often called the “Santa Claus rally.” However, many Wall Street pros predict relatively small gains for stocks in 2022 after two strong years.\n*****\n> “If you look around Wall Street, you see very tame expectations, and it’s probably a reflection that we’re probably pretty late in the cycle,” Jim Lacamp, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said on “Closing Bell.”\n*****\n> In addition to the S&P 500′s record close, the Dow is within 1% of its intraday all-time high, while the Nasdaq is about 2% below its high-water mark.\n*****\n> For the year, the S&P 500 is up 27.6% for the year and the Nasdaq is up 23.1%. The Dow is the laggard, up 18.6%.\n*****\n> It is a slow week overall for economic data, but investors will get a look at home prices on Tuesday when the October reading for the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is released before the bell.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7tOUXMY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nLKv6Cf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2JZE6Tm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/tcstxHH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8MxbgrN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/znfYWud.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/EdymJh0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0O8CWQ1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/GHBz8sB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/l7Zqyd6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UjPfKfr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BBIO\n* AMZN\n* NVAX\n* ARVL\n* DVAX\n* VUZI\n* MVST\n* SUSHI.X\n* CODX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/28/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-apple-vipshop-coinbase-and-others-.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Apple (AAPL)** – The company is once again approaching a $3 trillion market value, needing to reach $182.86 per share to achieve that milestone.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Dec 28, 2021. Please enjoy", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 28, 2021**\n\nAfter four positive sessions and a new record high yesterday, the S&P 500 (SPY) took a breather with tech stocks cooling down  in a very choppy trading session. Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. \n\n**Notable Numbers:** \n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.08%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%\n* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%\n* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\nFor context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December\n\n[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)\n\nIn light of Omicron’s lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\\\\n\nThe S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts’ expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007)\n\nThe rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.\n\nLooking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Fed’s reaction to such pressures.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.\n* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.\n* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.\n* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called “Paris World’, on Roblox (RBLX). While I’m a proponent of the metaverse, it’s not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. \n* For the first time since 2016, the S&P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterday’s close, the S&P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaq’s 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.\n* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UN’s space agency alleging China’s space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites\n* The new Spiderman movie ‘No Way Home’ has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 28, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 28, 2021**\n\nAfter four positive sessions and a new record high yesterday, the S&P 500 (SPY) took a breather with tech stocks cooling down  in a very choppy trading session. Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. \n\n**Notable Numbers:** \n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.08%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%\n* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%\n* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\nFor context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December\n\n[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)\n\nIn light of Omicron’s lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\\\\n\nThe S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts’ expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007)\n\nThe rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.\n\nLooking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Fed’s reaction to such pressures.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.\n* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.\n* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.\n* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called “Paris World’, on Roblox (RBLX). While I’m a proponent of the metaverse, it’s not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. \n* For the first time since 2016, the S&P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterday’s close, the S&P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaq’s 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.\n* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UN’s space agency alleging China’s space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites\n* The new Spiderman movie ‘No Way Home’ has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up.

I would say if you expect the stock to trade upwardly, it is delta that will make your short call unprofitable as opposed to IV. However, I see you are trying to sell a .52 delta call. Assuming that your long call is a delta of say 0.72, that leaves a net difference of 0.2: this means, even if the stock rallies in a wave of green, you get 0.2 profit per point increase in share price even past your short. \n\nIt’s not that bad an idea because some would like to have the short call there as a way to hedge your exposure. \n\nIf your short call gets ITM here is a workaround: you could roll both your long call and short up for credit. That way you lose nothing and it’s a generally a good idea to do so to save yourself from your long strike getting into too illiquid territory. \n\nMost important when dealing with a diagonal spread with some sort of longer dated option like a LEAPs for instance is to always always protect your LEAP, because that’s where your capital is. I remember holding a NET 150 LEAP on the run up to its most recent earnings and selling a 200 call against it, thinking it would never get there. Day after day I regretted my decision. In fact, I tried to do a “rug pull” a week before the earnings report by selling my LEAPs : I profited bigly from this already, I think already 20% of profits in a matter of a week, leaving my short call naked. I wasn’t too worried because I knew I can defend the short call over the earnings report by selling puts against it and then letting it die out from the dip. This trade really hurt my NLV and I was stuck in it for longer than I wanted to, but in hindsight, I would still have made the same decisions as I had. \n\nLong story short earnings can be a tricky business.

To diversify looking at the following sectors and sector etfs:\n\n* Banks: XLF, KRE\n* Bonds: AGG, BND, TLT\n* Real Estate: VNQ, ITB\n* Retail: XRT\n* Consumer staples: XLP\n* Oil: XOP, USO\n* Energy: XLE\n* Nat Gas: UNG\n* Utilities: XLU\n* Europe: SPEU, FXE\n* Japan: EWJ\n* Gold: GLD, GDX\n* Brazil: EWZ\n\netc...\n\nMy questions are\n\n1. Is it worth doing this in the first place or just accept higher volatility will be required for bigger returns in the long run? is it better to just focus on trading things you wouldn't mind owning or at least rolling a put on for a while? I've also heard that in a true market crash everything becomes correlated anyway.\n2. If it is worth doing, how do you trade these in a theta account given their IV and premiums are pretty weak? Some of these feel okay for selling puts or strangles (EWZ, GDX, EWJ, KRE) but others have non existent premiums. For example, wanted to grab some real estate exposure and VNQ has been floating around 50% IV rank but the Feb 110/105 put credit spread with 66% PoP only goes for $.76. Feb 18 puts on many of these etfs go for $50-100 for $5,000-10,000 in risk. Sure the capital requirement for naked options are only 1/5th to 1/10th of the max risk b/c these are safer etfs but 5-10x leverage and needing to sell options at or close to the money doesn't feel great when the goal is de-risking.\n\nThe premium just isn't that compelling which makes me wonder what the optimal way is to trade these.
