As more information comes into the market, they adjust that extrinsic value down which will give your long call a drag- you can see this increasing the negative theta too. You basically are saying when you place that trade you think the price of the underlying will be at least 177.51 at expiration. \n\nConsider elite directional traders are right 30% of the time.

This makes it easy to write some R or Python externally but not have to fight with downloading data and unstructured garbage (it's done that for you already!)\n\nI have attached a few screenshots to go with this post but as of right now the feature set it has, which I use daily, is the following:\n\n* Newsfeed ingestion\n   * Pulls down all content from the web and then presents it in textual form by extracting content using NLP\n   * Extracts ticker symbols (using a combination of fuzzy matching and straight matches ‚Äî i.e will treat ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù and ‚ÄúMSFT‚Äù in any given article as mapping to MSFT)\n   * PDF reader for PDF data (like SEC filings)\n   * Google, Yahoo, Tiingo\\*, Nasdaq News, SEC feeds\n   * Can also ingest arbitrary RSS feeds\n* Options scanner\n   * Filter based on a variety of criteria such as DTE, greeks, and return on capital\n* PnL modeling\n* Social data feeds\n   * Reddit post crawling, along with symbol extraction\n   * Social trend visualizations / analysis\n   * See the most talked about symbols in various subreddits\n   * See trends over time\n* Equity research\n   * Fundamentals\n   * Quarterly report data\n   * Pre-filtered news and social views\n* Treasury data\n   * Yield curves (current and historical)\n   * Yields over time\n* NASDAQ database charting\n   * Full-text search of datasets available\n   * Chart one or more dataset for comparison\n   * Able to support subscription datasets but currently only pulls free ones\n* Earnings calendar\n* Basic watchlist\n\nIf you have stuck it out this far, thanks! I am not quite ready for people to use it, hopefully in the next week or so, and I would love to have some willing beta testers - I will gladly give free licenses to people who help out. The app is, by design, multi-platform so it will run on macOS (x86 and M1), Windows and Linux, so anyone should be able to run it. \n\nPlanned future features that exist in a rough form but are not ready for people to use:\n\n* Forex market data / news / etc.\n* Crypto market bits\n* Backtesting / strategy building\n* Custom charting scripts for creating strategies\n* Additional third-party data sources\n* Custom dashboards and research views\n* More social feeds (Twitter at a minimum)\n* Built-in predictive models using ML (it already has some of this, namely HMM prediction, but I have been experimenting with news / market correlation and other things which would likely make their way in here.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk6ius5l48481.png?width=3248&format=png&auto=webp&s=20192bfa43f66fc603140003342afa6f78aab516\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmzju0sm48481.png?width=3258&format=png&auto=webp&s=139cfc02e48669745ff0195a60be9585a21efb9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vw61a6n48481.png?width=3246&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa48d827b37f9314c0214c785991849336f71d30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veh3uy6o48481.png?width=3244&format=png&auto=webp&s=951859d38bf7898c8f2980a231bfce54593c0c90\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drcl70wo48481.png?width=3250&format=png&auto=webp&s=52f8ac0922703de2cc511bd73d0486b9bc6cce68\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucy4vf7q48481.png?width=3252&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e046d1b19850e377de45885cba6bc26e7b04119\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr0yiqft48481.png?width=3266&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a15470a50983a5472431366c71c3e613ec447d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kobk19xt48481.png?width=3268&format=png&auto=webp&s=5af0bad90999fa23b7b627b91d3b26cdc99c001d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7eey8gvu48481.png?width=3270&format=png&auto=webp&s=cda6a8b6311cef86a992e8a87155a293664f2ed9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc5qafd258481.png?width=3256&format=png&auto=webp&s=374949dffbb54924a1b651d06627963f69196855", "id": "rbflir", "created_utc": 1638928608.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "This is amazing work.

You‚Äôd get mobile for free even if you don‚Äôt optimize for it. There‚Äôs also search engine discoverability.\n\n(2) Also curious what was the itch that needed scratching for you to make this? Your older post mentioned it‚Äôs options analysis but it seems like the scope has expanded?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks! Good questions - so the core is separate from the UI portion intentionally, in case building a web app turned out to be a better choice (or even as a parallel thing) - I don't care much for web development but I'm also pragmatic enough to know it's a possible outcome. For me there are a few reasons - (cue small-sized nerd soapbox)\n\n1. I want to have the data available offline and available on my machine in a structured way that is predictable and consistent (and I think other people would like this as well); I find that I do a lot of experimentation in R, Python or Scala worksheets and while it's entirely feasible (and easy) to ingest data in non-typesafe languages, you inevitably end up with a bunch of data that you need to keep looking at to remember exactly which data came from which provider because it's a bunch of dataframe columns with random strings which is just painful so my workflow is basically this: find a data set -> write some Scala / JVM code to ingest the data into the database -> fiddle with it using R / python -> write something in the app that is reproducible for me later. \n\n2. I am probably old and curmudgeonly but I remember a time when you would buy a piece of software and then, you know... you owned it. This is neither here nor there but I loathe the subscription model (and I know lots of others do too, like with Adobe's CC offerings, for example). Plus, as a personal engineering aside, I really don't like dealing with JavaScript and the tire-fire of an ecosystem that it comes with so for my own personal use I find writing a desktop app to be more predictable and easier in many ways than dealing with it. \n\n3. I have spent enough of my life working on services I have to manage and I am kind of tired of it (I spent a long time at Amazon and AWS) so unless there's a compelling reason, I would prefer to avoid running anything critical these days - I still cringe a little bit when I hear a pager :-) \n\nAll that said, part of why I am hoping to get feedback is exactly that -- if it turns out everyone says \"man I would totally pay for that if I could use it on the web\" then that's what I will do, but for now a desktop app suits me best!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate the reply.\n\nI agree the JS ecosystem is a dumpster fire, especially the new shiny stuff. That said you can still find success in using plain old HTML/CSS/JS looking at Optionistics [1] for example. Totally understand why you'd rather not do any hosting at this point though.\n\nNowadays people are used to renting software as opposed to owning it. Bad for customers, good for businesses (like you). Your app can justify it because I'm sure it'll need to be updated at some point to integrate with more data sources - would you give those out for free? Or pay-to-upgrade? Look at it this way, the finance guys are all about risk/reward so they'd be willing to throw $100/mo on a tool if it means they'll earn $1000 back.

Checkout TOS for how they do theirs. I don‚Äôt have it but from what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs good because you can setup your own mathematical criteria which is amazing. Like to do a custom math formula of for example delta / premium x open interest. (Nonsense formula). But that way people can do whatever they want. \n\n\nI would pay money to have access to that and for any stock and all strikes all expiry. I do that in excel (google) and it‚Äôs painstaking because I can‚Äôt scrape data for the Greeks directly. \n\n\n\nI‚Äôd really write out who your target customer is. Pros. Semi pros. Amateurs. Etc. what they are looking for and how you will deliver it. This will help you with marketing it later. \n\n\nOther random thoughts: \n\nLayering graphs on graphs. I‚Äôd like to be able to do things like see the jobs reports numbers layered over SPY. \n\n\nAlerts. Custom alerts. Price swings of xyz etc. webull alerts could be used as a basis for what types and kinds to offer. \n\n\nNews too horizontal again. Whole page needs a lot of UI work but I think you know that already. Just mentioning it as I look through. \n\n\nComparatives for company financials. So I can lookup company DICK and see it has whatever metrics.  So what. I need to first know who the competitors are which would be good to have, and then be able to compare it to direct competitors and then compare sporting goods stores as a whole to other types of stores like furniture stores, and then compare to retail stores as a whole. That would be valuable data. \n\n\nAll the stock screeners I can find aren‚Äôt very good. Either handicapped or limited or whatever. So that would be a good thing to have / add, and detail out. Allowing for custom calculated metrics would also be interesting. Like debt / gross margin or whatever. \n\n\n\nSocial trends. Sure but what sources. You‚Äôd have to include sources and saying which ones are picked up and how. If it‚Äôs just number of mentions then that‚Äôs misleading to me because TSLA will always be quite high and I‚Äôll miss GFD or whatever stock that‚Äôs hotly being talked about. \n\n\nI don‚Äôt know how, but trying to discern the quality of it is good too. If it‚Äôs just short squeeze sub spamming PROG that means nothing to me. \n\nBut instead if it‚Äôs Twitter organically not retweeting a ticker and lots of ordnance twits and reddits then that would be more powerful of an indicator to me. \n\n\nAdding it‚Äôs % gain up / down would be good as well. Also the options availability. \n\n\nSocial trends. Filter out CC and CSP and stuff like that which are acronyms. Don‚Äôt need WTF LOL either right. And again need to discern quality and sentiment not just number of mentions. Some other built services do that so you could explore those and see how to do the same. \n\n\nCheckout market chameleon for more of the in depth options screening stuff. Hot ops. Etc. \n\n\nA big aspect of hot stocks hot ops is volume which lots of services and screeners don‚Äôt do a good job of identifying. If a stock has a huge or unusual ops uptick I‚Äôd want to know.

While I firmly believe in the old UNIX philosophy of \"small tools you can string together\", the biggest problem for me has been twofold: first you end up spending a bunch of money on services that you have to keep paying, and second it makes it challenging at a minimum, sometimes downright impossible, to do any correlation between them because you don't have access to the raw data. This is also why I have been building a local app with data available, to make this kind of thing possible even if it's not built into the app itself just yet.\n\nI do have some ongoing work to better calculate quality of content - I am currently building some bits that do sentiment analysis and topic modeling of the content so I can decide if, to your point, it's a meaningful discussion or just a bunch of symbol spam, which also will help with identifying symbols / subjects / topics that are just noise vs. those which are meaningful. \n\nThe last point you bring up is a big part of why I'm now looking for feedback - I have thought that it may be better to break it into smaller, more focused applications, and either sell them separately (or license them separately, whichever) based on what folks are looking for.

{"title": "New to this sub, thoughts on CFD?", "selftext": "Hello, what are you guys' thoughts on CFD in general?\n\nI've been using a paper account selling CFD puts on the biggest techs right now (especially AAPL and MSFT) about 10% below the current price with a strike date 30 days out. I wish I could sell at a lower strike but the Brooker (plus500) simply doesn't offer it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoing this, every month, and selling about 10 to 20% of my capital has allowed me to 250% profit, and I'm set up for 300% profit by mid-December if the current trend continues.\n\nI also did it with a real account (2k) and managed to 50% profit in about 6 months, although admittedly I made a few mistakes by not following clearly defined rules and overextending myself.\n\nThe biggest risk of doing this is that, in the event of a sudden gap, there is a real chance of going into debt, possibly more than I can handle, which is why I've been lowering the positions' size almost every month to account for market swings (just this month I lost 900 bucks because I sold 325 puts on MSFT when it was at 330, which in retrospect was a big mistake since I could have sold 140 puts on AAPL was at 155, a more likely) but it's still a huge risk without the \"safety\" of selling regular puts on strong companies that allow you to wheel it in case of it going ITM. At the same time, since it can't be exercised, you could hold a losing trade till expiration and potentially recoup losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe biggest benefit is that you don't need huge capital to start making money. Even with the limited options provided by my broker (and if you know of other CFD Options that work in Europe that offer better options, I'd greatly appreciate it!), you can easily start with 2k and place 100 euros positions for a 50/98% profit depending on your parameters, which with real options could need upwards to 10 to 20k depending on the underlying, also selling far OTM Puts in the last few days is really profitable, the aforementioned 140AAPL Put is worth about 0.08 right now, and I sold a few more on it yesterday expecting a 0.04 price by next Wednesday. A trade that uses Options needs 14000 for a 4 dollars profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I don't have enough capital to open an account on IB, the only broker I've found that works in Europe and allows for trading US stocks,  then my objective is to use CFD aggressively like I've been doing now, try to get enough capital to start selling options and then use that premium to sell CFD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe I understand how Options and CFD work well enough and given my capital if I want to play the Theta game, CFD seems to have the highest risk and highest rewards, which I'm fine with.\n\nI just want to hear your opinion, if you have sold CFD before, how far have you taken it or anything I might have missed, I'd greatly appreciate it!
