S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n> The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration’s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n> Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n> Dow component Boeing’s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n> “We remain cautious on S&P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,” said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy.\n*****\n> Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n> “Another risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell’s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‘transitory’ indicate that the Fed’s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n> During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n> “Investors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n> Wednesday’s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n> “We’ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “The next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,” he added.\n*****\n> On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The 2-10 spread is near its narrowest point of the year, with a particularly sharp move since the end of October. While there's obviously still a lot of inflation anxiety in the air, the market sees it as increasingly less likely that we'll be in some new, hotter-for-longer regime. Instead what we see is the market pricing in more hikes over the next couple of years (which makes sense, because that's what all the Fed messaging has been saying) and then not much beyond that.”\n\nHow can you come to the conclusion that the yield curve is pricing in rate hikes, or anything for that matter, when the fed is still acting as the buyer of last resort? The market must be distorted right?

They're sources of entertainment. Their job is to keep you watching. That's it.\n\nThe idea that \"we'll be in some new, hotter-for-longer regime\" was a stupid *narrative*. I've been saying that for a year; as long as the FED is buying, prices will be up, and *when the recovery is underway and the FED stops buying, we'll go back down*. And when does it go down? Between when we know the timing, and when it happens, it gets priced in. But lots of big players want the market to stay up until as near to the end of actual tapering as possible, for various reasons.\n\nIn late summer things went down just on people thinking they understand the recovery timing, separately from the FED actions, because stocks are being used as a safe haven. The fact that gold goes down with the market now, and Apple goes up when gold+market goes down, shows it. They've got the biggest pile of cash, so they're the safest port in a storm. Many stocks trading above their pre-pandemic trend lines are being used that way, to varying degrees, and that won't last forever. Only until the end of the storm is confidently forecast.\n\nThey don't use market analysis to decide what narratives to feed you. They do analysis of what they think you already believe. What are retail investors thinking? What dumb stuff does \"dumb money\" say? And then they say something that adds to that narrative, because you'll find it interesting. Who is Joe Wiesenthal?

{"title": "TDOC holder, trying to calm myself...", "selftext": "**Trying to wrap my mind around this: About a year ago, TDOC finalized the buying of Livongo for 18.3B. Now TDOC is worth around 15B.**\n\nI was \"forced\" into TDOC because of that, as my shares were transferred to TDOC. Was around 150% up in LVGO, but missed the merger date so was not able to sell my LVGO shares on time. TDOC then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ATH of 308 in February. Now trading around 92/93, that is a 70% decline in 8 months! I kept on buying the \"dips\" since February, now holding 455 shares at 149$, -35% down (-22.5K$)\n\nAmazing how things could change that much within a year!

We believe that the company's future will be driven by the inevitable adoption of virtual care delivery which will help to eliminate major healthcare resource constraints, especially for physician visits and chronic disease management. Remember that the Telehealth market in the US alone is estimated to be a quarter-trillion dollar opportunity at some point. With the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care, near-virtual office visits, virtual home health services, as well as tech-enabled home medication administration, Teladoc seems perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this market as it continues to build out its multitude of services. We believe Teladoc should be able to address up to 80% of the market opportunity with its services.***\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nArticle (without figures)\n\nIt is important to highlight that the telehealth market is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality perception, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. The global telehealth market was valued at 62.5 billion USD in 2020 and forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026. North America remains by far the largest market as the US market revenue crossed USD 36.6bn in 2020. The US market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.\n\nThere is no doubt that Teladoc will likely continue to grow its business at a significant pace, albeit at slower rates than during the heights of the pandemic. In our view the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable. At the same time, management's forecast for >$4bn in revenue by 2024 means the company will at least double its current revenues within 3 years which is a strong sign of confidence. We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a big difference between a broken company and a broken stock and being able to make returns in a selloff requires understanding the difference between the two. When the market or a particular sector suffers huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies that have taken an unfair beating at attractive prices. We believe Teladoc (TDOC) provides such an opportunity given its leadership position in a secular growth industry. When speaking about telehealth, the first company that actually comes to mind is Teladoc as it has pioneered the rise of the telehealth market to a large extent, which was further accelerated by the pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeladoc shares entered 2020 just above $80 per share. The share price shot higher amidst increased demand for virtual healthcare delivery as the pandemic hit the world. Shares reached an all-time high in the beginning of 2021 around $300. Since the end of February, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% YTD and around 60% since its all-time highs in February, compared to a 25% YTD gain for the S&P 500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. Teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance. Management also provided a longer-term outlook until 2024 at its most recent investor day calling for >$4bn in revenue, representing a CAGR between 25 to 30%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that seemingly isn't enough to please investors and reverse the downtrend. While the outlook anticipates strong sustained growth, the growth rate is far lower compared to last year. In our view, the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable in light of the re-opening of economies across the globe. Nevertheless, Teladoc's 2024 forecast means the company will continue its strong path of growth (albeit at slower rates) and will at least double its current revenues within 3 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors that may want to participate in this secular growth industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis article will look at Teladoc's most recent financial performance, outlook and will put things into context of the current state of telehealth globally. Let's start with the latter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Current State of Telehealth\n\nTelehealth is seeing a historically high consumer demand that keeps to be significantly higher than pre-Covid-pandemic levels. While telehealth was rather perceived as a commodity, the pandemic has shown that it became an essential part of our everyday lives. It has become a necessity, an important bridge to allow patients to continue to receive necessary care. Telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, e.g., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of Covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the basis of a recent study by McKinsey, Teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the US alone could represent up to $261 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. In 2020 the global telehealth market was valued at $62.45 billion and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026, and North America crossed $36.6 billion in annual spend. Analysts are expecting the US market to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of >$150 billion by 2026.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith this huge opportunity in mind, where do we stand today?\n\nOverall, there are 3 key enablers that determine the future market growth: 1) consumer demand and acceptance, 2) provider willingness and ability to offer telehealth on a more regular basis, and 3) regulatory changes supporting necessary access and reimbursement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of consumer demand, a McKinsey report showed that, in April 2020, right after the COVID pandemic hit the world, telehealth utilization was 78 times higher than in February 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that the pandemic is having less of an impact as vaccines have become widely available, and lockdown restrictions are being lifted, telehealth use is still at significantly higher levels than pre-pandemic. Telehealth utilization has now stabilized at levels 38X higher vs. pre-pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, more than 32% of office and outpatient visits were occurring via telehealth in April 2020. Now utilization levels have largely stabilized with up to 17% of all outpatient/office-based visits being delivered virtually or virtually-enabled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite the relatively higher overall utilization rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, there is still a high level of variation with respect to the point of care and specialties where telehealth is being provided, with mental health services and endocrinology being in the top 3 of service modalities as of February 2021. Similarly, perception of telehealth usage has continuously improved. Around half of the consumers intend to continue to use telehealth going forward, up from 11% prior to COVID-19. This is in line with what Teladoc reported during its most recent Investor Day Presentation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, there is still some concern, especially on the consumer side on the quality, safety and accessibility of the technology, the latter being especially true for elderly people. Telehealth care delivery models are likely to adapt to such barriers by means of extending their platform offerings from fully virtual care delivery to offering also hybrid virtual and technology enabled in-person care delivery to really break down such barriers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the provider side, McKinsey suggests that more than half (58%) of doctors view telehealth more favorably now than they did before the COVID pandemic. Looking at actual utilization, 84% of doctors are now offering virtual visits. It has become clear, however, that costs of care delivery and reimbursement regulations are important aspects to consider moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, from a regulatory standpoint, things have progressed in favor of making telehealth a permanent care delivery option, enabling access and reimbursement for a range of telehealth services. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have expanded coverage on reimbursable telehealth services in the 2021 physician fee schedule final rule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvestments in virtual healthcare have skyrocketed lately, with 3 times the level of venture investment in 2020 vs. 2017. Per Rock Health's H1 2021 digital health funding report 10 the total venture capital investment into the digital health space in the first half of 2021 totaled $14.6 billion, nearly twice the investment from 2019 ($7.7 billion).\n\n*Is Telehealth here to stay?*\n\nAs we continue to move out of the pandemic into a more normalized healthcare delivery environment, there is no doubt that telehealth will remain an important component of healthcare delivery, supported by improved customer and provider perceptions, regulatory improvements, and a broadening of access to and coverage of services. Further broad-based adoption will require that providers and regulators work closely together to address some of the still imminent barriers, especially integrating virtually enabled services into the day-to-day routine of clinicians to enable hybrid care models.\n\nOne last point to note is that telehealth still remains a highly fragmented industry. This creates two important necessities: first, there is a clear need for a better and more holistic value proposition by means of a whole-person care approach where services from multiple disciplines are integrated to provide the best customer experience. From an industry perspective, this means that consolidation is inevitable to achieve this necessary level of integration.\n\nThis brings us to the most important conclusion: telehealth will likely be a winner takes most industry and only a few relevant players will be able to scale their services and will take most of the market opportunity. McKinsey estimated that up to $250 billion in annual healthcare spend could be up for grab, with the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care ($35bn), near-virtual office visits ($39 bn), and virtual home health services ($35 bn), as well as an additional $12bn in tech-enabled home medication administration.\n\nWhat does it mean for Teladoc?\n\nWith the above in mind, it becomes obvious that Teladoc has positioned itself as the leader to capture the significant market opportunity in virtual care delivery as its services address almost every area of virtual care delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso in terms of its provider network, Teladoc is already operating at a significant scale with its network of more than 10 thousand care providers and more than 76 Mio members as of Q3 2021. And management sees a long runway of member growth ahead with currently 92 Mio people (\\~31% of insured lives in the U.S.) having access to a Teladoc product, and \\~63 Mio additional potential customers to grab from existing clients, managed care organizations and Medicare & Medicaid Fee-for-Service lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nManagement also believes that the opportunity across the 92 Mio individuals who currently have access to one of its services constitutes at least a $75bn annual revenue opportunity, with significant upside to $137bn if customers would opt for multi-product adoption across Teladoc's services portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is an illustration on how multi-product adoption by an employer with 10,000 customers may lead to 4.1x higher revenues vs. a single condition product adoption. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as medical conditions do not occur in isolation, and for example, 40% of Americans live with two or more chronic conditions (like diabetes and hypertension) in parallel and would benefit from an integrated care delivery approach. Teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd Teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its Primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. Management estimates that around 80% of the US population could benefit from one of its primary care services under the Primary360 platform, with the total addressable market for managing Diabetes and Hypertension alone representing a $47bn opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts ability to penetrate the increasing customer need for virtual care delivery solutions is also reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. For Q3 2021, Teladoc reported:\n\nRevenue growth of 81% YoY to $522 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $67.4 million, growing by 71% YoY.\n\nRevenue growth was driven by +99% YoY growth in access fees revenue and +18% YoY growth in visit fee revenue. Growth in the US came in at 89% vs. 17% growth for international geographies. The difference between US and international is partly historical but was also impacted by the acquisition of Livongo, which is only available to US customers at the moment.\n\nTotal visits for the quarter reached 3.9M at a 37% YoY growth rate, showing an acceleration from around 28% growth in the previous quarter, and driven by a 40% increase in US visits vs. 19% growth for international visits.\n\nU.S. Paid Members gained \\~2% YoY in Q3, which is a deceleration from the prior-year growth. However, it is good to see that Paid Members and PMPM (per member per month) fees are continuing to trend upwards in parallel as both are two important metrics that together will drive topline growth moving forward.\n\nMost importantly the percentage of chronic care members enrolled in more than one program has grown 3x year-over-year to 24% in the most recent quarter, while more than 40% of telehealth members have access to multiple products compared to less than 10% in 2017.\n\nLooking at profitability, net loss for Q3 more than doubled from the prior-year quarter to reach $84.3M. The lack of profitability is one of the most frequently raised concerns by investors and deserves a look under the surface. Net loss for Q3 was mainly driven by stock-based compensation (SBC), mostly in relation to the recent Livongo acquisition. Teladoc actually reported positive adjusted EBITDA when excluding SBC (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.\n\nThe impact from SBC on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect Teladoc to make significant steps towards GAAP profitability.\n\nIrrespective of this Teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8M.\n\nGoss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted EBITDA margins showed a slight decrease in Q3 vs. prior quarters.\n\nTeladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to \\~$2.0B analyst consensus, indicating a \\~85% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company also boosted its guidance for total visits to 14.5 to 14.7 Mio, implying 37% to 39% growth, up from the prior guidance of 13.5 to 14.0 Mio visits.\n\nDuring its investor day management also provided a longer-term outlook for 2024 and expects to generate in excess of $4bn in revenue in FY 2024, implying between 25-30% compounded annual revenue growth throughout 2024.\n\nIn our view, the 2024 forecast is quite impressive as it means the company will at least double its current FY 21 revenues within 3 years, at scale, which is a strong sign of confidence by management.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*So What?*\n\nNow, there are several concerns by investors that keep weighing on the stock despite strong continued growth. Most importantly, investors fear that Teladoc's growth rates cannot be sustained. This is a valid concern which is already visible in many of Teladoc's metrics, including:\n\nRevenue growth, where the growth rate declined to 81% in Q3 from 109% in Q2 2021. And while the revenue outlook for FY 2021 indicates a robust 85% growth rate (vs. 98% YoY growth in 2020), it's probably the 2022 outlook that surprised investors where management provided a preliminary outlook of $2.6bn in FY22 revenue, implying only 28-29% growth vs. FY 2021.\n\nThe growth deceleration is also visible in the customer metrics as U.S. Paid Members came in at \\~2% YoY growth, a deceleration from 41% growth for FY 2020, and 20% YoY growth in Q1 2021.\n\nThere are two additional concerns that weigh on the stock: one is the above-mentioned concern on profitability. On the surface, Teladoc's net loss during the past nine months increased roughly 4-fold compared to the first nine months of 2020 with current 9-month net loss of $(417.8) million compared to $(91.2) million for the first 9 months of 2020. However, as outlined above, most of this is driven by SBC in relation to the Livongo acquisition which should have a declining impact moving forward.\n\nLastly, there is competition, which is trying to eat away Teladoc's lunch. Competitors like Amwell (AMWL) continue to expand their services which could become a threat to Teladoc in the fight for market share. In addition, big players are also expanding their telehealth capabilities, e.g. insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) through its acquisition of MDLive, or Amazon (AMZN) who is significantly expanding its Amazon Care ambition. It's important to highlight again that the market is still very fragmented but only a few have achieved to operate at significant scale, including Teladoc. And Teladoc continues to expand its service offerings, including its recently launched mental health service myStrength Complete, which integrates capabilities to deliver comprehensive virtual mental care delivery, which were shown to have the highest penetration rates at the moment (see McKinsey data above).\n\nTeladoc is further expanding in the US but also internationally which is key to maintaining and build out its leadership position:\n\nIn Q3, Teladoc has signed new agreements with CVS Health and Centene to on Teladoc's Health's Primary360 platform.\n\nTeladoc was selected as a vendor by Canada Health Infoway for its whole-person care services, which serve approximately 60% of Canada's population.\n\nAnnounced a strategic partnership with Philips to deliver virtual healthcare solutions in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSigned an agreement with giant Latin American telecom company Telefonica, which expands the existing partnership to make Teladoc's services available to over 60 million people in Brazil.\n\nAnnounced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to integrate Teladoc's solo platform for health systems into Microsoft Teams to streamline clinician workflows into a unified experience.\n\nNot to forget, in midst of the pandemic Teladoc made a key strategic acquisition with Livongo, a leader in the virtual diabetes and chronic disease management space, which gave the company access to key technological properties that are now leveraged within other services, including the recently launched mental health service, myStrength Complete.

What if it gets bought out by some health care insurance company in a fire sale? This is the most important question because it will help you analyze whether the unrecognized losses you're looking at in TDOC are due to financial stress or ego.\n\n2. Why did you first buy TDOC? What was your investment thesis? What mktcap were they when you bought them and what is their mktcap now? What is your revenue projection and industry P/S or P/E ratios? You said you bought LVGO and it was acquired by TDOC. You said you were up on LVGO by 150%. LVGO closed Oct29'20 (last day of trading) at $140. If you were up 150%, that means you bought it a price of $60/share which was around May 2020. You missed the merger day in October, and then it ran up even higher in February. All this time, you didn't exit at all. Why? So from May 2020 --> February 2021 was 10 months. For 10 months you watched this stock go up, up, up, and not once did you decide to take some money off of the table, lock in gains or anything. Since February, TDOC has been on a slide. It has the double whammy of lowered revenues due to macro factors (ie. reopening) and lowered P/S multiplier based on the industry. That's whats cratering the stock price right now. \n\n3.

I had many other high risk growth companies I was invested in, and I realized I was too heavy in growth which caused my portfolio to suffer. I ended up dropping TDOC when I reanalyzed what I wanted to keep in my portfolio.\n\nCathie and ARKK really believe in TDOC.
