{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, December 27, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n*The following was written on the* *recap I wrote December 3**: ‚ÄúOn a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying. As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed‚Äôs change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.‚Äù* \n\n*During that time, there was so much fear-mongering and doomsaying going around on social media and even mainstream media. All those articles, understandably, caused a lot of panic, especially among newer retail investors. The stock market will always be dominated by cycles or rallies and pullbacks and always overreacts, to the upside and downside. The most important thing when playing the market is managing one‚Äôs emotions. Always stay calm, be flexible and be prepared to act if your thesis is proven wrong.  Do your own research and never pay attention to mainstream financial media like CNBC.* \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 27, 2021**\n\nRemarkably, the S&P 500 (SPY) hit a new all-time high for the 68th time this year, driven higher by a rally in technology stocks, a very strong start for the bullish end-of-year rally typically called the Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) is up more than 4% in the last five trading sessions alone. I for one am absolutely loving it.\n\nOn Monday, market participants cheered on a new report that showed retail sales in the US soaring past analyst estimates and a new report suggesting that Omicron, while more contagious, is much less severe than previous variants and less likely to cause hospitalization.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.41%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.65%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.99%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0/91%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.40%\n* Microsoft (MSFT): +2.32%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.30%\n* BridgeBio Pharma: -71.64%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -1.84%\n\nA report by Mastercard (MA) showed total US retail sales jumped a remarkable 8.5% from November 1 to December 24 thanks to soaring eCommerce sales. This is very encouraging as we continue to deal with supply-chain disruptions and elevated prices. eCommerce sales jumped up 11% this holiday season while sales at physical stores rose 8.1%, according to the same report.\n\n[https://investor.mastercard.com/investor-news/investor-news-details/2021/Mastercard-SpendingPulse-U.S.-Retail-Sales-Grew-8.5-This-Holiday-Season/default.aspx](https://investor.mastercard.com/investor-news/investor-news-details/2021/Mastercard-SpendingPulse-U.S.-Retail-Sales-Grew-8.5-This-Holiday-Season/default.aspx)\n\nAccording to three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\nFor context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, [according to data ](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December\n\n[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)\n\nDr. David Katz, President of True Health Initiative, said ‚ÄúOne of the ways pandemics end is significant mutation of the virus. It looks like Omicron may be our friend in that regard, significant mutations different enough from the parent that it doesn‚Äôt make people as sick.‚Äù \n\nThe market will head into 2022 with several key considerations to weigh but with its biggest focus on the course of the pandemic and rising inflationary pressures as well as the measures the Federal Reserve could take in response.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* November[ sales of new U.S. homes jumped](https://finance.yahoo.com/home-sales-jump-12-4-151247687.html) 12.4% to a seven-month high of 744,000, buoyed by low mortgage rates and higher demand in the housing industry.\n* After rising 2.3% higher today, Apple has a market cap of roughly $2.96 trillion, flirting with becoming the first $3 trillion company.\n* Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 20% in the last five trading session\n* Alphabet (GOOG) is going to be the best performing mega-cap tech stock of 2021. The stock is up 68% this year, compared to 51% for Microsoft (MSFT), 33% for Apple, 23% for Meta Platforms, 5% Amazon (AMZN)\n* Ford Motors (F) delivers first locally made electric Mustang Mach-Es in China. The stock jumped 2.57%\n* Apple supplier Foxconn's plant near Chennai in India will stay shut for three more days, a senior government official told Reuters, extending a week-long closure following workers' protests\n* Core capital goods orders, a measure of business investment in equipment that excludes aircraft and military hardware, fell 0.1% after an upwardly revised 0.9% increase in October\n* Electric carmaker Tesla Inc will stop allowing video games to be played on its infotainment systems while its vehicles are moving, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday.\n* Meta (FB) appealed the UK‚Äôs ruling that it must sell moving-image company Giphy.\n* fourth-quarter sales in the U.S. are expected to jump 42.8% to 97,417 electric vehicles from a year ago and 28.8% over the previous quarter, the latest automotive industry forecast from auto information company TrueCar.\n* TikTok was the most visited website in the entire internet in 2021, beating out Google.\n* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity.

Based on valuation, MSGS shares could be selling at a huge discount to its actual value of assets.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nFor the first time ever, a National Hockey League team is valued at $2 billion in the annual valuation rankings from Forbes. Here‚Äôs what the valuation estimate and recent acquisition activity in the space could mean for the owner of the Rangers, which is publicly traded.\n\nWhat Happened: The average National Hockey League team saw a 32% rise in its value assigned in the annual Forbes rankings. The average NHL team is worth $865 million in the new rankings.\n\nThis marked the biggest one-year average gain to the average NHL valuation by Forbes since a 50% gain in 2012 when a new Canadian market television deal was signed.\n\nLeading the NHL team rankings is the New York Rangers, valued at $2 billion. The valuation of the Rangers was up 21% from the previous year and marked the first time a team was valued at $2 billion.\n\nCredited with the increase in valuation changes were several recent team sales and a rise in league revenue.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins recently entered a deal with Fenway Sports Group for a $900 million purchase price, or around 4.5 times expected revenue for the current 2021-'22 season. Prior to the deal, the average multiple was around four times revenue, according to Forbes.\n\nDeals for the Carolina Hurricanes (2018), New York Islanders (2016), and Arizona Coyotes (2014, 2019) were done at multiples of 3.9, 4.2, 3.3 and 3.0, respectively.\n\nLeague revenue is increasing thanks to media deals. ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Turner, owned by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) signed new deals that started this season paying the NHL an average of $625 million a year. The previous U.S. media deals from ESPN and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) unit NBC paid an average of $300 million annually.\n\nThe league reported hockey-related revenue of $2.9 billion in the 2020-'21 season. Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion in 2021-'22 and increase to $6 billion for the 2025-'26 season.\n\nRelated Link: 8 Stocks To Watch For The NBA's 75th Anniversary Season\n\nMadison Square Garden Sports: The Rangers are owned by Madison Square Garden Sports Corp (NYSE:MSGS), a publicly-traded sports holding company. Madison Square Garden Sports owns the Rangers, the New York Knicks (NBA), Westchester Knicks (NBA G League), Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL) and esports assets such as Counter Logic Gaming and Knicks Gaming, which is in the 2K League owned by the NBA and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO).\n\nThe latest rankings from Forbes break the Rangers down at $468 million for sport, $893 million for the market, $309 million for the stadium and $330 million for the brand. The team‚Äôs iconic Madison Square Garden Arena is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp (NYSE:MSGE).\n\nThe Knicks were valued at $5.8 billion in the latest Forbes rankings, up 16% from the previous year. The valuation is broken down as $2.0 billion for sport, $2.5 billion for market, $403 million for the stadium and $918 million for the brand.\n\nTaking out the value of Madison Square Garden Arena and the Rangers are valued at $1.7 billion. The Knicks would be valued at $5.4 billion without the stadium. There could be some additional overlap between the values of the teams being owned together.\n\nUltimately, the two iconic New York teams are valued at $7.1 billion without their stadium.\n\nMSGS shares trade with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion and an enterprise value of $5.3 billion.
