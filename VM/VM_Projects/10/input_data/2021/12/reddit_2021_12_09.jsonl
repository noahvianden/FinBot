The key part that stood out was\n\n>40% of investors said they have taken on debt to invest, including 80% of Gen Zers, 60% of millennials, 28% of Gen Xers.\n\n80% of Gen-Z borrowing money to invest seems to be very high. And it's not like they are taking inconsequential amounts.\n\n>Of those who took on debt to invest, nearly half (46%) borrowed $5,000 or more.\n\nWhile I am not questioning the outcomes from their survey \\[1\\], I ran a similar survey with drastically different results. As you can see below, only around 13% of the responders have used borrowed funds while investing in the market \\[2\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ya6ipo1l8g481.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=91023c4bfb85ea1ec18c9a2b33150d87d53d91c0\n\nNo matter the variations in the results, the key insight is that a large number of retail investors are using leverage while investing. So in this week’s analysis, let’s do a deep dive into the world of leverage.\n\n**Leverage - A double-edged sword!**\n\n>Having a large amount of leverage is like driving a car with a dagger on the steering wheel pointed at your heart. If you do that, you will be a better driver. There will be fewer accidents but when they happen, they will be fatal - Warren Buffet\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the concept, investing with leverage is very simple.\n\nLet’s say that you had $10K in your brokerage account. You have a high conviction stock that you think is going to have a very good return in the next year and want to invest more than $10K in the said equity. You can take another $10K as a loan from your brokerage staking your entire position as collateral.\n\nAssume the stock went up 10% over the next month and you exit the position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kiq44zzn8g481.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f04153c738720154ce89801c1a2f76e0f50d8c6\n\nThis is the magic of leverage. You used a 2:1 leverage on your investment and doubled your return. (It won’t exactly be double as you have to pay some amount as interest for the money lent to you. I have ignored it for ease of understanding)\n\nWhy leverage is known as a double-edged sword is because of what happens when the stock price tanks. Let’s assume that the stock went down 10% and you had to exit the position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zsby4wo8g481.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5423ee50b4bc036093d5ad3a467788ad321d797\n\nThe 2:1 leverage would literally double your losses \\[3\\] since your exposure to the stock was double that of your initial available capital.\n\nNow that we know what the benefits and risks associated with using leverage are, let’s look at the current trends in the market.\n\n**Rise of leverage in retail trading**\n\nTrading on margin is just one way of using leverage while investing. While there are more exciting ways to lose money using leverage (Options, Futures trading, etc.), in this article we would be focusing only on leveraging using borrowed money.\n\nThe below [study from BIS](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2103v.htm) shows an ever-increasing demand for leverage from retail investors since 2019. By Dec’20 the total amount of debt stood at $750 Billion, the highest level on record since 1997 (Inflation adjusted). Adding to this, retail investors are using options now more than ever before. A study by Goldman Sachs showed that retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5lkfgnq8g481.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=402d283492172c2c07cddf839198cbf319afedd3\n\nThe pandemic has only accelerated this trend as showcased by the Harris Poll. 46% of the responders stated that they have either bought options or bought on margin since the pandemic has started.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/til7esbr8g481.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd7bcc14048e1b7d869c231db85a1e27b2dc17a4\n\nIt’s not that using leverage is inherently risky. The way many of them are obtaining leverage is a cause for concern. The below chart shows the source of funds used by investors for using leverage.\n\nWhile borrowing from friends and family can be considered interest-free (it does come with its own set of issues), on average, [personal loans charge 9% to 13%](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-loans/average-personal-loan-interest-rates) APR and credit card debt on average charges a whopping [15% to 23% in APR.](https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/average-apr)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2gzwg9hs8g481.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=00da73d59f8e8b64fee0143fd190d84c3d0e13a1\n\nThe issue here is that just to break even on the investment, the stock or the portfolio must go up somewhere between 9% - 23%! Imagine picking the right stock with it going up by 20% only to lose money in the end because you used the wrong leverage.\n\n**How to use leverage correctly?**\n\n>“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.” - Archimedes\n\nLeverage used correctly can be a powerful tool in growing your portfolio. As per a [study published by APR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Alternative-Thinking/Why-Do-Most-Investors-Choose-Concentration-Over-Leverage), more investors prefer concentration over leverage while thinking of maximizing their expected return.\n\nWhat this means in plain English is that most of us will just allocate larger and larger portions of our portfolios to stocks expecting a better return, whereas ideally, you would have got a better risk-adjusted return if you had a well-diversified portfolio and then leveraged that \\[4\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvvcsxju8g481.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f3de12bc80124e34e9d65c3a9ae51e5e710fc8\n\nIan Ayres and Barry Nalebuff (both professors at Yale) argued [in a 2008 paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) that it’s responsible for young investors to use leverage. The argument made is that when we are young we need to maintain a lot of exposure to stocks but we would be cash poor. The solution is to use margin to invest in equity and gradually decrease the percentage of leverage as you become older. This in the end would end up providing a much better-expected return.[5](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/leverage#footnote-5)\n\nBut using traditional leverage while investing comes with its own risk\n\n1. **Limited access to cheap debt:** Not everyone might be eligible for getting a loan that’s cheap enough to make sense for leverage investing. Depending on your current assets/credit score, the loan you get might be sustainably more or less expensive than the next guy!\n2. **Margin call:** If you are using a margin account from your brokerage and are unable to maintain the margin requirements set by your broker (i.e, value of the margin account falls below the required amount), unless you have enough cash to cover the position, the brokers will liquidate your position themselves and cover their loan.\n3. **Risk of loss greater than initial investment amount:** In our first example, we only considered what happens when there is a 10% loss. Imagine a scenario where the company you invested in files for bankruptcy. Then you would lose the 10K investment you made and still owe another 10K to your broker making it a 200% loss on your investment.\n\nGiven all these complexities, how would a normal retail investor realistically use leverage?\n\n**Leveraged ETFs**\n\nLeveraged ETFs take care of all the complicated stuff for you. It’s like investing in any other ETF (albeit, with a slightly higher expense ratio) where they use debt and derivatives to amplify the return of the underlying index.\n\nA classic example is [ProShares Ultra S&P500](https://www.proshares.com/funds/sso.html) (SPXU), where it tries to 2x the return of its underlying benchmark (in this case S&P 500) everyday.\n\nAs you can see from the below chart, the returns are magnified when compared to the normal S&P-500. Another example is TQQQ which (3x leverage of Nasdaq) has generated 57.86% CAGR over the last 10 years compared to the 22.67% CAGR of QQQ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0202z6w8g481.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ade8f4d6f45488710599a353deab64a62062d8\n\nWhile leveraged ETFs present a rosy picture in returns, they do come with significant risks. The single most important issue with leveraged ETF is that it breaks the number one rule of Warren Buffet - Never lose money.\n\nLeveraged ETFs work amazingly well when it’s a bull market. But imagine a hypothetical scenario where the market drops 20% in one day. The 3x leveraged ETF (since it has to close its position every day) suffers a 60% drop. Now the market has to only go up 25% for the regular investor to break even on their index fund. But for someone who had invested in a 3x leveraged ETF, the market has to go up 50% for their fund to even break even. In an outlier scenario where the market drops more than 33%, you will suffer a 100% loss[6](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/leverage#footnote-6) in which case it’s game over.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLeverage is that magical thing that works until it doesn’t. When it doesn’t, it does not look pretty. [Ask Bill Hwang](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-08/how-bill-hwang-of-archegos-capital-lost-20-billion-in-two-days) if you don’t believe me! He had an amazing run where he converted 200MM into $20 Billion in 10 years (which is phenomenal considering the scale he was working with), then lost all of it in **just two days** due to an extremely over-leveraged position.\n\nGranted, the optimal use of leverage while investing would end up giving you outsized returns, but the extremely complicated nature by which you have to rebalance and carefully adjust your portfolio is far beyond the skill-set of most investors. You don’t have to take it from me, take it from two of the most successful investors of our time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*“If you’re smart you don’t need leverage; if you’re dumb, it will ruin you.” - Warren Buffet*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*“There are only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies and leverage” - Charlie Munger*\n\nUntil next week…\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The survey was conducted by Qualtrics. it was an online survey of 2,046 U.S. consumers — of which 994 were investors — from March 30 to April 6, 2021. The survey was administered using a non-probability-based sample, and quotas were used to ensure the sample base represented the overall population. All responses were reviewed by researchers for quality control.\n\n\\[2\\] Either the sample from which they did the analysis was biased or the Reddit crowd is extremely risk-averse, both of which seem to be not realistic. Let me know what you think about why the results are so vastly different!\n\n\\[3\\] Same as with the gain calculations, in reality, your losses would be even higher as you would have to pay back the interest as well on the borrowed amount.\n\n\\[4\\] This has more to do with the perception of risk. While concentrating all your portfolio into equity when you are young does not feel that risky (due to a longer timeframe), ideally, your risk would have been lower if you had borrowed money to invest in a well-diversified portfolio. But this intuitively feels riskier (borrowing money) for a large segment of investors even though mathematically it would give a better return over the long run.\n\n\\[5\\] The argument made in the paper supporting leverage is that even if we end up blowing the account due to leverage, the capital loss would be lower as we would be young and we would have enough time to build up another account.

Market participants continue to digest new data about the Omicron variant, the Weekly Unemployment Report, and look forward to new inflation data being released tomorrow. Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot “neutralizes” the variant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-booster-omicron.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-booster-omicron.html)\n\nBank of America Senior US Equity Strategist Jill Carey said, “The Omicron variant has obviously been a key variable that contributed to the sell-off that we saw, and a lot of uncertainty remains around that, but our colleagues are so far thinking that while much is yet to be known, so far signs point to it not affecting the course of the pandemic dramatically, but obviously there is still a lot we need to hear there.\n\nWith virus concerns diminishing, investors are pivoting their attention back to economic data, awaiting Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures on Friday to assess the extent inflationary pressures will persist.\n\n\"If the Omicron variant was to lead to a resurgence in goods spending at the expense of services or to further complicate supply disruptions, there could be a clear inflationary impact, too,” wrote HSBC economist James Pomeroy earlier this week in a research note to clients. “The inflation news in the past few weeks has been decidedly mixed — with upside surprises in both the U.S. and eurozone being offset by the possibility of some of the supply chain issues starting to alleviate, while energy prices have fallen sharply in recent days.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Lucid Motors (LCID) cratered more than 15% after the company announced it was offering $1.75 billion of convertible senior notes expected to be sold to institutional buyers in a private offering.

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, December 9th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are lower after major averages post third straight day of gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n> U.S. stock index futures dipped early Thursday, after the major averages posted a third straight day of gains as traders bet that the omicron variant’s economic impacts won’t be as severe as initially thought.\n*****\n> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 106 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each off by 0.3%.\n*****\n> Stocks were set to give back some of their gains in recent days, with the move higher spurred by the belief that the omicron variant of Covid looks less severe than earlier forms.\n*****\n> The move comes a day ahead of important inflation news as the Labor Department on Friday releases the consumer price index for November. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the year-over-year growth rate to be 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.\n*****\n> Federal Reserve officials are expected to react to the burst in inflation by announcing next week that it will begin pulling back on its economic aid.\n*****\n> The first step will be accelerating the reduction in the central bank’s monthly bond purchases, with markets expecting the Fed to double the taper to $30 billion. That in turn could pave the way for interest rate hikes as soon as the spring of 2022 and mark the latest Fed policy pivot under Chairman Jerome Powell.\n*****\n> Weekly jobless claims data will be released on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the number of first-time-filers to come in at 211,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones.\n*****\n> During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, with each registering a third straight day of gains. The S&P’s gain over the last three days is the strongest of the year, according to MKM Partners.\n*****\n> The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.64%, also registering a third day of gains. Apple had the most positive impact on the index, while Nvidia was the biggest drag.\n*****\n> Equities got a boost after Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday morning that a booster dose of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the new omicron variant.\n*****\n> “The range of possibilities is still wide, but in the bigger picture, we think the odds are still very much in favor of the pandemic phase winding down,” Bank of America wrote in a note to clients following the announcement. “In our view, COVID is here to stay, but a shift to the endemic phase is approaching where infections are common but severe outcomes / lockdowns / travel restrictions are not,” the firm added.\n*****\n> With Wednesday’s gain, the S&P 500 is now just 0.9% below its all-time intraday high from Nov. 22.\n*****\n> Ed Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda, said that the market is in a wait-and-see mode ahead of Friday’s inflation report, which could “fuel further Fed rate hike bets.” Economists are expecting the report to show that prices rose 0.7% in November month-over-month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.\n*****\n> “While growth and labor markets have provided reasons to be optimistic about the economy, inflation is also running hot and sits at a 30-year high,” UBS wrote in a recent note to clients. “With the omicron variant entering the picture, investors are now questioning what monetary policy will look like going forward. The pandemic has already greatly increased the uncertainty over the economic outlook,” the firm added, noting that its base case is that the Fed will be patient.\n*****\n> There are some notable earnings reports on Thursday, including from Oracle, Broadcom and Lululemon, all of which report after the market closes.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/DeLpyt2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/09JimbM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/vbclQo4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/p8x5KwC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/U04HZyc.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/w8s1VYV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/fCVcxBB.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/lo6axiS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/zbZdwtA.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/X9oq1kA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/uxi1ywR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dAMrphJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/99t8WoZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/6uZEfGa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-cvs-hormel-rh-gamestop-and-others-.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **CVS Health (CVS)** – The drug store operator issued new guidance ahead of its investor day, saying it expects a 2022 adjusted profit of $8.10 to $8.30 per share compared with an $8.24 consensus estimate and better-than-expected revenue.

The key part that stood out was\n\n>40% of investors said they have taken on debt to invest, including 80% of Gen Zers, 60% of millennials, 28% of Gen Xers.\n\n80% of Gen-Z borrowing money to invest seems to be very high. And it's not like they are taking inconsequential amounts.\n\n>Of those who took on debt to invest, nearly half (46%) borrowed $5,000 or more.\n\nWhile I am not questioning the outcomes from their survey \\[1\\], I ran a similar survey with drastically different results. As you can see below, only around 13% of the responders have used borrowed funds while investing in the market \\[2\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycobp07y7g481.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0a47ed7defa9985cfeac235753e1176d0cdf4d4\n\nNo matter the variations in the results, the key insight is that a large number of retail investors are using leverage while investing. So in this week’s analysis, let’s do a deep dive into the world of leverage.\n\n**Leverage - A double-edged sword!**\n\n>Having a large amount of leverage is like driving a car with a dagger on the steering wheel pointed at your heart. If you do that, you will be a better driver. There will be fewer accidents but when they happen, they will be fatal - Warren Buffet\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the concept, investing with leverage is very simple.\n\nLet’s say that you had $10K in your brokerage account. You have a high conviction stock that you think is going to have a very good return in the next year and want to invest more than $10K in the said equity. You can take another $10K as a loan from your brokerage staking your entire position as collateral.\n\nAssume the stock went up 10% over the next month and you exit the position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vr9jjz18g481.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a101021a1f1e184f25f698d8cff614dc56440a5\n\nThis is the magic of leverage. You used a 2:1 leverage on your investment and doubled your return. (It won’t exactly be double as you have to pay some amount as interest for the money lent to you. I have ignored it for ease of understanding)\n\nWhy leverage is known as a double-edged sword is because of what happens when the stock price tanks. Let’s assume that the stock went down 10% and you had to exit the position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyyyd8v28g481.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7a8a19c12cc46a7de529a1ba6f6e0145a09c9d5\n\nThe 2:1 leverage would literally double your losses \\[3\\] since your exposure to the stock was double that of your initial available capital.\n\nNow that we know what the benefits and risks associated with using leverage are, let’s look at the current trends in the market.\n\n**Rise of leverage in retail trading**\n\nTrading on margin is just one way of using leverage while investing. While there are more exciting ways to lose money using leverage (Options, Futures trading, etc.), in this article we would be focusing only on leveraging using borrowed money.\n\nThe below [study from BIS](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2103v.htm) shows an ever-increasing demand for leverage from retail investors since 2019. By Dec’20 the total amount of debt stood at $750 Billion, the highest level on record since 1997 (Inflation adjusted). Adding to this, retail investors are using options now more than ever before. A study by Goldman Sachs showed that retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68v48r848g481.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=281bf0692d3ffe39a7081257278f1ae36b98a4ca\n\nThe pandemic has only accelerated this trend as showcased by the Harris Poll. 46% of the responders stated that they have either bought options or bought on margin since the pandemic has started.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yk8n56758g481.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6a5e15121fd74c15f4c971ab03aae396d3aa9f\n\nIt’s not that using leverage is inherently risky. The way many of them are obtaining leverage is a cause for concern. The below chart shows the source of funds used by investors for using leverage.\n\nWhile borrowing from friends and family can be considered interest-free (it does come with its own set of issues), on average, [personal loans charge 9% to 13%](https://www.valuepenguin.com/personal-loans/average-personal-loan-interest-rates) APR and credit card debt on average charges a whopping [15% to 23% in APR.](https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/average-apr)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6c4lkm468g481.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=33bf61ba2d0cf94a730b34c228d03bbf2489d9e1\n\nThe issue here is that just to break even on the investment, the stock or the portfolio must go up somewhere between 9% - 23%! Imagine picking the right stock with it going up by 20% only to lose money in the end because you used the wrong leverage.\n\n**How to use leverage correctly?**\n\n>“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.” - Archimedes\n\nLeverage used correctly can be a powerful tool in growing your portfolio. As per a [study published by APR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Alternative-Thinking/Why-Do-Most-Investors-Choose-Concentration-Over-Leverage), more investors prefer concentration over leverage while thinking of maximizing their expected return.\n\nWhat this means in plain English is that most of us will just allocate larger and larger portions of our portfolios to stocks expecting a better return, whereas ideally, you would have got a better risk-adjusted return if you had a well-diversified portfolio and then leveraged that \\[4\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klhzo1w88g481.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dc4189963ba9160bf775114c14287c65ffd84f5\n\nIan Ayres and Barry Nalebuff (both professors at Yale) argued [in a 2008 paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) that it’s responsible for young investors to use leverage. The argument made is that when we are young we need to maintain a lot of exposure to stocks but we would be cash poor. The solution is to use margin to invest in equity and gradually decrease the percentage of leverage as you become older. This in the end would end up providing a much better-expected return.[5](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/leverage#footnote-5)\n\nBut using traditional leverage while investing comes with its own risk\n\n1. **Limited access to cheap debt:** Not everyone might be eligible for getting a loan that’s cheap enough to make sense for leverage investing. Depending on your current assets/credit score, the loan you get might be sustainably more or less expensive than the next guy!\n2. **Margin call:** If you are using a margin account from your brokerage and are unable to maintain the margin requirements set by your broker (i.e, value of the margin account falls below the required amount), unless you have enough cash to cover the position, the brokers will liquidate your position themselves and cover their loan.\n3. **Risk of loss greater than initial investment amount:** In our first example, we only considered what happens when there is a 10% loss. Imagine a scenario where the company you invested in files for bankruptcy. Then you would lose the 10K investment you made and still owe another 10K to your broker making it a 200% loss on your investment.\n\nGiven all these complexities, how would a normal retail investor realistically use leverage?\n\n**Leveraged ETFs**\n\nLeveraged ETFs take care of all the complicated stuff for you. It’s like investing in any other ETF (albeit, with a slightly higher expense ratio) where they use debt and derivatives to amplify the return of the underlying index.\n\nA classic example is [ProShares Ultra S&P500](https://www.proshares.com/funds/sso.html) (SPXU), where it tries to 2x the return of its underlying benchmark (in this case S&P 500) everyday.\n\nAs you can see from the below chart, the returns are magnified when compared to the normal S&P-500. Another example is TQQQ which (3x leverage of Nasdaq) has generated 57.86% CAGR over the last 10 years compared to the 22.67% CAGR of QQQ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syh7ytja8g481.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=461e2e1c35c5850b993f7b01d2669e6dbc037a75\n\nWhile leveraged ETFs present a rosy picture in returns, they do come with significant risks. The single most important issue with leveraged ETF is that it breaks the number one rule of Warren Buffet - Never lose money.\n\nLeveraged ETFs work amazingly well when it’s a bull market. But imagine a hypothetical scenario where the market drops 20% in one day. The 3x leveraged ETF (since it has to close its position every day) suffers a 60% drop. Now the market has to only go up 25% for the regular investor to break even on their index fund. But for someone who had invested in a 3x leveraged ETF, the market has to go up 50% for their fund to even break even. In an outlier scenario where the market drops more than 33%, you will suffer a 100% loss \\[6\\] in which case it’s game over.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLeverage is that magical thing that works until it doesn’t. When it doesn’t, it does not look pretty. [Ask Bill Hwang](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-08/how-bill-hwang-of-archegos-capital-lost-20-billion-in-two-days) if you don’t believe me! He had an amazing run where he converted 200MM into $20 Billion in 10 years (which is phenomenal considering the scale he was working with), then lost all of it in **just two days** due to an extremely over-leveraged position.\n\nGranted, the optimal use of leverage while investing would end up giving you outsized returns, but the extremely complicated nature by which you have to rebalance and carefully adjust your portfolio is far beyond the skill-set of most investors. You don’t have to take it from me, take it from two of the most successful investors of our time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*“If you’re smart you don’t need leverage; if you’re dumb, it will ruin you.” - Warren Buffet*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*“There are only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies and leverage” - Charlie Munger*\n\nUntil next week…\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The survey was conducted by Qualtrics. it was an online survey of 2,046 U.S. consumers — of which 994 were investors — from March 30 to April 6, 2021. The survey was administered using a non-probability-based sample, and quotas were used to ensure the sample base represented the overall population. All responses were reviewed by researchers for quality control.\n\n\\[2\\] Either the sample from which they did the analysis was biased or the Reddit crowd is extremely risk-averse, both of which seem to be not realistic. Let me know what you think about why the results are so vastly different!\n\n\\[3\\] Same as with the gain calculations, in reality, your losses would be even higher as you would have to pay back the interest as well on the borrowed amount.\n\n\\[4\\] This has more to do with the perception of risk. While concentrating all your portfolio into equity when you are young does not feel that risky (due to a longer timeframe), ideally, your risk would have been lower if you had borrowed money to invest in a well-diversified portfolio. But this intuitively feels riskier (borrowing money) for a large segment of investors even though mathematically it would give a better return over the long run.\n\n\\[5\\] The argument made in the paper supporting leverage is that even if we end up blowing the account due to leverage, the capital loss would be lower as we would be young and we would have enough time to build up another account.

{"title": "PayPal: Outlook Constructive amid the recent pullback", "selftext": "**Call to Action:** We see no significant risks to PYPL’s position in the short term and view the 2022 setup favorably. Price target $250. \n\n**Thesis:** PYPL’s performance will continue into 2022; while facing covid-comps, the combination of organic growth and elimination of drags will bode well for sustained double-digit growth. PYPL’s 2022 Venmo deal with Amazon will sustain growth in transaction volume while also boosting Venmo’s own growth. Continued payments and eCommerce integration affirm confidence after 3Q comps and a softer 4Q guidance.\n\n**Expanded Payments:** PYPL noted that Buy Now, Pay Later TPV run rate exceeds $8B annually, and new initiatives and expansions. BNPL is expanding to Spain and Italy, and consumer late fees will be eliminated since October 1st. PYPL continues to expand across payment verticals, with payment solutions with Walmart, Booking.com, AliExpress, etc. PYPL further noted that customers will be able to make purchases on AMZN and mobile shopping app via Venmo after 2022. \n\n**PayPal Wallet:** PYPL highlighted the global rollout of the digital wallet, and noted early wins in user engagement, driving increased transactions. PYPL Cash Card enrollments increased 35%, first-time alternative-currency users have increased 15%, and first-time donations have increased 35%. \n\n**M&A:** PYPL highlighted the tuck-in acquisition of Paidy, the leading two-sided payments platform and BNPL provider in Japan, which closed on Oct. 13th. This positions well for the 3rd largest eCommerce market’s pivot towards cashless payments. \n\n**Guidance:** PYPL’s guidance baked-in headwinds from reopening and cited EBAY as a continued drag on performance. Management currently expects around 18% revenue growth for 2022, with a reacceleration of revenues in 2H22 following a flatter 1H. Overall, management expects above medium-term guidance. \n\n**Key Takeaways:** PYPL’s initiatives continue to boost organic growth in transaction volume and user engagement. With the expiration of the PYPL-eBay deal, performance drag will be reduced. However, in the short term, tough prior-year comps and project maturation both point toward a flatter 1H22. The long-term setup is more positive with secular growth in cashless payments. \n\n**Estimates and Valuation:** My price target of $250 is using a forecasted 2026 Diluted Non-GAAP EPS, with a terminal EPS multiple of 26, a discount rate of 9%. This means the stock currently trades at 13.14x times Terminal EPS. \n\n***Downside Risks:*** increased credit losses from the BNPL segment, accelerated take-rate reductions, slowdown in transaction volume growth from normalization, poor choice of acquisitions. \n\n***Upside Risks***: outperformance in transaction volume and revenue growth, Acceleration in Venmo and cashless transaction uptake, any slowdown in take-rate reductions, positive consumer behavior changes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkg0dsw9oi481.png?width=2277&format=png&auto=webp&s=025c987e2a4ec538c596721a1e9ab592625e7e38", "id": "rchfbr", "created_utc": 1639055654.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent DD!\n\nPYPL was dropped more than 30% along with correction cycle of IPAY.

The Paidy acquisition I think is uniquely good; Japan is the 3rd largest eCommerce market, but transactions are still dominated by cash, which benefits the switch to cashless payments like Paypal and Venmo. \n\nThe new vertical expansions with Walmart, AliExpress, and Bookings.com also are good, getting those big labels online with more merchants. This really complements their Venmo deal with Amazon. \n\nI think my valuation is definitely conservative, but there are risks that I want to highlight.
