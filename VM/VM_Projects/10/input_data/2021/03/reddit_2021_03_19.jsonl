First, as a comparable, MP Materials is the biggest rare earths miner in the US/North America. They had great earnings yesterday, have a share price in the \\~$43 range, and a market cap of about $5-6B. They mine bastnaesite and still ship their rare earths to China for processing.\n2. UUUU, a year ago, embarked on a program to process rare earths of its own. They are not a rare earths miner. They contractually purchase (2500 tons as of right now) monazite ore from Chemours, from Chemours' mine in Georgia. They separate uranium from the monazite ore, then send it to Neo Performance Materials in Estonia, Europe, for the final stage of processing.\n3. Monazite ore is richer in rare earths.\n\n||Monazite|Bastnaesite|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Neodymium Praseodymium (NdPr)|22.6%|16.3%|\n|Samarium Europium Gadolinium (SEG)|14.4%|1.1%|\n\n4. UUUU's rare earths value chain is completely non-China, where MP's still goes through China.\n\n5. As of now, MP produces significant quantities of rare earths, while UUUU is at the beginning.\n\n6. MP cannot mine the richer monazite, as it contains radioactive uranium.\n\n7. Price action: after significant run-ups recently, UUUU has taken a breather. It's dipped low.\n\n8. UUUU is currently an $800-900m market cap with share price in the $6-7 range.\n\nConclusion: UUUU's current share price is massively undervalued. While MP currently produces significant rare earths, UUUU's impending production (up to 15,000 tons per year, equal to 50% of US rare earth demand) will be both higher quality and non-China. Putting together the superior REE play, plus its participation in the broader Uranium bull cycle, in my view, the price has significant upside.\n\nSee r/UraniumSqueeze community for more (it is not actually a squeeze community, the discussions are 100% real and good).\n\nSources:\n\n[https://mpmaterials.com/about/](https://mpmaterials.com/about/)\n\n[https://www.energyfuels.com/presentation](https://www.energyfuels.com/presentation)\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/science/rare-earth-element/Minerals-and-ores](https://www.britannica.com/science/rare-earth-element/Minerals-and-ores) (scroll to see the chart comparing mineral richness of various rare earth ores)", "id": "m8l7nj", "created_utc": 1616171773.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "I've done much DD on $UUUU as well.

The parent company Fresenius is a stable global player and keeps making nice acquisitions and has good prospects.\n\n**Why is it interesting? There were two dips last month in best Felix Baumgartner fashion.**\n\n**Dip No. 1:** Because of Covid 19, business is a little worse because some treatments can't be done. Oh scare. The first part of the exploders shits themselves and liquidates the entire depot. Stock crashes from 65‚Ç¨ to 56‚Ç¨. Then people notice that Corona goes around at some point and maybe that wasn't so smart, so the thing flies back up to 62‚Ç¨.\n\n**Dip No. 2:** The numbers have been released! For Q4 2020, the experts expect 4.49 billion in revenue, but it's actually only 4.40 billion. A whole 4% less in a massive pandemic crisis, what a scandal! The last hard boiled boomer break out in tears now and like in panic the entire depot is liquidated like piss. Two boomers have been hit particularly hard: [Doc Olaf and Harald](https://www.finanzen.net/insidertrades/fresenius_medical_care), two CEOs of FME. They were so shocked by the figures that they accidentally treated themselves to a total of 5000 stonks. Could it be that, as CEOs, they know more when they put their money where their mouth is? Or have they simply sniffed too many sharpies? Certainly the latter!\n\nThe [P/E ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/FMS/fresenius-medical-care-ag-kgaa/pe-ratio) is decent compared to the company's past history and to other companies in the sector. There is restructuring and reasonable long-term planning at both FME and Fresenius. Two CEOs are flanking in nicely. Signs are that it is undervalued and a bargain.\n\nI don't expect too much in the short term. If the news is particularly good, the stock could climb back up to ‚Ç¨65. But by the end of 2021 or early 2022 at the latest, it should be back at ‚Ç¨70 and higher. After all, this is blood dialysis, which will always be running, and not cars with screwed-up airbags, of which you first have to recall 20 million. In 20 years, when you're hooked up to an FME machine and die because you drank and smoked too much, you'll be nostalgic for the zarties this place made you. Diamond hands and perseverance prove!\n\n**Risks**\n\n**FME is of course attached to Fresenius**. One drawback is that Fresenius works a lot with credit and has a lot of debt, which is not a problem so far because of the turnover and the percentages, but if the credit conditions were to deteriorate, the business would also look worse. Overall, Fresenius is more broadly positioned and also includes FME shares, so if you want to play it a little safer, put some money in there.\n\nIn addition, Fresenius makes a number of takeovers and it is always possible that one will go to shit and fuck up the business. All that would of course affect FME as well. But I think even in the worst case the long-term strategy and outlook are right, so you would be condemned to hold the bag for a while but not have a total loss.\n\nSince this DD has been written, FMC has climbed from 58.18‚Ç¨ to 61.64‚Ç¨ (about +6%) and was relatively unimpressed by all the corrections. Could perhaps be due to the fact that the boomers have already beaten the thing so much that there was nothing left to kick and spit on. Chapeau! This development and the fat insider buying at that time confirm my assumption that FMC was strongly undervalued (see DD). FMC still has a P/E ratio of 15.05 and now there was another fat insider trade of 600k$ last week and another 300k$ last month.\n\nNo investment advice, I drink more varnish than you do bleach.

{"title": "$VST - Texas Winter Wonderland Play", "selftext": "First DD and keep having to minimize my screen when the bossman passes, so it will be a quicky like the wife's BF enjoys.\n\nVistra Corp is a company. A company in Texas where it was unexpectedly cold for a little while. Actually, more specifically, Vistra Energy is an energy producer and provider, serving millions in dozens of states. This is done both via wholesale power sales or its retail segment. Even amongst other energy gorillas in the absolutely massive energy zoo, the firm is no small ape slinger; it is the largest competitive energy provider in the United States with over 39 GW of power generation in its portfolio ‚Äì a number capable of sending Marty back to the future to sleep with your wife 32x. It also rivals that of traditional utilities like Duke Energy or Southern Company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhp9400xu0o61.jpg?width=195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88c495202d872f2a32627086343335bec39b260e\n\n\"So what?\"\n\nBeginning this year, EBITDA over the next three years was expected to be in excess of $9,000mm, of which the firm would have converted 60% of that to free cash flow. While some of that was set to fund growth projects (investments in renewables), the bulk of it was going to be returned to shareholders in the form of either dividends or shareholder buybacks. The firm was coming off of a multi-year deleveraging cycle and had achieved the leverage metrics necessary to qualify for investment grade credit, meaning that the heavy lifting on the balance sheet was done and it was time for the equity to benefit. The market, for various reasons, was fundamentally mispricing this opportunity. Vistra Energy traded with free cash flow yields to the equity in excess of 20%, and even traded with double digit annual free cash flow yields on the entire enterprise.\n\nVistra was doing well. Really well. Then came this once in a lifetime storm. Investors thought, \"no big deal. They can weather this thing.\" But then the management peeps disclosed a forecast of $900 ‚Äì 1,300mm in the aftermath of the freeze. In addition, media reported wiffs of bankruptcies across these companies.  BOOM! Sell-off.\n\nBut what happened? and is Vistra really in danger? Well, lots of  things happened that my smooth brain doesn't entirely comprehend, but it turns out it was an ERCOT pricing error outside their control. They were really well prepared to deal with this if it weren't for some stupid incompetent bureaucracy.\n\nVistra did good before the storm. They predicted the weather event and spent money to be ready. In fact, they were more ready than your wife's BF when you're in the taxi on the way to the airport for a business trip. Before the storm, they locked up natural gas supplies. They were prepped to be supplying energy in the face of this severe catastrophe.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csq9qfb6v0o61.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a491d2fcb5ffbb9699dc88a454f868f4c0957a2a\n\nThe winter storm comes and the grid gets shut down. Other fake and inefficient energy production like wind and solar go offline.\n\nThrough all of this drama, Vistra Energy is supplying a large portion of the power of the grid as one of the few electricity providers that was prepared. Yet, inexplicably, the ERCOT mandated price was slow to respond to conditions. Even with half of Texas power generation offline and load demand near all-time winter highs, market prices were not where they should have been.\n\nFor perspective, stated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d4i1f9uv0o61.jpg?width=313&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a395faf7d9b7b4538820b63a704ddf9fe904758\n\nUltimately Biff ended up with Marty's mom, Marty doesn't get to the clock tower and Vistra get's screwed.\n\nStated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.\n\nEnd of the day, despite making the correct weather call, the firm ended up with a higher cost of goods mix than it anticipated (higher natural gas prices, less use of coal-fired generation) and pricing issues related to the Monday morning ERCOT issue.\n\n**Longstory Short**Vistra is positioned to üöÄüåï.
