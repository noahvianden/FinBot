{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - March 11th, 2021", "selftext": "Today was a day similar to Tuesday, tech and semiconductors rallied while the financial sector and oil lagged behind. The 10 Year Treasury Yield ($TNX) was up a little from Wednesday's low, however it is still down for the week. Current yield is 1.527%. \n\nMy portfolio is up more than 8% today, but we still have a little ways to go to reach the highest peak that I reached a couple weeks ago. Overall, it is looking like this might be a V-shaped tech recovery - a lot of overreaction. The only positions that was filled today was 10 shares of Roblox ($RBLX). I would like to see two green day candles in a row before I start jumping back into my shorter term calls. I'm believe we will pull back a little tomorrow in tech, and Monday I'll be looking for entries on more calls if we hold up until then. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35ut8x2xoim61.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=774a66c970de9c828a83f652ee90d740ac05a371\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Adding to the Watchlist:** \n\n**$RIDE:** Lordstown Motors Corporation is an American automobile manufacturer of electric vehicles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oyyowbzoim61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc42796a9aebda5deaedfe4b7c4dee1ec5d7d060\n\n$RIDE is working on their electric pickup truck to try and take a piece of the $190B American truck market. It has the looks of a more traditional American pickup and in my opinion, looks better than Rivian's version. Although super futuristic looking, the cyber truck might not appeal to everyone and the price target is around $18,000 more than the Lordstown for the AWD version. Deliveries of the Lordstown Endurance are expected to begin in the fall of 2021, with full production ramping up throughout 2022; we can preorder on their website now for only $100 deposit. Welcome to the future. Currently $RIDE is trading below the 180 MA. Once it breaks this and tests it as a support, I'd be interested in buying this stock. \n\n* Target Price: $35\n* Entry: $20\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 4-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/749r8501pim61.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e37e541b070f9dca03827b7841fcc37380bfea2\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**CPNG**: Coupang is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. The biggest IPO on the NYSE from an Asian company since Alibaba. The $CPNG IPO was, for the most part, overshadowed by the Roblox IPO from Wednesday. Coupang has been compared to the Amazon of Korea. The Korean e-commerce market in 2018 was $100B and is growing rapidly. Coupang has a unique [returns ](https://www.expatguidekorea.com/article/how-to-return-a-product-on-coupang.html)system. On their app, you can select to return the product and where the delivery courier will pick it up. It is as simple as clicking a few buttons on their app and placing the product outside of your front door. It seems to me like a big deal. No technical analysis is need on $CPNG as it just IPO'd today. I'm interested to see if it will pull back before pulling the trigger on this one. \n\n* Target Price: $70\n* Entry: $45\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 3-5 months\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**CAKE**: The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated is an American restaurant company and distributor of cheesecakes based in the United States. Recently food, beverage and hospitality has been performing rather well while the entire tech sector has been selling off. I expect that this is a rather good play through the rest of the year as the economy opens up and stay at home orders are lifted for the country. I personal always liked their cheesecake and food. Over the last couple of years $CAKE has opened up restaurants in China and doing extremely well there. At Shanghai Disney's location I once had to wait for 4 hours to get a table.

Unless the issuer has defaulted and declared bankruptcy, then you haven’t lost any money. The trading value of a bond drops over time for a variety of reasons. The first, and perhaps most important to understand, is that a bond’s yield relative to its face value decreases as the bond gets closer to maturity. A 10 year AA bond with a face value of $5k and a coupon rate of 1.5% isn’t going to yield 1.5% in interest payments if it is sold at the face value with only five years left until its maturity date. Obviously, no investor is going to buy that bond from you without it being discounted to make up for the lost interest payments. Also of note is the fact that interest rates are inversely correlated to a bond’s trading value. No one wants to buy an old AA bond with a coupon of 1.5% when a new issue AA bond can be had with a rate of 2%. Again, you would need to discount the bond to adequately incentivize other investors to buy it from you. Changes in the issues credit rating will also effect the trading value of the bonds that they have issued. This is all 100% normal.

{"title": "Plus, NVIDIA Partner on Heavy Truck Autonomous Driving System", "selftext": "Plus has received more than 10,000 preorders for its autonomous truck driving system, which is expected to be commercially available in 2022 in the U.S., China and Europe.\n\nPlus, a self-driving truck technology company, has made several recent announcements:\n\nThe company will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) in its autonomous driving systems.A former Navistar exec has joined Plus as chief platform officer.Plus recently raised $200 million in new funding.\n\nPlus was founded in 2016 and specializes in self-driving technology for large-scale autonomous transport. The company is starting mass production of its autonomous driving system for heavy trucks this year. \n\nAccording to a press release, the company will expand its feature set and operating design domain over time through over-the-air software updates. By working with the NVIDIA engineering team to further evolve its system, Plus will make it possible for trucks powered by its system to achieve fail-operational performance for on-road safety.\n\n“Enormous computing power is needed to process the trillions of operations that our autonomous driving system runs every fraction of a second. NVIDIA Orin is a natural choice for us and the close collaboration with the NVIDIA team on a custom design for our system helps us achieve our commercialization goals,\" says Hao Zheng, Plus CTO and cofounder. \"We have received more than 10,000 pre-orders of our system, and will continue to develop our next-generation product based on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform as we deliver the systems to our customers.\"\n\nThe Plus autonomous driving system is designed to make long-haul trucks safer and more efficient. Because of the size and weight of heavy trucks, which can total 80,000 lbs. with a fully-loaded trailer, they need more time to come to a stop and to maneuver.\n\nPlus’ system uses lidar, radar and cameras to provide a 360° view of the truck’s surroundings. Data gathered through the sensors help the system identify objects nearby, plan its course, predict the movement of those objects and finally control the vehicle to make it move safely.\n\nThe NVIDIA Orin, which can deliver 254 trillion operations per second, can handle the large number of concurrent operations and support deep neural networks to process and make decisions using the data on heavy trucks outfitted with the Plus autonomous driving system. Orin is also designed for ISO 26262 Functional Safety ASIL-D at the system level for safety.\n\n“Plus and its automated trucks are delivering true social benefits today through improved safety and efficiency,” says Rishi Dhall, vice president of autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA. \n\nTo support the global deployment of its self-driving truck technology, Plus has added two new senior hires; Mooney, who was most recently senior vice president of global product development at Navistar and Chuck Joseph, who joined from Amazon’s Global Transportation Technology Group.\n\nThe company also closed $200 million in new funding in February led by new investors Guotai Junan International, CPE, and Wanxiang International Investment. Existing investors including Full Truck Alliance (FTA) also participated. Plus will use the funding to develop a sales and support network to help fleets integrate the Plus automated trucking system into their daily operations. The company will also scale deployments in the U.S. and China, and expand internationally to Europe and other parts of Asia.\n\nPlus also recently announced collaborations with Amazon AWS, Blackberry QNX, and Ouster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.forconstructionpros.com/trucks/trucks-accessories/heavy-trucks-class-7-8/article/21319412/plus-plus-nvidia-partner-on-heavy-truck-autonomous-driving-system", "id": "m39ui4", "created_utc": 1615523898.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Where do I give my money", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Bb", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "BB - this is the way.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It scares me to think a computer might be driving a car next to me ~", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Like you get scared when a computer files a plane? :P", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "It scares me to think you might be driving a car beside me.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "This was 2nd on my list of responses ;)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "You should be - I like sidewalks in congestion...", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "How can we ever feel safe without a sleep deprived human who is pumped full of stimulants behind the wheel? /s", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don’t worry, they drive better than you do anyway.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}

{"title": "IlLUMNated? Who Wins and Loses When Autists, Christian Bale and Tendies Collide?", "selftext": "**EDIT: I planned to post this before LUMN ran 15% in a week. I still think there is upside! This is not a YOLO on FD's stock! Leap calls are the move here folks.**\n\nOk what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why \"Cables are like the future, man\", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.\n\n**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**\n\nFor those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?\n\nConfused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).\n\nChristian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.\n\n**Act 2: A New Breed**\n\nOk, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nLUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUntil recently.\n\nLUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.\n\nLUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.\n\nOn top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**\n\nLUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?\n\n* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.\n* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.\n* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.\n* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.\n* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.\n\nRatios:\n\n* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.\n* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.\n* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.\n\n**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**\n\nHere are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:\n\n* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).\n* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.\n* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.\n* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.\n* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.\n* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**\n\nAnd yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.\n\n**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**\n\nOk time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.\n\nAnyhoo:\n\n* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.\n* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.\n* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.\n\nThis is a smart play folks.

{"title": "A health guide for the storm we find ourselves in.", "selftext": "Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. \n\n1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you \" Go outside\". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.\n2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  \n\n3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was \" again?\". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.\n\n6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. \n\n7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. \n\n8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .\n\n10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills \" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.\"\n\n11.

{"title": "Trading Tips for Novice Apes", "selftext": "I scored me an Adderall yesterday and in my amphetamine-induced madness sat down and wrote a bunch of rambling crap about trading stonks and options for beginners. I know, let's let the newbies lose all their money and clean out this trash-heap, but come on, the paper trading competition is more effective than sheer stupidity. Anyways, here's some tips to not lose money, at least not as quickly as $800 GME calls.\n\n  DiVeRsIfY!\n\nOptions are great. No, not those kind of options, but options like how normal people use the word. Basically when trading it’s hard to be right 100% of the time, so why risk your whole account by owning a single stock? It’s dangerous because *you will be wrong* and if you bet it all when you’re wrong, even if it is rare, you’re out of the game. All the money is gone. You might even *owe money to the broker* if you did something really dumb.\n\nDiversification is sometimes laughed about, even by giants like Warren Buffet. He famously said something like, “Put all your eggs in one basket *and watch the basket*.” He’s not wrong, but most people don’t know what to look for regarding dangers to this basket. There could be a wolf about to eat all the eggs and we wouldn’t know it. *We wouldn’t even know what a wolf looks like!* My point is unless you’re an expert at knowing market conditions, economic conditions, and are great at reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs like a wizard, you probably can’t watch the basket very well.\n\nPersonally, I admit I don’t know shit about companies. I invest in meme stocks that have high options premium. That’s my investment strategy. My egg basket is, well, I don’t know what it is, but it sure isn’t something that has any business holding eggs. The eggs could be eaten, spoiled (there's probably an option expiration joke here), or be stolen at any moment and that’s why I have multiple baskets. One or two of the baskets can get stolen/eaten, and I still have eight more. I can and will be wrong, and at most it’ll wipe out 10% of my holdings. I, and you, can happily easily take a 10% hit to the investment account and be able to function.\n\nThis play more into my next tip: be stoic. By diversifying you can remove extreme emotion from your investing/trading.\n\n## Be Calm. Be Chill. Be Stoic. It’s just money after all!\n\nYou are your main enemy to stock market success. It’s not market makers, shorts, or other traders; they only use you against yourself. Why? Because you’re a person. You have emotions. You’re stupid and irrational and emotional. Money is on the line; you know the thing we all trade for shelter, food, good, and everything? Money is fundamentally tied to emotion, so when your money starts to get messed with you get stupid. Think of all the silly shit you’ve done and said on an emotional high or low. You may have drunkenly told someone you loved them, kicked someone’s ass, bought something stupid, and apply this to your investment account. How are you going to treat hundreds or thousands of investment money if you’re emotional? When a stock you own (please be diversified!) drops 60% and your money disappears what do you do? You have a choice and emotion will only make the choice harder to make.\n\nI don’t really have a tip here because it’s something you learn to deal with. There is no magical key to not being emotional when money is involved (besides shutting your phone off and going for a walk), but just know that it is immensely important, more than any other thing, to keep emotion in check in regards to investing. I do have a few tips on things to be aware of though. Luckily they have names so by labeling them you can recognize what’s happening and combat it.\n\n## FOMO\n\nFear of Missing Out. You watch a stock you were kinda thinking about buying jump 300% in a few days. People at work are talking about their hot stock that's printing them tendies. You start to think that maybe you missed the boat -- you dragged your feet and are sitting out riding the rocket to the moon -- or did you? Maybe it’ll go up another 300% *if you get in ASAP!* Yeah, that’s a great idea. You’re not even greedy, you just want it to go up a little bit so you can feel like you were part of the moon mission, and that’s not hard to do, right? Surely if it went up so quickly, it’ll keep going up at least until you sell.\n\nWrong. This is a terrible idea. Hype is dangerous. FOMO is why people I work with are chucking money into \\[redacted\\] at $50,000 after it went up 1,000% in a year. This is why people are *still* bagholding GameStop at $450 per share. This is why a large portion of bagholders exist in the first place; their still holding onto their $18 AMCs they bought a few months ago no wanting to take the loss.\n\nIf you find yourself experiencing HARD FOMO and *just can’t resist*, buy yourself a small portion. Don’t go crazy. Don’t “invest” anything more than you’re willing to lose. Using \\[redacted\\] again, if you invested $1,000 at $50,000 and \\[redacted\\] went down to $5,000, would you be fine with it? You turned $1,000 into $100 and how would you feel? There is a low enough point where it’s stomachable, so invest that. I’m not buying \\[redacted\\] but if I did I’d be okay with a $500 \"investment.\" If I lose it, it’s fine, and I won’t lose sleep over it. FOMO is dangerous so be aware of it.\n\n## FUD/Dooming\n\nThe opposite of FOMO: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. This can be caused by your family questioning what the hell you bought, news stories, internet shitposts, etc. and make you scared to hold your stock/option because you're worried the price will crash. These pale in comparison to witnessing a beloved stock you owe totally collapse in price. You watch your thousands of dollars of gain disappear in a few days (or maybe hours) and what do you do? You panic sell. You're $10,000 profit is down to $7,000, $6,000 and $5,000 and *OMG how much worse can it get! I could lose all my profit!* You panic sell and realize a $2,000 gain, but oh how you kick yourself in the ass for not getting out at the top. You were greedy, you feel like shit. You're the worst trader ever.\n\nThen the next day the stock goes up and you get a side of FOMO to go with your main-course FUD. *If only you held...but maybe it's not too late to jump back in?*\n\nAs before, no real tips on this one. It's also hard to give tips for when something emotional is happening. It's easy to say \"*don't panic sell!*\" but when you're on the verge of panic selling its hard to detach yourself from the numbers on your screen and actually not panic sell. Only with hindsight do you realize how much of a paper-handed bitch you were.\n\nLike with FOMO, a good recipe for mitigating FUD is to give into your emotions just a little bit so you feel like you're doing something. If you want to sell as a stock is crashing, sell half. Sell a third. You don't need to sell it all and regret it later. And if you have truly massive balls, you can always *buy more shares on the way down!*\n\n## No Regrets! No \"what ifs\"!\n\nThere's few things worse than seeing an \"investment\" work out better than you expected but to not sell at the top. You're always haunted by the \"what if I just did this…\" A stock triples, you don't sell, and then it's back to where you bought it at. You could've raked in *so much money* but you held too long and raked in absolutely nothing.\n\nThen there's the opposite problem: selling too early. You got greedy/scared and took a 10% gain when you could've had a 1000% gain. This was me with *GameStop* in January. I had 400 shares total and sold them around $30-40. Sure I made $5,000 but I could've had $150,000 if I held on for another week or so! Try not to kick yourself in the ass for missing like that and tell me how well it goes. It's hard.\n\nAt least I didn't FOMO back in. I realized my mistake -- I sold too early -- and am trying my best to not let it haunt me. Everything is clear with hindsight and what I did made sense at the time. Trading is stupidly hard and no one perfectly buys at the bottom or sells at the top and as long as you come out ahead, who cares? I'm not the guy holding bags at $450 a share, and at least I was in the play and made some significant cash. As always, easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself for not being perfect.\n\nMy tip here is to take profits as you wish. You can probably tell that I'm a big fan of taking half-measures -- selling half, buying half -- because you're doing something and doing something feels good. If a stock goes up 20% and you want to sell, sell half. Realize some profits and let the rest ride. If it goes up even more, sell half of those, and so on. This isn't a rule, just an idea. You feel good taking profits but leaving some on the table does wonders for the \"what if\" thoughts that might haunt you.\n\nThe same is true for buying. Buy half of what you want and see how it plays out. If the stock goes down, buy more. This keeps you safe from tossing in a ton of money at a high price, but makes you feel good for getting some cash in the game.\n\nDisclaimer: I like the stock.
