{"title": "Vital Farms (VITL) DD - A non-tech growth play", "selftext": "# Overview \n\nVital Farms is a certified B-Corp focused on ethically growing pasture raised eggs and butter. They do this by partnering with roughly 200 family farms that share the mentality of putting the welfare of the animals before anything else and engaging in sustainable farming practices. All of the farms are located in ‚ÄúThe Pasture Belt‚Äù, an area notorious for favorable weather all year long.\n\n# Management and employee satisfaction\n\nThe company was founded by Matt O‚ÄôHayer in 2007. He is the founder and former president of the Organic Egg Farmers of America and is still the Executive Chairman and Director of Vital Farms.\n\nThe current CEO is Russell Diez-Canseco. Previous work experience includes McKinsey & Company, H-E-B Grocery, and the Central Intelligence Agency (he also has an MBA from Harvard University).\n\nOther senior management members have extensive experience in the food industry.\n\nThe company has a 4.2 rating on Glassdoor (50 reviews), 88% approval of the CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and motivation with the company‚Äôs ethical mission. A few reviews complain about managers (not uncommon on Glassdoor) and about the company‚Äôs culture.\n\n# Industry and competition \n\nVital Farms is active in the highly-competitive and fragmented US food industry with a focus on retail consumers and a few partnerships with restaurants.\n\nNotable competitors include Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ: CALM), Rose Care Farms and other major US egg producers.\n\n# Moats and competitive advantages \n\nVital Farms differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the ethical side of the production and farming of its eggs and dairy products. Customers and reviewers claim the products are of higher quality and of greater taste due to the production approach they‚Äôre taking. Customer reviews and satisfaction is extremely high (their standard egg carton has a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Amazon based on 5,985 reviews with customers praising the premium quality).\n\nAlthough their eggs are pricier than competitors, consumers haven‚Äôt been minding shelling out the difference for the premium quality. \n\nTheir marketing is unique and exceptional amongst competitors. To exemplify a part of this, they allow buyers to check out the farm where their eggs were laid in a 360 degree video to see if it‚Äôs up to snuff and they have a reward program for filling up a ‚Äúpasture passport‚Äù with the names of 10 different farms.\n\nTheir branding and packaging is also really strong and although it is still a small company, it is starting to show strong brand loyalty among its consumers (a significant percentage of first-time buyers during the COVID-19 pandemic became repeat buyers according to the CEO).\n\nAlthough the company does not have a truly strong moat at the moment, in my opinion they‚Äôre well on their way to building themselves one by the customer loyalty they‚Äôre amassing and the network of small farms they‚Äôre building.\n\n# Areas of growth\n\nThe company has been willing and adventurous when it comes to expanding their product line into sub-products (Egg bites, hard boiled eggs, liquid whole eggs) and completely new segments (butter). A natural next-step for the company at this point, in my opinion, would be to expand their dairy products further (milk, cream, etc.) to tap into other large markets.\n\nPartnerships with large restaurant chains willing to back sustainable farming practices could also be a catalyst for growth.\n\nOne could argue there is also potential internationally for Vital Farms, but I believe this is very far-off the current road-map. \n\n# Potential headwinds \n\nAs previously mentioned, the industry they operate in is highly fragmented and it‚Äôs unlikely Vital Farms will own a majority of market share in their segment. The egg and dairy industry is also notoriously smaller and has a lower CAGR than other high-flying fast-growing industries, so Vital Farm‚Äôs TAM and market cap growth is capped unless they manage to go international successfully or tap into new product and revenue streams.\n\n# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest\n\n* Institutional ownership sits at about 51-52% (including a 4.1% indirect ownership by Amazon.com).\n\n* Insider ownership: \n\n- Mathew O‚ÄôHayer (Founder, chairman): 10,650,494 shares \n- Brent Drever (Board Member): 2,533,512 shares \n- Karl Khoury (Board Member): 1,780,380 shares\n- Glenda J.

It traded sideways after it‚Äôs IPO and has been declining since November 2020.\n\nImportant to note that the current price held fairly well amongst the recent growth stock correction (only declining ‚âà 8.5% from its February peak).\n\n# Conclusion \n\n1. Extremely high institutional and insider ownership (almost 95% of the total outstanding shares are being held by insiders and institutions - including a small 4.1% stake by Amazon.com).\n2. **Very strong balance sheet with lots of cash and very light on long-term debt and liabilities.**\n3. **Growing revenues at > 50% per year and management aiming to grow at over 40% in 2021 and 2022.**\n4. **Net income growing at over 60% YoY.**\n5. **Profitable, cash flow positive.**\n6. High employee satisfaction and brand loyalty and high ratings from customers.\n7. Innovating in existing product lines and opportunity to venture into other product segments.\n8. Brilliant marketing.\n9.

{"title": "I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across social media to find rising stocks! This week's top growing stock and its DD: Vuzix($VUZI)", "selftext": "I had posted the previous picks from my program and my analysis here and the response I received was amazing. I have been working on improving the program and **have made the program public**. If you have seen the previous posts, please feel free to skip to the DD. \n\n**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.\n\n**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nHere is the stock picked by the program and my DD\n\n**Stock: Vuzix Corp ($VUZI)**\n\nWeek on Week increase in mentions: +46.3%\n\nMonth on Month increase in mentions: +1029% \n\nAverage sentiment across mentions: **+34.97%**\n\n**DD**\n\n**Core Product**\n\nVuzix is an American technology firm that mainly focuses on wearable display technology, virtual and augmented reality. One of the major differences between Vuzix and its competitors is that Vuzix focuses on specific niche sectors like healthcare, logistics, service training, etc. and their products are currently being used in the market today. Vuzix is considered a pioneer in wearable computing and augmented reality and has been working in this field since 1997. \n\nThe advancements made in mobile technology and 5G networks have now reached a stage where it enables wearable technology that is not clunky or too intrusive like the Google glasses. Currently, they have 3 products (M400, M4000, and Blade), all of which are targeted towards industrial customers and are currently deployed in the field. \n\n**Financials**\n\nVuzix is not a profitable company and expects to report an operating loss of around $4.4MM for Q4 2020. Their revenue experienced almost a 100% spike from $2MM in Q4‚Äô19 to 4MM in Q4‚Äô20. Even though the company is not profitable yet, they maintain a great balance sheet. \n\nDebt to Equity ratio is only 0.09 and they have a strong cash position of $52MM (inclusive of converted warrants) which implies they have a long runway to scale and make the unit economics work. They are also currently foraying into a total solutions package that is part hardware and part SaaS to create a recurring revenue model.\n\nOne additional thing to consider here is that there has been consistent insider buying of shares and no selling which indirectly showcases the management‚Äôs confidence in the company‚Äôs future prospects.\n\n**Potential and Hype Factors**\n\nThe buzz is generated primarily due to the following reasons \n\nCathie Wood‚Äôs ARK bought more than 1MM shares of Vuzix in their Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF(ARKQ). According to ARK‚Äôs forecast, AR market would grow from $1B today to $130B by 2030 and Vuzix is the leading contender with its long experience and wide IP rights (Vuzix currently has 184 Patents in the AR/VR field). \n\nOne of the other factors which is driving up the demand is pandemic-driven adoption trends. There are strong demands from the field of virtual healthcare and remote training and service calls. Most of their products are back-ordered/out of stock due to the extreme demand.\n\nThey have also fared well at CES 2021 winning 3 awards for their Next Generation Smart Glasses (A smart glass that looks exactly like normal specs). This news should definitely be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism as CES is liberal in giving out awards and Vuzix hasn‚Äôt given out their glasses for testing to any reliable tech reviewers.\n\n**Risk and Competition** \n\nThere is definitely significant risk associated with investing in small-cap stocks. The main risk factors for Vuzix that I could see are \n\na. Competition from Big-Tech firms: Almost all the major tech players (Apple, Google, Qualcomm) are in the field/planning to enter the field of AR glasses. While Vuzix owns a considerable number of patents, the best-case scenario for them would be to get acquired by a big tech company as they don‚Äôt have the financial backing or supply chain capabilities to take on established companies and successfully deliver on a consumer product.\n\n   b. Unit economics: Vuzix cannot be classified as a startup (they have been around for 23 years) and is still cash flow negative. The company needs to improve its scalability so to generate profits. The current rise in demand due to pandemic might be just the ideal situation for them to scale. \n\nc.  Intel ownership change: 30% of the company was owned by Intel in 2015. As of Mar‚Äô21, Intel does not have any ownership in the company. I am not able to find any reliable source of information on why Intel sold their stake in the company. But, on the other hand, there are established funds like BlackRock and ARK buying into the company. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nAugmented Reality is being touted as one of the megatrends of the next decade.

People are mentioning inflation or the rising 10yr bond yield, but I personally don‚Äôt know how much I buy that as a good reason because Jerome Powell has been doing everything he can to soothe all the worrying about inflation, plus inflation is relatively not even that high, historically speaking. Neither is the bond yield, which was over double what it currently is within the last few years.\n\nThe only thing I can really come up with as to why this is all happening is just that investors know that valuations are high right now and are expecting something to happen so they‚Äôre on high alert and are jumpy right now. When anything happens or nothing happens, everyone is ready to sell because the logical expectations that this growth is unsustainable and it‚Äôs gotta come to an end eventually, even though technically there‚Äôs nothing going on right now to indicate that it should be ending soon.

{"title": "ELI5: Why would a multi-trillion dollar stimulus benefit the stock market?", "selftext": "Hi. Over the past few weeks, I've seen a lot of comments and posts that assert a multi-trillion dollar stimulus bill will lead to positive, upward trends in the stock market. I hope these theories are correct, but I don't understand the connection between economic stimulus spending and the stock market well enough to know if these are valid assumptions. I keep thinking of reasons why the stimulus potentially *wouldn't* help or impact the market, but I'd like to hear from other people.\n\nFirst, I think there‚Äôs a misconception that the economy and stock market always move in tandem. Often they do, but sometimes they don't. For instance, if you look at last March, the market corrected  as initial COVID shut-downs and restrictions were enacted, then it quickly reversed, while COVID cases and economic conditions worsened. Despite a few minor corrections along the way, the market reached its pre-March peak by November, then it went on to reach all-time highs over the next few months. During this time, the economy struggled, and didn't really start to show signs of life again until late 2020/early 2021, as vaccine roll-outs were underway; with each month that passed following the March shut-downs and restrictions, unemployment rates increased, COVID cases skyrocketed, small businesses shuttered, and industrial giants in travel, hospitality, etc. struggled and realized significant financial loss. So, if the market performed well while the economy didn't, could we assume that the market could still enter a downward trend while the economy recovers during the next several months?\n\nSecond, I suspect there are potential implications of injecting trillion dollars into the economy, but I don't know what they are exactly or how they'd impact the market (or not). This may sound dumb/naive, but where does the government get this money from, and would they owe money over time to use this money now? Would they keep running the money printer, and then, wouldn‚Äôt inflation be a potential risk? Or (either/or/and??) would it be borrowed and paid back over time with increased interest? What I‚Äôm trying to understand here is the potential of interest and/or inflation, which chances are, could negatively impact the stock market, overriding the potential for the stimulus money to positively affect the market.\n\nPerhaps someone more knowledgeable could identify what I'm missing or where I'm wrong, and make a case for why the stimulus bill could help the market?\n\nEdit: fixed bad grammar", "id": "lymhd1", "created_utc": 1614980078.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "I put the checks I received for my kids into their 529 plans.

Consumer spending in the 4th quarter of 2020 increased year over year by 2.9%. barely a point off historic trends. The pandemic basically did nothing to stop us from buying things. \n\nUnderstand that the economic impact of the pandemic is HIGHLY inequitable. Yes, there are job losses, big ones, but those job losses were, unfortunately, focused primarily among lower wage workers in retail, food service, and travel. Everyone else? They kept their jobs, and not only kept them but millions of us got the new luxury of working at home and reducing expenses even!\n\nand having a new reason to download zoom, buy a webcam, or a new laptop, or a new PC. or...\n\nUnemployment benefits were pretty quick and generous, so that greatly minimized the fallout of the pandemic from a consumer spending standpoint. across the US we saw rent freezes, student loan freezes and other factors too that freed up cash... \n\nLong story short, some sectors absorb the brunt of the pandemic, but the economy as a whole? it kept on trucking, people kept on buying and in a lot of cases, bought more things. \n\nWill the stimulus increase the stock market? 100% yes. bottom line is the stock market tracks business that sell things. people are gonna get money, and they will use that money.

There‚Äôs a nice map there that breaks things down by state and by metro area.  A common theme here is large non-farm employment hubs like L.A., Miami, New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, San Diego, and Nevada (where I suspect Las Vegas and Reno are getting hit hard since they‚Äôre heavy tourism and service sectors).  These expectation percentages are large in leading metro areas.\n\nThere‚Äôs [this January 2021 survey](https://www.blackknightinc.com/black-knights-first-look-at-january-2021-mortgage-data/) on mortgage data that appears mixed.  Two bullet points demonstrate this:\n\n> The national mortgage delinquency rate fell to 5.9% in January, dropping below 6% for the first time since March 2020\n\n> At the current rate of improvement, 1.8 million mortgages will still be seriously delinquent at the end of June when foreclosure moratoriums on government-backed loans are currently slated to lift\n\nA large concern is the moratorium extension Biden issued on January 21st.  The extension moves the expiration from March 31st to June 31st.  The reason it‚Äôs a concern is because it‚Äôs only for mortgages, not also rent.\n\n> The White House said the extended protections are in part aimed at prioritizing communities of color hit hardest by the pandemic. Homeowners of color make up a disproportionate share of the home owners with delinquent loans or on forbearance plans. \n\n> However, Tuesday's actions did not address the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium on evictions for not paying rent. That moratorium is also set to expire March 31. About one-third of all Americans, roughly 107 million people, are renters. [(source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/16/mortgage-relief-ban-home-foreclosures-extended-joe-biden/6755036002/)\n\nWe keep pushing these quarterly moratoria out by one quarter, and I‚Äôm not sure what politicians are expecting to happen inside three months that will address this situation to a sufficient degree.  Debt is debt, and people getting their jobs back doesn‚Äôt mean that debt goes away instantly.  \n\nThe service sector is the largest non-farm sector in the US economy by employment [(source)](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm).  That sector has also gotten kicked square in the balls by the pandemic.  The fact that the service sector pays crap to most of its employees means that they have a really hard time building up emergency funds and are therefore likely to be small.  With an extended period of reduced wages or just plain unemployment means that most of those emergency funds will have likely been drained by now.\n\nThat‚Äôs a long way of saying there are lots of low-income folks on the edge of eviction with no help whatsoever in sight.  From the Bloomberg article above on February 8, 20201: \n\n> Some 9.3 million jobs were lost last year and the U.S. suffered the sharpest rise in the poverty rate since the 1960s.\n\nBash a bear all you want, I don‚Äôt see any other interpretation of this data other than politicians refusing to defuse a massive economic time bomb.\n\nThat does not mean that there won‚Äôt be growth in sectors.  I just don‚Äôt like the fact that I just now seriously considered for a few minutes getting into a payday loan ETF (they‚Äôve somewhat flatlined, which I‚Äôm actually thankful for, maybe due to various state-level legislation in recent years limiting their collective growth potential).\n\nIf [current monetary policy](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0Ex6kAKAoFRsFh6M/200.gif) was to avoid a crash in March 2020, they succeeded.  I‚Äôm no economist, so I can‚Äôt critique one way or the other if it was the smart thing to do, but we can‚Äôt deny the effects that it‚Äôs going to have:  increased inflation.  It‚Äôs possible that the intent was to turn a crash into inflation which the Fed can manage better, but it‚Äôs not clear if really they just dumped money into the economy only to save the stock market with near complete disregard for the long-term effects.  We‚Äôve heard JPow say their policy has been adjusted inflation targets to *average* 2% per year, but naturally that implies at least one year of > 2% inflation, likely more.  If an economist or two can lend some insight here as to their intent and potential mitigation strategies, it would be extremely helpful.  I worry that the party will be over when they transition to finite QE.\n\nThe picture is far more complex than these statistics.  As far as calling this DD, it‚Äôs incomplete, but I‚Äôm posting it here to get a more in-depth conversation started.  There are gaps to fill, statistics to clarify, and simply just more research that needs to be done to get a better picture.\n\nPersonally, I‚Äôm not doing this to profit on what could be a gut punch followed by a long, slow bleed.  I want to have hard data to present to my representatives and tell them what areas need fixing.

Lenders don‚Äôt want to foreclose on a property unless absolutely necessary. I personally think that a lot of the people behind on their mortgage will negotiate plans to tack on their missed payments to the end of their mortgage (essentially just extending the term of the loan).

I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around what's going on. I happen to deal with a lot of people with large portfolios of rental properties - both apartments and SFRs and to a lesser extent commercial properties. Across their portfolios they are collecting rent like COVID hasn't been an issue. Also, basically non existent vacancy rates. Past due levels across our bank are crazy low.  I'm sure it has a lot to do with things being pretty good where I'm at regarding unemployment, etc. But still no real warning signs going off. \n\nLending in general is competitive but I'm not seeing overly risky deals being made in the market. Rates are low and terms are generous. If you want business it is at low profit margins.\n\nMy fear, if you want to call it that, with the economy is that we are basically in a forever low rate environment. People have been conditioned to low rates. If a big hiccup comes along and rates go up people don't necessarily have the cash flow to cover it. We have been underwriting deals for basically the last 10 years based on minimum coverage ratios and consumer transactions on DTIs, with extremely low historical rates. People have gotten used to that and use the extra cash flow they were paying in interest expense to buy cars/boats/vacations etc and stimulating the economy. A rise in rates brings all of that to a halt. \n\nOur economy is also largely tied to construction and real estate. Right now we are seeing home prices appreciating and people are able to afford the mortgages on homes because the rates are low. With rates going up and home prices increasing its going to slow the real estate market. Homes are getting more expensive to build by the day so prices can't be cut to offset the rise in rates. At the same time inventory levels are low right now so people are going to keep buying, at least for awhile. But if rates are higher and cost is higher then people will have to cut back somewhere to afford it. Reducing their consumption. \n\nI watched a bit of a webinar yesterday where a guy was talking about expectations for mortgage rates, economy, inflation, etc. He said we can expect rates to increase for the near term before the Fed steps in with something akin to Operation Twist to pull long term rates down. We are bound to see inflation show up in the next couple of months because it is calculated based on a rolling 12 months. In March and April last year we saw negative inflation. As those months get rolled off it has to go up before settling back down.\n\nCosts are definitely goin up, so there is undoubtedly inflation out there. At the same time wages year over year are up and our govt is flooding the system with money. And looks like it will continue to be trickled in over time with the current stimulus package and a likely future infrastructure deal. \n\nIn my opinion at all costs rates have to be kept low. Not sure how that can be done long term but I'm also not convinced we can handle rising rates. \n\nTo be frank I'm also worried about us pumping so much money into the system and what will happen with taxes.

If they quit paying now, landlords are going to boot them the first chance they get. They aren't catching a completely free pass. The cost will be eviction when they're able to. \n\nI believe in larger metro areas you could be seeing this. Unemployment is a bigger issue in larger metro areas. I think you'll see a lot of issues as landlords are unable to find renters or aren't able to generate the same level of rents on properties, both residential and commercial. Small businesses going under, glut of vacant commercial spaces in some places, residential vacancies in cities as people move to the burbs or are able to move elsewhere and work remotely.

{"title": "UNFI Book Based DD", "selftext": "TLDR: UNFI 40C Aug 20\n\n Unfi is currently undervalued it's share holders equity is 1.1 Billion, Market Cap of 1.6 Bill. With consistent gains baring the acquisition of  SUPERVALU (which forced it through two VERY negative quarters) but has since been remedied due to the influx of covid online shopping. and a recent increase in net cashflow due to fixing distribution problem and gaining around double it's assets and using the recent covid surge to pay off debt.\n\n**In other words it got undervalued due to buying out another company which didn't have it's shit together. fixed that shit and now should have an increased revenue from it's already solid numbers. and the markets acting like it's still 2019 in this bitch.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pre Word:**\n\nSo i saw some \"DD\" by  [u/gpech](https://www.reddit.com/user/gpech/) and, while good news, it's more an article that only mentioned earnings and general good news related to amazon/things that apply to the food market as a whole. The problem is that, that shit is what a ton of people do and something I ignore since I invest on book value. After all beating earning doesn't mean shit if your still negative. all it means is that these analyst guessed wrong.\n\nThe problem is it's book value is actually fantastic holy shit. It looked like a dream so u/gpech, next time you get a good stock. GIVE ME THE BOOK NUMBERS FOR FUCK SAKE YOU REATARDED GENIOUS.\n\nSO I'm gonna explain a few things in this dd, \n\n**1: The book value:** all the numbers even the glaringly bad parts (which will be explained in part 2) \n\n**2: why it's undervalued** how it's clear net income problem is fixed long-term and its equity to market cap difference is low for its normal net income.\n\n**3:Why i set my valuation where I did and when i plan to get out:** this ain't GME, there's no movement. I get my money and I gtfo. Could i earn more? maybe? do i give a shit. Fuck no. I'm here to make money by logical gambling. Like the guys who bet on sports for a living. WE get what we know we can take, no farther. Cause even what you know to be true ain't always gonna work out. \n\n# Actual DD:\n\n**1 The books:**\n\nShare holders Equity: 1.18 B\n\nAVG Net income over 10yrs:$40M   \n\nWithout big losses(9.5yrs): .12B   \n\nBig losses to read on:2019-10-31 -384M   2019-01-31 -342M (yes 726M worth of losses in two quarters I'll Explain)\n\nMarket Cap: 1.6 Million\n\n**2 Why the books are fucked:**\n\nin late 2018( Quarter which goes into 2019) there's a jump in Equity, debt and A giant loss posted for the quarter. This is when these fuckers acquired a company called SUPERVALU \n\nThis caused these dumbasses to get more debt which hurt there cashflow as well as have to integrate 2 business's into 1. Fucking its shit up cause the didn't know how to deal with it. This caused them to start to lose a ton of net income forcing them to take another loss in late 2019 to try to rid itself of it's debt\n\nThis can be seen in the loss of share holders equity as both debt and equity decreased, however to get rid of debt early incurs charges(interest) netting you a loss of equity. At the same time the distribution was still having problems and talks about amazon looking around surfaced\n\n**The Fix Action:**  like wars create money so do pandemics for anyone who can ship online. for example a little know company called AMZ that ships grocery's supplied by UNFI. This nets them a ton of money which isn't seen on the books. why is that? cause these fuckers put it all into fixing the distributing cause apparently they only half as dumb as some of these other companies.\n\nMore then a fix action: Since they fixed the distribution problem you might be thinking cool so now that 153M net income is looking pretty good right? wrong you dumbass its better then good. They fixed a distribution line on a company that now has double the size. **essentially you can expect an increase in their net revenue from past highs** which can been seen in the recent earning releases which are occurring while they fix the distribution network as their revenue and costs increase dramatically in 2020.\n\n**to help you smooth brains understand**: imagine someone buys a fucked up Lamborghini, they start to fix it but just end up sinking more money then originally planned worrying your wife's boyfriend who stops giving you as much money to fix it up. however you get a giant lump sum of money from work out of no where which allows you to buy better equipment and gives you time to work on fixes in a more intelligent way. so when your cars actually fixed your net profit will be even larger then you originally though\n\n**3: Why my expectations are at 40$ or 2B market cap.** \n\nAssuming no gains on their past income you can realistically expect an average of 120 Ma year. however those were pre acquisition numbers\n\n**Floor** with 120M for 5 years with a 3 percent increase year over year you can expect 600M. That's my floor estimate assuming they just return to normal and don't have any increases despite being about twice as big as before\n\nRealistically though i expect at least a 40 percent increase from almost doubling there capacity in a time where people order online all the time. so instead of 120M with inflation I'm going with 168 which over 5 years gives me a more realistic low of 840M. putting its Low(to me) at around a little over 2B.\n\nso why did i put my call for 2 B and not lower to give me a better outlook? because when it spikes up to 40 i expect it to continue to around 44 before dropping bellow 40 and balancing out as most stock hover at it's worth rather then reach it. I'll be looking to get out at around 42 unless the WVAP is lower the the current price.\n\nif you know something i don't or see faults in my numbers let me know.
