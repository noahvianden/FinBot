Arguably, this is the only common stock that by itself is comparable with diversified indexes. Investors can clearly benefit from the simple method to quickly value the stock and predict its trading range.\n\nTwo ways to value Berkshire\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two main approaches to measure BRK value. One would run some calculations based on either book value or a sum of the parts (SOTP) of the company's multiple components. Without going into details, let us review the pros and contra of both approaches.\n\nBook value has been important for Warren Buffett himself and it is a natural starting point. An analyst would then assign a certain multiple based on either words or writings from the Oracle himself and/or BRK trading patterns and/or buyback timings. Simplicity is a big advantage here but this method does not provide any clue to finding an intrinsic value. If we assume that intrinsic value is equal to the present value of future cash flows, then it is obvious that market data is not supposed to determine this value. Buffett's words or actions do not help either since typically he does not explain how his brain works. For example, for many years BRK was supposed to buy back its shares at 1.2 multiple of book value or lower. But have you ever seen Buffett explaining this mysterious multiple? So, the book value method is simple and very practical but with its own flaws.\n\nThe SOTP approach is fundamentally better-grounded since an analyst makes her best effort to account for the company's important features. Alas, the method becomes too complex, with many moving parts, and with some important components notoriously difficult to evaluate. For example:\n\nHow to determine the value of the underwriting business?\n\nHow to treat deferred taxes?\n\nHow to account for claim liabilities and unearned premiums?\n\nAre you supposed to value cash, bonds, and stocks on the balance sheet the same way based on their fair value or you should treat them somewhat differently?\n\nUpon responding to or completely ignoring these issues, an analyst would value BNSF, BHE, other manufacturing or service businesses by either assigning some multiples or using comps. And voila - the magic number is produced. But upon introducing multiple assumptions and parameters, the fundamentally solid method becomes rather capricious, subjective, and less practical.\n\nBetween these two approaches, I like the one based on book value more: it uses only one parameter and is way more practical. But can we improve it somehow without creating too many complexities?\n\nAnother balance sheet method to value BRK\n\nIn the past, I published several posts (you can easily find them on my author's page) valuing Berkshire as the sum of its book value and float. This method does not require any external multiples or parameters whatsoever - all the inputs are taken right from the balance sheet. To make this post complete, I will briefly present some justification for this approach.\n\nA good insurance company (I will define \"good\" shortly) commands cash-generating assets financed by its equity, float, and debt. Insurance float stands for those liabilities that a carrier has to pay later in the future but can use productively meanwhile. Loss and loss adjustment reserves and unearned premiums are two main float components that are entered on the balance sheet at their future value.\n\nSome (but very few) insurance companies can be called \"good\" as long as they satisfy four important conditions simultaneously and continuously:\n\nThey generate underwriting profit on average and almost always.\n\nThey grow their net written premiums and float grows with premiums.\n\nTheir prior-year reserves are conservative and overestimate eventual losses so that almost every year prior years' reserves are being released.\n\nAssets are generally utilized productively with a relatively small part of them being held in short-term instruments or low-yield bonds.\n\nThe first three conditions are defined rigorously but the fourth one is open to interpretations. For example, BRK's latest balance sheet (Q4 20) lists $874B of assets with less than $160B of them in cash, short-term securities, and fixed maturity securities. I would call this balance sheet highly productive compared with most other insurance companies (please note that goodwill here is a productive asset!).\n\nOnce all four conditions are met, we can surmise that the top value of a successful, big, and rather stable insurance company should be equal to the sum of its equity and float. Smaller and quickly growing insurance companies or companies with a rather small insurance component (so in fact they are not insurance companies any longer) can have a value exceeding the sum of equity and float. On the contrary, even successful P&C companies not striving to put most of their assets into productive use (keeping them in high-grade bonds to minimize risks) should be trading below equity plus float value (TRV, for example, analyzed in my older publication).\n\nExplicitly or implicitly, Warren Buffett has been using the same yardstick of equity plus float in his career. For example, this is almost exactly how much he paid for Geico (I reviewed this case in one of my older posts). In multiple interviews, appearances, and writings, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger praised the value of float and even directly mentioned that float is almost as valuable as equity.\n\nMarket Data\n\nOf course, the conceptual arguments of the previous sections do not prove the point and we need to check how the market really values BRK. The float can be easily calculated directly from the balance sheet but for Berkshire, it is not necessary - the company always reports this number in both quarterly and annual filings. The relevant annual data is being presented in the table below.\n\nIn general, the data supports our logic: BRK is really trading close to the sum of its equity and float. Over 2004-2020, the average value of P/(BV+FL) is equal to 0.97 with 0.11 in standard deviation.\n\nSince P/(BV+FL) is trading close to 1 over all these years and does not display any particular trend we can make several speculative conclusions:\n\nInvestors consider BRK a P&C company.\n\nAs an insurance carrier, BRK is as good as one can get because its value reaches the sum of equity and float.\n\nMultiple acquisitions of non-insurance assets over 17 years, have not made BRK, in the eyes of investors, less of an insurance company.\n\nIt is not surprising that Buffett always mentions insurance first when he talks about his company.\n\nBut if BRK is such a superior insurance company why so few have followed Buffett's example? In my opinion, because it is very difficult and requires somebody like Buffett in charge. Those that have followed (I can name Alleghany (Y), Markel (MKL), and Fairfax (OTCPK:FRFHF)) are generally trading lower despite their share of success.\n\nToday's BRK's trading value is very close to where we would expect it to be. Still, it is the end of the quarter now and the last row of the table uses the balance sheet data of Dec 31, 2020. There is no doubt that equity and shares outstanding have changed since: we know about BRK's buybacks in Q1, S&P 500 is already up more than 5%, and some operating net income will be delivered as well. Float is also likely to change but perhaps, not so significantly: without big retroactive deals, the float is gradually growing primarily due to net written premiums growth. However, all these factors together are not expected to change (BV+FL) per share more than several percentage points during Q1 21.\n\nThe last column of the table presents public equities as a proportion of BRK's market cap. The ratio has been fluctuating over years but currently is on the high side. This is not so good for Berkshire because its shares become more volatile and it confirms how badly the company needs productive acquisitions. After all, many investors view Berkshire as an island of stability in rough seas and prefer its shares to be less volatile. At the same time, volatility creates opportunities for investors and our simple method can be very handy in this regard.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Kudos on the great write up.
