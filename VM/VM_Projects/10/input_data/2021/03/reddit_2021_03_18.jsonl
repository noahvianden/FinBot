Cannot cut and paste the annotated chart:\n\n\n\"Everyone's hero, Warren Buffett, dumped his Apple shares and found himself using the pocket change generated to buy one or two shares in US telecoms giant Verizon. In fact, his company Berkshire Hathaway are now Verizon largest shareholder. Obviously, the markets regard this as quite a big deal and a Trends and Targets quick survey of hedge funds shows a substantial majority bullish on the share prospects.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the last few years have not been particularly kind to many hedge funds, their reputation somewhat tarnished due to the horrific number which shut down.\n\n\nDespite everyone being eager to find 'the next Tesla share', it's generally far safer to explore slower, safer, and more stable companies, though obviously worth considering what field they are in, along with their future potentials. In telecoms, the demand is obviously for a high tech future and to judge by their press releases, Verizon are producing all the right 5G noises for the USA market.\n\n\n\n\nDespite all our optimistic writing, we're pretty far from convinced the immediate future is rosy for Verizon, the immediate trend indicating the risk of weakness below just 54 dollars driving the share price back to a visually appealing 52 dollars. We like this level as it promises some sort of bounce but the danger comes should 52 break as ongoing travel down to targets of 50.5 dollars (or less) calculates as possible. As the chart below highlights, this presents an issue.\n\n\nBy breaking the Red uptrend since 2010, the share price enters a region where \"bottom\" calculates down at $44 in the event our 50.5 level breaks. This, in theory, is the case anyway but we've some doubts. Inevitably, a bunch of smart folk would review any break of trends as an opportunity, especially if a share price failed to make it below its most recent low. In the case of NYSE:VZ, this suggests the price requires break below the $49 level to justify hysterical behaviour.\n\n\nIn summary, we suspect Verizon shall reverse from its current 55 dollars but we're more inclined to regard the movement as presenting an opportunity for the longer term.\n\n\n\n\nFor everything to come up roses, the share price currently requires exceed $59 to enter a region, where growth to an initial $68 is hoped with secondary, if bettered, at 72 US dollars. Importantly, we cannot calculate any targets above the $72 dollar level for this company. This does not mean a ceiling awaits, just should it exceed 72 dollars, it enters unknown territory where things can become very illogical!

{"title": "Why we are down in the futures today - Why the news from the FOMC meeting was actually bad for the markets", "selftext": "The FOMC meeting was met with extreme optimism. At 2 pm est on wednesday the 17th we had a huge rally in all the indecies even putting SPX close to 4000 and QQQ above the daily 20SMA and 50SMA in one swoop. \n\nThis was not the reaction that the news from the FOMC meeting deserved. It seems like the markets expected much worse news like the FED tampering asset purchases which was'nt realistic. In a post i made yesterday I had my realistic worst case scenario which was about what happened yesterday.   \n\n\n1. **Real GDP projections skyrocketed from 4.2 to 6.5 for 2021**  \nGDP can increase because of 2 things; economic growth & inflation. Even though USA has printed trillions of dollars they have not seen almost any growth. Instead money is flowing out of the country shown in the trade deficits. The main reason for the GDP projections are therefore not because of expectations of economic growth as some news media try to portray it as.   \n\n2. **PCE inflation projections for 2021 rose from 1.8 to 2.4**   \nThis projection i did expect to rise but this is a really bad projection and it tells me that the FED either have no idea what is going on or the FED has become too politically motivated and is straight up lying to calm the bond- & stock markets. We should expect PCE inflation to increase alot more than 2.4% for 2021 because of all of this liquidity in the markets and the opening up of the economy, the PCE inflation will be much higher (Or already is much higher) around 5%.   \n\n3. **The dot chart showed more economists at the FED projecting the federal funds rate to increase eariler than last projections.**   \nThis goes hand in hand with the PCE inflation projections. Because PCE inflation projections ticked up higher the projections for when the federal funds rate will increase should also be earlier.   \n\n4. **The FED wont initiate yield curve control**  \nThe FED have no interest to initiate yield curve control which is understandable considering their amazing projections for the future. Jerome Powell did though wink to the bond holders that if yields rise too much they will step in.   \nThis is in my opinion the worst news coming out of this event. In a short period of time we have seen the 10 year treasury yield rally 240%, panic selling on the bond market like this has never been remotely close to happening since the 1970's and even then it's did'nt sell at the velocity of which it sells now. Even though we see bonds sell at this rate and record high trade deficits without notable economic growth the FED let it be. This tells me the FED either have a strategy they are not expressing or they have lost control of the bond market, meaning; the economy.   \n\n\nAfter the event we saw a huge rally in everything. I attribute this to the great projections the FED made for the coming years. Sadly, reality hit and we see the futures market push the lows of yesterday, we see bond yields go up even faster than before now standing strong at 1.731%, the FED is about to lose this chicken race with the invisible hand. \n\nWhat I am going to do: I've had the bulk of my investments in the European markets. This is something that has been talked about by CNBC and so on since mid 2020. I will still keep a trading account to make risky trades on the US markets and for the coming 3 months i will trade it as a bear. (This is not financial advise, you make your own decisions)   \n\n\n**TL;DR**   \nEven though we saw a rally after the FOMC meeting it was actually a fakeout.

{"title": "Play Magnus Group (PMGME:NO) - The Chess Long Play", "selftext": "TL;DR: Oldest game around commercialized with the newest tech around\n\n\nThis is going to be a very long DD, but it has all you need to know about the [***Play Magnus Group***](https://playmagnusgroup.com/).\n\n#1.Market\nChess is a unique and fascinating game in many ways, but most so in that it has a simple set of rules universally accepted across the globe. It essentially requires no more than a board and a few different looking stones, which makes it accessible to almost every person of every age on this planet. That already describes the biggest up- and downsides of it as an investment:\n\n ##Evaluation\nYou could say that the market is bigger than in any other industry. Not everyone who could, actually plays chess, but an estimated 650+ million people worldwide do, and surprisingly most still offline. At first it‚Äôs quite puzzling to think of ways to make money from it, since it's free for everyone and there is no form of copyright to the game. But the main point is that the money is not in boards and stones, but in the playing environment and more importantly the additional content available within this environment. As mentioned, the rules are simple but in the end chess is virtually the benchmark for [Bushnell‚Äôs Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law) of a game ‚Äúeasy to learn but hard to master‚Äù. Many people learn it just by playing, but if you really want to become a good player you need to seriously study games or get a professional trainer or both. And that is the selling point of a good contemporary chess venture which most people seem to miss:\n\n- Chess playing and broadcasting websites create market reach ‚Äì but not value! \n- Playing chess is free ‚Äì but coaches and good study material are not!\n- The online chess market is huge and still widely untapped!\n\n\n#2. Competition:\nThere are 3 major chess websites worth the mention. When discussing the [*Play Magnus Group*](https://playmagnusgroup.com/) in forums like this, one of the first arguments always immediately popping up is that the company‚Äôs playing site [*chess24.com*](https://chess24.com/) (which I will discuss in more details below) is basically [shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HikaruNakamura/comments/ldb3w4/i_mean_who_uses_chess24/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share) and has no chance against the main competitors *lichess.com* and *chess.com*. I will not fight on this topic too much but will just highlight some points to spark your own thoughts:\n\n- The preference for one site or the other is kind of subjective. Different people prefer different visuals/animations/sounds/etc. and also feel more connected to a certain user base to compete and socialize with. That is fair and should not be challenged too much.\n- Lichess.com can easily be called the overall most appealing playing site. But it‚Äôs open source without any paid content (100% free) and as a charity ;) I will not consider it as a competitor for the relevant markets in this analysis, simply because the best content creators will only put in so much of their valued time for free.\n- Chess.com is deemed the most successful ‚Äì and I guess you could say ‚Äúbest‚Äù ‚Äì chess website overall. It was the first one I signed up to years ago and it‚Äôs also the choice of 50+ million other users. It's by far the biggest playing community in the game. Many say it largely owes its success to the domain but I personally think that does not give the site enough credit. Surely the popular name was a factor initially, but the company did so many things right for so many years that you just have to admit it is undoubtedly a top address for chess which can be easily recommended to anyone interested in the game.\n- Many chess players, myself and almost certainly the current top 20 in the world included, don‚Äôt just use one site, but at least two of them frequently.\n- The market seems big enough for even more companies and good ideas and they will all help growing chess and increase each other‚Äôs success.\n- Play Magnus is the only publicly traded chess company I know of.\n\n##Evaluation:\nCompetition is good for everyone and will benefit the Play Magnus Group.\n\n\n#3. Business (Brands and Services)\nThere is a lot to talk about but I will try to keep it as short as I can. PMG has grown immensely both on the organic and acquisition side in very short time. Their current business can be divided into the following sections, which together build an absolutely unique and harmonized ecosystem fueling each other, set up for significant growth:\n\n**Play:** The company‚Äôs foundation and name patron is the [*Play Magnus app suite*](https://www.playmagnus.com/en), in simple terms a mobile game to play against machine versions of world champion Magnus Carlsen at different ages in his career. It has a related tactic trainer app and I believe the main app contains some interesting trivia about Magnus etc. I have to admit I have the least experience with this, since I prefer playing real opponents and also feel I would be too frustrated to constantly loose against a toddler or so. But the main app and the tactics trainer both have 1m+ downloads and a 4.2 star and 3.9 star rating respectively in the Play Store and I would say it‚Äôs one of the most innovative ideas to capitalize on the name of a famous chess player in many years.\n\n**Watch:** [*Chess24.com*](https://chess24.com/) was founded in 2014 and acquired by PMG in 2019. While I have mentioned above that it has serious competition for playing, the overall opinion on the best watching experience of all available services is pretty much set, with chess24 being the premier broadcaster of many world class chess events with major partnerships and presence on tv, twich and youtube etc. If you want to watch a big chess tournament in your language, you will one way or the other be recommended chess24 at some point.\n\n**Study and Learn:** PMG‚Äôs current driving force towards profitability and one of the main focus points for revenue acceleration is [*Chessable.com*](https://www.chessable.com/?page=landingpage). Co-founded by John Bartholomew, one of the first and most influential chess youtubers around, the site offers a one-of-a-kind learning platform and community with their science based learning software *MoveTrainer¬Æ*. You have to think of it like this: For decades players annotated and analyzed their own and other player‚Äôs chess games and extracted key positions and recurring patterns in order to collect and present them in a kind of analog quiz form in dusty books, for students to buy them and play through these lessons on a real board in long hours at home. Chessable.com is the polished digital 21st century version of this, refined to such a pleasing and simple user interface that any kid could learn with it, while having the feeling of directly interacting/chatting with a world class chess coach. For people who don‚Äôt play chess this may sound really nerdy and strange, but within the chess community things like these are regarded as an absolute game changer if not the holy grail of commercializing chess. When I started playing, online chess was already famous, but to learn my favorite opening the best I could find online was still a small private website with long annotation, text and some diagrams thrown in for all different variants. Today with a few clicks you have a chess Grandmaster video-teaching you the opening while you see the moves from famous examplary games played out on your screen, followed by an interactive quiz with encouraging comments for every correct or wrong move. It‚Äôs just nuts to me! And to emphasize the ecosystem aspect for you, in 2021 PMG has acquired the profitable company [*New in Chess*](https://www.newinchess.com/), world‚Äôs No. 1 chess book and magazine publisher and [*Everyman chess*](https://everymanchess.com/), another major publisher with the plan to integrate the best of their content into Chessable online courses. See, we speak about the rights to some of the greatest books and articles ever written by chess legends, waiting to be digitized and made digestible for the everyday chess Joe.\n\n[*iChess.net*](https://www.ichess.net/), acquired in 2020, also focuses on the e-learning through video courses. Most of the above applies here too, so I will not repeat it.\n\n[*Cochess.com*](https://cochess.com/) is another pillar in PMG‚Äôs strategy to dominate the market for professional chess training. You can select and book face-to-face chess lessons with one of the top chess coaches represented on the site. \n\n**Compete:** A real Pandemic-winner is the [*Champions Chess Tour*](https://championschesstour.com/), a series of 9 online tournaments throughout 2021 with 9 days of chess in each tournament and a historic prize fund of $1.5m fought out by the absolute world elite of chess. This is the second tour after the huge success of the first one in 2020. The PMG management continues to mention that the tour is not meant to be profitable (which I personally believe it actually is), but a catalyst for all other ventures of the Group. The concept is easy: tens of thousand of viewers drawn by the broadcast (peak viewership of the 2020 tour were around 200k viewers) get interested in the other great products of PMG and sign up for subscriptions. To finance the tour itself and increase its recognition the company partners with many fascinating names. The current 4th round is presented by [*Breakthrough Initiatives*](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/) which is backed by Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin. If you are already into chess or browsed reddit lately you may have seen the viral video of the [Bongcloud meme game](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/m5xzi1/magnus_carlsen_current_reigning_chess_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) between worlds No. 1 classical chess player Magnus and world‚Äôs No. 1 Blitz chess player Hikaru Nakamura, which happened in that tournament and got 1m+ views on Youtube in one day. It‚Äôs also really interesting to see how good the Play Magnus Group is in appealing to a new and young customer base e.g. with their great tour broadcasting team around the lovely Kaja Snare.\n\n \n**Outlook:** Describing potentials which I personally see for the company but are not material at this point, would drift too much into speculation, so I leave that. However, seeing PMG partner with [BCE](http://www.bestchessmenever.com/) for the beautiful new Play Magnus chess set only adds one additional income source to my imagination. But I have to go deeper into one particular thing which is already announced and will be one of the most important generic projects for PMG‚Äôs future: As mentioned [*chess24.com*](https://chess24.com/) is the group‚Äôs website to play online against opponents around the world. For competitors as well as the public perception this is one - if not THE - major point for brand recognition and gaining customers. Chess24 is seen far behind in this category mainly due to their poor UI and too few variants and time controls. Few frequent players online at the same time mean you cannot easily get paired with another player of your strength and that results in mismatches or long waiting times, which is a death sentence for a game moving more and more towards faster time controls. On March 3, 2021 chess24 has finally opened the long awaited [new playzone](https://chess24.com/en/read/news/try-out-the-new-chess24-playzone) for their premium members, although the timing when it will be finally available to everyone for free is still unknown. Well, guess who already uses the new playzone since last year? Absolutely! The champions chess tour is played exclusively on the new software, which means the world‚Äôs top professionals are free testers for the project. I don‚Äôt want to exaggerate the effect, but to me this feels like having all F1 drivers test a new Porsche model for a year before bringing it to the market. You get the point! I believe the new playzone will be the Porsche among the online playing sites and my guess is that it will be released latest towards the end of the tour in September 2020 (but probably much earlier).\n\n##Evaluation:\nIn terms of portfolio, there is no company in any other gaming field, which is better prepared to take over the huge market they compete in.\n\n\n#4. Management and Ownership\nProbably the part which I felt needed the least research after I saw how the company is managed from a strategical viewpoint. \n\nCEO Andreas Thome and CFO Dmitri Shneider convinced me in the presentation streams I have seen. They are straight forward about the company‚Äôs position and at the same time strike me as the kind of persons to not make any claims they can‚Äôt actually stake. Thome joined 3.5 years ago from Opera and Shneider left a strategic executive director position at JP Morgan to become COO at chessable before the acquisition by PMG. CTO David Kramaley came in as a co-founder of chessable.\n\nThe [Ownership Structure]( https://www.playmagnusgroup.com/investor/share-information ) is not too surprising. The 52.4m issued shares are listed on Merkur Market in Oslo with a current market cap of around $150m. Besides myself as a proud owner of a few pennies, there are of course some institutions/banks involved, while the founders of chess24 (9.5 %) and chessable (2.0 %) and obviously Magnus Carlsen (9.5 %) and his manager (2.0 %) seem to be the largest individual shareholders. It has to be mentioned that around 4.2m warrants were outstanding as per Feb 2021 which could move the price upon execution. I even believe this could be part of the reason why the stock is currently moving side-/downwards despite a very successful tour and positive financials.\n\n##Evaluation:\nI will probably take the shares to my grave, but anyone else is of course free to do what they want. The management to me is much above average for a company of this size.\n\n\n#5. Financials\nI have spent quite some time not only on all the above but also on the financials and I strongly suggest you look at this for yourself before you invest. With the size and age of the company the available data does certainly not allow a DFV-style valuation model. At a revenue of $7.9m in 2020 (vs. $2.9m in 2019) the company lost $16.0m (vs. $4.5m in 2019), mostly driven by non-recurring expenses e.g. for ramp up/hiring, acquisitions, share-based compensations, equity funding and exchange listing etc.  \n\nAt such a loss, PMG - similar to other growing tech companies - has to be measured by their growth rates, for which they use these KPIs:\n\n- Bookings (revenue that has been paid or contractually agreed to be paid) is up 196% YoY to $9.26m in 2020\n- Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU) is up 30% YoY to $18.4 \n- Monthly Paying Users is up 89% YoY to 44.3k\n\nThe balance sheet shows an almost debt free company loaded with cash ($35.3m; equals around 60 % of total assets) and intangible assets ($15m) which screams for more transaction announcements in the near future.\n\nThe officially communicated target is break even in 2022 and $60m+ bookings in 2025 (with the company overachieving all their quarterly targets in Q4 2020/21). At the current market cap this would value PMG at a revenue multiple of around x2.5. For reference: Pokerstars changed owners in 2019 for around x3 revenue while e-learning company Chegg currently trades around x30 revenue. I see PMG somewhere in between, with much room for phantasies.\n\n##Evaluation: \nThe company is healthy with a great plan. Obviously, financials (especially forward looking) alone are difficult to judge outside of all the context given above and I really recommended you make your own research here. \n\n#6. Momentum:\nI guess even before times of retail-investor-driven meme-stock-markets, trends had to be part of the investment consideration, but today the influence of informed young minds is more important than ever. Chess has never had more steam with all the hype around Netflix‚Äô Queens Gambit and the top reach on twitch where PogChamps and individual streamers like Hikaru with 1m+ followers brought it up to be (among) the top followed game(s) on the site. There are so many interesting and influential ambassadors for the game (just google the Botez sisters) which are as far from the dry image chess had for years as you could only imagine. The world chess championship in Dubai ‚Äì the world capital of influencers ‚Äì at the end of 2021 will pour more fuel into this. \n\nFinally I have to emphasize one important point in the context of the current attention for my favorite game: Many people think this trend ‚Äì and with it, the interest in the game ‚Äì will go away just as fast as it came. Now, I am a pretty average player and person but I believe chess is the most beautiful, interesting and entertaining game ever invented, and its unbroken popularity for centuries tends to support my belief. If people are like me, they will ‚Äì once drawn in by its beauty ‚Äì never drop the pieces again. If a guy who got hooked after watching [Fresh](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0109842/) in the 90s is still flame today, so will the gal who found chess for herself in QG2 in the 20s still be in in love with it in the 40s! There have been chess hypes before, but never did one company tackle the commercial side of the game like the Play Magnus Group does these days.\n\n##Evaluation:\n**For me personally, yes, I do find it's an attractive investment at this price point.**\n\n\nThis got even longer than initially expected. My last recommendation is: don‚Äôt spend money you don‚Äôt have based on strangers opinions on a messenger board. If you can‚Äôt afford shares, picking up a board and a few different looking stones or better registering for free to any chess website to learn the game is by far the better idea. I would even say it‚Äôs the best idea period!

{"title": "\"This could be the next TESLA\" and Powerpuff Girls", "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments with something in the lines of \"This could be next TESLA\", and while some are using it as a meme, others are serious and take whats being said pretty serious.\n\nI think one of the origins of this is fomo - fear of missing out, and I understand that, in fact, I think almost everyone understands that. We all have that unrealistic side that still hopes that we gonna hit the jackpot on a stock and get a lot of money. Everyone day-dreams and I think thats good thing, however it also needs to be compartmentalized.\n\nWhen you join FOMO, with day dreaming and companies like TESLA or Amazon (and in a way GME for a few) that enforce the latter, things can get a bit out of hand.\n\nIt is way to easy to get lost and end up both checking stocks that we now think its too late to get in (and oh no we just lost our chance of getting rich) or getting into some stocks that its more gamble than actually DD. And despite writing this post, I have at least one stock that I feel like is gamble and supports my day dream wishes of getting rich, the problem is not on having such stock, but rather build our portfolios based on that.\n\nSo when I see posts saying that X Company can be the next Tesla just... chill. Think that through, either if you are writing it or reading it.\n\nIn the first case have in mind that a lot of people might read it, people with different backgrounds, knowledge, hopes, dreams and also age. Don't over sell something but rather aim for getting comments like \"I think this has more potential than you are giving to it\". Comments like this means that people actually made some research.\n\nIf you are reading... well long-story short... do DD (there are plenty of posts warning about it).\n\nNow the \"Next TESLA\" thing:\n\nA company is many things and many things impact that company. Like Powerpuff Girls sugar ain't enough. What made Powerpuff girls was not only the sugar but also the Chemical X.\n\nExample:\n\nJust because Tesla has had a huge success on EV that does not mean that Seat will have the same success on EV too. Traditional auto brands aiming for EV and changing the their plans for the next years is not the Chemical X but rather the Sugar. I mean, lets be real, it was expected!\n\nChemical X in Tesla might be Elon itself, might be because it was the first big EV project that succeded, might be because a buch of reasons all together that... well, are unique to Tesla.\n\nThat doesn't mean that only Tesla has Chemical X and others don't, but rather don't think it something easy to find or easy to tell.\n\nNot every company will be the next TESLA (most likely 99% of them won't) and for sure something that several companies are investing it also won't be the next Chemical X.\n\nThe whole point of this post was just to getting this off my chest and, hopefully, reach to one or two users that really think that everything \"could be the next Tesla\" or believe it when someone says it will. They might be right but... if we were all right all the time... we wouldn't still be here but rather in our own Tesla's in a beach somewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsual Disclaimer: English is not my main language and I'm not a financial advisor, so considerer at given value.\n\nNot so Usual Disclaimer: I liked Powerpuff girls but I'm not the #1 fan.

One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).\n\nSome of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also serve all the major -commerce players. \\*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\\* -from the latest earnings call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: their exists alternatives(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.\n\nWhile when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.\n\nAnd although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.\n\nManagement's COVID handling is also praised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.\n\nAlso, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)\n\n[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still).\n\nOther alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.\n\nThis stock is not for the faint of heart.\n\nManagement also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).\n\n[10-K report.](https://wallmine.com/doc/edgar/0001082923/000108292321000033/stmp-20201231.htm)", "id": "m7vbsf", "created_utc": 1616086668.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Well, if you bought [stamps.com](https://stamps.com) stock you're the big winner here.

That means if I buy through Amazon and USPS loses the package which they did a lot this year, when the customer gets refunded for missing the fulfillment promise the money comes out of Amazons pocket not the sellers. Until USPS gets as reliable as UPS, that‚Äôs going to be a very important consideration. Also Amazon passes on much better rates on UPS than many sellers can get on their own. I‚Äôm not quite sure what level of volume you would need to get comparable rates, it tends to be something that is negotiated on an individual basis. So when I sell on other marketplaces my personal preference is using Pirate Ship for USPS. They are free compared to I think about $80 a month with shipstation. They integrate with EBay beautifully and anywhere they don‚Äôt integrate with its an easy cut and paste.

{"title": "$LAC - Securing America's Lithium Supply - DD", "selftext": "Lithium Americas Corp TSX:LAC NYSE :LAC\n\n# Summary\n\n* With increasing demand for Lithium I wanted to find a Lithium producer that has strong reserves and upside in the medium to long term\n* LAC has the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America and the largest-known lithium resource in the United States\n* These two assets are under development but are nearing completion. Price dipped recently but based on their existing assets and recent analyst price targets LAC seems like a decent investment\n\n# Lithium Background\n\nI wanted to understand how Lithium is extracted to make sure I could gauge the viability of the lithium mining companies I was looking at. I summarized my findings below if you are curious. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022. [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/lithium-production-2340123#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20extract%20lithium,increasingly%20high%20concentrations%20of%20lithium.)\n\nTpa = Tonnes Per Annum ‚Äì essentially how much Lithium they can extract on a yearly basis\n\n# Market Overview\n\nTo summarize ‚Äì Lithium demand is expected to grow exponentially. 2 main factors:\n\n1. Falling Lithium prices over the last 3 years reduce investment in Lithium production globally\n2. Surging demand for EVs and shift to green energy\n\n**Lithium prices continue to soar ‚Äì up 88% in 2021** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/lithium-prices-continue-to-soar-up-88-in-2021/)\n\n**Schlumberger unit to launch Nevada lithium plant as EV demand rises** [**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-schlumberger-energy-plans-lithium-134649877.html)\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt heard of Schlumberger check them out, they are the world‚Äôs largest oilfield service company. If they are shifting into the lithium production space then the leadership team sees value and growth here. Also from the article ‚ÄúDemand for battery-grade lithium is projected to grow exponentially, driven by growth in the electric vehicle market, and efficient production of the metal has become an important topic for regions, industries, and technology companies.‚Äù\n\n**Battery grade lithium prices in China surge 68%** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/battery-grade-lithium-prices-in-china-surge-68/)\n\nWhile lithium‚Äôs majors are beginning to reengage in expansion plans, three years of falling lithium prices have failed to incentivize sufficient investment into the supply chain, leading to greater risks of price volatility as battery demand ramps up.\n\nTrading Economics forecast of Lithium Prices [here](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lithium)\n\nThe prices here are in yuan/tonne so if we use a conversion rate of 1 yuan = $0.15 USD. Assume price is around 80,000 yuan/tonne then it is about $12,000 USD/tonne\n\n# Lithium Americas\n\nLeadership is one of the key aspects I look at when considering an investment. Most of their leadership team has 20+ years in lithium or resource production. They have a CTO who has 1-\\_ year of lithium processing experience and used to work for Tesla. Check out their investor [presentation](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf) for a bit of background, but essentially from what I‚Äôve seen they have a strong management team.\n\n2 Main sites under development for Lithium\n\n**Cauchar√≠-Olaroz, Argentina (Brine Extraction)**\n\n* Cauchar√≠-Olaroz is the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America\n* Partnered with Ganfeng Lithium on the jointly owned operation in Jujuy, Argentina\n* Average production 40,000 tpa battery-grade Li2CO3\n* After-Tax NPV10% is $1.5 billion\n* Quick math: 40,000 tpa x $12,000 USD/tonne = $480M USD annually\n* Note: Production doesn‚Äôt start until 2022\n* Capital expenditures for the Project remain on budget with $477 million (84%) of the $565 million committed, including $388 million (69%) spent, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n**THACKER PASS LITHIUM PROJECT (Clay Extraction)**\n\n* Developing the largest-known lithium resource in the United States\n* 100% owned by Lithium Americas with offtake rights uncommitted\n* On January 15, 2021, the US Bureau of Land Management issued the Record of Decision following completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process.\n* All remaining state permits and water right transfers required to commence construction **are expected later this year.**\n* Top ten biggest lithium mines in the world [here](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) **Thacker Pass Lithium Project is #2**\n\nSummary of March 2, 2021 Full Year and Q4 Report\n\nI highlighted some key points and provided commentary to their recent Annual report\n\n* ¬∑ As at December 31, 2020, the Company had $148 million in cash and cash equivalents ($518 million as at February 28, 2021). **great position to be in, especially with heavy CAPEX projects, especially with amount that has been spend in Argentina**\n* ¬∑ On January 22, 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock and issued 18,181,818 common shares at a price of $22.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $400 million (approximately $377 million net proceeds). **This is big especially if you look at the current price**\n* On November 30, 2020, Lithium Americas completed an at-the-market equity program (‚ÄúATM Program‚Äù) and issued a total of 9,266,587 common shares from treasury for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million ($97 million net proceeds). **Price was \\~$10 a share at this point in time**\n\nLink [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-reports-2020-full-122600429.html)\n\n**Analyst Price Target**\n\n* High: $30.50\n* Average: $21.42\n* Low: $16.00\n\n# Risks\n\n* **Nevada Permits** ‚Äì This is always an unknow, they expect to receive permits by mid to late 2021.

{"title": "Optimizing capital for premium", "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying I am very familiar that the concepts of delta, ITM probability, the fundamentals of the underlying and whether or not you are comfortable owning a stock play a very important role in the selection of a CC or wheel strategy. \n\nThat aside, I am curious if anyone has any strategies that involve selling options (or wheeling) on stocks that have the highest rate of return relative to capital investment. For example, AAPL, currently sitting at $122, has a Mar 26/125 call going for 1.35. While this premium may be appealing given that the delta is .3 and the underlying is a company as reliable as Apple, the ROI is absolute dogshit. You are committing over $12,000 to make $135 a week. SOS on the other hand currently sitting at $8.40 has Mar 26/10 calls for .60. This means for the same capital investment, you could instead make (12,000/840)*60 = ~$850 a week. AMC, another volatile stock sitting at $14, has Mar 26/16 calls for 1.15 equating to a premium gain of $985 a week. \n\nAgain, I am very well aware of the fact that both SOS and AMC are much riskier investments than Apple and the potential loss in underlying value would greatly outweigh the premium gained, but I believe that if volatility remains high over time you could more than make up that loss through selling weekly calls at lower strikes relative to your cost basis. I have been sifting through the market all morning and looking through IV screeners and have yet to find any stocks that have as high of a ROI than these two.
