The price the stock is trading at tells you nothing about the business. So you need to analyze the business using fundamental metrics and then also its strategic competitiveness for example do they have a moat etc. When you analyze using fundamentals you can then value the business how much its worth and you  compare this to what it’s trading on the stock market. If the price on the market is below the value of the business then you buy. If above you don’t. (Btw this is oversimplified but I think the correct thinking is there). MPL uses the stocks prices to come up with a portfolio of stocks that have a good risk/return characteristic. Risk under MPL is treated as volatility but that is a very limited view. Risk should be treated as the risk of unsatisfactory returns and loosing all capital. The best example how using volatility as risk is Buffets example when he bought the Washington Post.

Or should it hit max on Monday because 1 of them is in ITM?\n\n10/15 is pretty far out there. I don't usually trade options with more than 60 DTE.\n\nForget about break-even at expiration. It only applies at expiration, hence it's full name. What matters is how much you paid for the spread and what it is worth now. Say you paid $0.30 for it.

All that matters is what the market is valuing your spread at today.\n\nForget about \"maximum gain\". You just said yourself that you keep making a mistake trying to get more out of a winning trade. \"Maximum gain\" is the same mistake, particularly as it comes with maximum risk. Instead, is the gain you have now a good gain? If it is, exit the entire trade by selling to close.\n\nAs advised in our [FAQ wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/subreddit_resources), have an exit strategy planned out before entering a trade.

The reason is because I already have 100 shares that I sell covered calls on, and have long out call options below my sells so if someone exercises my call, I can turn around and rebuy the shares at a lower cost. With that, if I lost all value on this spread, I would have made more off selling CC, and if it drops that bad I could buy back my sold $2 call and be left with the 10/15 $1 call. \n\nBut honestly, how does this sound to you?

For debit trades, shorter holding time and going further out than 20 days reduces theta decay, while keeping costs down by not going beyond 60. For credit trades, 45 DTE hits the sweet spot for risk/reward, as shown by numerous backtesting studies.\n\n> But honestly, how does this sound to you?\n\nSounds overly complicated and overly concentrated to me, fwiw.

So you’ve bought this spread with a debit $0.35. This gives you the right the buy shares at the price of $1, and a potential obligation to sell it at $2. Your maximum gain occurs when you’re able to fulfill both of these contracts. Even if the stock trades at $5, you’ll still need to sell it at $2 to fulfil the contract - so you therefore do not see any additional profit after the stock trades more than $2. The Max gain here is then $0.65: the $1 you get from buying it at $1 and selling it at $2, minus the $0.35 cost for opening the position. \n\nHowever, you won’t see this max gain until expiry, so unless you want to wait until 10/15 to see it through, I’d recommend closing this position once the profit has approached close to $0.65.

{"title": "Quest Diagnostics ($DGX) DD - An Undervalued Dividend Payer", "selftext": "\\*long post\\*\n\nHi guys!\n\nToday I'm going to be talking about a pretty boring dividend payer: Quest Diagnostics. They've seen a good run-up during COVID and they showed up on a PE screener I ran recently, so I figured I'd check it out.\n\n**Business**\n\nQuest is the world's leading provider of diagnostics and testing. They actually end up serving about the equivalent of one-third of the American adult population every year which I find staggering. They've seen a spike in revenue (see revenues section for more detail) during COVID as they were the first actor in the testing space. Normally, I'd go into more detail by breaking down their various business segments, but Quest only operates in one segment so this section will end up being short.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\n[TTM Revenue 12/31/10 -> 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/YYI1qTz)\n\nAs you can see, after 9 years of stagnation, Quest finally got a major pickup from COVID. Now, they have to take this opportunity to continue growing. They document some of these strategies in their recent 10K. To cut through the corporate jargon, I'll summarize the 4 points:\n\n1. **Strategic Acquisitions:** Besides providing an opportunity to grow, acquisitions allow Quest to extend its footprint further. Personally, I think an attempt to break into foreign markets could be good if done right, however, this would be very difficult due to varying regulatory standards.\n2. **Partnering with Others:** The idea here is simple. By partnering with health plans, IDNs, etc, they can increase market share and become a go-to provider for advanced diagnostics tests. They've been successful in implementing this thus far as evidenced by a 2020 Anthem partnership.\n3. **Provide more Tests:** Nothing much to add here, it's pretty self-explanatory. By offering more solutions, they can drive growth through more facets.\n4. **Increase usage of their consumer solutions:** Quest saw large growth in their QuestDirect platform. QuestDirect is a consumer-initiated testing platform. This means that you can order tests to do at home or a Quest Patient Center or you can ask questions online.\n\n**Revenues**\n\n[TTM Revenue 12/31/15 -> 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/OU9lCd0)\n\nQuest has grown revenue 22.12% YoY, 27.57% over the last 3 years, and 26.03% over the last 5. Just by looking at the chart, you can tell that a large portion of growth came from the pandemic, but quantifying that makes that fact even more apparent.\n\nMoving to Net Income, you're met with the same story on a more drastic scale. YoY, Quest has increased net income by 66.28%. Quest has grown net income by 85.71% over the last 3 years and 101.41% in the last 5 years.\n\n**Margins**\n\nQuest currently has a net margin of 15.16%. This is encouraging compared to their historical margins. 3 years ago, their margin was 10.43% and 9.42% in 2015. Comparing that with its competitors, Labcorp has a net margin. of 11.13%, Buffett favorite Davita has a net margin of 6.70%, and Abbott had a net margin of 12.99%.\n\n**Assets/Liabilities**\n\n[Total Assets 12/31/15 -> 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/OsVbxNQ)\n\n[Total Liabilities 12/31/15 -> 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/CHGjnJB)\n\nAs you can see, both Total Liabilities and Total Assets have increased about the same amount over the last 5 years. The only difference here is that they have significantly more assets than debt. They have a current Debt/Equity ratio of 0.59x and interest payments are well covered. To look a little deeper, subtracting long-term debt of 4.01B from total liabilities of 7.22B and we see that Quest has 3.21B in short-term liabilities. Quest only has 1.16B in Cash on Hand which means that there's 2.05B in short-term liabilities that aren't covered by cash. While this isn't amazing, it's expected and I would be very surprised if this wasn't the case.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nQuest has grown Free Cash Flow by 71.94% over the last 3 years and 184.41% over the last 5. This is promising as it implies they'll be able to continue dividend growth. Speaking of dividends....\n\n**Dividends**\n\nQuest currently pays a 1.92% annual dividend ($2.24 quarterly) which is well above the average health care dividend yield of 1.54%. On top of that, it's a consistent dividend. Quest has a 22.64% payout ratio and had grown its dividend for 9 years prior to COVID. They lowered their dividend 1-cent to $2.21 focus their capital on testing, however, they are back to growing with the next yield being $2.24, 2 cents above their previous highest yield in 2019.\n\nQuest's next ex-dividend yield is April 6th.\n\n**Price Ratios/Other**\n\nThis section aims to go over all of the relevant ratios and percentages that didn't fit anywhere else. I'll show the ratios on the chart below, and then I'll break them down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ratio|Quest|Labcorp|DaVita|Abbott|\"Good Value\" for Sector|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PE Ratio (TTM)|11.20x|9.82x|14.32x|31.78x|<15|\n|P/B Ratio|2.29x|2.44x|7.25x|6.23x|<2x|\n|P/S Ratio|1.69x|1.67x|1.14x|6.05x|<2x|\n|P/FCF Ratio|10.05x|15.36x|9.55x|45.58x|<15x|\n|ROE|23.04%|19.47%|39.81%|19.37%|\\>20%|\n|PM/RG Ratio (My personal creation)|0.58x|1.99x|30.73x|4.30x|<2.5x|\n\n**PE Ratio**\n\nI said a \"good\" number for this sector may be under 15x. The problem is this number cannot be universally applied. While Abbott does supply testing solutions, they are also a supplier of drugs that has grown revenue significantly faster than others and have seen more consistent growth since their spin-off of Abbvie than many others in the testing space, including Quest.\n\nThat being said, Quest has the second-lowest PE in the testing space and looks pretty attractive from this angle.\n\n**P/B Ratio**\n\nI said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 2. Other than Abbott, many testing providers have exhibited choppy growth and a temporary boost as a result of COVID, so I'd like to see them trading pretty low compared to book value. Interestingly, none of the major testing providers were below 2x. This could mean 1 of 2 things.\n\n1. Many companies in the testing sector are overvalued compared to book value.\n2. My P/B number was unreasonable and arbitrary.\n\nI'm inclined to believe the latter, but I'd be interested to see what you guys think.\n\n**P/S Ratio**\n\nI said a good P/S Ratio was 2x (same as my P/B threshold), and this time, some companies actually qualified. In fact, most of them did with DaVita trading at a low 1.14x P/S Ratio, Labcorp coming in with a 1.67x P/S Ratio, and Quest coming in closet third at a good 1.69x. Overall, P/S Ratios look good all-around.\n\n**P/FCF Ratio**\n\nI'm pretty new to using this ratio, but I identified under 15x to be a good multiple. When I Google what a good p/fcf ratio is, the consensus is 20x, but since many of these companies have stagnating revenues, so I decided to hold them to a higher standard. The only two qualifiers here are DaVita and Quest with DaVita coming in at an impressive 9.55x and Quest coming in at a cool 10.05x. So far, these numbers are looking good for Quest.\n\n**ROE**\n\nI was looking for an ROE higher than 20% here, and we again saw Quest and DaVita being the only qualifiers with Quest coming in at 23.04% and DaVita producing an impressive 39.81% ROE. If you're going to have potentially stagnating revenues, you should really be good at efficiently generating capital, and that's what Quest is.\n\nTo break down Quest's ROE further, let's look at their historical ROEs:\n\n|Quest Ratio|2010|2015|2017|2018|2019|2020|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ROE|18.51%|15.73%|16.10%|14.05%|15.47%|23.04%|\n\nLooking at this chart, we're told a different story. Quest historically never broke 20%, it was only because of COVID that they recently broke through. That means that next year (2022), we could see a return to 15-16% ROEs. Let's compare this trend with DaVita's historical numbers:\n\n|DaVita Ratio|2010|2015|2017|2018|2019|2020|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ROE|17.82%|5.17%|12.98%|3.70%|24.65%|39.63%|\n\nWhile it looks like DaVita had an ROE of above 20% before COVID, this drastic 2019 move can be attributed to UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of DaVita, not an improvement in the underlying business.\n\nThe takeaway here is that these high ROEs are likely temporary, and they will go back to historical levels once COVID is no longer a threat.\n\n**PM/RG**\n\nThis is a ratio I thought of myself this last week and I'm excited to see what you guys think of it. I wanted to find a ratio that could measure how rational price movements were, however, I couldn't find one. I ended up creating a pretty simple ratio to measure it. While I may change it up in the future, I think it works for now.\n\nThe Ratio works by dividing the price percentage movement over some period by the revenue percentage movement over the same period. So, for example, if ABC's price went up by 50% over the last year and their revenues only went up by 25%, they'd have a PM/RG of 2x.\n\nI decided to measure price and revenue movements from 1/1/2020 -> now. I put an ideal PM/RG ratio down as being <2.5x. Normally, I'd want to see it be under 2x, however, since testing stocks have been a big beneficiary of COVID, I decided to give a little more leeway. The only two companies that qualified here were Labcorp and Quest. Labcorp had a PM/RG of 1.99x and Quest 0.58x.\n\nI'm very surprised with Quest's PM/RG. They only appreciated 58% compared to revenue. To me, this could be a *potential* indicator that Quest has been undervalued by the market.\n\n**DCF Valuation**\n\nAssuming a -1% 5yr Revenue CAGR, an 8% Discount Rate, a 22.4% EBITDA Margin, and a Terminal Revenue Multiplier of 3.8x, Quest's fair value is $188.48 (a 59.8% upside from the current price of $117.96). Let's go over some other scenarios to give ourselves a range.\n\n**Bullish Valuation**\n\nI think I find it highly unlikely Quest will be able to capitalize on the recent increase in revenues to continue growing, but that'll be what I'm assuming in this scenario.\n\nWith a 1.5% Revenue CAGR, an 7% Discount Rate, a 22.4% EBITDA Margin, and a Terminal Revenue Multiplier of 3.8x, Quest has an implied Fair Value of $225.89 (91.5% upside from the current price of $117.96).\n\nAgain, this scenario is **VERY** improbable, but I figured I'd include it just for an idea of the theoretical max FV.\n\n**Bearish Valuation**\n\nI'd peg this as unlikely, but plausible.\n\nAssuming a 5yr Revenue CAGR of -2.5%, a 9% discount rate, a 20% EBITDA Margin, and a 3.5x Terminal Revenue Multiplier, Quest has a Fair Value of $151.86 (28.7% Upside from the current price of $117.96).\n\n**PE Valuation**\n\nI use the PE Valuation as a way to sanity check my DCF Fair Value. Using an average 1 year PE of 14.51x and a current TTM EPS of $10.47, we get a Fair Value of $167.83 (43.10% Upside from the current price of $117.96). As we can see, the PE Valuation is pretty in line with the DCF Valuation we came up with above.\n\n**Risks**\n\n1. **Regulation:** A large part of the Biden Administration's agenda was based on making healthcare more affordable. While it could be all talk, the Democrats having majority control of the Senate and the House make any regulation Biden proposes is fairly likely to be passed. This could drive down profitability throughout the Healthcare sector.\n2. **Competition:** This is going to be a risk no matter what sector you're in. There are a lot of large testing providers, so there's always a chance margins are driven down by a competitor's more effective and cheaper test.\n3. **Failure to produce new tests:** The title is pretty self-explanatory. If Quest stops being able to license and create new tests, their revenue growth will slow/stop. The FDA being overwhelmed by COVID treatment/vaccine cases could make this risk a reality.\n4. **Failure to defend IP:** If Quest fails to protect their Intellectual Property and they lose the rights to exclusively market their tests, competition will be driving down margins more aggressively than before.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'm bullish on Quest. They're significantly undervalued and even with declining revenues being assumed over the next 5 years, they're still trading >35% below Fair Value. Compared to competitors, they've appreciated very little and their safe dividend makes this a good long-term hold.
