{"title": "$$$ FDX DELIVERING YOU RETURNS...massive upside in call options going into ER, DD inside", "selftext": "TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are inexpensive and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings.\n\nEDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm\\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm\\_medium=Social&utm\\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=SocialMedia)\n\nBelow are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, which should run into ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\\_massive\\_dilution\\_incoming\\_easy\\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).\n\n* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:\n   * Record Black Friday shipping\n   * Record Cyber Monday shipping\n   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&J vaccine\n   * Record Holiday season shipping\n      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping\n   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))\n      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs\n   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too\n   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))\n* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99\n* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.\n* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.\n* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.\n   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.\n   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever from yahoo finance. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger\n      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.\n* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.\n* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit. My positions are below, I gave it a bit more time to play out.\n* Positions june 300c and 320c\n* &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nj2c8l7akam61.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10f90e6bba4ab3ac987d39899f330df010966ec", "id": "m2d40d", "created_utc": 1615421613.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Great write up man.

{"title": "Selling far OTM puts 1-2 years out", "selftext": "With the whole downtrend over the past couple weeks, I've been considering doing something rather stupid and just not looking back again for long time. However, apart from early assignment and the stock of course going down, what else is wrong with doing this. Looking at TSLA for example. If I were to sell a 2 year put at $1500, I'm required to have at least $30k in my account and I'll receive about $95k.\n\nFrom my understanding, as long as the stock price is anywhere above $550 at expiration, I'd make a profit. Max is above $1500 obviously. So if I'm assigned early and it's above $550 that's chilled, but if it's below and there's no other funds in my account, I'll get margin called, right? Now here's the thing I'm struggling with. If that were to happen, are you given any time to meet the margin call requirements ( assuming it's significantly below $550 ) and if so, assuming the premiums are roughly the same as now, selling a 2 year call ATM would go for about $27k and I think that might cover any margin requirement I may need ( unless it goes to absolute shit to like $100 or something ). I know I'd have to sit down and work it out to figure out the exact numbers, but does this sound absolutely retarded or like I might be on to something?\n\nAlso, I know that when you sell calls those sometimes might get assigned early if there's some dividend or something coming up, but is there a legit concern to worry about with puts being assigned early? Especially on something 2 years out?  \n\n\nEdit: And one more thing. I don't know if I'm understanding this correctly. TastyWorks allows you to have 2x buying power for stocks. So... $30k + 95k premium = $125k. So even if I bought 100 shares at $1500, that would mean only needing $25k in margin. I know I must be missing something because this seems a little too good.

This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings.\n\nEDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm\\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm\\_medium=Social&utm\\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=SocialMedia)\n\nBelow are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, which should run into ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\\_massive\\_dilution\\_incoming\\_easy\\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).\n\n* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:\n   * Record Black Friday shipping\n   * Record Cyber Monday shipping\n   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&J vaccine\n   * Record Holiday season shipping\n      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping\n   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))\n      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs\n   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too\n   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))\n* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99\n* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.\n* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.\n* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.\n   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.\n   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever from yahoo finance. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger\n      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.\n* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.\n* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit.

This bubble has in part been created by mainstream energy analyses that have, for the last decade, significantly underestimated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from conventional power plants because they assume these plants will be able to successfully sell the same quantity of electricity each year from now through 2040 and beyond. This assumption has been false for at least ten years. The rates at which conventional power plants are utilized will continue to decrease as competitive pressure from near-zero marginal cost solar photovoltaic and onshore wind power, and battery energy storage continue to grow exponentially worldwide. \n\nSince 2010, the LCOE figures published in mainstream analyses and used by policymakers, regulators, civic leaders, utilities, asset owners, and investors have significantly underestimated the actual cost of electricity generated by prospective coal, gas, nuclear, and hydro power plants. This in turn means that conventional energy asset valuations are heavily overstated.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I forwarded the youtube link of this to about a dozen people this morning... so much discussion from some older relatives trying to get me to diversify into \"good dividend stocks\" like exxon.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Pff exxon had like 20billion in losses Q4 2020..

{"title": "What is High Frequency Trading (HFT) and what does it do to stocks? [Explained]", "selftext": "First of all I have to congratulate to all apes that hold this attractive stock with their diamond hands, and shoutout to everyone who even bought the rediculous dip that we all witnessed yesterday (10th).  \nSo I want to explain what HFT is and how the ultra rich use it.   \nSome of you might be too young to witness and some heard of these mega bubbles like the \"dotcom bubble\" 2000 and the \"real estate bubble\" 2007-08.   \nYou might have heard about the movies of Wall Street, Margin Call or Boiler Room that are based on the events that happened before.\n\nLets get this straight. Market Manipulation has always been a part of the stockmarket. Such as insider buying or selling with large orders.(For that you could as a normal trader find still a way to be profitable) but with internet and technology that just got better and better over time, the softwares with High Frequency Computer Trading/Algorithm have changed this market manipulation that we see today.   \nSo what is this software?  \nSuch software is capable of doing trades in milliseconds. They are used to drive stocks up rediculously high or down. It gives the people that are watching this an optical illusion that a stock is being bought with momentum or sold with force. So good luck being a technical trader.\n\nBy selling stocks as soon as they buy them, the HFT is manipulating price differences.  \nFaster trades = more money  \nIn HFT it doesnt matter how much money is moving in each direction per trade, its the amount of trades the program can make in a split second thats important.\n\nSo if you can make like 10.000 trades every second and arbitrage 0.0001 cents per trade, thats 1$ every second.  60$ every minute and 3600$ every hour.  \n\n\nAnd then there is fake news. If someone decides to create panic, they simply make some news. Post it. \"Ape stuck in Bananaprocessing machine, production halted\". And as soon as this is posted, the stock of your BananaCompany that you have invested in, has dropped before you could even react onto it.\n\nAnd who loses money? The normal investors. Mostly retailers. So if anyone talks that a retailer is able to manipulate a market while these big boys have 70-80% power over it, thats fake news.\n\nWe can prolly give it momentum, but that's all. \n\nBut the real battle is between the bigboys themselves. Because each one of them has such a machine, and it must be better than the other, in order to win.   \nSo what these programs are designed to do apart from making trades in milliseconds, they also FAKE in milliseconds.  The Trade orders are sent  to throw a kink into competing programs. Many trades are just made to flood the market and trick other computers+investors into thinking that a trend may be occurring in a particular stock, when no trend really exists.\n\nSo these programs are made to read feeds and analyze data, but they cant varify wether this data is true or not. So wether the ape stuck in bananamachine and the production is halted news is true or not, the stock will fall because the bot reads it. The same way when you play an online game, the program cannot see and decide wether you are sabotaging the game or you are just bad af. But if you for example write some words, especially negative, they immediatly strike you with a ban.\n\nHow do we know we are in a bubble? When you make cash easy. And the bubble grows exponentially higher when these bots are included aswell. And why will the stockmarket crash? Because of easy money. \n\nSo some should consider after this bubble bursts, that trading might not be the same again. Then we talk about a bearish market. And as normal  trader it is impossible to beat the market. If you wanna invest, invest in a company that you believe in a longterm growth. GME will be one of a kind thing.
