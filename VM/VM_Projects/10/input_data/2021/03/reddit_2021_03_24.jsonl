Disney worlds have opened back up i‚Äôm pretty sure. As the vaccine progresses, and more people are also vaccinated, their growth should be linear with the amount of people coming. However, as you say in your post, growth worries for disney+ are pretty reasonable. Because just like the disney WORLD growth, disney PLUS growth is also linear. As people return to work, unemployment should go down, and thus people won‚Äôt be as home as much. What they did, in making disney+ was a great idea though, amid all the lockdowns. I would say it‚Äôs kind of like having two spreads. A spread strangle kinda. SOME people will ALWAYS want disney+, despite its price increases, just for the exclusive shows. So I would say until those stop and the movies are the newer thing again, it should be a pretty stable service once the people who just wanted to watch the shows and stuff get out for the movies. However, keep in mind movies are much more expensive with their ticket prices, so the monthly thing might be more attractive. On the other hand, said movies may only come out every 1-2 months, and people just like seeing it on the big screen. So I would say eventually movies and disney world and Disney+ are at a stand off right now, but one should take over the other in sales, although the disney+ subscriptions should be more stable as long as the mini-series community stays in. \n\nI would say that it should definitely go up, especially once the vaccine is main stream and plenty of people have it (Think 70-95%) and the disney world and movies start to roll out. But who knows? On paper the subscription service is better because IF, and I say IF disney moved all their movies to just the subscription, then that would force in a new group of people all paying monthly (or just a month or use the free trial to see the movie) which would over take the movies (since they‚Äôd be out) and also increase sales higher than with the movies. The reason I would think this is because AMC, and whoever else (tbh I only go to amc and my local theatre) want a cut for those movies, and with disney not having to pay those, it would be better for them.\n\nIn conclusion: This is not financial advice, and just what I think disney could do in the future. However, I would just hold, as inevitably those dirty, greedy brats who want good deals on their stocks will come flying back into the nest. In other words: *I* personally would just hold, especially with a theta that low. Also, the more ITM (In the money) your option gets, the more you can earn with it (Delta gets higher).\n\nEdit: Also I kinda felt bad since nobody answered your question so I made this. Good luck!

The competition is out of control. My young nieces and nephews don‚Äôt watch Disney channel or disney classics over and over again like I did, they watch YouTube.  Children today are exposed to 1000x the media and entertainment options I had when I was a kid, and I‚Äôm not some boomer.\n\n2. Recent Disney movies have sucked; There is a real risk Disney has lost its touch for making good movies. The remakes they are churning out are soulless cash grabs made for parents nostalgia and the children today aren‚Äôt growing up watching the Disney classic or Disney renaissance movie being made. Major failures like Mulan, Aladdin, and Lion King remakes show a real corruption of Disney‚Äôs once creative storytelling process that they might not be able to get back. Tangled and Frozen 1 were the last really good Disney classic-like movies and frozen was released in 2013. \n\n3. Disney + is already maxed out; I don‚Äôt pay for Disney +, I share an account with 8 other extended family members, I have several other friends that all do the same thing... you want to know what they will do if Disney cracks down like Netflix is pretending to on account sharing? Just cut the service all together. The generation that started Napster and limewire as teens are raising kids now... they aren‚Äôt going to struggle to pirate content they want. \n\n4. Parks are too expensive; Parks are no longer the middle class affordable weekend/summer getaway. They are now extremely expensive vacations that a middle class family will have to save for to go for a week. Disney also just eliminated the season pass pulling the rug out from some of their most loyal fans. This is not an exaggeration, my wife loves Disney, we have priced it out multiple times, it has been cheaper for us to go on week long safaris across Africa or hike Machupicchu than spend a week at Disney so we did that instead. The price for a family of 4 to go to Disney world and stay on property is well over $1,000 a day, and that‚Äôs without flights, other transportation, limited meals, no park hopper, parking, or any other standard vacation extra expenses. It‚Äôs actually insane. \n\nAll these things point towards a further erosion of the relationship between the average American childhood experience and Disney as the years go on.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 24, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.\n\nMarket participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that ‚Äúeconomic recovery is far from complete‚Äù and reiterated the Fed‚Äôs commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy ‚Äúprogressed more quickly than expected‚Äù. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying ‚Äú we should be clear-eyed about the whole we‚Äôre digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.‚Äù While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. \n\nAfter a slow start last year, the US‚Äô vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. \n\nThe rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a ‚Äúthird-wave of the virus‚Äù. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to \"wash up on our shores.\" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After years of false starts, New York state lawmakers said Wednesday that they had reached an agreement to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use by adults starting next year. The bill is set to be taken up next week by the state Assembly and Senate, lawmakers said.\n* The industry group for cruise operators has called for federal health authorities to allow cruise lines to start sailing out of the U.S. by July and to scrap a framework for sailing resumption that has been in place for nearly five months.\n* Tesla Inc customers can now buy its electric vehicles with bitcoin, its boss, Elon Musk, said on Wednesday, marking a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency's use in commerce. \"You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin,\" Musk said on Twitter, adding that the option would be available outside the United States later this year.\n* Intel (INTC) recently announced plans to invest more than $20 billion in order to ramp up their capacity to produce chips.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect the price at close\\*\\***\n* Digital Turbine (APPS) target raised by Maxim Group from $85 to $111 at Buy.

{"title": "What are your thoughts on Curiosity Stream?", "selftext": "I'm not going to mention the ticker because of HF data mining, but it's the first 4 letters of the company's name.\n\nCuriosity Stream, in case you're not familiar, is a relatively new streaming service that produces their own content and focuses on fact-based programming. Their service costs $20/year, and there are frequently discount deals available for 25% off. Note, that's per year, which comes out to $1.67/month; compare to sector behemoths Netflix @ $8.99/month for basic or $17.99/month for premium and HBO Max @ $15/month. That tells me that if Curiosity Stream gains significant mainstream market share, there's a lot of potential for increased revenue per customer, but in the meantime, it's inexpensive for prospective customers to try out.\n\nNext point, this isn't some little fly-by-night operation. A lot of the same people who were involved in the Discovery Channel are involved with Curiosity Stream, including their founder, John Hendricks, who also founded the Discovery Channel, and their board includes several big names from the entertainment industry. The way I see them, they're basically the streaming-era reincarnation of the Discovery Channel from the 90s, before reality TV became popular and Deadliest Catch set the format trend on the channel. Among their planned original content releases for 2021 is a documentary series on Jane Goodall's conservation efforts with chimps in the Congo, produced in partnership with the Jane Goodall Institute, and featuring unreleased footage from a three-decade span. Can you apes honestly say that doesn't sound like a series worth checking out?\n\nWhat I like even more is that I see their name all over YouTube. They seem to sponsor a LOT of educational YouTubers, and they've partnered with Nebula, a small streaming service founded by YouTubers to circumvent YouTube's advertising policies and content filter, so you can subscribe to Curiosity Stream and get Nebula for free. Their YouTube presence and educational focus means they have a lot of exposure to younger demographics, who could grow up thinking of Curiosity Stream with the same fondness that I remember the Discovery Channel of old.\n\nThey made an IPO in 2020, becoming the first educational streaming provider to go public, and their  share price quickly more than doubled from $10 to its peak at $24. It dropped back down and seems to be stabilizing around $17, but in the downtrending markets of the past week, it's dropped below $15, which I personally believe is a very attractive entry opportunity.\n\nThe one professional analysis I've found set its target price at $25. I'm relatively new to trading, so I don't know how much I should buy into that one analysis, but yesterday's Q4 and FY results were very strong. From [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323006005/en/CuriosityStream-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323006005/en/CuriosityStream-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results):\n\n* Revenue for the full year 2020 of $39.6 million, up from $18.0 million in 2019;\n* Gross margin for the full year 2020 at 61%, consistent with gross margin of 62% for the full year 2019;\n* Net loss for the full year 2020 was $(38.6) million compared to net loss of $(42.5) million for the full year 2019;\n* EBITDA for the full year 2020 was $(38.6) million compared to EBITDA of $(44.1) million for the full year of 2019; and\n* Ending cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments totaled $42.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThey are also projecting $71 million in revenue for the upcoming year, an 80% increase over this year, after more than doubling it this year compared to last. Holy revenue growth, Batman!\n\nThe chart shows what looks like a golden cross about to form on the 1M, 3M, and 6M time scales, although today's 1D chart is pretty ugly (unless you're buying the dip). The price is currently at the bottom Bollinger band, with a downward trend, but the SMA has hovered around $17 for the past two weeks after finding support at $14-16 for the previous three months:\n\n[Here is a pretty chart for you crayon-munching apes](https://preview.redd.it/dvaxv01tx0p61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25e5b99097ad012424d862cc2d88f7325bed75b2)\n\nThe stock broke its bullish run (green lines) after peaking at $24 in February, moving into a bearish wedge (red lines) that should be resolving within the next week or so, somewhere around $14. From the DD I've been reading, it seems that wedge resolution should lead to a breakout one way or the other, and with the upward support diagonal and the strength of the company after yesterday's report, I'd be surprised to see a negative breakout. There's also a support diagonal forming with a slight upward trend (blue lines), which could be the start of a new bullish run.\n\nIn my smooth-brained ape opinion (which, to be clear, is not financial advice), this ticker looks appealing at any entry under $15 in the short-to-medium term, and appealing at any recent price in the long term. Based on the fundamentals, I feel like it's a strong candidate for a long position, that will almost certainly rise above $20 in the next year or two and could feasibly double its value more than once within the next 5 years. And while they almost certainly won't be the next Netflix at $500+ per share, I would not be surprised to see their price rise into triple-digits over the next decade if they are able to sustain their strong growth trend. They seem well-poised to capitalize on this year's explosive growth with new original content.\n\nThis is my first DD here, so please poke holes in it and tell me what my smooth brain missed.\n\nTL;DR - Curiosity Stream (the Discovery Channel of the streaming era) looks like a strong candidate for either a long position or a medium-term swing trade, but I've only been trading since February and would appreciate either confirmation bias or constructive criticism", "id": "mcezan", "created_utc": 1616615711.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Not a financial analyst, but if they are losing 38 mil this year and probably losing 10-20 next year comparing to the recent growth, if they have just 40 mil in cash that seems really tight.
