{"title": "High Level Analyses on SPY Gains/Losses for Bear Call Credits Spreads", "selftext": "This is High Level, a Macro view of the strategy, explained in plain English the way I interpret and understand things. Still a freshman at this so this is not in the weeds technical, as that is not my current style but I appreciate those styles of communication. \n\nNotes are at the bottom. **This isn't a guarantee strategy or play. In my opinion, during this current market condition** it's seems like the highest probability of winning for a strategy.  I don't do CCs because I don't  want to be limited to owning individual stocks by the 100s. I like Spy as it is the most liquid and tracks the S & P 500 and is the standard for benchmarking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# If you are considering playing weeklies Bear Call Credit Spreads\n\n7/20/2020 to 7/16/ 2020 on weekly period\n\n[A quick glance and you can see there is more gain than loss, however I removed Highs & Lows and focused more on Closing prices, so this data doesn't account for volatility intra day, Highs, Lows. ](https://preview.redd.it/adopm63hl0c71.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcdf1189fd0aa8464a8afd73f38becd243f7dd55)\n\n    2. Highest Gain  on a weekly basis :\n    \n    \ta.  $19.96 on Nov 2nd 2020\n    \n    \tb.  $13.99 on Feb 1st 2021\n    \n    \tc. $10.79 on Oct 5th 2020\n    \n    3. Highest Loss  on weekly basis \n    \n    \ta. ($15.59) on Oct 26th 2020\n    \n    \tb. ($13.60) on Jan 25th 2021\n    \n    \tc. ($9.51) on June 14th 2021 \n    \n    4. So the Average Gain on SPY weekly basis is $5.39\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Based off this weekly period on this chart, SPY gained above $10 only five times out of 53 weekly periods, again doesn't account for intraday Highs\\/lows](https://preview.redd.it/xtetrowkl0c71.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=4595aa22b4fe5385d0d91dd48c0747a401af8126)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. So with this simple math, if you played a bear call credit spread based off previous closing price and set your short strike about $8-$10 above current price, with a width between strikes @ $2, return on collateral will be around 10% and will give you a higher probability of winning. Depending on volatility that day you might have to add more time to your spread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Setting the short leg, near At-the-money,  $2-$6 ,above current price is riskier, decreases chance of profit but **higher reward 16-30% return on collateral** .  I've had many winning trades doing this but you'll get a few losing trades, playing it this close, it will fucking sting. I think if we are playing very conservative monthlies then shooting for strikes price near At-the-money is ok, if all the stars are aligned on your setup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Obviously regardless of return, we must take profit in pieces  **aka trim up** **( drop this all or nothing mentality)** and if the trade goes completely against you during intraday due to volatility , you close it out because you are not an idiot and this is **100% within your control when you close out.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. So after you close out your trades on average you might be around 6% return a week, after commissions and/or taking profit early bringing you around 50-80% profit on trade, if you are shooting for 10% return a week. This excludes losses. It's impossible to get 6-10% return consistently, you will eventually have a lose trade to cut early or break even. However,  once you increase your capital to a certain point, you might become more conservative shooting for 4% return per week, thus have a higher strike prices above current underlying price, giving you more margin of safety and higher chance of profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Playing above $8 - $10 of the current price, can provide a higher probability of win **but it's important to add additional analysis strengthen your thesis** : seasonality analysis, mainstream media, technical analysis of\\\\\\[ gap theory, support and resistance, supply and demand zone, RSI, 20 EMA, VWAP,\\\\\\], Economic data releases, Fed talk, VIX and bond/yield prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If Spy drops more -1&#37; or $5 in a day trade can be closed for 80&#37; profit ](https://preview.redd.it/s3m9b6fpl0c71.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3db3d6b7fa8fb71c56de0399c4e48b539a121ed)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# If you are considering playing Monthlies bear Call Spreads\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\tGains per month was stellar in 2020 but since 2021 it has been on a downtrend. remember Trend is your friend](https://preview.redd.it/0wdzcrx8m0c71.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=34940b8a617b4454ace6d42dcf2ce25b16ceddd6)\n\n    1. Highest Gain $42.50 on April 1st 2020 - right before the crash \n    \n    \ta. $31.86 Nov 1st 2020\n    \n    \tb. $ 20.99 August 1st 2020 \n    \n    2.

So setting your short strike around $20 above current price, with  $2 width strikes, potential is 16% return on collateral for the month.  I would most likely make this play my Main strategy, as it is a true theta play. I haven't start this yet but I will on Monday, 7/19th,2021. I've been doing weeklies but will be doing both.\n2. Since it is a monthly play, seasonality chart, earnings, major fed talks might be the main additional analysis. Any other suggestion let me know below.\n3. Chance of profit is higher due to theta decay and higher strikes prices, you basically have to watch paint dry. However, if SPY violently sells off this can be closed out sooner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If Spy drops below -2&#37; or $8 from current prices in a day or few days, trade can be closed and create close to 80&#37;+ profit ](https://preview.redd.it/zvk7x3hfm0c71.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fb05294b58e56724729bb120e64ae66a843a44)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Some notes:\n\n1. Remember even though we are using a Bear Call Credit Spread, its real objective is being **neutral and playing above All Time highs**. Its a bearish and neutral strategy.   The thesis is SPY can't keep breaking records on a weekly or month basis, due to economic stresses and pullbacks/ corrections is healthy and needed.  As you know supports levels can ALWAYS be broken faster than rising prices for S & P 500. It's incredibly hard for financial professional to \" **call a bottom or have a date when the market will crash**\". Again This data above  is just based off closing prices during a weekly and monthly period, **it doesn't account for intraday highs and lows, so volatility will change projections.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  I'm not religious to only doing bear Calls, I've done Bull Puts on SPY as well, mostly after the correction in March 2021 then I went to 80% bear mode. Now I do think it makes sense to do Bull Put Spreads on QQQ, supply chain weakness, high earnings, consumer demand & spending, re-opening, economic stimulus and FAAMNG on going performance. There's just some gaps in SPY that need to get filled, **gap theory** is part of Technical Analysis..do you see the gaps that need to get filled?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The goal is to **be consistent income selling options,** for Financial freedom or time freedom. By having your expenses paid by selling options. I've tried dropshipping, running a youtube channel( I still run it), real estate investing( very slow- low returns still building), and  being a realtor(I'm still licensed,) they don't COME CLOSE to selling options. **The barrier of entry for selling options is literally free education and time.**\n\n*No license needed, no human interaction and no direct sales to consumer.*\n\nHowever it is still important in having a multiple streams of income/asset/strategies/opportunities for the goal of being wealthy and having a fulfilling life. So don't put all your eggs in one basket, **UNLESS you a temporarily**  devoting 100% energy to understanding and learning the skill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Average expenses for an American, that want to live a modest yet fulfilling lift could be $5,000 per month. US Bureau of Labor($5,102)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. So Capital requirement for collateral needed would be $12,500 to \\*\\***potentially  generate 10% return a week**\\*\\*, $1,250 per week. Obviously if its $12,500 cost to run this business of selling options, your portfolio value or cash on hand, emergency fund should be at least, minimum, 3x value or $37,500 or 33%. It be reckless to use 100% of your hard earned cash. **\\*\\*Start off small and just focus on returns now dollar value! Better to get the practice in now and than later.\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other ideas**\n\n6. Since saving hard earned income is much harder, even on average $70k salary, one should engaged with **low capital\\*\\*(1-10% of cash or Portfolio value)\\*\\*** on a calls, leaps, debit spreads on fundamental sound companies or even meme stocks. Yes I said meme stocks, if played correctly and using gambling/HIGH risk money that **\\*\\*you are willing to lose\\*\\*,** you can increase the level of your portfolio. That’s how many of us end up in r/thetagang. Now if you got plays and you can't sleep at night, keep decreasing the amount of money you are using.\n\nCurrently I risk less than 2% of Portfolio value for certain RISK plays( non credit spreads) if the opportunity presents itself. At 2% I can sleep well at night.  I don't force these opportunities, I watch for trends in volume and sentiment. So I typically execute 3-5 trades per month. Also Same principles applies, close out trades if it doesn't go your way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Extra short note:\n\nGenerate Income weekly and Monthly\n\nHave some gambling plays, so you don't have to keep feeding your portfolio with hard earned money\n\nRe invest into long term investment.", "id": "omxand", "created_utc": 1626635955.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "I use to trade 0dte bull credit spreads on SPY.

This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through as well, whom I'm expecting beats from all across the board. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [collateral plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7c0wj/mitigating_risks_and_maximizing_returns_using/), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I57fF-zCVw1OV_jHUnY-brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I57fF-zCVw1OV_jHUnY-brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Steel stocks move in tandem with one another.** $CLF and $NUE will put up their numbers on Thursday morning, and the market will then price ***all other steel stocks accordingly***. That means if $CLF/$NUE are up, the rest of steel gang will also be up bigly. The flipside is also true. If either tanks, they'll take down the respective companies. If you're looking to make a steel play, I would look to play $MT or $X options instead of $CLF/$NUE options, as they will move roughly the same amount, **but they won't get IV crushed.** Those looking to roll the dice should look to enter a position Wednesday before close, as that's when the options will be the cheapest (thanks to theta gang).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Airline stocks also move in tandem with each other.** Similar to above, $AAL, $LUV and $ALK all report Thursday morning. If you're looking to make a collateral play, look to play $DAL or something to avoid the IV crush. ***Alternatively***, you can also look to go long or short on the entire sector through $JETS. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we’ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. This is key, since we’re going to get a large move in $JETS as the *entire sector* will fly (lol) or crash after Thursday since the market will price all airline stocks, not just $AAL and $LUV, based off of the $AAL and $LUV earnings. On average, airlines move around 4.5% post earnings, so we should see a comparable movement in $JETS. If we get such a move in $JETS, we’ll have at minimum a five bagger on deck. More information about this [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *under 6%* on both sides of the chain. What really makes this pricing weird is the fact that Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO. If you're gambling on this one, the odds are *really* in your favour. That being said, maybe Wall Street knows something, I've honestly got no idea. The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I57fF-zCVw1OV_jHUnY-brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

{"title": "Market Perspective: Recent Trends and Performance in Charts", "selftext": "Since the volatility in mid-late May I’ve been generally bullish on the market: it seemed that nothing could accelerate meaningful downside move and this I think was further proven with the post-FOMC reaction of a small stumble and then right back up.  And while I’ve continued to be bullish more recently, I have been looking at and discussing metrics and commentary around market breadth and the authenticity of this latest move to ATHs.\n\nLet’s look at some charts to build context:\n\n[SPY vs RSP 1y](https://preview.redd.it/yle3no63h1c71.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=64d46c316f0f5d2f747a9b588dbb2daf068c77e5)\n\n[SPY vs MAHP 1y](https://preview.redd.it/m3fz1fl6h1c71.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a9e328184bf854a5efab5e38ec73bc98ebebdfe)\n\n[SPY vs S5FI 1y](https://preview.redd.it/6m20ma08h1c71.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eaedcdde07a1210d9b6e6a1954afa31adac129f)\n\nIn the first chart we compare the performance of the SPY to the RSP, the latter being the equal-weight S&P 500 index. We can see that while the SPY has bounced to new highs from the mid-June low, the RSP has traded largely sideways. At first this may look similar to previous patterns in the chart where the performance has diverged, but this is in fact a divergence of direction - one going up and the other sideways. This is still a nascent pattern in my opinion, but a worrying sign if this continues.\n\nThe second chart shows the SPY vs the percentage of S&P 500 stocks making new all-time-highs, the latter of which continues to hover in a range around %10. For example on Friday only \\~%9 of S&P 500 stocks closed at ATHs.\n\nOur last chart shows the the SPY vs the S5FI, the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 50DMA at close on any given day.\n\n**What this might tell us is that this recent rally has been narrow**, in other words lacking broad participation and fueled by a few select stocks dragging the index higher. That’s generally not considered a healthy move and can be indicative of a stall-out or perhaps a setup to some downside.\n\n# Charts\n\n[Sector Compare YTD](https://preview.redd.it/sgry11wgh1c71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad34b9039846d9a9935075677bfa19ae4c3d159)\n\nSo while the indices have moved higher as of late, there doesn’t seem to be a particular sector that’s been leading the way, and in fact it seems like we’ve had more downside than upside moves sector-wise through the last few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY 1y](https://preview.redd.it/fo853knih1c71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd6fccda486fad70f89af13121e21f16f42894ff)\n\n[QQQ 1y](https://preview.redd.it/ez3qhqijh1c71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=d982b8f8b1084ff0f6c3af8a0ce931c4914fa20e)\n\n[IWM 1y](https://preview.redd.it/zu3rf7hkh1c71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c5d8c73f63e7edc6226e2d5fb31bf2364f23ae7)\n\nLet’s also take a look at the RSP and ARKK charts:\n\n[RSP 1y](https://preview.redd.it/b3pzay5nh1c71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=394227ea5d3e071fea09fe25f67694d336512ff0)\n\n[ARKK 1y](https://preview.redd.it/724bj75oh1c71.png?width=2107&format=png&auto=webp&s=d02ac5846db3cbb2ac0954995b2b082a8073beb4)\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n* ARKK, representative of the growth trade, seemed like it had taken a turn for the better but then stalled out around the 130 mark which seems to be overhead resistance. It’s since given back a good bit and with it now below it’s 200DMA I wonder if we’ll continue to see further downside here.\n* I think the RSP here tells us a lot. It’s been in a tight range for awhile now and failed to make new highs in concert with the SPY which again is a real indicator that a handful of stocks are dragging the index higher.\n* IWM continues to be range-bound, but I’m getting the feeling we could test the lower end of that around the 208-210 area soon given recent performance.\n* SPY and QQQ don’t look terrible, especially with last week’s stumbles cooling off RSI, but as I’ve discussed here the credibility of this rally is in doubt.\n* As mentioned above, it's hard to see any clear leader here in terms of a trade, but also hard to see a meaningful pullback happening either. Perhaps this earnings season will be the catalyst for some well-defined action/direction going forward.\n\nI think at a high-level I buy in to this idea that we’re in a “phase two” of this bull market, where phase one has aggressively pulled forward valuations and now companies must prove their stock’s worth. This likely means a more challenging environment where we trade sideways at the index level and investors must find alpha at the individual stock level, and I think this has really been the case since February or March this year.\n\n# What I’ve Been Reading\n\n[Variant Perception - Phases of a Bull Market](https://www.variantperception.com/2021/07/17/phases-of-a-bull-market/)\n\n[FT - ‘Strange’ bond reaction to US inflation data puzzles investors](https://www.ft.com/content/26f6be41-61b7-4db8-b190-90a1f26c1424)\n\n# Bonus Charts\n\n[UBER 1y](https://preview.redd.it/jisik687i1c71.png?width=1957&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1bb8d6d747694030b8c8d8f7306f8dcf869a0fc)\n\nI think UBER has been breaking down for awhile, and this setup looks like it could yield further downside as we’ve broken below this lower trendline, the 20/50DMAs have turned down under the 200DMA… it just doesn’t look great.\n\n**Previous:** [https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oie2lz/market\\_perspective\\_recent\\_trends\\_and\\_performance/](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oie2lz/market_perspective_recent_trends_and_performance/)", "id": "on00fy", "created_utc": 1626644328.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|34|**First Seen In WSB**|7 years ago\n**Total Comments**|212|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Monday will be interesting.
