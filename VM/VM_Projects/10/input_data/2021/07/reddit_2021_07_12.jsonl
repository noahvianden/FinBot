{"title": "Anyone can beat the stock market, new research suggests", "selftext": "[https://fortune.com/2021/07/11/how-to-beat-the-stock-market/](https://fortune.com/2021/07/11/how-to-beat-the-stock-market/)\n\n BY [**GEOFF COLVIN**](https://fortune.com/author/geoff-colvin/)\n\nJuly 11, 2021 9:00 AM CDT\n\nIs it possible that ordinary individual investors, without the help of ultrafast computers or a PhD in math, can reliably beat the stock market? \n\nSixty years of [Nobel Prize-winning theory](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-prizes-in-economic-sciences/) say no, it is not possible. But just maybe it is. Ironically, the widespread belief that it’s impossible helps to make it possible.\n\nTo see how, recall a high-buzz stock market event last December 21, when [Tesla](https://fortune.com/company/tesla/#:~:text=Tesla%20is%20an%20electric%20vehicle,before%20the%20start%20of%202021.) became a component of the [S&P 500](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf). [Research Affiliates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/home.html) chairman [Rob Arnott](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/about-us/our-team/rob-arnott.html) and colleagues made a [bold prediction](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/819-tesla-the-largest-cap-stock-ever.html): [Tesla](https://fortune.com/company/tesla) stock “is likely to underperform the market (S&P 500) in the year after entry” and “[Apartment Investment and Management](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2006/apartment-investment-management-company/), the stock removed from the S&P 500 to make room for Tesla, is likely to outperform the index over the next year by as much as 20%.”\n\nToday, just over six months later, the only flaw in that prediction is that it may have been too modest. The S&P 500 is up 17%. Tesla is indeed underperforming badly; it’s flat. Apartment Investment and Management (known as Aimco) is outperforming the S&P, and by way more than 20%; it’s up 44%.\n\nArnott, whose firm develops investment strategies used in managing $166 billion of assets worldwide, argues that what happened is no fluke. It’s a particularly dramatic example of a predictable phenomenon that can be exploited by traders.\n\nThe opportunity, he says, is in the fundamental nature of index mutual funds and ETFs. Their objective, obviously, is to track the performance of an index, which means tracking it exactly. The index fund industry has become intensely competitive, and any divergence of a fund’s price from the index’s movement, known as tracking error, will be seized upon by competitors as evidence that the fund is poorly run. The danger of tracking error multiplies when one stock replaces another in the index. The reason: To avoid tracking error, every index fund wants to buy the new stock and sell the departing one at the closing prices on the day before that day because the index will be calculated on that basis. The result is trading mayhem on the trading day before the switch.\n\nFor Tesla traders, [the big day](https://fortune.com/2020/12/20/tesla-stock-tsla-share-price-sp-500-berkshire-hathaway-procter-gamble-johnson-johnson-spx/) was Friday, December 18, and trading mayhem duly ensued. On each of the previous few days about 5% of the company’s outstanding shares had been traded, but on December 18, 23% was traded as indexers stampeded to buy the stock as near to the closing price as possible. The price jumped 6%, then fell all the way back down the following Monday.\n\nBut that’s only half the story for Tesla or any other stock being added to the index. The S&P U.S. Index Committee [announced](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/tesla-joining-sp-500-tsla-stock-market-profits-spx-index/) Tesla’s addition a month in advance, on November 17, 2020, and for the next month hedge funds and other traders bought it up, knowing they could sell it to index funds that had to buy it on December 18. Partly as a result, Tesla rocketed 57% in that month from the announcement until December 17.\n\nFor Aimco it was the opposite: Over the same period, its stock fell 17% as investors dumped it.\n\nThe trading opportunity is obvious: Buy the outgoing stock, which has been pounded down, and sell the incoming stock, which has been pushed to the sky, on the big day before the switch becomes effective. Those opportunities occur fairly often, about ten times a year on average, Arnott’s research shows. Over the past 20 years, an average of 23 stocks have been exiled from the index annually, to be replaced by 23 newcomers. Most of those deletions are practically automatic when a company merges, is bought, or goes bankrupt. The rest are discretionary switches, like Tesla-Aimco, and those are the ones to focus on.\n\nIt isn’t necessary to follow the formula exactly. Individual investors may not own any of the incoming stock to sell and may not have the stomach for short-selling. That’s fine. Just buying the outgoing stock works great, on average.\n\n“Stocks being dropped from the index inevitably are deep value stocks that have performed badly, are struggling as a business, and are dropped at distressed prices,” Arnott says.\n\nHis firm’s research finds that buying the outgoing stock in discretionary deletions from the S&P 500 at the closing price on the day it’s removed from the index has beaten the market by an average of nearly 20% over the following 12 months.\n\nThat is supposed to be impossible. The efficient market hypothesis holds that any reliable system for beating the market will quickly become known and almost immediately be arbitraged away as traders jump aboard. Why hasn’t it happened in this case? “The big force that prevents it from happening is the sheer scale of the indexers,” says Arnott.\n\nNearly $5 trillion of assets are indexed to the S&P 500, says the index’s parent, S&P Global. When the managers of all that money must buy a particular stock and sell a particular stock on a given day, almost at a given hour, that’s an opportunity for other traders. Everyone knows it’s coming, yet it doesn’t get arbitraged away because not enough money is trying to do so. In part—here’s the irony—that’s because so many trillions are invested in a wide array of index funds on the belief that picking individual stocks doesn’t work.\n\nInvestors in S&P 500 index funds are the losers. Consider that the fund giants wage war to attract customers by offering the lowest expense ratio; for [Vanguard's S&P fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFIAX) it’s four basis points, for [Charles Schwab's](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swppx) it’s two, for [Fidelity's](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911750) it’s 1.5. Yet the annual cost to clients of rebalancing for additions and deletions is 20 to 40 basis points on average, Arnott calculates.\n\nThat cost, which is significant over time, can be at least partially avoided. A strategy of rebalancing three months after the effective date rather than the day before the effective date has beaten the index by 13 basis points on average over 18 years, Arnott and his colleagues found. It seems an easy way for a fund to improve its performance. But index funds don’t do it because it would introduce tracking error—and never mind that it would be positive tracking error.\n\n“The indexing community has trained customers to think zero tracking error is the goal,” Arnott says. “Even positive tracking error is bad.”\n\nIndex funds on the whole are a boon for investors. Turns out they can be a boon in an unexpected way. An S&P 500 rebalance, says Arnott, “is a great opportunity to do the opposite of what the index does: buy the deletion and sell the addition.” It may not pay off in every rebalance, but over time it “has historically proven to be an excellent investment idea.” Even if it is supposed to be impossible.", "id": "oiq0hd", "created_utc": 1626091995.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Many investors can beat the S&P500 index.

{"title": "Help please - how is this legal?", "selftext": "Hi, \n\nIf I have got any of this wrong I apologise and please point it out to me, I have a mediocre idea on how stock markets work, not fantastic, but not a small amount either. \n\nFor context I am in UK, and this relates to etoro UK (broker) \n\nOn Thursday 24th June , Bed bath and beyond (Ticker BBBY Nasdaq) was due to open. \nPremarket was around 4%/5% positive. \nMarket is due to open at 2.30 pm UK time. \n\nAt 2.30pm, market open, there was a surge in buying for this stock. \nEtoro did not open the market. \n\nThe stock went all the way up to 8% positive, \nAnd etoro did not open the market. \n\nThe stock then took a turn, peaking at 8% positive, all the way down to 2% positive. \n\nEtoro finally opened the market. \n\nThat was 18 days ago, and I have only got a reply from them today. \nI have had a long ongoing chain of emails with etoro looking for an explanation, but I will paste their last reply, below, as it is the only real answer they have give me (it is in quotes) :\n\n“Please understand that it is paramount for eToro as a broker to provide optimum trading conditions for our clients and the safest possible environment in which to enjoy the diverse array of financial opportunities we offer. Our ability to uphold this commitment is dependent on market conditions and liquidity or lack thereof.\n\nMuch like our price feed, the market hours listed on our Market Hours page are indicative and whilst we aim to open and close the markets at the times indicated, it is not always possible. On rare occasions where we see price gaps and/or severe volatility on a given instrument, we may decide to either delay the opening/closing of the market or to disable it temporarily during the active session until we deem it safe to resume trading. \n\nThe extent of these limitations is at eToro's discretion. We may decide to disable an instrument on one side only, in which case the Buy or Sell button will be grayed out, or we may decide to temporarily disable trading on the instrument altogether.\n\nIn the Case of the Instrment BBB, kindly note that due to having an elevated volatility while the market was opening, our safety mechanisms kicked in and this instrument was deemed safe to trade a few minutes after the opening.\n\nSuch preventative measures are always taken in the best interests of our clients in order to minimize the risk of them receiving inflated spreads and/or poor execution. \n\nThank you for your understanding and apologise for any inconvenience. \n  \nShould you require further assistance or information, please reply to this message or chat live with us during our business hours.”\n\n\nThis leaves me with more questions than answers: \n\n1. A broker can just open the market when the market suits them, no questions asked, regardless of the profit/losses suffered by their customers? \n\n2. This was a CFD trade, so neither me or etoro likely ever owned the stock, so why prevent me from selling it? Has etoro got a serious cash flow problem?\n\nI have a hell of a lot of more questions, and my apologies about the format of this , I am writing it on my phone on break at work. \n\nIf anyone can make sense of this and let me know if it is even legal?", "id": "oiv93r", "created_utc": 1626108700.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Unfortunately anything these companies do is legal, as it is at your own risk that you decide to trade with them. \nNow for the closing of the market part.

{"title": "My Weekly RIG DD with Technical Analysis", "selftext": "Good afternoon fellow traders,\n\nI'm continuing my RID DD with my weekly chart and technical analysis.  \n\nPreviously, the focus of my RID DD has been reviewing the fundamentals.  My previous DD with technical outlook is here for reference:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ocejdt/rig\\_revised\\_dd\\_with\\_new\\_technical\\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ocejdt/rig_revised_dd_with_new_technical_outlook/)\n\nContinuing with what was discussed previously, I'm going to focus on 3 key items that have or will impact RIG's price action in the near future:\n\n1. Geo-Political risks/uncertainty:  Obviously, one of the biggest drivers in the price movement of oil and oil-related stocks is the recent OPEC meeting.  Unfortunately, OPEC could not resolve their core differences and concluded their 7/2 meeting without an agreement.  This certainly is not welcoming news for the oil industry since the expected result was an increase of oil output by 400,000 BPD, but UAE threw a monkey wrench in the whole thing and blew the deal up.  So, in the near term.  This is somewhat reminiscent of a few years ago when OPEC couldn't agree on their output, combined with U.S. oil shale, which leads to an all-out production war that drove down the per-barrel price to the 30s.  Obviously, the market is concerned about another similar event and the market hates uncertainty.  I believe this will be short-lived given the fact that none of the OPEC nations wants to see oil prices fall again, the price should stabilize around the 70s and then start slowly climb back up to the mid-70s to low 80s in the short-term.  That would benefit any oil sector stocks and drillers, RIG included\n2. Day-rate for drillship:  One of the key metrics that indicate the health of the industry is the day rate for the drillships, semi-submersibles, and jackups.  While the semi-submersible and jackups are flat, the drillship's day-rate has been increasing and approaching $250,000 per day price. This bolds well for RIG since they primarily operate drillships for deepwater and harsh environments.  Given the past consolidation of the deepsea drilling industry and the increasing material cost and lengthy building cost, there is a huge barrier to entry in this industry, thus given RIG a defensible moat around its core business\n3. Technical trend:  The last important factor is the current technical trend of RIG stock price.  Since November of last year, the stock has been following an upward trend line shown below \n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slqrqdwl5ua71.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=925c3699454feb54f8d3b705294ab025d5b44a04\n\nI believe that we'll continue this pattern and test the trend line during the ascend.  \n\nAdditional technical analysis: \n\nTuesday:  With the uncertainty of OPEC, which stirred high oil price and potential inflation concerns, RIG price crashed through $5 support and shortly the secondary $4.81 support as well with heavy volume.  This does not bolt well for RIG in the short term as it sets the $4.81 as the immediate resistance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dj56tt37ua71.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f8391a4197c1b32413acc2216648f9284323c20\n\nWednesday:  RIG tried to get to the $4.81 resistance and failed to do so and heavy sell volume around 10:30 pushed RIG to a low of $4.3, which appears to be the short-term support for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dus8809l7ua71.png?width=1511&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7b8ac694b7de80a05b94e9696f1ac968c7e5fb\n\nThursday:  In the initial first hour, RIG maintained the short-term $4.3 support and the rest of the day RIG slowly inched higher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eibwbowv7ua71.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=3973906930d5a3d7cd5e464213febb9e9cd93aab\n\nFriday:  On Friday RIG gapped higher but without strong follow-through and drifted lower throughout the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkvj8drc8ua71.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde1cc56c70b3333af8d1e34dc748f6bcfb9df26\n\nLooking ahead:  \n\nOverall, the technical still remains for RIG that it is following its trend line moving higher and it could test its lower trend line in the near term, but I expect it to bounce off the trend line and continue ascending.\n\nThe overall macro and micro conditions for RIG remain in tack.  The recovery is still ongoing and the demand for oil and oil-related product will continue to increase.  Once the geo-political uncertainty is addressed, I expect oil prices will continue to creep upward, which will coincide with RIG.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer:  I/we are currently long RIG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nx1lwbb9ua71.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=805f8f60f5613baf50de1e5187c7319ff192532d", "id": "oiz8rr", "created_utc": 1626120409.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|61|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oa9yp3/rig_supply_and_demand_for_oil_and_recovery_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ocejdt/rig_revised_dd_with_new_technical_outlook/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oa93l7/rig_the_next_potential_short_squeeze_target_quick/) \n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "RIGGeDD", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Rigtard", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What's your price target for RIG if WTI goes to low 80s?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "RIG should already be way higher than it is.
