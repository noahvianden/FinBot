{"title": "I thank I've come up with a great selection of Trading 212 pies. Most are based on my individual investments and background/experience in tech.

So I came up with this selection, which ranges from popular EV manufacturers like Tesla and Nio to battery and component stocks. They've performed very well individually and the great thing about this pie is that I can re-adjust the weightings when needed. Currently Tesla and Plug Power are very prominent due to current growth but it won't last forever and then I will be moving more into the component space (e.g. batteries and lithium)\n\n**5G, Semiconductors & Microchips Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xcy8h4](https://prnt.sc/xcy8h4)\n\nI follow Fool.com who were heavily promoting 5G stocks but I didn't want to pay for the subscription. I did my own research and this is a collection of stocks I have been investing in for around 1 year and they've all seen excellent growth. This is the pie that I'm most confident about long-term. With the exception of AMD and Nvidia Who are fairly well-known, many of these of stocks aren't known very well in terms of the brand names involved but they play a significant role in our lives and I expect will play an even greater role in the years to come. I'll be updating this soon with a couple of additional stocks that I've been tracking.\n\nYou'll notice a pattern as many of the companies feature across pies, especially in the semiconductor/chip space. The ones below are more speculative based on my research. I don't have as much experience investing in these sectors but I feel they have great potential and would really like to get feedback on these:\n\n**Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Energy Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xa4nmv](https://prnt.sc/xa4nmv)\n\nThis one is linked to my EV pie but with more of a broader focus on energy solution suppliers working in the Hydrogen space.\n\n**Uranium Mining & Energy Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xa4lsr](https://prnt.sc/xa4lsr)\n\nMany of these stocks are near an all time low given uranium/nuclear power's lack of popularity historically, but times are changing and demand for uranium and nuclear is growing so I can only see this going up in the years to come.\n\n**Crypto, e-Payment Platforms & Blockchain Pie**\n\n[https://prnt.sc/xa4me0](https://prnt.sc/xa4me0)\n\nMany of the players here are well know and are getting on board with crypto in a big way, e.g. Visa, PayPal, DocuSign, etc. Others provide the chips and hardware to make bitcoin/crypto mining possible, e.g. AMD and Nvidia.

{"title": "Daily Market Recap - Thursday, January 21, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 21, 2021**\n\nStocks continued rallying today, with the three major indexes setting fresh record highs for the second day in the row as market participants continued to look ahead towards the policy implications of the new Presidential administration.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted its best Inauguration Day return since Ronald Reagan‚Äôs second inauguration in 1985, according to an analysis by LPL Financial. And the index‚Äôs move from Election Day to Inauguration Day was its best ever, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 14% between Nov. 3 and Wednesday‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs remarkable how well the market held up despite the political unrest and widespread claims of election fraud. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve actually been very surprised by how the market has really brushed aside all the political issues that we‚Äôve had in the first three weeks of the year. I would have assumed coming into the year that had the Democrats swept the Senate, the House and won the presidency that the markets would have sold off on the back of a potential increase in the corporate tax rate in the future,‚Äù said John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management\n\nPresident Biden began his term yesterday by signing roughly a dozen executive orders to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis, and reverse many of Trump‚Äôs more controversial actions. The President signaled he planned to sign additional orders in the coming days. \n\nBiden is also set to move quickly to begin pushing for additional fiscal stimulus. He recently outlined his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, which includes a host of new relief measures to be added to the provisions in the $900 billion package Congress passed last month. Biden‚Äôs proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in stimulus payment to be added on top of the $600 already being distributed, the extension and enhancement of unemployment programs, aid to small businesses, $350 billion to state and local governments, increase in tax credits for low- and middle-income families, and $160 billion for a national program on vaccination and testing. Biden said, ‚ÄúWhile Congress‚Äôs bipartisan action in December was a step in the right direction, it was only a down payment. It fell far short of the resources needed to tackle the immediate crisis. We are in a race against time, and absent additional government assistance, the economic and public health crises could worsen in the months ahead.‚Äù Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also advocated for significant additional relief spending during her Senate confirmation hearing earlier in the week.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims Thursday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Also, for some content it is the only alternative here to expensive specialized services and especially the *only* decent alternative for casual watchers of such media. For example, K-Dramas and Anime. You either buy a service as expensive as Netflix just for this, or get a reasonable amount included in Netflix already. \n\nI can tell you that all students at my university have Netflix, because it is unbeatable.

First the company owns the rights to operate in 8.5 million acres of land in NE Namibia and NW Botswana, on the Kavango Basin. Why this is a big deal? Because the basin, according to chief geochemist on the team Dan Jarvie, is estimated to be home to 120 BILLION barrels. At a conservative estimate (.58x NAV) Haywood Capital Markets places a price target at $7/share. This would represent a 233% increase from the current price of $3.\n\nThey started drilling on January 11th and state that they will find out if the basin has deposits in 45 days. That is the catalyst, and yes I know the obvious downside would be that the basin does not have oil which would drive the price to basically zero.

The Federal Ministry of Economics has allowed the US group to \"begin measures temporarily\". At Tesla's own risk.\n\nThe news surprised the Brandenburg government: No application for Tesla's battery production has been received yet. But the Minister of Federal Ministry of Economics, Peter Altmaier (CDU), has bundled the battery cell projects of several manufacturers and submitted them to the EU Commission.\n\nNow Brussels is to examine the applications - to allow billions of dollars in taxpayer funding. \"We expect the state aid approval by the Commission soon,\" says the federal Ministry.\n\nBut the electric car market leader can get started now already: \"Tesla and other participants were allowed to start preliminary measures at their request,\" said Altmaier's spokeswoman, \"that means that companies can start preparatory work on their projects at their own risk.\"\n\nBerlin and Brussels are still silent on the location, size and number of jobs. Tesla recently applied for the construction of a huge hall in the southeast of its Gr√ºnheide building site. Possibly a case for the battery factory.\n\nBut: There is a water protection area there, not on other areas. \"Tesla is planning more environmentally friendly dry batteries,\" said Brandenburg Economics Minister J√∂rg Steinbach (SPD) on Wednesday, \"this will not be a chemical factory.\"\n\nBut first the State Environment Agency has to give final approval to the car plant - according to BZ information in March. Tesla can only submit the building application for the battery factory after receiving the EU funding permit. It must be publicly displayed.\n\n----", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "God knows why they applied to the federal authorities first.

They would be able to build out Phase 2 in the area surrounding the drive unit in the already cleared space. Otherwise, they could continue to clear in another space and it may take an additional week or two of clearing works.\n\nThis also might bode well for a full S/X powertrain refresh using 4680 cells, as I was concerned they would not have a battery factory up and running in Berlin in time for major car production in Berlin. Kato road itself would be large enough to supply about 90,000 130kWh S/X 4680 packs. They have also likely been stockpiling cells. There may still be some leftover to support the early ramp of the Berlin factory, i.e. the first 3 months. If we assume 80kWh per pack, and 10,000 units in Q3, that would be \\~ 0.8GWh. This would be \\~27% of Kato road's full quarterly capacity.\n\nKato road didn't take that long to build out, and I think the machinery would require less complex foundations, i.e. no casting/stamping pits. It's quite possible Tesla has the battery lines up and running in 5-6 months right around the start of production of Phase 1. Although, this might be optimistic. If we assume that Kato road can provide the cells for the first 3 months (as well as S/X), then the gives the battery factory an additional 3 months to be built, i.e. 9 months or so from now. This is quite achievable imo. Phase 1 foundations began \\~7 months ago.\n\nIt all really depends on how the ramp of Kato road is going!

And Tesla definitely did have some serious problems to work through with the Model 3 and GF1 ramp up. There probably was a window where a \"crisis of confidence\" was possible, but Tesla pushed through and came out strong enough to survive.\n\nThe mindset of a lot of shorts, especially the TSLAQ crowd on Twitter and anyone that listened to them might have just been something like \"if we keep up the pressure eventually it'll be enough\" or they had just spent so much time in an echo chamber that they believed all the stuff they were making up.\n\nIt seems like people just let emotions get in the way of reason, maybe even let themselves feel like they were part of a community.

It's essentially a money manager's job to spot those few stocks before everyone else does, and Tesla was a textbook example of what to look for. \n\nAnyone who looked at that potential and *bet against it*, not only missed out on one of the best trades I've ever seen in my life, but they made the single worst trade you could make last year.

Fast forward to 21 JAN 2022, hopefully AAPL has appreciated atleast a meager 5% from todays 132 price to 138. I would pocket 2005 (138 current value - 117.50 strike bought = 20.5 X 100 shares) \n\nIve been tracking AAPL‚Äôs premiums for about 6 months, the 143 example above is a little high. Assuming i sell safe strikes on CCs i make between $90-100 a week ($4680 to $5200 by the end of the year) plus $2005 (stock appreciation) minus the cost of the long call $2690 = $4515 profit less taxes and fees. \n\nI read one of these posts every week and have a hell of a time following the OPs math, hopefully ive made this easy enough.

So what is all the hype, why are people confident in its future, and why are they right? One this is for certain this is NOT, I repeat NOT, just a space tourism company.\n\nLet me first introduce you to the staff and some key players:\n\nüöÄFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nüöÄCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nüöÄ (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nüöÄCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\nNoteworthy Investors:  \nüöÄVanguard  \nüöÄBank of America  \nüöÄMorgan Stanley  \nüöÄARKQ and now ARKX  \nüöÄBoeing  \nüöÄChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nüöÄCathie Wood\n\nPartners:  \nüöÄBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nüöÄRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nüöÄNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nüöÄLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nüöÄUnder Armour (suits)\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n1. üöÄQ4 2020üöÄ: The FAA test flight occurred but it \"failed\" according to stupid people. Smart people know it was a successful test of the machines fail-safe technology. It was due to a software issue that didn't allow the rocket to ignite. This is a success to smart people because the biggest concern before was \"wHaT iF iT bLoWs uP!?\" but now that the fail safes have been successfully tested, that is no longer a concern. The software issue has been identified and TODAY they are launched Eve (the mothership for gliding tests, this is an indicator that they will be announcing a new test flight window in the next week or so)\n2. üöÄQ1 2021üöÄ: Sir Richard Branson has been on several media outlets quoted saying that he himself will take a flight up marking the start of commercial operations in the next 2-3 months. This is the start of publicity and marketing, and the re-launch of ticket sales. So far roughly 600+ tickets have been sold and these will be the first clients to go up. Notable clients include: Leonardo DiCaprio,¬†Tom Hanks,¬†Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,¬†Russell Brand, Lady Gaga,¬†Katy Perry,¬†Justin Bieber,¬†and Ashton Kutcher. The interior of SpaceShipTwo has 16 cameras which will be engaged during the duration of the flight and will capture these stars, quite literally in the stars as they float around in microgravity for several minutes. This will be recorded and surely uploaded to their social media. I imagine some of these individuals like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga will attempt to shoot a music video using this footage. Ticket sales will also resume again at this point.\n3. üöÄ2021üöÄ: For the rest of 2021 Virgin Galactic will be sending clients to space all the while they will be pushing profits in R&D for future endeavors, such as the hypersonic point-to-point travel which will be discussed later. They will also be building out more Spaceports and ships in order to conduct more flights. According to the last investors meeting, each spaceport is predicted to generate $1B/year.\n4. üöÄAround 2025üöÄ: The hypersonic point-to-point ship will be complete and ready for commercial operation. This will revolutionize human travel. To put it into perspective, the International Space Station circles the globe in 90 minutes, and when this plane is complete, so will we. Preliminary indicators suggest that a trip from NYC to Sydney, Australia would take roughly 30 minutes.\n5. The possibilities are as limited as space and I won't make your eyes bleed as we talk hypotheticals. I do however want to address highly likely revenue streams we could expect.\n\nRevenue Streams (amount of revenue measured in rockets):\n\n1. Space TourismüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n2.

NASA Contracts ( astronaut training, payloads, taxi services, etc)üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n5. Booster Services  üöÄüöÄ\n\n   1. Now, there is no news on this, but this is my prediction and what I would attempt to achieve. As hypersonic travel becomes the standard way for humans to traverse the globe there will need to be a way to make it possible and affordable for the general public. Virgin Galactic cannot achieve this on their own and current airlines (Delta, Southwest, etc.) cannot convert to Spaceship companies either. With Virgin Galactics unique approach and design, they could become a booster service for airlines. Airlines will need to design a space plane that is capable of hypersonic travel and Virgin Galactic will use their mothership to carry these planes to sub-orbit.\n6. While Virgin Galactic is currently operating in the sub-orbital space, I am sure they will begin working on deeper space projects for asteroid mining, moon operations, etc.\n\nCommon Objections and Rebuttals:\n\n1. Who would be able to afford this and even if they could, why would they?  \n\n   1. There are around 42 million people in the world with a net worth of $5 million where $250k is extremely affordable. The price of the ticket is the same price of chartering a yacht for the weekend. Except instead of playing on a boat for two days, you go to space for a few minutes. Yes, the complete trip lasts around 90 minutes, but we are talking about going to Space. Virtually anyone would say that's something they long to do because that is human nature, if you look at people with high net worth they spend their money on much more ridiculous things. Not only is it human desire to want to go, it has the \"Johnson's effect\" as well. The Johnson's effect is an old sales analogy, where someone in your neighborhood would say \"Oh did you see the Johnson's got a new Porsche?\" Inclining you the observer who has the capital to feel the competitive nature and want to also have said clout. So yes, there is very much latent demand on this service. As explained earlier there are already 600+ pre-sold tickets including highly renown individuals and 900+ who have reserved a slot for a future ticket purchase. Note that these ticket sales only stopped because Virgin Galactic stopped them and will resume ticket sales Q1 2021. Virgin Galactic could currently handle 50 flights per year per plane and has recently finished their second plane, meaning they can handle 100 of the 1400 pre-purchased flights over 2021. So, even as Virgin Galactic scales, there is enough customers already to cover operating costs and the development of new planes for several years.\n2. Wow so you get to go to space for all of two minutes?  \n\n   1. People who say this are people who can't afford it. That might sound harsh, but it is that simple. Very few humans would pass up on this opportunity for such a magical thing if they could actually afford it.\n3. It's not really \"space\"  \n\n   1. Who cares? You get to experience microgravity and float around. You get to see the curvature of the Earth. You get to officially be called an astronaut. The media will not be attempting to point out this very minute, arrogant point. Again, only people who can't afford it will be pointing it out purely out of jealously or disbelief in the Space Age that is upon us.\n4. People only invest in this because they can't invest in SpaceX.  \n\n   1. Not true. First off, they are completely different markets. SpaceX is orbital, Virgin Galactic is sub-orbital. A SpaceX tour would take you into deeper space for around a week and costs somewhere around $52 million. Secondly, even if SpaceX is a direct competitor I hardly see how that's a bad thing. Competition drives commerce, and to have Elon Musk being your direct competitor, that would only bolster Virgin Galactic. Thirdly, there is potential for partnership between these two companies in the future. A collaboration of completely different and unique technologies to overcome the challenges of the Space Age. Finally, SpaceX news and Elon Musk hype will mean space news and space hype, also helping Virgin Galactic. When/if SpaceX IPO's I will definitely scoop up some of that, but I won't sell SPCE to do so. \n\nWhat I imagine by 2035:\n\nSpaceports all across the globe, connected by the Virgin Hyperloop (for those who don't know it's another Virgin project that allows humans to travel faster than the speed of sound through tunnels). At this point, Virgin Galactic will already be partnered with other major airlines who have created space planes, very much reducing the cost and barrier to entry. Meaning any human who would have normally have flown \"first-class\" will now have the ability to end up anywhere on the planet in under an hour. Virgin Galactic will also partner with shipping companies and if you're impressed with 2 day delivery, how does 2-hour delivery sound? Packages moved via space plane, then into a hyper loop to your distribution center, and finally automatically driven to your home via autonomous AI. All the while Virgin Galactic is innovating new technologies for deeper space missions, working with the Space Force, and continuing space tourism.\n\nThis is not some flashy new technology, this is the revolution of human travel.  \nThis is not sci-fi, it is simply sci.  \nThe future truly is now and we all have an opportunity to be a part of it. Thanks for listening and big disclaimer, I clearly own SPCE shares, because at this point, it doesn't make sense not to.\n\nTLDR: I know you've heard about SPCE before and I know we are at war and I'm holding strong 500 shares GME @ $17, but the rockets are LITERALLY fueling up and you will LITERALLY miss the trip to space if you don't buy before the announcement. Last time it was announced the price was around $23 and ran up to $35, back down to $23 after the \"failed\" test flight. SPCE is currently sitting at $33. The test flight window will be announce anywhere within the next week or two and will probably run up to 37-40. After it is successful we are looking at 50, after Branson goes up around 70. Once other celebrities start going up and blasting it on their social media we will easily break 100. I don't know how many wins I could post before you retards start listening to me.

{"title": "Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market-driving news (Jan 21, 2021 GME euphoria edition)", "selftext": "* The market was a bit mixed today compare to yesterday's nonstop buying - but tech continued its skyrocket after yesterday's bullish inauguration run. AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.\n\n* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.\n\n* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. \n\n* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.\n\n* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.\n\n* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.\n\n* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.\n\n* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.\n\n* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none. got busy enjoying AMZN scalp gains.
