Also, Citron is shorting a company that is trying to save the world in a global pandemic, media ain‚Äôt got nothing on us now.\n\nIt has a float of only 16 fucking million\n\nIt is a very low volume stock that could move massively, furthermore it is already at a high of thte week and hedgies still did not cover their position. Adding to that, LGND‚Äôs all-time high was at $280 in late 2018.\n\nIt has a short interest as % of float 64.42%\n\nThis is the highest after the #1 we all know and love, also this is actually a good company that is not next to bankruptcy. Furthermore about 100k shorts were added just yesterday.\n\nInstitutional ownership is at a whopping 110.60% Blackrock for example owns 12.2% of Ligand, which is bullish for me.\n\nhttp://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/summary/?id=8814937\n\nFurthermore shorts have 26 days to cover on this baby. Now that is the short part of it, but LGND is not just a company near banktruptcy, LGND estimated they would make 6$ / share in 2021. This is a growing company with a lot of catalysts for 2021. They make wrapping for remdesevir and other COVID-19 drugs for example and they are working on a vaccine with Merck as I said.\n\nNow we have all of the above and the following:\n\nShorts have been adding to their position. The people short right now are likely already down 50% on their shorts since they have held them for some time.\n\nAnd to top it all of LGND has earnings in less than a week! This means that shorts will not only have the risk of massive wsb herd buying, but also of an earnings beat which will sent the stock thrusting like never before.\n\nGuys, I think I‚Äôve done enough explaining, this baby is going to the moon.

{"title": "Other Short Squeezes DD", "selftext": "Okay, to make it clear: Yes, WSB won't let me post, I wrote this whole thing up in emojis and now I'm salty because I can't just copy paste it, and yes, this is kind of just more GME DD.\n\nHowever, the thesis of my post is literally \"we should open up to everyone, so anyone can learn the basic facts of investing, because then people can make more educated decisions\", which is distinctly *not* WSB style apparently. So let me elaborate on why I think popularity is good, not bad, and how that makes *other* stocks squeezeable. \n\n# Fact 1: Many people don't know the basic facts\n\n(How \"many\" is defined is unclear, but given the amount of complaining about questions on this, and the number of people who have exactly 0 investing experience, I think this is self-evident).\n\nPeople have been calling GME a bubble, or a pump and dump, since 1000% ago. Now, while it is a bubble in the sense that it's going to go up and then crash, it is *not* a pump and dump, but an entirely legal short squeeze.\n\nI'm going to explain the basics, so **feel free to skip ahead** if you know them already, but here's the long and short of it. GME has had [well over 100% short:float ratio](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) for quite some time. We noticed, and due to general hype around Ryan Cohen (who successfully turned around Chewy, a pet food company) among other things, the stock price started going up.\n\nHowever, that was *not* the short squeeze. That was just good ol' crowd behavior - as the stock goes up, people start buying, and when people start buying, the stock goes up. Normally this is pretty well controlled. However, around $40/share, people noticed something - Citron Research [tweeted](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1351544479547760642) that GME was going to crash back to $20/share, and then, within minutes, a massive sell went through in the market. The price began to drop.\n\nFrom WSB's perspective, this was two things: One, blatant and unfair market manipulation, and two, a perfect opportunity to \"buy the dip\". After all, if they kept buying, the price would go back up, Citron would be shown wrong, and they could squeeze out the bad guys. And, enough people agreed (or at least saw the price go back up) that the price *did* go back up. And then some.\n\nNow here's what people got wrong, and still get wrong: The price started skyrocketing because of a squeeze, yes, but a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. The short explanation is basically, when calls expire in the money, you get stocks from whoever wrote the contract (who has to buy them if they haven't already), and when stocks are up, more calls expire in the money. More stocks have to be bought = stocks are up = more stocks have to be bought. Technically this doesn't *all* happen on Friday when the calls expire, but rather the effect gets diffused throughout the option chain, and the measurement of how fast it's going up is gamma, which is why it's called a gamma squeeze.\n\nI don't know *how* many times I've seen people mislabel the various spikes as a short squeeze, or even ignore that aspect entirely and just call it mob mentality. The numbers on the shorts are mostly public knowledge, and yet, *even in this sub* you get tons of people asking \"has the short squeeze happened yet?\" or even asserting that it has.\n\nFurthermore, the basic squeeze tactics - exercising options at expiration, not buying then selling, stop-loss hunts, etc are similarly, horribly underrepresented.\n\n# Fact 2: The more the merrier\n\nNow, here's a fact that everyone knows - the more people get in on a short squeeze, the higher it goes. As more people buy in and hold, the price skyrockets higher with less opportunity to exit short positions, so those holding short positions are forced further into the red. Notably this is *great* for everyone in on the squeeze, even those who get in relatively late - as long as it's not during the squeeze itself, which is driven by short sellers buying rather than normal buying, everyone makes more money.\n\n# Conclusion: Spread the info\n\n*This* is why I'm so salty WSB went private. It's absolutely the worst possible move. With the momentum the movement in general has, we could easily make more and more people aware of these basic facts. If people watched r/stocks anything like they watched r/sports, even half as much, there'd be triple the number of people invested. At 1/2 the subs, that'd still be quadruple the current sub count - even by a [month old estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/) WSB had 6% of the stock, so even being conservative on every part of this back-of-the-envelope calculation this could easily be 20%. If you really believe in reddit swaying the market, imagine quadrupling that sway - even in less optimal conditions, is it crazy to believe it'd reach a modest percentage of GME's success?\n\n# Actual Recommendations\n\nHere's the thing - I'm not that smart. But you can easily verify that a lot of the \"GME is a one-time opportunity\" people are full of it. A common claim is that there's not that much hedge fund investment in shorted stocks so you're just fighting other individuals, or that there's not enough shorting to squeeze, but that's easily checked: take a look at [this list of shorted stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/another-gamestop-here-are-the-next-10-most-shorted-small-caps-51611688092), and see, for example, [LGND](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/lgnd). At 40% hedge fund ownership it's similar to gamestop, and at 65% shorted float you can bet *some* of that spike is going to hit the funds. It's also got an incredibly high put-to-call ratio, which has similar effects. Similarly [DDS](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/dds) has 91% float shorting, and still 17% hedge fund ownership. \n\nTL;DR don't crack down too hard on newbies, get DD to the front page, and there could very well be another GME.", "id": "l6mx9x", "created_utc": 1611804830.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "GME is the only stock that's over 100% shorted.

{"title": "A hedge fund managers opinion on GME: What to do now", "selftext": "Thank you all for the very nice comments, messages and emails regarding my last post )[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a\\_hedge\\_fund\\_managers\\_perspective\\_on\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)).  My apologies for not having the time to respond to some of the commentary - I will try to do some of that if I can later today. I was happy to see that our prediction that some companies might monetize their short squeeze with a secondary offering indeed came to pass with AMC.  Hopefully, GME will capitalize on this unusual opportunity - but even without any financing activity, the free publicity for GME from this event, along with inevitably increased sales, will likely leave the companies stock higher for the long run, perhaps significantly higher than from where it started.\n\nIt makes me happy to see that we were correct in suggesting GME would continue to move up, \"perhaps substantially so\", which indeed it did.  Unfortunately, my fund only had a very small long position in GME, and we have since liquidated this after seeing it over double.\n\nNow what I'm going to say now will probably prove very unpopular on this forum, and it is being said not to offend anyone but simply to state the fact.  GME's current stock price is divorced from reality and will ultimately collapse down, perhaps substantially so from current levels.  Now I'm not saying anyone should short this stock - that's a fool's errand.  Nor should options like long short-term puts be used to bet this will occur.  Option implied volatility for this issue would make it more likely you will loss money on any such bet.  This is because the squeeze here is largely over.  Massive forced buying of GME has occurred from many funds, that were backed up against margin requirements and needed to preserve liquidity and cover.  The overall loss in both the S&P and DJIA yesterday only exacerbated the need for many funds to cover their short positions. Run-ups in many heavily short issues (like GWPH) occurred yesterday as long-short hedge funds were forced to both sell their longs and simultaneously cover their shorts in an attempt to avoid the fate of Melvin capital and the bleak alternatives of either bankruptcy or begging for garage sale dilutive capital infusions in order to avoid a total loss.\n\nThis sequence of forced buying has largely already played out, both for GME and for many other similar companies like BB.  Now I have no idea where GME will be today, tomorrow or even a month from now - but ultimately it will fall from today's artificially elevated values. It is impossible to know when this collapse will occur, but this is essentially a certainty.  The point I'm making here is simple: If you have profits in this company, or others that have recently participated in the near marketwise epic short squeeze, you should take them and probably do so quickly.  This is your change to profit from the many long-short hedge funds who have been given a real beat-down from this epic retain investor phenom. Once the collapse in valuations occurs here, it is very unlikely a repeat of the recent action will occur - at least for the recently squeezed companies.  So get out, take your profits and, at least for now, park the profits in a profitable company with a reasonable valuation and future growth prospects - like APPL which, for full disclosure,  we have a very large long position in.  I am very confident you will get higher future returns with that strategy versus the alternative of holding GME for the long term.\n\nI am very happy retail investors (like me just a few years back) have taken it to the street on this one!

I believe that these corrupted firms that short a stock over 100% should definitely be destroyed but the recent influx of people going on wsb saying that they want to reform the entire free market game is kinda insane to me since let's be honest here, GME prob only spooked the people who were short this company. Any company that did smart hedging prob didn't take too much loss and those that were long this stock are up a fortune right now if they still haven't exited. My question is do you think there's a possibility that this stock could keep going up? The short interest continuously staying high because institutions think this is overvalued and the retail just doesn't want to sell for whatever reasons which causess more squeeze if other big players come and push the stock up. Also, I don't even think retail is the primary force behind pushing this stock. Some funds are probably taking advantage of this narrative and pushing the stock along with retail. There's a lot of money to be made here and I think this stock is going to keep going up because of that.\n\nThat's my take on this and I wonder what you think.

Just a simple fella, running his YouTube business in Germany and trying to make tendies so I can kick out the boyfriend of my wife.\n\nBrothers someday we will dine in Valhalla but for now we are in war. This war is not about the tendies, its not about the boyfriend of your wife. Its about justice.\n\nI keep seeing how GME and AMC are being treated as opponents. This is not true! I was honored to be serving along with you in the GME battle and it is almost won. We fought bravely and soon we will see victory. That means HOLD to your GME as if your life depends on it, you know why? Because it does (this is not financial advice).\n\nBut Im also serving on the frontlines with the other autists, your brothers, fighting hard with moneydriven cold shortsellers in the battle for AMC. Yesterday aftermarket we experienced a new short attack, just like we know from GME already as you can see here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC)\n\nBut for those who are not aware of AMC and its potentials, a short DD my fellow retards:\n\n1. AMC was trading at around $ 10 before the pandemic. Its all time high was 2017 at around 35$. Currently (after already 300% rise in the past 3 days) it is going to trade when the market opens at around 15$.\n2. AMC is pushing new revenue highs every year (except for 2020). 2012 the revenue was $2.5 Billion and 2019 they were at $5.4 Billion. ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/revenue))\n3. Their business model is legit: I got my first handjob while watching Spiderman 3.\n4. 2021 will be a huge year for blockbusters, just a name a few: The King's Man (March 12, 2021), Godzilla vs Kong (March 26, 2021), Mortal Kombat (April 16, 2021), Black Widow (May 7, 2021), Samaritan (June 4, 2021), Top Gun: Maverick (July 2, 2021), Minions: The Rise of Gru (July 2, 2021), Cinderella (July 16, 2021), The Suicide Squad (Aug. 6, 2021), No Time to Die (Oct. 8, 2021). [https://www.cnet.com/news/new-movies-coming-out-in-2021-marvel-james-bond-and-more-in-a-blockbuster-year/](https://www.cnet.com/news/new-movies-coming-out-in-2021-marvel-james-bond-and-more-in-a-blockbuster-year/)\n5. Amazon and AMC were talking about potential cooperations (Amazon Prime Members can go to the theatre for free). Netflix could try the same. Movies ARE dope but watching MOVIES in a theatre is even MORE DOPE. Netflix and Amazon know that! Since they are the new hollywood, soon its going to be war over who is controlling the movie theatres.\n6. Adam Aron the CEO of AMC is jewish and went to Harvard.\n\nBut now lets talk about why AMC is really worth talking about. **It is right now the 3rd most shorted stock after GME and Virgin.** [**https://www.highshortinterest.com/**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)\n\nIts not like GME, that is right! GME has short interest high as 138% where AMC has only 69%. BUT: AMC shortsellers are also DOUBLING DOWN. Pretty soon we can see short interest higher than 100% in AMC. Again this is not financial advice, just a retard writing this while the bf of my wife is out for a walk.\n\nWhat Im saying is brothers: Lets win the fight over GME but do not forget the AMC autists. We can win the battle but lose the war. Do not let this happen, lets win this fucking war. Valhalla is waiting for us but first we have to finish what we came for. Not the money, not the glory, we came for blood.\n\nP.S.: I like the stock and STONKS only go up.
