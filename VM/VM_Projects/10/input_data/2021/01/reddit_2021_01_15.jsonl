The coronavirus pandemic continues to surge both in the US and abroad.\n\nLate Thursday, Biden outlined his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, which included a host of new relief measures to be added to the provisions in the $900 billion proposal Congress passed last month. Biden’s proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in stimulus payment to be added on top of the $600 already being distributed, the extension and enhancement of unemployment programs, aid to small businesses, $350 billion to state and local governments, increase in tax credits for low- and middle-income families, and $160 billion for a national program on vaccination and testing. Biden said, “While Congress’s bipartisan action in December was a step in the right direction, it was only a down payment. It fell far short of the resources needed to tackle the immediate crisis. We are in a race against time, and absent additional government assistance, the economic and public health crises could worsen in the months ahead.”\n\nYesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he believed the US economy was still “far from our goals” and that “now is not the time to be talking about an exit” when considering the massive asset-purchasing program the Fed has undertaken during the pandemic. He said “ We’ll let the world know. We will communicate very clearly to the public and we’ll do so, by the way, well in advance of active consideration of beginning a gradual tapering of asset purchases.” He also recommitted to maintain interest rates at near-zero for the foreseeable future, saying, “When the time comes to raise interest rates, we will certainly do that. And that time, by the way, is no time soon.”\n\nIn light of the surge in the coronavirus pandemic, many countries in Europe are considering imposing stricter restrictions. In France, a nationwide 6pm curfew was put in place. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is reportedly pushing for tougher measures, including more work from home and the closure of non-essential businesses.

Write it down.*\"  \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Within an hour after selling Bio Nano for a handsome profit this morning at $7.75/share ($0.72 CB), it spiked to $8.75 and threatened to break $9. I missed out on nearly $1,400 by selling 98 minutes too soon. \n* MSFT, which has reliably doubled every two years since Lincoln was in office, picked the exact time I bought it last year to finally break that pattern and start trading sideways for six months. \n* A friend IRL told me in Nov 2019 that he was YOLO'ing into NIO with $35K, at less than $2/share, but I didn't get in until $21, after he had already cashed out and written a check to buy his new, giant house. \n\nWe all have similar stories, and as long as we invest, we'll keep piling them up. My secret to not having any FOMO or regrets is a concept that's important enough, I think it's fair to call it the investing secret of life:\n\n*Whether or not an investment is a \"good investment\" or a \"bad investment\" has nothing at all to do with whether or not you end up turning a profit.* <-- Re-read that sentence.\n\nA good investment is one that helps your personal portfolio align with your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time line. (This includes another key lesson - when setting goals, \"make money\" is not a valid goal, because it's not specific, measurable, or attached to a timeframe.) If an investment is truly good and it properly fits your strategy, you'll never have to sweat over whether or not it's time to sell GME, and the bad week ICLN\\* and AMD just had wouldn't stress you out. \n\n*Spend some time this long weekend consciously and deliberately assigning a date and a dollar value to your investment goals. Write it down.* What kind of strategy will it take to get there? What kind of risk will it involve? If the worst feasible and realistic outcome happens, where will that leave you? With markets closed, look at your portfolio. How much do you know about the companies you hold? Are you being honest with yourself about the risk level you've taken on and what you're comfortable with? \n\nI hope everyone bought some dips today. I feel a rebound coming on next week. Happy Friday and Green Numbers to everyone! \n\n\\* Yes, this is politely directed at a number of you\n\n\\*\\* If news breaks that substantially and materially alters the outlook for a holding (glares motherfuckerly at BABA), then the risk equation has changed and you'll have to start making difficult re-assessments about how much risk you now know to be involved and adjust accordingly.", "id": "ky5ufc", "created_utc": 1610750599.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "So TLDR put entire portfolio into GME?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "yes EXACTLY. 🚀🚀", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Bought £6k worth of PLUG back in July at $10 a share but after 4 days in the red I offloaded the trash and moved into something else 😂", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I’ll just assume you let go of the falling knife and spared yourself 🤣", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Haha if only I held for 6 months I’d be up around £30k now!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oof.

{"title": "Google Trends Analysis of Amzn searches. For those playing upcoming earnings.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nI've compiled google trends comparing Amazon searches over the last 3 years. Then, I correlated that information with Earning Reports. Keep in mind this doesn't take into account people using the app store. \n\nTL;DR. I've deduced that Q2's huge boost from earnings could have been easily been spotted using Google Trends. Also, I've found the overall interest in searches during Q4 this year is better than 2019 Q4 Google trends, in which the underlying had an 8% pop from Q4 ER. Keep in mind Consensus Estimate is almost double that of 2019 Q4 ER. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo help you make sense of the Google Trends graphs I've posted, I'm also including a chart that fellow Amazontard u/slocs1 used in his EPS post. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTABLE 1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9i90ampipkb61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa531224626dabfcf0a80ff6606aedc695099b8\n\nTABLE 2 shows trending results for Q2 Amazon google trends. The last big ride for Amazon was for q2 (april-june 2020). Google trends justified Q2's pop as average google interest was well over 80 and mostly in the 90s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTABLE 2 \n\n[2020 Q2 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/r2s8ec4vekb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59380e74bc0f0bca95f145e015aceb575317dc83)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ4 2019 ER had an 8% pop day of earnings release. Mostly in 50s and 60s interest, plus holiday pop, then averaged out at 75 interest. Trends showed in TABLE 3:\n\nTABLE 3\n\n[2019 Q4 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/ywz1etq9fkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0805354ecd48509438c5ff78d272c0a20e6760b)\n\n2020 Q4  shows very similar interest patterns to previous years. The dip in interest is from the election, not sure what that mid October pop in interest was. The general interest is higher than 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTABLE 4\n\n[2020 Q4 amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/bv6kuc6hjkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f61372729937b710a393e282430613d2627ed7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTABLE 5 shows entire 2019-2020 google trends. Again that Q2 growth in interest (may) directly correlates to stock's growth during Q2 Earnings Release. The holiday season interest was stretched out this year, and shows it was 10 days longer than 2019 Q4, which is promising. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTABLE 5\n\n[2019-2020 Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/3b56dq10kkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc1925f3c7310f3b63dc859814e17b287312235)\n\nAnd here is 5 year google trends. Clearly, massive growth in Q2 this year, but radically declined to the yearly mean for Q3, which is possibly why Q3 ER dropped the underlying stock price, as interest stagnated, although it was still above the previous years interest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTABLE 6\n\n[5 Year Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/r5hjpvq4nkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=623a3375c36d2baec87a5f66b71679134a49d42d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough Google Trends isn't taking into account all of the industries AMZN is dipping it's pen into (i.e. AWS). I do think it's compelling all the same. I will say that I wish I saw more of a drastic change in Q4 google trends to be more confident my calls will print. Please, give me feedback and advice as my calls are bleeding rocket fuel :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 02/19 3300c", "id": "ky63dw", "created_utc": 1610751368.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Was gonna get 2/19 calls on Tuesday anyway, this confirms I must.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good luck!

It underestimates the shift from app purchases. More and more people have the app and buy things directly so don’t need searching “amazon“ on google. In addition to that, even people who buy things on their pc (so people who not use the app) more and more don’t Look for products on google first but go to amazon directly by typing in the respective URL. So no need to google the term “Amazon“ in the first place. That being said it’s impressive that the search results still are up on the google trends search tool because of these 2 effects that I mentioned ((1) more app purchases + (2) direct navigation to amazon.com instead of googling for amazon/for products)\n\nTo strengthen this thesis I want to bring 2 arguments:\n\n- Amazon is grabbing more and more market share in digital advertising. I don’t have the Link right now but amazon is expected to grow their market share in advertising significantly and biting into FB‘s and GOOGL‘s market share. That’s an indicator that people more and more go to amazon directly. Because if they wouldn’t, enterprises that want to advertise still would pump their money to google directly. But with amazon grabbing ad market share this implicates that more people go to amazon directly because enterprises realize this trend and have a better return on investment when advertising on amazon directly.\nBTW: Advertising will be a huge factor for amazon both top and bottom line, fast growing and high margins, so it’s a big Booyah \n\n- secondly just compare to the term „Facebook“ being searched on google. I know it’s different because Facebook is a platform and not a product for which you would search but the google trends show a huge decline for the term “Facebook“. Nonetheless Facebook still adds or at least sustains the amount of users in their platform. That supports the argument that people navigate directly to the platform of their choice and don’t use google in the first place anymore.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for further fortifying my faith in my play.
