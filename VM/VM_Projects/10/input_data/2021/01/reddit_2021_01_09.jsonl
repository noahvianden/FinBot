You are correct that the min P&L on the position is going to be 33.62.  If TSLA ends below 1100 then all the calls expire worthless and you keep the 33.62 credit.  If TSLA ends above 1160 then the profit actually increases:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShorts are assigned at 1140 = - 400 shares of TSLA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can cover 200 of those shares by exercising the 2 1100 longs for a net gain of 8000, and then you can cover the remaining 200 shares by exercising the 1160 for a net loss of -4000, giving you a total gain of 4000 on the shares plus the original credit received of 33.62 leaving you with a total profit of 7.36k\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** Is my max profit achieved between 1100 and 1139?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMax profit is at the body of the fly, or 1140.

{"title": "option trading service review - Option Alpha", "selftext": "This is a long review about Option Alpha. I tried to post this on Investimonials but that website was glitching so here it is on Reddit. I'm not riffing here on Option Alpha but trying to provide an unbiased review to the community. Hopefully this helps someone make a better decision before they part with their hard earned money. \n\nA lot of people are getting into options, whether its theta gang or long directional option trading. My warning to everyone is that don't necessarily fall for option trading services/rooms specially when they don't list an accurate trade log and PnL account performance. \n\nThis review below here is more applicable to the Theta gang option traders/option sellers so if you are a option buyer/directional optional trader than this review won't apply to you. \n\nHere is the TLDR - At the very best if you want very low single digit annual returns while taking huge risks and want to take the headache of making 100s of option trades, spend tons on trading commissions and subscription fees ($100 to $300 per month), waste time making option adjustments and then create a tax headache paying short term capital gains tax rates (your highest income tax bracket) on profits and filling out IRS forms at the end of the year then this is the service for you. Also the return on your time spent understanding option alpha and then implementing its strategies is negative.\n\nNormally I would not write reviews unless I thought that subs were getting ripped off. Let me start of by saying that I don't think Kirk (the founder of Option Alpha) is running a scam per se, but he is basically bilking gullible subscribers who are very new to options trading and have been sold the dream about option selling as the ONLY proper way to make money in options.\n\nThis service is a total waste of time for the individual investor. The last few years the returns have been flat after all these trades (basically up a few % or down a few %). This is before accounting for option commissions, and taxes (selling options ie. premiums are always taxed as short term capital gains at your highest income tax rate so you get no benefit vs holding stocks or buying options over 1 year) and subscription fees. Accounting for all this basically makes this a negative return. In fact I think it is better to buy a balanced Vanguard index fund or VTI etf and just Dollar cost Average into that every month vs using this system. Atleast with VTI you can expect to make 6% over the long term. The simplest strategy which is to buy VTI etf will beat Option Alpha over the long term with fewer headaches and invested time and energy.\n\nLet start of with the good stuff first. The option education videos are free, extremely well made so that even total beginners can understand option selling. Kirk is a gifted teacher and explains everything in simple language. If you are a complete beginner than these videos will help. Things I learnt that are useful - adjusting losing positions and how to beta hedge. However they don't get deep into the intricacies of options that professionals worry about. \n\nThe education is totally biased towards option selling strategies. They try to sell the Option Alpha system (where you are a net seller of options) to the subscriber as basically running a an insurance business or creating your personal casino where you make 100s of trades ever year to eke out a small premium for taking on the risk. They then go on to basically sells you the system as being better than buying and holding ETFs or stocks over the long run and - how option buying doesn't work 80% of the time and how buying and holding stocks is riskier than selling option premiums. This is all good in theory. But in practice it reminds me of this quote - \"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.\". In reality, what they don't talk about is the fact that the success of option selling relies on harvesting variance premium in the option markets (historically around 3% or so). Unfortunately in recent years the variance premium has at times declined to negative levels. The sign for VRP can flip positive to negative for different underlyings and is not always positive every single month of the year. So making money with this system is basically entirely dependent on luck. Atleast the stock market tends to grow over the long term with earnings growth and GDP growth, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case with variance premiums which could be permanently arbitraged away by option sellers and brain dead option selling strategies such as Option Alpha. Option selling has to be done smartly or not at all.\n\nThe basic system is this:\n\nNaively diversify by selling wide Iron butterflys/condors (this is the bread and butter trade about 80 to 90% of all trades) or credit spreads (about 10% to 20%) on these sector ETFs - SPY, TLT, XOP, XRT, EEM, OIH, FXI, XLP, XBI, GLD etc. Sell options about 30 to 45 days to expiration. I say naively because whenever markets crash everything goes down together so infact naive diversification is really di-worsification. Never have more than 5% of risk in any one ETF. They like to start out trades with a 1% to 2% risk per position and then scale in as adjustments are and will be needed. Good luck following this strategy if you have a small account as you will be taking greater risk. Then do this every single month or so without regard to broader macro conditions or IV levels or trend. Doesn't matter what EEM is doing or FXI is doing. Does Option Alpha look at price action, fundamental analysis, news flow, macroeconomics etc or anything else at the individual ETF level? No it doesn't appear they do. If and when positions move against you (which they regularly do) then waste time adjusting your positions and tracking credits to prove to yourself that you did make a tiny profit. They try to center the strikes as the underlying moves with adjustments and additional scaling in positions but honestly it doesn't work over the long term. \n\nAt the end of the year after 100s of trades (6 to 10 etfs x 4 (assume butterfly or condor) x 2 (opening and closing) x 10 (every 35 to 45 days) = assume 600 trades per year not including the adjustments and additional scale ins that will be needed), subscription fees (between $100 to $300 per month), broker commissions, pay short term capital gains and then waste additional time filling out dozens of pages of IRS forms with the 100s of option trades all to make a small single digit low annual return if lucky. The thing to understand is this, with option selling you generally risk $3 to $4 for every $1 of gains. So you can have 3 winning trades and then the 4th one will blow up profits. To counter this, they will show you how to make adjusting trades (only one side of the butterfly is underwater, so the whole position can be adjusted) or scale in so that strikes are centered around current underlying price. Even after adjusting which is not a guarantee of profits, the overall the results are just extremely lame. If you refuse to adjust positions it will be impossible to make any profit with this system. This is not to say other option selling strategies don't work (there are some that can work but they require a true edge) but its just that Option Alpha doesn't work. The free Theta gang on reddit or discord probably does a better job than OA.\n\nAs such there is nothing even remotely proprietary about Option Alpha. There is no edge. Because there is always a risk that all positions can simultaneously lose money in a crash as all assets trade downward, so Option Alpha advises that only use 40-50% of the account value for option selling and keep the rest as cash as a hedge against blowing the account up. Recently they advised having a 1% long VXX calls positions to hedge black swans/market crashes which I think is an improvement over the system of past few years. \n\nI personally think that selling this system to gullible retail subscribers is extremely irresponsible. You can argue that option selling has a place within pension funds or other entities that have a lot of money who need yield income tax free and who have a proprietary system with an edge that can makes better risk adjusted profits but Option Alpha is basically gambling and praying for profits. If selling options is so good, how come I have not heard of a single Hedge fund that only does this with 100% of their capital? There were some crooks in Florida who blew up one fund that was selling energy options (you can look up Optionseller.com on google - website is defunct now). I'm not saying Option Alpha is pursuing similarly risky strategy since these are all defined risk trades and they do ask to hold 50% in cash. But it is conceivable that you can lose 100% of the amount you have put into selling options - that is the other 50% of the portfolio under a true black swan scenario. Maybe making adjustments etc will save the portfolio but its not really a guarantee. Btw the stock market can never goto zero. We can get another market crash and yes it could take a long time to recover but it can never goto zero (the businesses underlying these stocks have real value unlike options/derivatives). With stocks you have time to sell even with a 10% gap down overnight. Options will get blown up much faster. \n\nThis strategy is not at all the best way for the individual investor to invest. The only market where this system works is even Implied volatility is high ( so that you get extra compensation for selling time decay) and the market moves sideways. However in practice the market is either steadily marching higher and IV is low, or IV is so high (that you get a decent premium) but the market is rapidly moving in either direction so you will endlessly keep adjusting positions or keep taking losses. Options are complicated instruments and if you don't understand vol skew, statistics and probability, option greeks properly and can't backtest with good data than it is literally gambling and praying for profits. There is a real risk that naive option selling can blow up accounts. Option selling only makes sense in certain market regimes and only when done smartly. To tell retail traders that they should trade this way all the time for the rest of their life is extremely irresponsible.\n\nHere is the thing. What I'm mad about is that Option Alpha has spent all this time very aggressively marketing this system and spent the last few years trying to develop an autotrading platform. It has been recently launched in Beta mode if you upgrade to lifetime membership for $2000-$2500. My hope is that the autotrading system will work and not blowup accounts due to software glitches like the Knight Capital software glitch fiasco in 2010.\n\n I think they know these strategies don't work. The website claims that there have been 200k people who have signed up. I think at any given time they have 1000s of subscribers who come and go. If we assume 4000 subscribers per month at avg of $100 per month is $400k per month or $4.8 million per year. This is better than a lot of smaller hedgefund managers. For Kirk's own account, it appears that he trades a $300k portfolio, but his main source of income is selling Option Alpha subscriptions and doing real estate investing. How come his account is not millions of dollars now after almost a decade? But still around 300k? The simple reason is this doesn't work and instead he invests his income from Option Alpha subscriptions into other things/real estate investing etc.\n\nThe founder of OA has institutional experience trading and as such I would have expected him to focus on improving trading performance, creating new strategies, backtesting etc, interacting with members, rather than selling snake oil promises.\n\nThere isn't enough skin in the game. Option Alpha has forums where members can talk to each other and there are probably some legitimate strategies there (none are based on the Option Alpha) developed by members. But the OA founder has been completely AWOL last few years. Zero participation. Zero time trying to refine or improve his strategies on Option Alpha. They could have hired professional optional traders or even subscribed to institutional level stuff to help them out but no they have been focused entirely on making money. There are other free blogs and similar option newsletter services which also trade condors and butterflys which have shown much much superior results, however OA refuses to adapt their strategies or spend any time engaging with members. The focus has been on scaling the business and selling promises about the new autotrading system.\n\nI think the founder has realized that this Option alpha is going nowhere and so has decided to pivot into autotrading. Gullible retail investors have been financing the build out of this service it seems.\n\nWant another proof of what I'm saying? You can sign up for free membership and see the performance section. First the performance section does not tell you the performance from one year to the next. The only thing you can see is the meaningless numbers such as avg profit and loss on different option selling spreads and win rate. It is impossible to reconstruct PnL performance from these metrics. I think this is very misleading. Even Motley Fool shows their performance for their $100 per year newsletter. Almost any good newsletter and or trading/membership service shares performance/trade log for the past few years. If this is just about education then charge only for educational videos and don't have trade alerts and monthly membership/weekly elite calls etc.\n\nAnother note on some of the enhancements they up-sell on the website. The tools are almost totally useless. The backtester sucks. The scanner sucks. The forum is basically impossible to use properly.\n\nThe research reports (each priced at $400) are not worth the money.\n\nLet me summarize the technical indicator report - use commonly used oscillators that everyone knows already at a medium term time-frame and buy at oversold condition and sell at overbought condition. I mean C'mon everyone already knows this. Does Option Alpha appear to use this research - nope!\n\nThe profit matrix report will tell you that there is no limited-loss option selling strategy that produces a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) above a low single digit return. Not a single one. This is not surprising since the variance premium per academic research is around 3 to 4%. Shouldn't this be disclosed to regular subscribers instead of asking them to pay another $400 bucks?\n\nCovered calls research report - sell short dated deep OTM calls. Viola! There is no actionable information in these reports. These reports are a few years old and the information is not updated. The reasonable price for such reports should have been $20-$30 not $400.\n\nYou can even find REITs or dividend paying stocks that have a higher yield than than option alpha strategies.\n\nIn fact I'm not even confident if Option Alpha has used proper back testing methodology and not made mistakes. You will learn more spending this money on a proper backtesting website that professionals use. Even Seeking Alpha and Reddit have better options strategies articles for free. A lot of academic research is available for free. Tasty Trade has similar trade ideas for free. The bottom-line is that Kirk is not a skilled trader. And has made no effort to improve or adapt to the market environment the last few years. All effort has gone into growing the business and up-selling membership with very aggressive sales tactics. He is a master salesman so be careful. Its really the case of the blind leading the blind. \n\nJust blindly sell options every month without any edge and charge big money for it without any real view about the direction of the underlying or IV.\n\nJust to be clear I do not have unrealistic expectations from a newsletter service/system. If I'm subscribing to an expensive service than I expect that I should have a reasonable chance to make greater than 10% on my account annually. I'm not expecting 100% nor even 20% - just a reasonable 10% to 20%.\n\nThe best thing about OA is the free educational videos and the podcast. Use that and skip the paid services.

Right around the time the two companies merged is when I got involved in the project. What we learned from Alta5 (where users had to write their own code) was there's an extreme disconnect between people who want to automate strategies and the exponential level of difficulty to get there. \n\nI respectfully disagree with your assessment that relatively novice users won't be able to build their own bots. That's exactly why we built this system in the first place. It's meant to bridge the gap between novice and advanced - easy enough for a new trader to use, but complex enough to keep the advanced traders interested.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 11th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Markets face a big week of news, with stimulus at the top of the list  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/markets-face-a-big-week-of-news-with-stimulus-at-the-top-of-the-list.html)**\n*****\n> Markets will stay laser-focused on the prospect for more fiscal stimulus in the busy week ahead.\n*****\n> Politics and politicians are likely to continue dominating the headlines, as Democrats seek President Donald Trump’s removal after a mob of his followers took over the Capitol Building on Wednesday.\n*****\n> But it is stimulus that should get the most attention from investors, who are betting the new Democratic majority in Congress will move quickly and that it could consider a package of $1 trillion or more.\n*****\n> Stocks rose to record highs in the past week, boosted in large part by the idea of a bigger stimulus package.\n*****\n> With Democrats now in control of the Senate and House, the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden is expected to deliver an even bigger stimulus package than had been expected with a divided Congress. Biden said Friday the total will be in “the trillions of dollars.” The election Tuesday of two Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, shifted control of the Senate to Democrats.\n*****\n> While disturbing, the temporary assault on the Capitol Building did not ruffle markets, and the removal of Trump is not expected to receive enough Republican support to succeed with just days remaining in his term. Biden is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n*****\n> “The market is willing to look through that chaos, but not through this anticipation of faster and bigger stimulus,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n> # Earnings, data ahead\nIn the normal business of markets, fourth-quarter earnings season begins with the rollout of big banks’ reports Friday, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on tap. There is also a long list of Fed speakers including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled for a webcast from Princeton University Thursday.\n*****\n> On the data front, CPI inflation data is released Wednesday and December’s retail sales are reported Friday.\n*****\n> The consumer price index will be important, and although it is expected to show muted inflation, markets have begun to price in rising expectations in the bond market. One bond market inflation measure, the 10-year breakeven, went as high as 2.1% Thursday, meaning investors expect that to be the average level of inflation over the next 10 years.\n*****\n> But strategists said little will matter but stimulus, which economists expect will ease the impact of the surging virus on the economy. The U.S. reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid in one day for the first time Friday.\n*****\n> The stock market may also begin to pause as soon as the coming week, as the virus surge continues and investors worry vaccines are being too slowly deployed,\n*****\n> “You feel like this recovery rally is going to run out of legs,” Hogan said. He said that with the S&P 500 up about 16% since Nov. 4, investors may begin to think it is getting ahead of itself.\n*****\n> “That could be next week’s business to contemplate. You’re likely to take some sort of breather,” Hogan said.\n*****\n> Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said there’s a level on the S&P 500 that could be a turning point for the market. The S&P 500 closed at 3,824 Friday, up 18% for the week.\n*****\n> “I think there’s a chance we could be hitting 3,900 and that’s a key level for markets,” said Lee. “That’s the level where people are looking for a local top. That’s a level where we could be repelled. It’s a number where if we blast through it, it would be good but if we don’t break through it, it could start the correction. It’s a binary risk.”\n*****\n> But even if there is a pullback, Lee expects the S&P 500 to reach 4,300 by year end. “I think what the stock market is saying is we’re going to get a really good economy this year,” he said.\n*****\n> Earnings season should be a positive for stocks.\n*****\n> “Uncertainty has plagued everyone, so the certainty that comes with earnings is good for stocks,” said Lee.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/C0LIthO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/naBACT7.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3qF2U4y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WfEELCq.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUvCcqT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/99vHejZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ABV4hoR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OWCbndT.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/PrdtNkQ8/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfYjV27r/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/hv1cMCcj/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Cyclicals Climb, Defensives Decline\n\n> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, cyclical sectors are leading the way higher in 2021 as Energy, Materials, and Financials are all up around 5% or more compared to the S&P 500's gain of a more modest 1.65% YTD. That outperformance has led to some sharp moves in the relative strength lines of several sectors. As shown below, the Materials sector and Financials have both seen sharp moves higher in their relative strength lines versus the S&P 500. For Materials, this has been part of a broader trend of outperformance (upward trending line) that has been in place over the past year. For Financials, prior to this most recent upswing, the line first began to trend higher in the late Fall but then took some pause in December. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Health Care, and Industrials have also made moves higher, albeit more modest than those of Materials and Financials.\n\n> As for the other sectors' relative strength lines, there have been some sharp moves in the opposite direction. Starting with what had been market leaders at various points of the past year, Communication Services and Technology are perhaps some of the most notable negative reversals. For the former, the relative strength line has generally moved sideways over the past year, but since mid-December, the line has been on the decline with one of the most dramatic legs lower taking place in the past week. Tech was a consistent outperformer in the first half of 2020, but since the summer that outperformance has faltered. The sector's relative strength line peaked and has been trending sideways since the start of September and the move so far in 2021 has brought the line down towards the low end of the past few months' range. As for other sectors, Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples have been trending lower for the better portion of the past year, but with cyclical sectors flying, the relative strength lines of these more defensive sectors have made new lows this week in dramatic fashion.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Breadth Strong\n\n> Several measures of market breadth have been showing strength recently as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. Over 80% of S&P 500 stocks trade above their 50-DMAs, more than half are overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA), and over 20% of S&P 500 stocks reached new 52-week highs yesterday. Additionally, shorter-term breadth as measured by the 10-day advance-decline line has also been strong. Pretty much across the board, every sector's 10-day A/D line has tipped into overbought levels. That doesn't apply to only Consumer Staples and Real Estate which have more modest readings, though breadth for these sectors has still been positive recently. At the moment, Materials, Health Care, and Financials are the most overbought sectors by this measure. Overall, the sharp moves higher in the 10-day A/D lines does flash a warning sign for the very near term that things are running a bit hot.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-10-day-AD.png))**\n\n> As previously mentioned, several sectors are reaching new 52-week highs, and given breadth has been strong to match, cumulative advance-decline lines are confirming the moves higher. As shown in the charts below, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Industrials, Materials, as well as the broader S&P 500 all closed at 52-week highs last week and so too did those sectors’ cumulative A/D lines. While price did not close at new highs, Tech, Financials, and Communication Services also all saw new highs in their cumulative AD lines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-cumulative-breadth.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Stocks Off to Strong Start to 2021\n\n> The average stock in the Russell 3,000 is already up 5.24% year-to-date after just four trading days. And to think, major indices were down ~1% on the first trading day of the year this past Monday. Below we highlight the average YTD performance of stocks by sector in the Russell 3,000. Remember, the Russell 3,000 contains large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, and it covers roughly 98.5% of all US-traded market cap. As shown, Energy stocks have jumped out to the strongest start to the year with an average gain of 13.26%. Materials rank second with a gain of 9.1%, and then Industrials, Financials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are all bunched together with gains between 5% and 6%. Technology stocks -- last year's big leaders -- are 'only' up 4.34% on average so far in 2021, while the Real Estate sector is the only one that has averaged declines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/sectorsavg.png))**\n\n> Looking at Industry Groups, while Technology as a whole is underperforming a bit, the Semiconductor group (which are part of the Tech sector) is up big with average YTD gains of 9.4%. Autos are also performing very well with a gain of 9.2%. Thank you Tesla (TSLA).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/r3kgroups.png))**\n\n> There are already more than 600 stocks in the Russell 3,000 that are up more than 10% year-to-date. That represents 20% of the index.\n\n> Below is a look at the top-performing stocks so far in 2021. Usually, it takes weeks or months to see YTD gains like these, but we've gotten here in just four trading days. 3D Systems (DDD) ranks first with a gain of 119%, followed by Atomera (ATOM) at 70%, ViewRay (VRAY) at 59.5%, Arcturus (ARCT) at 54%, and Akerna (KERN) at 52%. We don't fault you if you have never heard of these names!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/beststocksytd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Equity Winners and Losers in 2020\n\n> 2020 was a good year for stock investors despite unprecedented challenges.\n\n> After being down more than 30% at the March 2020 lows, the S&P 500 Index ended the year with a solid 18.4% total return. Last year marked the first time the index ended a year positive after being down at least 30% during that year. Gains were driven primarily by the emerging economic recovery taking hold, bolstered by massive stimulus, and the remarkably fast COVID-19 vaccine development that encouraged market participants to begin to price in the end of the pandemic.\n\n> We take a look at some of the asset class and sector winners and losers in 2020.\n\n> Massive growth outperformance. The growth style of investing had one of its biggest runs ever relative to the value style in 2020, benefiting from better positioning for the pandemic, superior earnings growth, and balance sheet strength. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the major growth indexes returned over 30% while the value indexes produced mid-single-digit gains. The technology sector was the biggest driver of growth outperformance (about 60% of it), but the consumer discretionary sector—led by Amazon, one of the biggest stay-at-home stocks—also outperformed the broad markets and value indexes by a wide margin last year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Typical January Trading: Mixed Results since 2000\n\n> Today’s mixed market performance with mega-cap tech shares declining while other major indexes moving higher is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. The only difference is it has usually been tech moving higher while other areas of the market retreated. Since 2000, the S&P 500 has declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n> Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a0a002cdd46e852712841fbd1688c132/24a9987a98ef15dd-ec/s500x750/ba4983415f1eddedf6687d8d793c86b9c732f497.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xqhdHaoXUw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D38Z4N7eG1M))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$CMC** \n> * **$ACI** \n> * **$AZZ** \n> * **$DAL** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$KBH** \n> * **$SNX** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$SJR** \n> * **$OGI** \n> * **$SLP** \n> * **$LMNR** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$INFO** \n> * **$EXPO** \n> * **$BBCP** \n> * **$PRGS** \n> * **$KRUS** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$VOLT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/L8eQcWP.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WjsRkdd.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 1.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qrT91FG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  1.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/O2aSUyP.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mitgWeG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xWZfXGx.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vplnuuc.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oCqgrUS.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qKlnVyr.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mfw4byl.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.15.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited $118.69\n**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 6:00 AM ET on Thursday, January 14, 2021.

{"title": "Buying safe dividend stocks on 1.59% margin - Free money? (long)", "selftext": "Trying to bounce some ideas/strategies around, especially for those that have tried them or see pros/cons with them.  \n\nOne of the ideas I've had is going with Interactive Brokers as they currently charge only 1.59% for margin loans.  With the government basically pledging to keep rates low for the upcoming years, how is it not a bad idea to buy 'safe' dividend paying stocks that pay 3-4% yield?  For example, Kellogg's or General Mills. They pay \\~ 3.7% each.  Lop 25% off for taxes, and you're left with a 2.75% gain.  Subtract out the 1.59% margin rate and you're looking at approximately a 1.15% profit.  Even Coke pays a 3.25% yield, and they've paid a dividend for over 120 years and have increased it every year for the past 55-60 years.  Had I known about IB and their insanely low margin rates during the pandemic, I probably would've loaded up on some high-quality stocks and gotten 5%+ yields AND made a boatload of money simply due to the share price going up.  So if I had decided to hold onto those gains for just 6 months, I would've only paid 0.8% for the loan.\n\nI understand 1.15% isn't much, as they could raise margin rates OR the share price could decrease by 1.15% or more (within minutes, technically)  However, these are stable stocks.  Both K/GIS are right at the midpoint of their 52-wk range.  If they went down, you could hold for a while and collect the dividend, waiting for the share price to increase.  If they end up going up, well, you can simply sell and book a profit -- especially if it's for a lot more than 1.15%.  Since I plan on holding for the longer term, I'm also interested in buying quality stocks right before they release their earnings.  If it's a good earning report, the stock will go up that day and I'll probably make a lot more than 1.15% profit in that day alone.  If the stock goes down, no biggie.  I'll hold it for the next 3, 6, 9 months -- whatever.  Maybe even a year or more.  Statistically, it'll go back up and I'll walk away with a gain.  \n\nSo that was the 'safe' stock angle.  I'm also interested in the angle of high-yield stocks, such as Horizon Technology Finance (HRZN), HTGC or TPVG.  HRNZ has typically paid \\~10% annual yields (paid monthly), and have done so for \\~ the past 10 years.  That's their business strategy; they a 'venture debt/business development company.'  They selectively provide loans to start-ups and have relatively stable income to support their payouts.  When you compare stocks that don't pay dividends to ones that pay high dividends, you see a stark contrast in their share prices over the years.  Typically companies that don't pay dividends see (hope) their share price goes up and up and up.  Think MSFT.   \n Companies that pay a lot in dividends see their share price go up very slowly over time (think: VZ & ATT)  And since these 'venture debt' companies pay out even higher dividends than higher-yield dividend stocks, their share price ends up staying relatively flat over the years as a higher level of cash is flowing out of the company on a regular basis.  If I started borrowing on margin, I'd only make these BDC companies a smaller part of my investment; less than 10%  \n\nNow another wrinkle to all this:  I currently have $110k in paper gains, and I've been selling as the stocks keep going up.  If things start going south, in the markets, I anticipate I'd book at least $75k gains (stop losses) So part of my investing angle is kinda to gamble; if I have a 50/50 of buying right before earnings, I may end up with a decrease in share price right off the bat.  I could sell my position at a loss OR I could ride it out.  Let's say I ride it out for 9 months and get show a $5k loss on 1 stock, but I've pulled in $2k in dividends.  The cookie jar is short by $3k, but I can sell that $5k loss and use it to off-set my big 2021 gains.  No, I'm not saying I'm trying to lose money, but if I have losses, then I can use them to off-set gains and pay lower taxes as a result.\n\nSo what is the real downside to this strategy?  Obviously a 'margin call' but I'm not talking about going all-in.

Overall IB is pretty small potatoes compared to Schwab or Fidelity, which is why they didn't really pop up on my radar until recently.  I always thought margin was 6-9% or so, and was where brokers made their money.  But according to my research, IB has historically catered to professionals/fund managers/day traders.  They have 2 types of accounts; Pro & Lite.  Lite caters to the Robinhood crowd and Pro caters to the pros.  Pro charges 1/2 cent per share, so pro traders are more likely to trade more expensive stocks like AMZN and not the cheap $5 stocks.  Lite doesn't charge fees per share.  So they make a ton of money on Pro accounts and other fees, which allows them to give out cheap margin.  Then when people are borrowing even more margin, IB makes more 1/2 cent commissions on each share.  Since they cater to professionals and traders, those types can even get a lot more leverage, which allows them to trade even more, which allows IB to make even more on commissions.  It's kinda like the reverse of a 'death spiral' for IB, ha.  I think the average margin account can leverage up to 4x and the pros can leverage 6-9x.  So tons of commissions to be made.

{"title": "Nvidia and the ARM deal", "selftext": "So I’m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I’m not sure myself, first time posting here.\n\nI know this stock hasn’t been talked about for some time here, but I’d like to know your opinions.\n\nAtm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI’m stupid, I’m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.\n\nAt the moment it’s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. \n\nAnd as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can’t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.\n\nFor those who don’t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: “a reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design” acoording to Wikipedia, so they’re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. \n\nWhat people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU’s.\n\n\nGiven the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.\n\nI’ve seen people here saying it’s the CCP being butthurt, but I’ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn’t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits already fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. \n\nI’d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP’s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I’d love to hear your arguments against and for.\n\nBull case: I’d say they’re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.\n\nBear case: When looking at the P/E it’s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I’ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don’t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.\n\nI hope you’ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.\n\nFor those who ask positions I’ve been owning 2 shares since June/July bc I’m poor.", "id": "ktnwor", "created_utc": 1610184760.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Best example is when they came out with a 64 bit version when ARM hadn’t even released reference designs.\n\nThink of it this way. The Chevy Corvette’s LS engine block is used by lots of boutique carmakers, who tune them to 1500+ HP. Of course you could run it stock, but that won’t leave you competitive in the marketplace. A 400HP V8 is weak when there are Golf GTIs and 4 cylinder Turboboost Fords making that sort of power. \n\nNVidia can run stock ARM reference designs but they will lose hard to any serious competitor.\n\nI had an interview with one of NVidia’s mobile Directors. He didn’t get it either.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "So you’re basically saying that atm ARM has the biggest market share because the market more or less chose to leave this branch alone?

They aren’t concerned about the power because they can fix that themselves.\n\nARM was willing to partner with anyone. For most applications, power isn’t a big deal, the support, commonality, and existing ecosystem are all more important.\n\nHere’s the thing, those are all well and good for a company building microcontrollers or budget phones, NVDA is not one of those things. Neither is Apple, hence why Apple’s CPUs are nothing like the ARM reference designs.\n\nApple would gain nothing from buying ARM. They don’t care about the existing ecosystem, the reference ARM license designs don’t help them make better CPUs, there’s really no point.\n\nNVidia has been frankly terrible at making their own mobile CPUs. Ideally they’d be like Apple, and they would have their own high performance designs, and not benefit from purchasing ARM. The fact that they did purchase ARM to an extent comes off like an admission of defeat. It’s like NVIDIA is admitting they don’t have what it takes to compete.\n\nIt’s like if a boutique carmaker bought Chevy. For what? So they can force Chevy to make the LS motor better, on their behalf? \n\nEven if Chevy did, now Chevy would want to sell these upgrades engines to everyone.

That would greatly benefit NVDA.\n\nTheir current dominance in Machine Learning is largely due to their KUDA language, great support, great ecosystem, etc.\n\nThey can expand their markets by offering compelling hardware.\n\nA word of warning, every big tech company is working on their own proprietary Machine Learning HW. Google TPU is the best example. NVidia has a very uncertain future in this space. Their GPUs are not the best hardware for the job and there are plenty of startups looking to offer something better.\n\nIf, as I think, NVidia is trying to offer a complete product (great ARM CPUs, their own GPUs) that only works so long as their GPUs remain first choice for Machine Learning.

Robin Hood has profited insanely by unethically front running their customers’ orders and screwing them out of their full potential profit (or magnifying their losses). That’s not some big institutional firm. The ways that retail investors have had impacts on big firms is primarily through the options market, and only on a few securities. Will their computer algorithms adjust to increased volume and volatility? Of course. They’re programmed to do exactly that. It’s not because they’re trying to “prove a point.” It’s because the computers will absolutely capitalize on increased volatility opportunities and they are far better at it than some idiot sitting on a toilet with their smart phone. But the biggest impact even to the options market wasn’t from retail traders, it was from large institutions like SoftBank buying up $4 billion in calls on big tech last summer, massively spiking volume, volatility, and option price.
