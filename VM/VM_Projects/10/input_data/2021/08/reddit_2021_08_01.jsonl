{"title": "<My own analysis", "selftext": "Okay this is going to be really long.  It's basically going to be an informal analysis of the company Nvidia, on the likes of high flying hedge funds like ARK Invest.  However, since I have no clients and I only make investing decisions for myself, I have the ability to share my own insights should I choose without any moral qualms.  All information presented here is publicly available.\n\nBasically my conviction regarding OP is that he is mostly correct, but he makes a few incorrect conclusions that I have made myself in my earlier days.  If anything, OP is not optimistic enough.\n\nI’d like to start off by introducing myself.  I am currently in my mid 20s.  I have my bachelors in computer science and electrical engineering, worked a few years as a software engineer, and am going back to school for a masters in computer science specializing in Artificial Intelligence.\n\nI’m actually not a gamer.  I’ve heard of Nvidia more during my undergraduate years since they came to the career fair, but I didn’t really give the company too much thought.  All I really knew was that there was an Nvidia gpu in my MacBook Pro, which is funny because Apple chose soon after to point the middle finger at Nvidia.\n\nMy academic interest in machine learning technologies sprouted during my undergraduate years and has gradually accumulated in a wide variety of interests in related fields.  These broad fields include:  artificial intelligence, deep learning, robotics and autonomous systems, computer vision, applied mathematics, mathematical optimization, scientific computing.\n\nMy technical and practical knowledge about Nvidia has a company has accumulated along with my own industry experience and studies.  Most gamers and crypto miners on reddit and WallStreetBets know Nvidia as the best graphics card designer and manufacturer (although people in Team Red may disagree).  What not as many people in the public know is that Nvidia is also the leading provider of artificial intelligence semiconductor chips and a comprehensive artificial intelligence tech stack to major research centers and all the top tech companies and start ups.  On this front Team Red, Intel, and even other chip companies like Qualcomm are behind Nvidia’s product maturity by at least 5 to 10 years.\n\nThe only real competitor to Nvidia’s offering is Google Cloud and their software stack and hardware, which by default currently is Tensorflow and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).  Even Google’s offering is behind Nvidia.  Unfortunately for Google, Google is trying to make TPUs exclusively available to their cloud offering, so TPUs come with cloud vendor lock in.  I think they are shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nBecause of the immense growth opportunity that the AI chip market presents, there are an astounding number of hardware start ups relative to the past.  Companies like Amazon, Samsung, Microsoft, Alibaba and Tencent invest in these start ups through their investment portfolio divisions, so you can imagine that lots of money gets flooded to these start ups (on the order of tens to maybe hundreds of billions).  However, in my estimation, none of these competitors have presented a serious threat to Nvidia so far.  Part of the reason is that Nvidia is both a hardware and software company, much like Apple.  It is difficult to be world class in either, so you can imagine being world class at both and integrating them to work seamlessly is at least one or two orders of magnitude more difficult than being good at exclusively one.  In particular, software is an area where building reliable, scalable, and usable product takes large investments and time, and the winnings go to the best solution with the highest market share.  In the AI space, that is currently Nvidia, and given that Nvidia has had a multi decade head start (much like Amazon with AWS, but actually even more than that), that is not changing any time soon.\n\nIf you ask me what the projected Total Addressable Market (TAM as the analysts say) of the artificial intelligence chip space within the next 10-20 years, an extremely conservative estimate would be half a trillion dollars.  The ecosystem for a tech stack directly above up to the software that data scientists, researchers, and engineers directly use I would say may be in the trillions (all end applications considered).  Of course I am not using any official figures here and I am hand waving a lot, so these estimates could be off by an order of magnitude or so, but this is just to give an idea of what I think.\n\nIf we combine this massive growth potential with the fact that Nvidia *already* makes huge profits in their staple, which is gaming, we can see that the proper way to think about this company is not through price/earnings multiples.  Nvidia is in a truly unique position; they can use their profits selling graphics cards and pro viz solutions (which are themselves projected to grow massively) to directly plow into research and development for revolutionary technologies and new products which we are already seeing with new HPC data center cpus and bluefield chips, in addition to adding incredible to their staple products (ex. DLSS for graphics cards), so the ability of Nvidia to grow its own cash position is incredibly ginormous, not to mention that their cash position is already rock solid.\n\nFinally, the CEO Jensen Huang is really one of a kind.  He is extremely passionate about his current products, his employees, his company, and future technology developments.  He like myself are passionate about hardware, software, HPC/data center, AI, robotics, gaming, graphics, etc. and on top of that he is comfortable doing is job interacting with others in the business world.  I would give him a field medal for managerial competence, which is quite important in a competitive space like AI.\n\nWhen Nvidia’s p/e ratios are 80-90 people (myself included) gulped a bit and waited for p/e ratios to come back down to earth, like maybe 20-30 tops.  If anyone bought companies at these multiples Benjamin Graham would roll in his grave.  I chickened out a lot, placed heavy bets at lower p/e ratios, and made many times my initial money.  However, I think that was a serious mistake.  The right way to think about this company is not what their p/e ratio is relative to their growth, but what their valuation is going to be in 5, 10, 20 years.\n\nThat I can easily say 1 trillion in almost no time.  Maybe not even 5 years.  Currently their market value is 470 billion.  So imo if you need a relatively quick buck you could probably double your money in the span of a few years most likely.\n\nBut I think nvidia may not just be a trillion dollar company.  They are at least probably 1.5 trillion if not 2 trillion, and maybe 3 trillion in the future.  Thus, it is not a stretch to think that you can at least quadruple or sextuple your money from prices now.  Just be sure that you can ride out the extreme volatility of this stock.\n\nAddendum: open to questions on this reddit thread, I don't know everything about the company but I do know a lot.", "id": "ovpphf", "created_utc": 1627813229.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Ark suuuuucks", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Lol they sold off nvda to go into crypto.  that was a mistake", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "idk I don't follow hedge funds I just check the analysts occasionally to see where the stock might move short term", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Best post i have ever read in my life.

THE key to what NVDA has done/is doing/will do in the future with AI/ML hardware is the idea they have a programmable platform.\n\nCompetitors, for the most part, do not.\n\nThey started investing in CUDA \\~10 years ago, and before that they seeded research and academia with parallel processors and then trained CS departments and researchers on how to program those GPUs.   They trained generations of students about parallel processing before it was a thing.   Those graduates then used GPUs in low hanging fruit applications like Monte Carlo and Black Shoals modeling for FinTech, then Oil and Gas exploration.  Soon Bitcoin mining caught fire and it was really then that a new general purpose computation platform proved it's worth beyond a niche.\n\nNVDA has invented and released on the world a new computationally dense programmable platform that is widely accepted and is now state of the art for driving the 4th technological wave.  CUDA has 2.5M downloads and hundreds of thousands of developers.   What is the last general purpose non CPU processor to have done that in technology?   And they now have an installed base measured in the billions.\n\nNVDA holds the position they do because of foresight.   They saw limitations to single threaded processors and developed and refined an alternative and then pushed it hard into the computer science world.   Graphics processing was just the first application for their processors.

Sure they may be a threat but the chance is low in my estimation, at least in the short term.\n\nI am also not claiming that nvidia will claim full market share, merely that they will grab a significant chunk, perhaps a majority.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}

{"title": "How Stocks Are Valued Part 2: Relative Value", "selftext": "In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.\n\n# Comparables\n\nWhen you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.\n\nIf the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.\n\n# How Do We Compare Stocks?\n\nRemember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.\n\nA lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:\n\n1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.\n2. The Enterprise Multiple (EV/EBITDA). This ratio measures the enterprise value (market cap + debt - cash) compared to a company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This is an alternative to the P/E ratio but takes into consideration more than just equity holders, and adjust for capital structure, taxes, etc.\n3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.\n\nWe can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies\n\nWe can also make relative value trades in the short term.\n\nA common retail trader’s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.\n\nHedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples\n\nHow can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn’t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)\n\nWe can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/Ford, Visa/Mastercard, and Coke/Pepsi.\n\nA second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.\n\nGoogle has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.\n\nTheoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)\n\nBy buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I’m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don’t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don’t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I’m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.", "id": "ovuksb", "created_utc": 1627833123.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Price-to-sales is not a viable metric, in the same way price-to-EBITDA is not a viable metric.
