Amazon is a one off and was clearly a mistake holding through earnings, but even apart from that its still the same issue.\n\nThinking about it, having a lower average win vs loss should be expected for credit spreads, so I was thinking its just a matter of choosing the stocks better to increase win/rate.\n\nAny feedback on this?", "id": "oztw1i", "created_utc": 1628345198.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "First, you did a great job documenting everything and bringing it to the table to have a good discussion.\n\nFor me to gain some context, what normally decides your order entry? Is there something that you're looking for to give you a signal or indicator that you want to place a trade in a stock? \n\nOn some of these trades I think you're too close to being ATM at trade entry. On your OXY and F positions you're basically at the nearest OTM strike. This makes the credit spread largely directional.  That isn't always a bad thing, but it can mean that the probability of profit (POP) that we're expecting to be challenging to replicate unless there are a very large number of trades. Going *way* OTM to lets say the 2SD is comparatively easy to replicate the POP since it's such an outlier event, the downside is that 2SD has virtually no credit to be made except on the biggest instruments.\n\nOn a few other trades that were losses, it looks like they could have become winners if you had waited for them to run a little longer: NIO, FUBO and JNJ potentially. You'll hear Tom talk about how they manage losers on occasion and generally, their naked positions they manage when they need to, but their defined risk trades they let play out. You made the right decision with AMZN, it gapped down and wasn't about to recover after earnings so getting out for the loss sucks, but it was the right call. The others I would have waited on. You defined your loss on trade entry, I'd let them run unless you think it can't realistically recover.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it looks like you're trying to shoot for about the 1/3 the width of the strikes on premium or at least be pretty close. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of that rule. They use it a lot for Iron condors which I agree with, but when you are only using a call/put credit spread it doesn't have the benefit of collecting premium on both the call and put sides so it's comparatively harder to get that same premium without going closer to the ATM strikes, especially on smaller stocks. I prefer aiming for about 20% the width of the strikes and only move up to 30% when I have a strong directional assumption. \n\nI think you're onto the right stuff, but I'd be curious to hear the mechanics of why you get into each trade and your exit mechanics as well for both winners (you mentioned 50% max profit) as well as losers.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot for the detailed comment! Actually have a lot more columns & rows that track more stuff like W/L percentage, average win/loss, period held, and price difference from short leg just for my info. Thought if I didn't track this I'd never learn.\n\nFirst of all, I used to use alerts from an options flow service to get plays but I realize those are much shorter term so don't use it anymore. Right now, I use a mix of Finviz and Barchart but what I've learned so far is that playing support levels are much better than breakouts for Credit Spreads.\n\nOn OXY & F, those were my first trades so clear mistake on construction of the PCS haha.\n\nOn NIO, FUBO, & JNJ, you're absolutely right. These are the plays that quickly went against my direction and I couldn't figure whether it was best to close or hold. In hindsight, I would've definitely held but didn't feel that way during the moment itself. Trade management is actually what I'm currently struggling with. Noted that since these are risk defined plays we should just hold them but after doing some quick calculations on premium collected + PoP, I've come to the conclusion that I cannot let every loser go to max loss.\n\nThis is actually what I'm trying to improve on. NIO hurt especially much, but with all the China FUD I thought its best I close.\n\nOn the 30% rule, I noticed that it brings my delta to around >0.3 too. Think the difference in how I trade PCS is that I have a somewhat directional bias, and play around support levels.

Some people swear by it and I'm sure they're smarter folks than me, but a lot of it to me appears as either reading the tea leaves or relying on self-fulfilling prophecy (i.e. as long as enough people or algorithms see pattern XYZ  and believe it's bearish, then they'll sell accordingly and create a bearish scenario that wouldn't have otherwise happened). If it's the latter then great, doesn't matter why it works, it just matters that it did. If it's the former then it's just people drawing on charts getting lucky along the way. \n\nThere's an old scam that used to happen. You send an email to 10,000 people, half of them  you say, \"Buy stock XYZ, it's going to take off,\" the other half you say, \"Sell XYZ, it's going to tank.\" After earnings or some big news event the stock moves. Now you send an email only to the 5,000 you were correct on, and do it again this time with stock ABC. Same results, but now you have 2,500 people that you can say, \"See, I've sent you 2 great recommendations for free. Buy my service and I'll keep giving you my best recommendations.\" \n\nI rarely see people that can predict the stock market with technical analysis the way that some claim. I think the ones that do it consistently *may* just be the ones that got lucky enough times that they can look back and say they are great at it. Day to day, the stock market is virtually random. For every \"good TA\" there is one that isn't. Could they simply be more skilled? Sure, but I'm skeptical until I can see someone reproduce results in real time. I did read someone on a day trading thread that intrigued me so I'm open to being wrong.   \n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI tend to base most of my trading on probability and some basic properties of data like mean reversion. Ideally, I want to open trades when IV Rank is higher (at least for credit spreads or selling premium) or when price extremes are happening. I don't mind people using resistance lines, I think they fit into the psychology of how people view a stock. \n\nThe majority of my trades are set up based around where probability of profit puts me and/or by what the IVR is suggesting. For instance, when IVR is higher I am getting paid more to take on what is mathematically the same risk if I'm trading at 1SD regardless. If IV drops then the stock price doesn't even have to move to make money. \n\nI'm also a little more conscientious  of  return on capital and don't mind trading naked positions wider knowing that it's still going to get me a 5% ROC over 45 days and probably closer to 2.5% in a week or two if I manage early. \n\nI only use credit spreads on large instruments. I've noticed that on most things under $100 the premium has some big drop off on credit spreads that are near my risk tolerance. On stocks like that I'll just sell undefined risk.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Curious how you went about picking these tickers?  Why these?
