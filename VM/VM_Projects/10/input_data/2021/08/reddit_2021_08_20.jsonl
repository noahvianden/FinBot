But none of the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines have received full FDA approval.\n\nThe approval could give the vaccination campaign a boost by convincing more unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective and also make local officials more comfortable in implementing vaccine mandates.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has been a major hurdle to the White House's goal of getting all eligible Americans vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.\n\nPfizer and U.S. listed shares of partner BioNTech SE were up more than 1% in extended trading.
