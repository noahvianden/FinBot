Still one of the best plays for me this month has been puts on **EBON**. As some of you may know, I have personal experience with this company. I've been in their industry since 2016 and they are known as a joke company in my industry circles. No one in their right minds actually wants to buy their hardware. More so, I've visited their factory outside of Hangzhou and it is one of the most dirty computer manufacturers I've every seen. It is an easy decision to buy puts. Every time it touches the 50MA, I buy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvps2oi391h71.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=37601245dd5ea381206b194adbeb14614effbeda\n\n# New Plays I'm Considering\n\nAn interesting opportunity, pointed out by a member of the Discord, to buy puts on $**YUM**. The stock is very overbought at the moment, and closing in on some sort of upper resistance that dates back exactly a year. I think that this is is a good chance to get cheap puts and right them down to at least the 20MA, maybe 50MA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ym0twbb1h71.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&s=277d78ffcc715daba5a5db9a0d2b4a867298214d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The financial sector is hot right now, to hot. Let's get some cheap puts on $**GS** if it bounces on the upper resistance that has formed more than a year ago. I like playing the bank stocks, as they are easier to predict. More of the same story for the **GS** put, ride it back to the 50MA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7zsx16fb1h71.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f477434519dbb1310d41cee4afae0ebec7eb7a6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nI like **NFLX**, but not so much. If **Netflix's** price consolidates more toward support, which it bounced on 5 times over the past year, I see myself going into some more dollar heavy calls. I think 3-4 months out, around a $550 strike work best here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o9ogdy2ib1h71.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c69f868452ae9fce105c14521fdb81cdc1a9b9c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I used to like $**NIO** and the other Chinese electric car manufacturers, now I like them even more. Beijing has given their approval in pushing this industry forward for the 'betterment of society'. I did a [review on the ES6/8 on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvT3RLVPm6A&t=37s) (not the best quality) and you can check it out if you want. They are very nice cars, however not as cool as Tesla, but they are everywhere on the streets of Shanghai.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vcjghfqb1h71.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=74476d2bb5b6e73e407e842f45e02096c880b4ff\n\n $**ROKU** has pulled back so much from its upper resistance to the lower support of the support (180MA). It looks like an interesting point to get some short/mid term calls. Let's see if we can get a confirmation on the bounce tomorrow.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q27o15wb1h71.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=0213cf6ba6c855f0bda887b86eb050671a0e6b07\n\n&#x200B;\n\n $**SOXL** is pulling back the last few days, which is no surprise coming off of all time highs. The leveraged ETF provides great swing plays, and possible huge exposure in the form of LEAPS. I've still got an alert set on the 180MA, waiting for it to pull back further. September usually is a pretty good month for **SOXL.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eg8metdyb1h71.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=75d8e4739891b5e8a9277e27e43312db18a80899\n\n&#x200B;\n\n $**MA** fell and I cut my position at a 6% loss today. I plan to re-enter at the support that it appears to be headed toward.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/raa2kzo1c1h71.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=6889343e3a1a826c077905398c295273fb04f5ea\n\n Last but not least, $**AMZN** is now on the 180MA. I still haven't gotten the LEAPS that I want. Considering the seasonality looks pretty bad in the upcoming months, I'm certainly in no rush. However, the offer is tempting.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgo663a4c1h71.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba6f5b530645f89195c3a25c1f1a4310674d079\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ^(Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.)", "id": "p3ecic", "created_utc": 1628821221.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "I was about to get triggered with \"EBON\" in the title, but then I saw \"puts\".", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "It has never failed me so far.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I like the yum play and the bounce off roku I’ll definitely look into them", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good god I miss the days when this sub wasn’t flooded with discord spammers typing shit like “journey to 1 million” to drive traffic to their guru blogs. \n\nMaybe you should start with “journey to 50000” or some such.

{"title": "PFE options", "selftext": "I'm going in on PFE options calls again.  It paid off before emergency use authorization,  and I think it will pay going into earnings.  Full FDA approval should come out soon\n\ncurrent position.\n\n10 Oct 15th 50C  up 45%\n\n700 Oct 15th 55C  up 4.13%\n\nDD I found useful. \n\nPfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon.\n\n1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)  \n). Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\n2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccination. Even once US demand dries up, the rest of the world will still be waiting for our extra supply for a long time.\n3. There are new variants. With the delta variant, Pfizer has already publicly said that a third booster will help. Imagine if the US gov announces they will start paying for 3rd vaccinations? What if an Epsilon or Zeta variant starts blowing up? Would they pay for a 4th or 5th vaccination?\n4. Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.\n5. Solid Financials. During the last 2 earnings releases (where the effects of COVID vaccines have shown an impact), Pfizer outperformed EPS by \\~+20% and +10%. Due to the current trend with COVID, I expect this to go on at least for another year.\n\nI honestly don't believe Pfizer is a meme stock.

Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.\n\nYou can't look at two entities who happen to produce similar products, disregard everything else they're doing, and simply compare market cap growth.\n\nThe COVID vaccine accounts for a vast majority of Moderna's revenue - [in Q2 2021, it accounted for $4.2 billion of its $4.4 billion revenue](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial).\n\nIn contrast, during the same period, [Pfizer's vaccine accounted for $8 billion of its $19 billion revenue.](https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nSo you're comparing the 253% growth of Moderna, which has very little revenue if it weren't for the COVID vaccine, to 31% growth of Pfizer, which would've done just fine with all its other revenue streams. In other words, Moderna stock exploded because they went from having some $60 millions in quarterly revenue to $4.4 billion, while Pfizer's went from some $9 billion to $19 billion, and the stock price growth reflects that.\n\nNot saying any of your other points are wrong, just that this comparison isn't valid.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Let’s also keep in mind about the other variants which are coming such as the alpha and beta variants.
