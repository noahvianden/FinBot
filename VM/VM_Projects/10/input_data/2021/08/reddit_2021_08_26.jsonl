The S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) retreated from record levels, falling 0.59% and 0.63% respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.57% while the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its streak of outperformance to finish 1.06% down. Market participants are digesting a key Federal Reserve event and a speech by chairman Jerome Powell tomorrow. Market participants are looking for any new clues regarding a taper timeline that might emerge.\n\nThe annual Jackson Hole Symposium is a conference that brings together members of the Federal Reserve, economists, policymakers, academics, and government officials in order to discuss issues and challenges relevant to monetary policy and the stock market. The Fed’s July meeting minutes stated about a potential taper timeline, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.” As the Jackson Hole meeting kicks off, market participants are anxiously waiting to see if any more information or details regarding the taper timeline are divulged.\n\nIn my opinion, which is shared by many pundits, Powell will likely keep his messaging in line with his other recent public remarks, signaling the economy has progressed toward the central bank's goals while still remaining a ways off from fully reaching the thresholds necessary to begin tapering.\n\nWells Fargo Senior Macro Strategist Zach Griffiths said, “We don’t think the Fed is going to do anything suddenly, and we really don’t think Chairman Powell is going to indicate that they’re ready to move policy anytime soon. If you look at the July FOMC statement, they did indicate that they have seen progress toward their goals, but if you listen to \\[Powell’s\\] press conference, he really walked that back and said they are still a ways off from the ‘substantial further progress’ threshold.
