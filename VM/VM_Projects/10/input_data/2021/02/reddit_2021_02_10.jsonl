{"title": "Enphase Energy Post-Earnings DD", "selftext": "  \n\nHi all,\n\nYesterday Enphase Energy published their Q4 2020 results. See my earlier DD here in this sub. \n\nWith this post I would like to discuss the results and the web-call with regard to future growth/earnings. So far my investment in Enphase was a solid move (5% after-market), let‚Äôs hope that this momentum will increase. I have divided this post in three chapters: results, web-cast management notes and analyst Q&A. However, before we continue let me first do a short into on the new C-suite hire. \n\n**Chief Marketing Officer**\n\nEnphase recently announced that they hired Allison Johnson as Chief Marketing Officer. Who is Mrs. Johnson and why did they hire her at this moment? Are sales declining or are there some amazing plans in the pipeline? \n\n‚ÄúJohnson brings decades of executive marketing experience to Enphase, including serving as chief marketing officer at PayPal, where she led a global marketing transformation, and as vice president of marketing communications at Apple, Inc., where she helped launch some of Apple‚Äôs most iconic products and campaigns of the Steve Jobs era. Johnson received her Bachelor of Science degree in journalism and communications at the University of Florida.‚Äù\n\nWhen checking her Linkedin, she started working at IBM as a Media Relations Director, moved to Netscape (1 year) √† HP (6 years) √† Apple (6 years) √† West (7 years) √† Paypal (1.5 years). \n\nLet leave it here for now. \n\n**Results Q4 2020:** \n\n¬∑ We reported revenue of $264.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, along with 40.2% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC, or 2,292,132 microinverters.\n\n¬∑ Revenue of $264.8 million \n\n¬∑ Cash flow from operations of $84.2 million; ending cash balance of $679.4 million \n\n¬∑ GAAP gross margin of 46.0%; non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% \n\n¬∑ GAAP operating income of $79.1 million; non-GAAP operating income of $72.4 million \n\n¬∑ GAAP net income of $73.0 million; non-GAAP net income of $71.3 million\n\n¬∑ GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.51\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rqzlro7vmg61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=605df05a5786cde0d8a866f3fe901dd691bdf4ad\n\nThis was their forecast for Q4 2020:\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n¬∑ Revenue to be within a range of $245.0 million to $260.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n¬∑ GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, excluding the recovery of the remaining $16.0 million tariff refund that has not yet been approved; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding tariff refund and stock-based compensation expenses\n\n¬∑ GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $51.0 million to $54.0 million, including $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\n¬∑ Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $35.0 million to $38.0 million, excluding $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\nSo one can say that they performed extremely well. \n\n**Management notes web-call:**\n\n**Badri:** \n\n**‚Äú**Let's now talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2020 played out. When the pandemic began, we cut manufacturing in Q2 of 2020 and then had to quickly ramp back up to meet the surge in demand in Q3 and Q4. The production in Q4 was more than two times the level in Q2. I'm very pleased with the ramp of our Mexico factory that met our target of producing more than 1 million units in Q4.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs part of our supply chain strategy to diversify production to tariff free and cost competitive locations globally, we began microinverter production at Salcomp, India in October of 2020 and started shipping to customers during Q4. We have a high quality state-of-the-art automated line with a quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and the space to add a second line with the same capacity. The production ramp is going very well and we expect to produce approximately 400,000 microinverters in India in Q1.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet's now move on to the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn Europe, we reported record revenue for Q4. Revenue increased 10% sequentially. On an annual basis, the revenue from Europe increased 32% in 2020.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn Australia, we built on our strong Q3 results and achieved record quarterly sell-through and record installer count in Q4. The results were fueled by the launch of our Enphase Installer Network or EIN as well as growing demand for our high power IQ 7A microinverters plus a favorable competitive environment as regulations continued to shift towards safer and smarter solar. We expect to introduce our Enphase Storage system for the Australian market during the fourth quarter of 2021.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn Latin America, we reported record quarterly revenue. Puerto Rico showed strength for our microinverter systems as well as our storage systems.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAt the same time, the uptick in broad economic activity has stressed the global semiconductor supply chain. We are seeing constraints on a few semiconductor components used in our microinverters.‚Äù \n\n**‚Äú**There are two specific components that we are constrained on. One is our ASIC that goes into the micro and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high voltage FET. There the name of the game is we are qualifying multiple more sources so that we have more supply as well as expediting product. And I am in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by early April. Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they are not affected. So that's on the microinverter side.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou will see a lot more going forward. So we continue to grow at a nice clip. You can do the math. If we continue to grow at this 30%, soon we will need a third supplier, that might happen in 2022 and we are already talking to those people‚Äù\n\n**TL:DR: They are growing in every aspect. They are trying to train installers internationally (Australia, Europe, South-America). Ones these installers are trained appropriately, they will start installing the products. Enphase will rather wait with the installment to only send very trained personnel, then just let a shitty installer do the job.** \n\n**Q&A:**\n\n**Q1: ‚Äú**Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. So you said you'll start shipping IQ 8 in 2Q. How should we think about IQ 8's standalone pricing versus IQ 7? What may be the range on the premium and might you expect over time a majority of installers shifting more toward IQ 8 versus IQ 7 or is the jury out on that question still?‚Äù\n\nA1: ‚ÄúWith regarding whether people are going to adopt IQ 8 over IQ 7, we think the answer is a no brainer. It's going to be, yes. IQ 8 is a grid-independent microinverter system. So, therefore, I expect the adoption to be high when it is released and there are obviously a lot of combinations with IQ 8 and in some cases, people might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.‚Äù\n\nQ2: ‚ÄúOkay. Thank you. And just on the R&D cycle, are there any updates you can provide on the development of IQ 9 where that currently stands at this time? Is it still being developed or is it in testing phase? If you can provide any color there? Thank you.‚Äù\n\nA2: ‚ÄúYeah. We are actually working on IQ 9 at this time and IQ 9, our vision is basically obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ 8. Right now, we are focused on a few areas. One is, we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the \\[indiscernible\\] (00:49:10), the 600-volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread. GaN-on-GaN, GaN-on-silicon, they are becoming widespread.‚Äù\n\nQ3: ‚ÄúAnd just on the new acquisitions and the digital strategy, could you maybe talk about like what's the goal here in terms of reducing that soft cost? I think a couple in the solar developers have talked about $7,000 or $8,000 per customer of soft costs. So, is the idea here to kind of like bring it down similar to probably what the soft cost is in Europe and Australia or what's your thought process here? And I have just a quick follow-up after that as well. Thanks.**‚Äù**\n\n**‚Äú**Yeah. So, soft cost is an outcome of what our goal is. Our goal is to provide our installer partners with the best service possible, and so ‚Äì installer partners actually as well as the homeowner. So, we have mapped out a very detailed journey of both how the entire installation process as well for both the installers as well as our homeowners starting with leads all the way through design, proposal, permitting, procurement, commissioning, installation commissioning, permission to operate O&M, et cetera. And so, if we do an amazing job on that where we really create a very powerful platform and these acquisitions that we're talking about are important elements of that journey, then I think the natural outcome of that is going to be a reduction in the soft cost. But we are starting with a very clear focus that this is about bringing great value for our long-tail installer partners.‚Äù\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nStaying invested in a company post-earnings is normally not our strategy. We scan every company on the earnings calendar and dive in the fundamentals/growth of that company. If you find 3 solid companies which you want to gamble your money on per week, there is a possibility to earn 10% ROI on each of those companies. Investing in boomer company of which the stock increases 2% post-earnings is not interesting for us. It rather be +7% at least, or nothing. \n\nEnphase however is a different story. They keep beating their forecasts every quarter. There is enormous demand for their products and they a growing in supply and demand. \n\n\\- Management is amazing. The way Badri perceives the business is very client focused. They are well aware that this is a client focused business and quality and client experience are top priority. \n\n\\- With regards to future growth they have some very interesting things going on. IQ 8, which I expect to be finished during the 2nd quarter of this year. Then it is the job of the new CMO to promote the heck out of this. As Badri said in the call: ‚Äúpeople might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.‚Äù\n\n\\- There is so much growth opportunity in this company. And yes the P/E is high, but you must see Enphase as a tech company and not solar producer. Last quarter they hired 85 employees. \n\n\\- So our plan: keep this gem for one more quarter to see how their results are in the next quarter. Have they improved their semiconductors problem or not? Are they still beating the forecast or not. Then we‚Äôll see from there on. This weekend‚Äôs plan: scan earnings calendar of next week to find the next gem üòä  \n\n**Q1 2021 forecasts:** \n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n‚Ä¢ Revenue to be within a range of $280.0 million to $300.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n‚Ä¢ GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, as there are no remaining tariff refunds pending approval; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding stock-based compensation expenses\n\n‚Ä¢ GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64.0 million to $67.0 million, including $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization\n\n‚Ä¢ Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42.0 million to $45.0 million, excluding $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization", "id": "lgrhvo", "created_utc": 1612955485.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Strong company.

{"title": "(2/10) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak\n\n> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.\n\n> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.\n\n> * Bitcoin bounced around Wednesday, one day after soaring to an all-time high below $48,000. Crypto enthusiasts are wondering whether other companies will follow Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla and invest in bitcoin. In the latest sign of institutional interest, Tesla revealed Monday that it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4\n\n> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.\n\n> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM‚Äôs crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Twitter is ‚Äòbigger than any one account,‚Äô CEO says\n\n> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is ‚Äúbigger than any one account,‚Äù said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments\n\n> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he‚Äôs no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing\n\n> * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/UcNjYBi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jzsj6V4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bEWgiAZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/K690R0u.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/NGnaqee.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vLhBS2V.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1p6W5Oy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qxoyyCv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9Jx5owU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/I9j8fVZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/iAjNlv8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1MVWFH6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xZ56Gwf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2MZhVwY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TLRY\n* APHA\n* ACB\n* AUVI\n* FSR\n* GM\n* PACB\n* ADA.X\n* BPTH\n* HTBX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-under-armour-twitter-bunge-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Coca-Cola (KO)** ‚Äì Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates.

{"title": "$AGTC - What I haven't seen anyone mention", "selftext": "Posted by: [u/aguacatesoup]\n\nHey all, I've seen this research on this stock all weekend since I'm considering investing. I've seen multiple posts about it and have read them all, but I haven't seen anyone mention some very odd (potentially bullish) things about this stock. I am not a financial advisor.\n\nI will link all the sources to my information down below.\n\nThis stock is pretty volatile and has been jumping all over the place for years. It reached a high of $30.46 back in 2014 and currently it is at $5.27, with a 52-week high of $7.40\nThe reasonable explanation for this stock's volatility is because it's a biotech company still in the clinical trial phase. What really interests me though is that 6+ years later after that initial high, it appears to be on the uptrend again. They are in Phase 2 expansion for X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa, in Phase 1/2 for Achromatopsia and Bionic Sight.\n\nWhat really REALLY interests me are these 4 facts I will lay out below\n* 1. In July of 2020, Roth Capitol analyst Dr. Zegbeh Jallah speculated that AGTC could attract interest of a Sanofi buyout.\n* 2. On February 1st, 2021 that same analyst updated the price estimate from $30 to $35\n* 3. On February 2nd, 2021 users on StockTwits were up in arms about AGTC's stock stubbornly remaining at $4.05 even though there was a HUGE increase in volume. It later comes to light that big whales Blackrock Inc. & Empery Investments both made large purchases of AGTC's stock on that day, which explains why the stock remained at $4.05 (market manipulation?)\nBlackrock made a purchase of 1,732,067 shares, Empery made a purchase of 3,932,584.\n* 4. AGTC is releasing their Earnings Report on 2/11, and are also hosting a conference before the market opens on Thursday.\n\n**Analysis of these 4 facts:**\nFirst off, let's take a look at the analyst at Roth Capitol. \n> \"Zegbeh Jallah, Ph.D. is a Managing Director, Senior Research Analyst in the Biotech sector. Prior to joining ROTH, she was a Senior Biopharma Research Strategist at Piper Jaffray, where she worked in close partnership with the Biopharma Sector Analysts to author and develop thematic Biotechnology research with unique insights. Ms. Jallah‚Äôs universe includes mid-cap biotech companies developing technologies for ophthalmology, auto-immune, and oncology indications. She holds a Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh, and is a trained scientist with over 10 years of scientific research experience.\"\n\nBased on her credentials, I'm inclined to believe she has valuable insight into this field of Biotech that we, the retail investors, do not. In September 2020, she raised the price estimate from $25 to $26. In November of 2020, she raised it again from $26 to $30. Then finally on February 1st, she raised it to $35. What could cause her to raise the price estimate 3x in 6 months? To me, this is indicative of promising findings from AGTC's clinical trials. There hasn't been any information from her about Sanofi interest since July of 2020. Obviously a company buyout, if it were happening in this case, would take time to get everything in order. For her to raise the price point yet again at the beginning of Feb and then the very next day Blackrock and Empery make those purchases...hmm..\n\nNext, we have the large institutional share purchase on February 2nd, 2020. This to me is the most baffling. Why would they keep the price at exactly $4.05 while they purchased their shares? Why not lower? Why are they purchasing before the release of the Earnings Report? The exchange of shares at this price is very odd indeed. Almost like it was agreed upon beforehand. \n\nFinally, we have their conference & Earnings Report release on February 11th. This is typical of AGTC to hold a conference in conjuction with the release of the ER. Historically, the share price drops $1-2 after the release of the ER, as they are usually negative being that this company is still in R&D. Given that, I would normally wait for the conference before deciding to invest. But something seems up here. Does anyone else have some insight on what could be going on? Why are these institutions buying in before the ER? \n\n**Conclusion:**\nI have no fucking clue what is going on. But if a more seasoned investor out there has suspicions on what could be going down here, your input would be greatly appreciated. This stock seems like a great long term investment, no doubt about that. I guess the question is when to get in.

{"title": "$RESN - Resonant Inc - 5G play. My first DD", "selftext": "I got involved with trading recently and have loved seeing all the amazing DD some of you put together. So I figured it's time I give back. I haven't seen $RESN talked about recently so I decided to do a bit of a dive on it. (I apologize beforehand for lack of meme-speak and rockets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nResonant Inc, a late-stage development company, designs and develops filters for radio frequency (RF) and front-ends used in the mobile device, automotive, medical, Internet-of-things, and related industries in the United States and internationally. It uses Infinite Synthesized Networks technology, a software platform to configure and connect resonators that are building blocks of RF filters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy is this important? Resonant ($RESN) makes products for mobile and IoT devices that connect through 5G. Their technology allows to filter out lower frequencies that can overlap with 5G frequencies, critical as the RF spectrum becomes more and more congested. This technology has the potential to be in every 5G device.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, they signed a strategic investment and a licensing agreement to design 5G RF filters with their XBAR¬Æ technology, with Murata Manufacturing, THE biggest RF Filter and Duplexer manufacturer in the world. (Source: Navian, 2019)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn late December 2020, the company released a letter to shareholders indicating that they surpassed a shipment milestone of 50Million RF Filters, among other encouraging news. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150894/0/en/Resonant-Issues-Shareholder-Letter-and-Provides-Corporate-Update.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYesterday, February 9th 2021, they provided prelim FY2020 results, showing revenues increased 330% YoY to a Record $3.2 Million. Also reported that as of December 31, 2020, Resonant had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.0 million, which included $11.0 million of net proceeds from sales of equity under the Company‚Äôs previously announced at-the-market (ATM) program. And as far as I can tell, no debt.

Resonant has reached a milestone with Murata Manufacturing allowing them to move to the next phase of building a commercial platform & high-volume manufacturing of XBAR-based RF filters for 5G.

The best part is, they have opted for an intellectual property licensing business model, in the manner of Qualcomm, ARM and others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n$RESN seems to still fly under the radar but has a good runaway to go for 2021.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this one!

Each band must be isolated using filters to avoid interference that will drain battery life, reduce data speeds, and cause dropped calls.

{"title": "Gamida Cell ($GMDA) is starting to run! My first ever stock purchase, and why I love it.", "selftext": "So, I know this gain is nothing compared to others on here, but my day was made today. When I first got into the stock market 3 months back, this was the first stock I ever bought and I made it about 25% of my portfolio after researching it ($5k initial investment). My average cost was $6.80. In December, when they came out with good news from their Phase II trials it went up which was exciting, and hovered around $8-$10. Today as soon as the news of their successful stage- 3 clinical trial cure for bone/blood cancers released with overwhelmingly positive results it LEAPED after hours! I'm now up approximately 150% on GMDA (Over $6,600 gain today alone). I think I saw it as high as $18.15 post-presentation and has consolidated around $16.60 range. I do believe we'll see another run at market open tomorrow based on the news. It was a stock I felt good about investing in initially, and it's awesome to see 150%+ gains from your first ever stock pick. This stock helped push my entire portfolio to 55% gains overall in a little under 3 months.\n\nFor those who don't know what Gamida Cell ($GMDA) is, they are an advanced Israeli-based cell therapy company committed to cures for patients with blood cancers and serious blood diseases.\n\nTheir main focus is Omidubicel, an advanced cell therapy under development as a potential life-saving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (bone marrow) transplant solution for patients with hematologic malignancies (blood cancers). With Omidubicel, it results in faster recovery, fewer infections, and fewer days in the hospital, and increased survival than the standard umbilical cord blood transplantation that's currently in use in the medical system. Omidubicel should be considered the new standard of care for patients eligible for the umbilical cord blood transplantation if they get FDA approval (which I think they will).\n\nEven with this recent leap in price, I think it still has a LONG way to run. The clinical data results will form the basis of a Biologics License Application (BLA) that Gamida Cell expects to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2021. If it works out, they could be one of the first blood cancer-curing companies to be FDA approved which would be HUGE! If they get FDA approval this year it's going to run even more. I still don't think it's too late to jump in on this stock. Cathy Wood has even added a lot of it to ARK.\n\nAlso, I'm not a financial advisor.

I put about $2,500 into the market last March when everything was tanking.  I bought about 30 companies across as many sectors as I could find.

But I could also take my chips off the table and be happy with my \\~$5000 profit.  Sure the market could continue to go up, but it could also crash.  If it goes up, I still could benefit from my original $2500 being left in and if it crashes I can invest even more now and hopefully replicate the above.  Either way, it is important to note that I don't actually need this money for anything.  The $2500 and the $5000 I've made aren't needed for bills or credit card debt, or anything else.

There‚Äôs no doubt that artificial intelligence is here to stay and that it‚Äôs impacts have been tremendous, but there is a new player in town that goes by the name of Quantum Computing. A brief explanation of QC(Quantum Computing), QC completely changes the way computational problems are solved. On a classical computer you are dealing with binary pieces of information that can only solve certain types of problems, this means that some things are unsolvable. Enter QC, this is able to use particles slowed down to bear absolute zero and use their motion as means for computing(this is a very brief explanation and I urge you to research more if you are interested). Because of QC companies can now solve problems that were previously impossible, and right now there are a very limited amount of companies invested in QC. Companies like MSFT, GOOG and IBM own and create quantum computers but right now there is no easy way for businesses to access there potential. QUBT has made proprietary software that bridges the gap between the two and its really amazing. Not only do they allow customers direct access to the worlds top class quantum computers, but they also allow customers to run programs that can simulate them in classical computers. This means that Companies won‚Äôt have to change drastically to get the benefits of QC.

So that situation is fluid. It doesn‚Äôt look good for Tesla, tho.

But I consider that a waste of time because all you need to know is that Tesla has quality and safety problems with its Chinese consumers to know that the company is not in a position to maintain its current production without addressing these quality of build problems, much less increase production. The Chinese government isn‚Äôt like the US government and will not allow Tesla to continue to sell its cars with severe safety and quality problems. If Tesla doesn‚Äôt find a way to fix its current quality of build complaints problem in its Chinese cars, it will either fall farther behind its Chinese EV competitors as it slows production to improve its quality of build, or it will have its market share cut by order of the Chinese government if it has to take unsafe models of its cars off the road. It is conceivable that Tesla, with its massive capital, could pour almost unlimited resources and talent into its production to improve quality of build, but then it will be building cars at a greater loss, and that would take its earnings in the opposite direction of the earnings growth its high P/E demands. \n\nAll of these weaknesses and flaws will prevent Tesla from pulling off a successful defense of its market share. Tesla never addressed its poor quality of production culture in the US factories and now that problem is apparently creeping into its Chinese factories even though the quality of build of Chinese-built Teslas were supposed to be better than its US-built Teslas. The poor production quality is a problem of Elon Musk‚Äôs leadership (Google ‚Äútesla production hell‚Äù).
