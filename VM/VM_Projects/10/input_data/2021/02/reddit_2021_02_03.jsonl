{"title": "DD: Lockheed Martin (LMT)", "selftext": "Happy Hump-Day gang, here’s some more DD for you...\n\nThe Ticker: LMT (Lockheed Martin)\n\nThe Thesis: LMT provides an outstanding rebound opportunity as it has underperformed the market despite being expected to thrive going forward, it also provides a healthy 3.21% dividend to those who own the underlying stock.\n\nThe Evidence: \n\nGeneral Company Context:\nThe main threat that loomed over LMT’s head over the past few months was that the US government would significantly reduce spending for FY ‘21. However, the US Government approved a budget that holds the defense budget over $700 Billion once again this year, which essentially removes that fear from the table. With plenty of money to spend, LMT remains the leading supplier in the Defense industry globally, and also boasts a long track record of working with the US Government. That track record only has been lengthening recently, as LMT sold nearly $100million in software to the US Navy and Air Force over the past week. Additionally LMT has been working with NASA on a $250million project to develop a supersonic jet. Outside of the US, LMT holds strong prospects as well. It has recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne, a supplier rocket engines, which should decrease costs for LMT going forward. Additionally, LMT remains firmly in contention to retain a contract from the Indian government to re-fit their Air force’s soviet era Air Force fleet.\n\nAnalyst Ratings and Price Forecast:\nTake a peek at the CNN analyst ratings:\n\nLow: 334 (+.2%)\nMed: 407.5 (+22.3%)\nHigh: 480 (+44.1%)\nAll 11 analysts rate LMT a Buy\n\nCNN Analyst Ratings Chart: https://gyazo.com/ea4dffaca464ce631327ebf425cc0d3a\n\nAlready, the lowest projection being slightly above the current price is a huge green light. But, double checking with another source strengthens that signal. Schwab maintains a price target of LMT at $504 (+51.3%), which is based on a ‘22 EPS projection of $28.57, which equates to a PE of 17.65x. Their ‘21 EPS estimate is $26.38, which if trading at the current PE of 13.23x equates to a price of 349. However, LMT has a 5yr P/E average of 21x, and over the past 2 years tends to trade in the 15-18 range. Assuming only a slight bump in PE to the bottom of that trading range at 15x, Schwab’s ‘21 EPS estimate of $26.38 would lead to a share price of $395.7, and an 18x P/E would represent a share price of $474.84.\n\nLMT’s 1yr price positioning reflects the positive sentiment taken form P/E and price forecast analysis. Underperforming the S&P by nearly 40% this year, LMT remains only 19.86% off of its corona-crash low, but still has 59% to run before hitting its pre corona highs. With P/E forecasts showing the relatively low expected downside, I find it unlikely LMT returns to its dead lows, and find the 3:1 upside/downside ratio to be quite conservative.\n\n1yr Price Chart: https://gyazo.com/dd466d23f063898c9730413a0d6cb72b\n\nCurrently the P/B ratio of LMT stands at 15.55x. The standard trading range for LMT is usually anywhere between 20-40x, barring 2019 which had LMT trading between 50-200x. Either way, for LMT a 15.55x P/B ratio is at the minimum 20-25% lower than normal, and I expect it to correct towards that 20x mark over the next year.\n\n5yr PB Chart: https://gyazo.com/f117b91e4f6c03478f7cc666c38aac0e\n\nEarnings Information:\nLMT has its next earnings call in April, so anyone opening a position extending beyond then may find this pertinent. Over the last 4 quarters LMT has beaten on both revenue, and EPS in every quarter, beating EPS by an average of 2.31% and Revenue by an average of 3.36%. The actual earnings numbers are below.\n\n4Q20: EPS Expected 6.31 —> Actual 6.38 (+1.09%) \n            Rev Expected 16.92B —> Actual 17.03B (+.64%)\n\n3Q20: EPS Expected 6.1 —> Actual 6.25 (+2.53%)\n\t     Rev Expected 16.14B —> Actual 16.50B (+2.22%)\n\n2Q20: EPS Expected 5.71 —> Actual 5.79 (+1.42%)\n\t     Rev Expected 15.20B —> Actual 16.22B (+6.71%)\n\n1Q20: EPS Expected 5.84 —> Actual 6.08 (+4.19%)\n\t     Rev expected 15.07B —> Actual 15.65B (+3.88%)\n\nDisclosure: \nThis post is not professional financial advice, and represents my research and opinions.\n\nAfter doing this research on LMT I have opened $330-$360 Call Debit Spreads Expiring 1/21/22\nI entered this trade at a net debit of -$12.28/spread. The $330 Strike has a delta of .54 and the $360 strike has a delta of .41.  I chose the 1yr date for these options as I am fairly confident in a 1 year target of at least $395 but want to play it safe in terms of not losing on this trade. \n\nMy max risk / spread is my debit of -$1228\nMy max gain is the difference between the strikes ($3000) minus what I paid to enter the spread ($1228), which comes to a total of $1,772. This gain means that for every $1 that I risk, I can make $1.44.\n\nMy breakeven Price is LMT: $342.28\n\nI may also enter a long position on the underlying stock in LMT over the coming days.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\nDo with this as you will, and may you reap your rewards.

CPSH: Gapping up on a seemingly pretty weak catalyst. Low float, so could see some volatile swings this morning. Be careful, and make sure to have an exit strategy if you choose to enter a trade. Premarket resistance around 9.80, with support at 8.85-8.90.\n3. AREC: Gapping up continuing momentum from yesterday's trading, no new catalyst. Low float so could see some volatile swings. Sometimes these day-2 plays die down early in the morning without providing trading opportunities, but it's worth keeping an eye on for a continuation play if price action and volume permit it. Premarket resistance at 4.63.\n4. ZYNE: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at around 4.40, with a potential gap to fill to a daily chart resistance of around 4.80. \n5. SNDL: Gapping up on momentum from previous days of trading, no new catalyst. Showing some strength in the premarket, with good price action. Extremely high float, so this could be a slow mover, but I'll be keeping an eye on it. \n6. SELB: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Good price action on okay volume in premarket. Showing some weakness now after if failed over premarket resistance, but I like it if it can get back up and cross that resistance at 5.74.\n7. CRBP: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good price action and volume in the premarket. Premarket resistance around 3.14, with possible support around 2.50.\n8. CANF: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading.

We could see a push back to all-time-highs for SPY, but I expect to see some resistance. Silver up again today, and I'll be watching GME with popcorn once again. We've been seeing some little spikes in volatility, so things could potentially get choppy again. If it does happen to get choppy, use proper risk management and there is nothing wrong with sitting a day out.

{"title": "Why Jeff Bezos stepping down as the CEO of Amazon might cause Tesla shares to fall short-term: in depth explanation:", "selftext": " \n\nDate: 03/02/2021 \n\nHi guys, my name’s Ryan and this is a document giving reasoning behind why I think Tesla stock (TSLA) will plunge in the near future. This is purely an opinion and I don’t suggest anybody uses it to influence anybody’s investments strategy. \n\nI am writing this on the 3rd February 2021 and as of yesterday Jeff Bezos has announced that in the third quarter of 2021, he will be stepping down from the CEO of Amazon (AMZN) to become the executive chairman of the board. He said in his blog to employees the reason he is doing this is to focus on other ventures such as The Washington Post, Bezos Climate Fund and Blue Origin. Blue Origin is one of SpaceX's’ main competitor (SpaceX being owned by Elon Musk). Musk and Bezos have had a rivalry for a few years now over their space companies with Musk recently overtaking Bezos as the richest man on the planet. Over the years they have had disagreements and disputes over twitter concerning their space companies. \n\nWhat triggered me to write this was Musk’s February 2nd post (the same day as Bezos’s announcement) “Off Twitter for a while”. This could be for various reasons but my thinking is that Musk is having to rethink his time management. After Bezos soon leaves his position of CEO, he will have lots more time to focus his efforts towards Blue Origin which rivals SpaceX. This means Blue Origin will be able to grow at a faster rate due to Bezos focusing on the company more. This will prove challenging for SpaceX to compete with Blue Origin. Musk making this tweet suggests he will be very busy in the coming “while” and my guess is that he is having to make a very big decision: Should he step down from CEO of Tesla aswell and dedicate more time to SpaceX so it can compete with Bezos’s Blue Origin? \n\nIn my opinion there are 2 main reasons as to why Tesla stock has soared more than 750% since the start of 2020: Visionary-green car company and Elon Musk. The financials behind Tesla haven’t been worthy of a 750% increase in comparison to other S&P 500 companies. Elon Musk has a quirky, down to Earth, intelligent personality, giving off an image of friendliness and a “memey” jokey perspective on life. In my opinion this is the dominant reason people are buying Tesla stock.  \n\nIf Elon Musk using this “Off Twitter” time to reevaluate his time management and maybe position at Tesla, I am willing to bet Musk is going to take a lesser role at the company and because I believe the reason people buy Tesla stock is Musk, when he drops out, the stock price will follow. Therefore, my conclusion is that depending on Musk’s decision, we could see a shakeup at Tesla resulting in the stock falling in the short-term. In my opinion shorting the stock would still be a gamble but I believe there is good reason behind it. \n\nI however don’t recommend anybody to act on this post, I hope you enjoyed reading my predictions, I haven’t seen a post about this yet so that’s why I am sharing my thoughts with the investing community. \n\nThank you, Ryan.", "id": "lbze5c", "created_utc": 1612389214.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Do you really think bezos or musk actually do the work in their space companies?

Being beta sensitive also means that leveraged ETFs are short beta, meaning you can wait until a large dip or large spike in vol to get in. \n3.

{"title": "Avoiding FOMO and Catching Tops with Options", "selftext": "So it's taken a ***LOT*** of practice for me to learn to take profits. Two of my biggest failures this year:\n\n* Buying gold futures right before the acceleration upwards, and doubling down at the top. I broke even.\n* Sell $HTZ calls and making $24K in premium before a baby short squeeze which brought me to only $2K.\n\nOne of the tricks I've learned is to manage your emotions by ***expressing the trade in a way that provides optionality to ride the trade with your emotions.***\n\nFor example, DFV had enormous conviction $GME would go up. A pure long position makes sense here.\n\n99% of the other people on WSB however had a different view $GME would rocket up and then come crashing down. In my view, **a pure long or short position is a huge mistake for this group.** Timing is impossible. Your emotions will get involved too soon. If you exit too soon you'll want to buy in again, but damn you know the implosion is coming, should you go short instead? How much should you take off?\n\n**The Setup**\n\nSo you see a stock whose price has begun to accelerate. You know this thing is going to crash at some point, but you also know it might continue to go parabolic in the short run. What do you do?\n\nThe answer is below, I encourage you to try to think about what you would do using options. Hopefully, this exercise will help put some folds back in that smooth AF brain of yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n**Opening the Position**\n\nPut on a straddle with a shorted dated call and a longer dated put. As the price keeps accelerating upwards, keep rolling the straddle so that it naturally increases in value. Once you stop being able to roll without spending additional capital stops, it's time to start with your exit strategy. You may also want to consider legging in if you're decent at timing.\n\nClosing the Position\n\nThere are 3 ways to close depending on how you feel. The beauty is there's no way turning back once you initiate.\n\n1. Close the straddle, take profits. This is my least favorite.\n2. Sell the call once you can't roll any futher. Hold the put until the collapse. If the underlying stalls or begins a crawl upwards and IV starts to implode, close the put sooner.\n3. If you're greedy, sell a call at a strike between your put and the call. Now you're holding a directional spread and a put. Hold until collapse. Again, if the underlying stalls or crawls upwards, close everything sooner.\n\n**Risks**\n\nIf at any point the underly stops moving like a rocket (to the moon or the ground), theta gang will eat you alive. Make sure you hold a put that will give you enough time to express your view and GTFO once IV crush begins. This is a huge signal momentum will not continue. Also make sure you have enough time value on the put so you're not eaten alive by theta gang.\n\n**Why is this beautiful?**\n\nYou can fish for a top comfortably with IV guiding your moves.

Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:\n\nNova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMetrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.\n\nMarket cap: \\~2.2 Billion\n\nP/E ratio: \\~42\n\nHas beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)\n\nThe stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.\n\nDaily volume is low (about 150,000)\n\nIn a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it \"received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions.\"  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?\n\nAnyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.\n\nThe company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).\n\nI did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTechnicals:\n\nI don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021\n\nThe options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.", "id": "lbp4ds", "created_utc": 1612363772.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "This actually seems like a decent stock with a longer term potential.

{"title": "Clarification on \"short ladder\" attacks and Round Lots vs Odd Lots", "selftext": "So I have seen a lot of posts pointing to GME (and others) volume as an indication of short ladder attacks. While I’m not claiming they are or aren’t happening, I think it is important to understand how institutional trading works. For reference, I work on the sell side so im a semi-suit (im not an execution trader, but I have enough friends who are).\n\nYou may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments, this is by design and has a name, they’re called “round lots” and are used to break up large orders. These round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bid/ask walls and ensure orderly markets. They are not evidence of a short ladder attack.\n\nThink about it, if a fund wanted to buy $1,000,000,000 worth of AAPL, they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them, and a limit order would never fill. They could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order, or find a willing partner for a block trade. They also, very frequently have to use low touch VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algos (much different than prop algos) to buy in the open markets on an exchange. These algorithms ingest the order, and then execute the trade based on a predefined % of volume, ie. the sell side execution trader never wants his/her orders to take up more than xx% of volume. As the algo operates throughout the day, it executes thousands of round lot trades. These round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day. All the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades (blocks not in increments of 100 shares).\n\n**TLDR:** 100 share blocks are round lots and are not in any way an indication of a short ladder attack, they simply show institutional order flow.\n\n**Positions:** 30 shares of GME at $14.07\n\nMost importantly... **HOLD THE LINE**\n\nEdits with interesting questions:\n\n**Q: If you're going to execute a short ladder attack it makes sense to choose a round number like 100**\n\nA: They're not choosing 100 shares, their order is much larger, probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares. The algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade. The reason for this is simple, its easy to match  100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders. If the seller is asking $xx.xx for 100 shares, the buyer can bid $xx.xx for 100 shares and the match is made. If you have 13 shares at one price, 29 shares at another price, and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side, complexity increases materially.\n\n**Q: Why do I see a lot of odd lots in AH trading?**\n\nA: Because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a MM, so they just execute an odd lot order. It is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above.", "id": "lbqgix", "created_utc": 1612367308.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "What is this?
