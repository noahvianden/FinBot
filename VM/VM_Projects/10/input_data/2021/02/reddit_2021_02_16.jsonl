The rocket ship thrusters are just warming up.\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nSOS Ltd. is a small player in the cryp world with the share price being only $7.44 (as of writing this). It's not like some of the smaller cryp mining players like $CWLD or $MGTI who are sub $1.00 but it instead has a nice foundation of a few dollars. When comparing this to other stocks like **MARA ($38)** and **RIOT ($39)** this has potential for huge gains.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nNow why am I bringing this to your attention? Because I honestly believe in cryp growing long-term and becoming a fundamentally important part of our economy. This would also mean the companies mining cryp would go up in value and a lot.\n\nCryp is getting a lot of attention lately with **Elon Musk** buying **1.5bn** worth of B and even considering to accept it as a payment method. B is becoming more mainstream as we speak and it also hit a ATH which helped MARA and RIOT grow a whopping **+62%** and **+67%** over Friday and Monday respectively.\n\n📷\n\nElon Musk had \"#b\" in his twitter bio\n\nElon Musk had \"#b\" in his twitter bio\n\nWhen comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS then we can see that $SOS has been unnoticed so far and with those two companies going up over **1500% and 1000%** respectively in the last three months while SOS has only gone up around 100%. This is just **untapped potential** and I hope you get on the train while it's still in the station.\n\n📷\n\nComparison between MARA, RIOT and SOS\n\n***About SOS Limited***\n\nSOS is an emerging blockchain-based and big data-driven marketing and solution provider, with a nationwide membership base of approximately **20 million** in China. Recently, SOS has outlined its strategy in **block and cryp**, which include a series of initiatives to expand its business into cryp mining as well as **cryp security and insurance**. The core infrastructure of SOS' marketing data, technology and solutions to insurance and emergency rescue services is built on big date, block-based technology, cloud computing, AI, satellite, and 5G network, etc. We have created a SOS cloud emergency rescue service software as a service (SaaS) platform with three major product categories: basic cloud, cooperative cloud, and information. This system provides innovative marketing solutions to clients such as insurance companies, financial institutions, medical institutions, healthcare providers, auto manufacturers, security providers, senior living assistance providers, and other service providers in the emergency rescue services industry.\n\n📷\n\nSOS Ltd. logo\n\nSOS Ltd. is a **first of its kind** in the cryp industry. SOS is the first **cryp insurance**, **cryp bank** and on top of that they're also **mining cryp**. They're mining B and E. Their goal is to be the first complete **cryp institution**.\n\nRecently they just bought a **cloud computing company** which is capable enough to mine **3-4 B daily and over 50 E**. Now with the rising value of cryps their revenue is only going to keep going up.\n\nAnnounced on February 5th, SOS Ltd. entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower station in Heijang to secure **cheap and renewable electricity** for its cloud cryp mining center.\n\nAdding on top of that, today, February 9th, they announced their receipt of **5000 pcs of Mining rigs** which arrived ahead on schedule. This rigs can generate about **B Hash Power 175P and H Hash Power 350G**. If these machine operates as expected, **the annual ROI (return on investment) is projected to be significant based on the current cryp price momentum**. The seller also confirmed that they have enough inventories of cryp mining rigs and that they can fulfill the next two batches of shipments as scheduled. SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented, \"we have secured supply of cryp mining equipment that is expected to generate sufficient cryp hash power to allow us to promptly capture the rising cryp price.\"\n\nJust today on February 9th, they also announced the exercise of warrants for approx. **$48 million** in gross proceeds. This took a slight dip on the stock today but **we recovered** really well and this can only mean good for the company. Having more cash/liquidity, more financial freedom and opportunities to catch onto.\n\n📷\n\n$SOS minute chart (February 9th)\n\n***Financials***\n\nSOS Ltd.'s balance sheet is just beautiful. Here we can see that they have a really good amount of cash in hand to improve and they're debt is only a measly ca $200k.\n\n📷\n\n$SOS balance sheet\n\nMarket cap is 264m with the share price of $4.19 as of market close 09.02.2021.\n\nIf we take a look at the performance of the stock we can see that it hasn't had its boom yet unlike most other stocks who have gained 100-500% in the last few months. This gives me **more confidence** that there might be a **breakout** soon when more people find out about this company.\n\n📷\n\n$SOS performance\n\n***Technical indicators***\n\nThe technical indicators are also looking positive. We're seeing a **good volume increase** which usually indicates a breakout soon and it getting more traction. We recently just **broke the last resistance** ceiling as well and we are in a continuous **upwards trend** at the moment.\n\n📷\n\n$SOS daily chart\n\nNow if we take a look at the weekly chart for SOS we can see it has been upwards of **$30** before which can indicate that it can reach that again. We're seeing a parabola happening, it seems like it's just the start of it. We all know these stocks which have been high, fell down and held a certain price for months until a **breakout back up** to previous ATH or even higher. Also looking at the **volume increase**, it's huge - volume increase is usually a **bullish indicator**.\n\n📷\n\n$SOS weekly chart\n\n**Summary/TL;DR**\n\nSOS Ltd. is a stock which **has not boomed yet** in this bull market meaning that we still have a chance to get on the train before it leaves. SOS has a great balance sheet and positive technical indicators showing an **upwards trend** at the moment.\n\nThey are a unique kind of a company in the cryp currency field and have **a lot of potential** to be the setting stone for others. Cryp currencies are only becoming more and more mainstream, more popular means more attraction which means a price increase in those coins. This increases SOS's revenue by each year as we can expect B and E to soar in the next few years, probably even few months as B just hit a new ATH. B has a lot more confidence now growing as well since the most well known and richest man on Earth, Elon Musk, just invested into B worth $1.5bn.\n\nWith good news this week we can only expect it to do well in the future. I hope you get on the train with me!\n\nPosition: 3550 @ $5.38 (I had this stock on my watchlist for around a week now but only managed to get some stock liquidated to get into this stock yesterday)\n\n*\\*I am not a financial advisor, nor is this investment advice.

{"title": "Overview of Environment Related Investments Under President Biden", "selftext": "Biden is president and the House and Senate are all under Democrat control! \n\nThe first month of the Biden presidency has set the precedent for  things to come. Biden signed executive orders to re-join the Paris  Climate Accord and cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline from Alberta, Canada.\n\nPolitics  has consequences and opportunities. Here are some environmental themes I  see developing plus many investment ideas to play under a Biden  presidency.\n\n**Green everything**\n\nThe  Democrats will push in the direction of the Green New Deal, which means  more clean energy solutions – wind, solar and regulating oil and gas.\n\nThis  will pump up already inflated clean energy stocks. If the ESG bubble  wasn’t big enough already, don’t be shocked if it continues to grow.  Their yields will continue to decrease and their businesses will have to  grow at exponentially increasing rates to justify their valuations. I  expect ESG stocks to decouple from value names at some point.\n\nESG stocks like Tesla (TSLA) and First Solar (FSLR) are direct plays on  Biden’s agenda. Buying into these stocks at todays’ prices, you’re only  return is if another guy bids higher. Maybe you can make it work, but I  don’t see great risk vs. reward buying into the obvious. I’ll check back  on these stocks many years later. \n\n**Batteries and electrification require base metals…**\n\nBiden’s climate plan promises  “millions of solar panels” and heavy investment in the electric vehicle  (EV) industry. Along with EVs, Biden wants to install 500,000 charging  stations. Windmills, solar panels and batteries need a lot of compounds  and metals – nickel, cobalt, zinc, copper, rare earths, steel, coal,  silver, etc.\n\nThe play here is simple: avoid the obvious green  energy stocks and buy the undervalued metals/compounds. Not only are  they needed in green infrastructure, but industrializing nations will  offer an extra tailwind.\n\nCheck out these base metal blue chips: Norilsk Nickel (NILSY), Vale (VALE), Teck Resources (TECK) and Ferrexpo (FXPO.L).\n\n**and precious metals**\n\nAs for  silver miners, the largest producers Fresnillo (FRES.L), Pan American  (PAAS) and First Majestic (AG) are solid picks. Mid-tier producers like  Endeavour (EXK) and Mag Silver (MAG) will give you more upside. If you  really want to multiply your wealth, the juniors can give you huge  leverage to the price of silver. Some names include Aurcana (AUN.V),  Impact (IPT.V) and Aftermath (AAG.V).\n\nThe average solar panel of 2m2 uses around 0.7 ounces of silver. If Biden lives up to his promise of installing [500 million solar panels](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbryce/2020/07/14/joe-bidens-2-trillion-energy-plan-ignores-cost-land-use-conflicts), American solar panels will add 350 million ounces of extra silver demand!\n\nEach  EV uses 0.9 to 1.8 ounces of silver which is twice the amount of an ICE  vehicle. The silver institute estimates EVs will consume [90 million ounces of silver per year by 2025](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-consumption-global-automotive-sector-approach-90-million-ounces-2025/).\n\nThe industrial tailwind as well [monetary tailwind](https://fundamentalsfirstinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gold-and-Silver-Research-Report.pdf) for silver looks promising.\n\n**Regulating oil and gas is actually bullish**\n\nThe Biden  administration is regulating oil and gas making them harder to produce  domestically. Combine that with production destruction from COVID and  increasing demand, oil and gas prices have to rise. In fact, they’re  rising as we speak.\n\nThe surviving companies will be the main beneficiaries.\n\nAntero  Resources (AR), Sandridge (SD), Suncor (SU), Schlumberger (SLB) and  Occidental will give you exposure to oil and natural gas (mostly in  North America). If you want to avoid the West altogether, Lukoil (LUKOY)  and Gazprom (OGZPY) in Russia are dirt cheap. Why not buy oil and gas  for less than a PE of 3 and collect 5% dividends?\n\nNot to mention,  we’re going to see more power outages until scientists improve on green  technology. Until then, fossil fuels will be a relevant energy source.\n\n**Green energy needs black energy**\n\nBelieve it  or not, windmills made of steel use coal, specifically metallurgical  coal. It’s used in the steel making process. Peabody Energy (BTU) just  got lifeline a few weeks ago when they extended their debt maturities.  Peabody already moved 30% since the announcement and 5x since its  November lows. If coal continues to perform, Peabody will be a  multibagger at today’s price. Warrior Met Coal (HCC) is another met coal  play in America.   \n\n**Batteries and electrification needs rare earth metals**\n\nRare earth  metals are used in magnets and batteries among other things. If EVs  take off, rare earth metal stocks will explode. Even without EVs, the  electrification of things will be a tailwind. Appia Energy (API.CN) is a  rare earths play with a uranium kicker. Energy Fuels (UUUU) is a  uranium play with a rare earths kicker. I like Energy Fuels more since  I’m more bullish on uranium.\n\n**The Left finally wants nuclear**\n\nFinally,  the Democrats and the West are warming up to nuclear energy. Joe Biden  and Kamala Harris have shown interest in promoting nuclear energy in the  US. China and Russia are building nuclear reactors like mad – I guess  the Chinese are getting tired of choking on smog.\n\nOn the supply  side, we’re about to run out of excess supply. The only way utility  companies can keep their reactors running is to contract miners to sell  them U3O8 at double today’s spot price of $28/lb. There is tremendous  opportunity in the uranium space. I’m talking *thousands of percent* from trough to peak.\n\nSome  uranium stocks I like: Uranium Participation Corp (U.TO), Yellowcake  (YCA.L) Cameco (CCO), Energy Fuels, Denison Mines (DNN), Paladin  (PDN.AX), Boss Energy (BOE.AX), Goviex (GXU.V), Laramide (LAM.TO),  Azarga (AZZ.TO) and Ur-Energy (URG).\n\n**The market doesn't care what you want**\n\nWhether you like it or not, these are the investment themes developing under the Democrats.\n\nIf you’re a Leftist, you can cheer Biden on and profit off his policies.\n\nIf you’re anything else, the best way to protest is to profit off of the Democrat’s malfeasance.\n\nThe  market doesn’t care about your political virtues.

{"title": "(2/16) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good Tuesday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, February 16th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-16-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq set to add to record highs\n\n> * U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, adding to Friday’s record closes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday for Presidents Day. All three stock benchmarks finished higher last week, in a continuation of February’s strength. For the year, as of Friday’s close, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up nearly 2.8%, 4.8% and 9.4%, respectively.\n\n> * The 30-year Treasury yield held above 2% early Tuesday as investors watched for progress on President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package on Capitol Hill and the push for wider distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the U.S. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to more than 1.26%.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Bitcoin hit a new high over $50,000\n\n> * Bitcoin reached a new record high Tuesday, going over $50,000 per unit for the first time ever, before paring some of those gains. Major firms announced support for digital currencies last week, starting with Tesla revealing it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Mastercard said Thursday it would support certain cryptocurrencies later this year, while BNY Mellon announced the following day it would open up its custody services to digital assets. Bitcoin more than quadrupled in 2020 and it’s up over 60% since the start of this year.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Deep freeze in Texas causes massive energy crunch\n\n> * More than 3.8 million households in Texas are in the dark Tuesday morning, as record low temperatures boosted demand for power for heat that pushed the state’s electric grid to its limits. Rolling blackouts, typically seen on 100-degree summer days, were imposed in Texas. The scarcity of power was so great that spot prices of wholesale electricity on the Texas power grid spiked more than 10,000% on Monday. U.S. oil prices also climbed to a pandemic-high above $60 per barrel. The frigid weather was part of a massive winter blast that brought snow, sleet and freezing rain to the southern Plains, across parts of the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Congress to establish a Capitol riot commission\n\n> * House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that Congress will establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to look into last month’s deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Rules Committee.\n\n> * House impeachment prosecutors who argued for Donald Trump’s conviction of inciting the attack said Sunday that they proved their case. Democrats also railed against Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, saying they were “trying to have it both ways” in finding the former president not guilty while criticizing him.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Biden to make first official domestic trips\n\n> * Trying to move beyond Trump’s acquittal in last week’s impeachment trial, Biden plans to keep up a busy schedule focused on the coronavirus in the coming week. Biden is set to make his first official domestic trips of his presidency, starting with a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday to talk to Americans impacted by the pandemic. Biden on Thursday then visits a Pfizer Covid vaccine facility in Michigan as the drugmaker’s two-shot regime and Moderna’s start making more inroads into pharmacies around the nation.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/DBRFnXS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/htGjHLM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I52tgfD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1jwcLAI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JRy8Aaj.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/u51j1Cc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/htlixKJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/UnHxfVT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/U1NwZNN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* PLTR\n* SOS\n* NNDM\n* RIOT\n* PDAC\n* EBON\n* GLBS\n* GTHX\n* PSTH\n* CVS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-palantir-microstrategy-corelogic-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Palantir Technologies (PLTR)** – The business analytics company’s stock sank 6.2% in the premarket after reporting a quarterly loss, although revenue did top Street estimates on a jump in new contracts.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** PLTR\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=PLTR&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **AutoNation (AN)** – The auto retailer beat estimates by 42 cents a share, with quarterly profit of $2.43 per share.

{"title": "Does investing in funds still makes sense (vs. ETFs) ?", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nthis might sound like a newbie question, but it has been bothering me for the last days. I am currently in the process of considering where to put $500 monthly for the next 25-30 years (passive investing). And the most common and reasonable thing would be to choose the S&P 500 or the MSCI World index ETFs (average annual returns 10% and 8% respectively).\n\nOf course, as greedy as I am, am also looking for better performance, which is above 10% return on average and my first thought was \"What about funds?\". So I decided to check some of them and found the Blackrock World Technology Fund, which has slightly outperformed the S&P500 in the past years and especially in the last 1 year. Of course it has a 2.50% fee (more expensive than a ETF).\n\nBecause this is a big decision for me, I wanted to do more research and found this article in Morningstar (unfortunately in German), which compares the 10-year performance of ETFs and Funds. The conclusion is that only around 20% of the funds manage to beat the average ETF (like MSCI World or S&P500) over a 10 year period. The rest of them either fail and/or go bankrupt. This is an extremely low success rate.\n\nLink to the article:\n\n[https://www.morningstar.de/de/news/205151/kurzfristig-passabel-langfristig-mau-aktiv-verwaltete-fonds-im-stress-test.aspx](https://www.morningstar.de/de/news/205151/kurzfristig-passabel-langfristig-mau-aktiv-verwaltete-fonds-im-stress-test.aspx)\n\nSo I am sitting here asking myself:\n\nIs it worth it to invest in funds?

I’m aware that I would also need more capital than I currently have in my account and a better platform, but having a balance to make this work is achievable I think. I’ll avoid buying on margin altogether as that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nI’m basically looking for advice as to whether this is realistic, or if I’ve failed to consider something drastic.

{"title": "BFLY and the flagship product Butterfly iQ", "selftext": "Good Morning and Happy Trading Day,\n\n     Given the recent merge and ticker change from LGVW—>BFLY, I’m here to discuss my thoughts on the stock and the product. This isn’t a classical DD post to say Cathy Wood this and Bill Gates that, which yes, to the moon etc. Honestly I’m sure one of you can give much better DD on the stock itself. I mostly wanted to just hop on here and explain my experience with the  product, which so far my reviews are quite fantastic. \n\nI’m an MD anesthesiologist, chief resident currently and on my way out of residency soon (finally). I recently picked up a Butterfly iQ+ with... yes... gains I made from playing stocks with y’all. Sort of a graduation present to myself.   \n\nFor those of you who are unaware, Butterfly is famous for their handheld portable ultrasounds which are the most affordable in the industry by far and can connect to an Apple or android device such as iPhone to use as the screen. They are affordable because of a new technology that replaces the piezoelectric crystal(thing that makes the sound waves) in the probe with a chip, surprisingly not at the cost of quality). Just suffice it to say this is a huge deal, as previously we have carted around bulky  ultrasound machines to patient rooms which can include waiting on elevators or even struggling to find one in the first place. \n\nThe iQ+ is a newer model of their original design that reduced the weight of the probe and added more features. So I buy the IQ+ for 2000$ and they have a subscription model for the advanced features such as saving images and certain probe modes, so I opt for the 1000$ lifetime subscription rather than the ~420$ a year thing. They also sell accessories such as cases and belt clips which are pretty neat, overpriced, but you kinda just buy them anyway at this point. All very sleek looking stuff including the wireless charger the probe comes with. It’s very easy to use, simple as plug in to your phone, open the app, adjust your mode with a simple scroll up or down, add some gain (brightness), and start scanning.\n\nThis thing has done for me what the calculator did to math.  Does anyone else remember their grade school math teacher saying “what if someday you don’t have a calculator” as reasoning for not letting you use one on the test? And now we all carry one with us everywhere we go even to the bathroom. Training in my specialty has been similar- placing IVs, arterial lines and other procedures with an ultrasound has often been met with “what if someday you don’t have an ultrasound available.” Well take that, now I carry one around in my pocket when I go to work.\n\nThis company is farrr ahead of any competitor in this space, no other product even comes close. And they’ve already demonstrated further improvement to the product with the iQ+ and new features that have been added to the app. I believe a superior product will carry this company forward, it’s potentially useful to millions of healthcare professionals and students around the world, almost all of whom don’t have one yet (probably don’t even know what they’re missing out on).\n\nI’m 118 shares @ 22.59, plan to hold long term. \n\nTLDR: If you decide to buy just know that you’re investing in a product that actually works.", "id": "ll444u", "created_utc": 1613483240.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 7, "comments": [{"body": "This product is revolutionary!!

While they are growing and expanding, they don't anticipate their new infrastructure to mass produce until late next year.\n\nFurthermore, TSMC's main technological advantage is to produce sub-10 nm semiconductors, which is how they stole a ton of the market from Intel and other manufacturers. Even in the WSJ article it says \"But the harsh reality is that chips for cars have to compete for manufacturing space with other products that generate a much higher return. Nvidia, a major TSMC customer, sells some of its latest gaming processors for several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world’s automobiles can fetch a dollar or less.\" So TSMC isn't going to sacrifice manufacturing things like graphics processors, which have 300x profit, for an automobile component.\n\nBecause of the two points above, any surplus demand can simply go to other foundries like ON Semiconductor. They aren't faced with sub-10 nm semiconductor demands like smartphones require so they are positioned to manufacture automobile semiconductors.\n\nFinally, the P/E and forward P/E for TSMC is almost equal. That tells you that analysts don't expect the revenue to significantly increase beyond last quarter, since TSMC is already at max capacity. ON Semiconductor, on the other hand, has a significantly lower and thus much more favorable forward P/E.\n\nIn my opinion, the TSMC manufacturing pipeline has already been priced into it's stock.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your well-thought-out comment.

{"title": "Thoughts on Merck(MRK)?", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor and I have no background in pharmaceuticals.\n\nCurrently trading below the 20 and 50 day moving average at $74, 3.4% dividend, price targets of $79-100, plans to split the company in two with one focused on womens health, and Berkshire Hathaway opened a position in Nov/December around a similar price point.\n\nI'm just trying to get some input on what the outlook of this company is to the average investor as it seems most analyst are heavily bullish on Merck. I don't expect Merck to be a high growth stock but it seems undervalued.\n\nMRK stock trades at about 4x trailing revenues. Between 2017 and 2020, Merck’s revenues grew by about 13%, from around $42.3 billion to $48.0 billion, primarily led by its oncology drug – Keytruda – which saw its sales double from $7.1 billion to $14.4 billion over the same period.\n\nRecent article going into something about their drugs that seems positive I'm not a scientist, not gonna try to explain this to anyone but if someone wants to explain it to me, I'm all ears.\n\nMerck may continue to see steady revenue growth led by market share gains for Keytruda, and it will also benefit from its robust pipeline, which includes expansion of existing drugs, such as Keytruda, Lynparaza, and Lenvima for other treatments. Barring the increased R&D investments in 2020, Merck’s operating margins have actually been on an upward trajectory, and it will likely trend higher going forward. Merck’s stock has been weighed down partly due to a higher reliance on a single drug - Keytruda - which accounts for 30% of the company’s total sales. Also, the company’s Diabetes portfolio of Januvia and Janumet (accounts for 12% of Merck’s total sales) is expected to see a slowdown in sales going forward, as it nears the end of the exclusivity period.\n\nThat said, Keytruda has established a dominant position in lung cancer, the largest oncology drugs market, and it will be difficult for other drugs, such as BMS’ Opdivo to challenge it. The company has been focused on increasing its market share for some of the other blockbuster drugs and vaccines, including Gardasil, which will aid the overall top-line growth over the coming years. Better top-line growth along with margin expansion means Merck will likely post better earnings growth over J&J over the coming years, boding well for its stock. As such, we think the difference in P/S multiple of 4x for Merck versus 5.4x for J&J will likely narrow going forward, implying better returns for MRK stock.\n\nEverything you've read is not just from some dumbass on reddit spewing nonsense.

At first glance, I assumed the stored energy in a flywheel would disipate much faster. The Wh/kg specs are crazy. \n\nI was really surprised that one of the commercially available ones he featured could sustain 8kw for 4 hours... I run super-efficient 7kw Honda inverter generators every day in my business. An 8kw load for 4 hours would probably burn around 3 gallons of gasoline. Of course, a gas generator is only converting a fraction of the gasoline's energy into electricity, but it's  still a startling comparison. I wouldn't have guessed that a flywheel would spin that long against that type of resistance.\n\nI've wondered for years about giant flywheels in cars, just daydreaming type stuff... probably from those toy cars that have some kind of heavy flywheel inside,  where you push the car forward 3 or 4 times to really get the thing spinning then let it loose. I wondered if cars could have a big, flat flywheel disc beneath the undercarriage that spanned the width of the car. With a smaller, high rpm motor, you could wind the flywheel up to tremendous speeds running the motor at peak efficiency, then drop the clutch to engage the flywheel and launch the car, similar to cranking up a catapult. Your initial start up would have a lag, as you have to get the fly wheel up to speed, but once you get it going or \"charged up\" it's ready for short burst acceleration. Cruising down the highway is easy. A flywheel is probably more efficient at harnessing kinetic energy from regenerative braking, right? Lastly, if it were tuly the width of the vehicle and spinning at high RPM, the gyroscopic effect would make it nearly impossible to flip the car I would think.\n\nI love daydreaming about stuff like this. It's cool to see so many new things coming to light. I think the big answer is going to be lots of little answers. There will be applications where something like a flywheel offers the best solution, and others where chemical or other types of mechanical batteries make more sense. I'm happy to see all of them.

{"title": "Advice for Wheeling in a Bull Market", "selftext": "Hey gang, newbie options trader here. I've gone down the rabbit hole learning about options and i've decided to dive in with the rest of you. I've saved quite a bit of money the boomer way of buy and hoping, err holding, and i'd like to put the shares and money to work. During my research, I've come upon a couple articles arguing between whether buy and hold during a bull market can out-perform wheeling. So if the market continues to remain bullish...my plan is to do this. Any candid feedback is appreciated.\n\nI'll start by selling CSPs, but near the money. The concept here is I want the juiciest premium, but I also want to be assigned shares. Theoretically, if all I do is sell CSPs and the stock only goes up (I wish), sure, every single CSP will win but what if the stock gain out performs the premium I'm earning. I would have been better off just buying the shares outright and holding. Once I am assigned, I will sell 30 - 45 DTE CC at a low delta (about 0.20)  and BTC at 50% profit if possible. I'm not worried about assignment perse, as most of the stocks I have would exercise at a profit for me anyways, but I want to hold onto the shares as much as possible to realize as much stock gain as I can.  I would basically keep this up until I finally get assigned, and repeat with a near the money CSP to regain the shares.\n\nAgain, I'm new to this and working with a few contracts just to build experience so feel free to rip my plan apart so I can learn how to approach this better.", "id": "lkwalu", "created_utc": 1613451444.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Only sell the CSPs on red market days on stocks that are also red.

{"title": "The Case for Cloudflare's Continued Growth", "selftext": "# Why Cloudflare Is Positioned for Continued Strong Growth\n\nThe largest growth opportunity I see for Cloudflare within the next year  is  with Cloudflare One and Cloudflare for Teams offerings, as it really   fits a distributed workforce better than traditional VPN offerings.  The  pandemic has highlighed this issue for many companies, and I expect  to  see a lot of companies moving to modern offerings like this instead  of  relying on firewall appliances.\n\nThe second largest growth opportunity that I see potentially in the next   five years is the increased adoption of edge computing. Many established   companies are still getting into containerization and serverless   architecture. However, I expect to see a large increase in edge   computing being used for new platforms and microservices over the next   few years. I expect to see larger growth from slower moving companies   further down the road as older platforms are refactored and   re-architected to take advantage of new technology like this that   decouples the code from managing infrastructure.\n\nThere are a lot of competitors in the space. However, few offer the same   range of products, or the same level convenience and ease of setup and   operation that Cloudflare does. This makes it an easy transition for   many companies, while also allowing them to consolidate tools and   platforms into a single company.\n\n**Some Other Highlights**\n\n* Massive growth over the last two years - Beating expectations - Revenue rose  to  $125.9 million from $83.9 million in the year-ago quarter\n* \\~66% increase in stock price since IPO\n* Companies with similar offerings range from \\~$100-$200 per share\n* Broad range of products that help companies consolidate multiple tools/platforms into a single platform\n* Most Cloudflare services, like overall traffic, is not billed on usage, which keeps costs predictable\n* Ease of use - Very easy to roll out quickly\n* Low total cost of ownership\n* Great customer service\n* Focus on innovation - Tons of new products over the last two years\n* Early to the Edge Computing space\n* Provides value to free customers and the public\n   * Free accounts with basic DDoS Protection\n   * Cloudflare for Teams was free for quite a bit of 2020 to help in the pandemic\n   * 1.1.1.1 private DNS Servers\n   * Project Fair Shot\n* %5-%10 of internet traffic goes through Cloudflare (as of 2018)\n   * \\~16% of Fortune 1,000 runs through Cloudflare\n\n# Potential Downsides\n\nCurrently, Cloudflare is not profitable, but I believe it is getting close. I expect to see them profitable within a year or two. Their most recent report was a fourth-quarter loss of $34 million, but the adjusted loss was 2 cents per share vs 6 cents per share a year ago.\n\nEdge   computing is still new. I don't see it being widely utilized in most   organizations for a few years, as it can require re-architecture. It's   easier for new platforms being written from the ground up or   micro-services being moved over to it.\n\n# A Few Prominent Companies Who Use Cloudflare\n\n* Discord - Yes, we hate them, they kicked us off, but we'd take them back. Right?\n* Hubspot\n* Zendesk\n* OneTrust\n* Panasonic\n* Shopify\n* AutoTrader\n* Ivanti\n* Udacity\n* OkCupid\n* Have I Been Pwned\n\n# Highlights of Cloudflare's Offerings\n\n**Cloudflare One** **-** Network as a Service\n\n**Cloudflare for Teams**  \\- Cloudflare Gateway and Cloudflare Access\n\n**Cloudflare Gateway** \\- Secure Web Gateway - Web Filtering and threat protection\n\nSome of the competitors in this space\n\n* Zscaler\n* Cisco Umbrella (previously OpenDNS)\n\n**Cloudflare Access** \\- Zero Trust Access - Decentralized VPN - Adding CASB type integration for SaaS applications as well (currently in beta)\n\nSome of the CASB Competitors\n\n* Zscaler\n* Bitglass\n* Microsoft Cloud App Security\n* Netskope\n\n**Cloudflare Workers** \\- Edge computing - next step in serverless architecture\n\n* Cloudflare was early to the game in this. Fastly, Akamai and others are working on their versions.\n\n**Cloudflare Bot Management** \\- This is a huge problem for companies, and is on the rise - Think eCommerce scalpers, botnets, etc.\n\nSome Competitors:\n\n* DataDome\n* Radware\n* Imperva\n* Akamai\n\n**Cloudflare DDoS Protection** \\- Defended against some of the largest DDoS attacks\n\nSome Competitors:\n\n* Akamai\n* Imperva\n* Netscout\n* F5\n* Radware\n\n**Cloudflare CDN**\n\nSome Competitors:\n\n* Akamai\n* Fastly\n* Limelight Networks\n* Microsoft Azure CDN\n* AWS Cloudfront\n* Imperva\n* Rackspace\n* Google Cloud CDN\n\n**Cloudflare WAF**\n\nSome Competitors\n\n* Imperva\n* Akamai\n* Fastly\n* Radware\n\n# Investor Info - So you can do some of your own DD\n\nInvestor info page:\n\n[https://cloudflare.net/home/default.aspx](https://cloudflare.net/home/default.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n* \\~30 shares\n* Not a financial advisor and don't play one on TV. This is not financial advice.\n\n**TLDR:**   This company has strong products and leadership. I expect Cloudflare to  hit $200+ per share within a year or two based on their growth, offerings, earnings, and comparable companies. This is a long play, so don't expect a moon rocket overnight.\n\nCloudflare is one of the few companies that I'm genuinely excited about.
