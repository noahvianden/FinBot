I say bonds have substantial risk because although they get first claim to assets over shareholders, in case of bankruptcy, Twitter is really lacking any assets.

For bonds you are consistently paid at a certain rate. and can gain a premium if you get a good interest rate that is at the time better than the market, or becomes better than the market while holding the bond. \n\nbonds are low risk, stocks are higher risk. \n\n \n\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well it depends.

With so many of these hot, startup tech companies becoming more and more predominant and going public, people are getting lost in the glimmer and hype. The market still comes down to financials. Unless a company does something extraordinary(finds cure for cancer), its stock value must be determined by the numbers on 10-k, 10-q, proxy, etc. These new tech companies financial statements are most time cringeworthy to look at.
