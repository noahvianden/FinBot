{"title": "Am I doing options right?", "selftext": "So I've been practicing with a virtual account to get a feel for options. I first started with $100k and beat that amount down into dirt, leaving myself with about $5k thanks to some stupid calls right before the market shat itself. Started over with $25,000. I didn't want to risk it all on one call or put so I split it into 2 halves of $12,500. I've been following Tesla pretty closely and after this recent crash I felt they were staring to slowly rebound. It was trading at $226 a share. I bought 57 call contracts at $218 at a strike price of $228 for $12,426. I then spent the remaining $12,500 on 56 put contracts at $220 per contract with a strike price of $224. Then I waited. The market opened and Tesla jumped up to around $232. I immediately jumped ship on the puts, selling for $0.25 a contract and sold my calls for $500 per contract. All in all, I made about $3,740 in 4 trades. I feel like just betting all your money on options trying to predict where the market is going is pretty much gambling, and yeah, I made way less money than if I had put all $25k into the calls, but that would incredibly risking considering how the market has been acting. I bumped up numbers for the initial capital. With $100k, I made around $15k. $500k made me $73k and $1 million made me $147k. This seems pretty easy since I am protecting myself for both the good and the bad, making money either way the market swings.

{"title": "The 15k challenge! Week #11", "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back after I missed last weeks post. Me and the girlfriend went to the beach for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. Anyways, in that timeframe I had my ass handed to me by Mr. Market. I was not prepared for a correction at all. Looking back at it, being 100% long and leveraged wasn't the best strategy. My account is looking pretty sad right now, but you live and you learn. I'm trying to not let the losses get to me, but they were pretty significant. AAPL especially, that's $1500 down the drain and the worst part is that for a split second during the iphone 6 announcement last month I could have cashed out for +$1000. Ughh. Well anyways, here's the breakdown as usual. \n\nNew positions:\n\n* 10 SPWR Nov. 22 $35 calls - Earnings at the end of this month. This company is the best american solar play in my opinion. Industry leading panel efficiency, and their manufacturing process is top fucking notch. They've received awards for that, only solar company to have actually. Management is on point. Highly confident in this one. I did buy in too early because I underestimated the severity of the \"dip\" but with a good beat this could fly back up to the ~40ish range. \n\n* 1 FB Nov. 22 $77.5 calls - Picked these up today to play the range back up as well as earnings. Google reported yesterday that they were losing some of their market share for ads. Wonder where its going too...\n\nClosed positions:\n\n* 2 IWM Oct. 18 $106 calls - picked these up when I saw IWM outperforming SPY earlier this week. Small caps led in to correction, so I figured they would lead out. In at 1.17 and out at 1.71. Should have held on a little longer and this would have been 100%+ but I felt like I needed to take some profit after all the red that I've been seeing. \n\n* 5 AA Nov. 22 puts - Picked these up before earnings. Technically I shouldn't have made money on these, they had an excellent report. I got \"lucky\" because the market tanked the next day. In at .75 out at .9. Once again, should have held longer, but I was happy to get out with a profit at the time because I thought that after that report the stock should go up. \n\nExpired positions:\n\n* 5 AAPL oct. 18 $100 calls - as stated above, big hit for me. I'm still confident long term in apple, but I guess I'm not the best at short term movements. I feel that it's kind of manipulated anyways. \n\n* 5 MU oct. 18 $33 calls - Still made out with an overall profit on this one, so I can't be that bummed. Was hoping to cash these 5 out higher than the first 10, but that didn't happen. Oh well, still made 25% on the overall position of $1600.\n\n* 5 AMD oct. 18 $3 calls - lotto play from yesterday in case they beat earnings and had a short squeeze. Didn't happen obviously, but whatever this was only like $50. \n\nOpen positions:\n\nStill holding on to GE calls for now, had a great earnings report today. If market continues to recover, I see GE climbing right along with it.\n\n**Open profit/loss = ($1476) Closed profit/loss = ($1903)**\n\nEdit as requested: **Account value = $4367**\n\nWow that looks atrocious! That correction hurt me really bad. I need to learn to play the short side. If anybody wants to throw me any tips/pointers or examples of whatever you did recently that worked for you feel free to. I am open to any advice, and by the looks of my results right now, I probably need some. Anyways, thanks for following along guys and I look forward to hearing from you!
