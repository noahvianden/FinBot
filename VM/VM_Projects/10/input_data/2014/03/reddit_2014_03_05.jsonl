I made 70% gain on it last week or so and it's hard to tell what will happen but I think I think it's a bubble waiting to pop. Just another pot stock pump up to me and I have profited greatly from shorting the stock CANV which seems to be acting vaguely similar. If I were you I would take my profits. Even if it goes up more you can sleep soundly knowing that you had a smart strategy and that you are sitting on an incredible profit. If you really believe in this company I think that there will be great opportunity to get in in the near future at a much lower price. Those are just my observations, take them with a grain of salt because I am a beginner", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well that trade's payin off real quick!
