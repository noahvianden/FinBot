{"title": "Twitter Advice", "selftext": "Hi! First post in this sub, let me know if I'm doing it wrong.\n\nAnyway, kind of a two part question here. I just took over managing my father's portfolio, since he's not too interested in trading himself and I've been doing fairly well with my own portfolio the past couple years. He picked up Twitter when it was up at 58 dollars (luckily when I sold it myself), and it's just been pummeling ever since. I'm not really sure if I should hold onto it, hope for a recovery, or just cut my losses. \n\nWould love to hear input, as well as a more general answer to \"when do you normally drop a particular stock and cut your losses?\"\n\nThanks!", "id": "20qhu8", "created_utc": 1395165948.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "The one piece I do know is that Twitter People are over in China trying to get it legalized there.
