{"title": "Stock Trading Education", "selftext": "Hello, my name is Leonard, and I've created this post in order to make an important proposition.\n\nI will teach people how to trade stocks profitably, for free. You will be learning the concepts of trading which involve chart analysis and risk management. In the beginning, you'll open an account with a broker of your choice and practice trading with the fake money that most brokers provide. Once you are adept at chart analysis and risk management, you will \"graduate\" from the program and start trading with your real money.\n\nWhat I hope to achieve is a potential clientele of people who are willing to pay for future educational services from me once they've graduated from the program. Keep in mind these services are in no way necessary to trade on your own. You will have all the tools necessary to trade on your own upon \"graduation\".\n\nOnce you are satisfied with what I have to teach and decide to start trading stocks with your real money, I will be offering a look-over-my-shoulder type of educational service where I give my opinion on stock setups that I'm stalking, and what I would do in certain situations. I also will not charge anything for the service unless you are profiting in your trading. Again, I offer stock trading education completely free and will only charge a small fee for my look-over-the-shoulder service if you are profitable in your trading.\n\nSo if this interests you, please continue reading.\n\nThe stock market is often considered to be a gigantic casino. There's truth to this because you can make a lot of money in a very short amount of time and because most \"stock traders\" are actually gamblers who blindly pick stocks and lose money like they're playing slots.\n\nHowever, despite all of this, I strongly believe that trading stocks (more specifically stock options) can be an extremely lucrative business, and anybody can learn how to do it. As long as you have a basic understanding of chart analysis and options trading, you can create an effective trading strategy. And as long as you have the dedication and discipline to implement that strategy, you can turn the odds in your favor just like counting cards in blackjack.\n\nMy goal is to share what I believe are the core principles involved in chart analysis and options trading, along with an applicable trading strategy that will create a low risk + high probability environment for you to make money.\n\nI've been implementing this strategy for two years now, and my account has increased by 800%. I don't think these types of returns are out of the ordinary. In fact, I think it is a conservative estimate because there are many times when I couldn't participate in a trade because I didn't have enough money to buy that particular stock (due to my account value being small). And unfortunately, if I had enough money, I could have increased my total account value 2~3 fold overnight.\n\nAlthough the returns are great, and despite my belief that anybody can become a trader, there are two main reasons that explain the small number of successful traders. The first one is that most people don't know the process involved in stock trading. They believe stock trading is out of their reach or too hard to understand, and they don't realize it's completely learnable. The second reason covers the people that do know the process involved in stock trading. These people might have a solid understanding of chart analysis, and they might even have a profitable trading strategy. However, these people do not have the dedication and discipline needed to implement their strategies without emotion.\n\nWhen you look at a chart for a stock, you aren't just looking at the price of a company's stock, you are looking at the psychology of the people who buy and sell that stock. More specifically, you are looking at two of the strongest human emotions: greed and fear. When people think the price of a stock is going up, they buy it in the hopes that they'll make money. And if the price begins to rise, their greed rises along with it as they want to make more money. On the other hand, when people think the price will fall, their greed turns into fear of losing money, and they sell their position. This battle between greed (the buyers) and fear (the sellers) determines the price -- If there are more buyers, the price goes up. If there are more sellers, the price goes down.\n\nUnfortunately, most traders are slaves to these two emotions, and they buy or sell at the worst possible time, even when they may know better. This is why it is crucial to implement a trading strategy with consistency and discipline. You shouldn't deviate from your strategy because you feel like you might make more money on this stock, or you feel like you might lose money on that stock. If the strategy is effective and profitable, it will make you money in the long run, so you need to stick with it.\n\nThe trading strategy I use is consistently profitable. I'm not saying it's the only profitable one or even the most profitable one for that matter. My point is that this strategy is profitable, and I would like to share it with willing individuals. Once you are experienced with chart analysis and options trading, you could even create your own strategy.\n\nMy ultimate objective is to teach people how to trade stocks, while also earning money to fund my own stock trading venture. While I am trading successfully, my account value is small, so it takes much longer to make big money. This is the main reason I ask for all potential students to be of high net worth. If you trade with a small account, like I do, you will miss many opportunities to make money because you simply can't afford to buy that stock or option. It ends up taking much longer to generate large gains.\n\nIf you are interested in this proposal, pm me with any questions or comments and the following details:\n\n1. First Name (or nickname)\n2. Location (city, state)\n3. Field of Occupation\n4. Amount of money you are considering to invest\n5. Skype ID\n\nYou lose nothing by accepting this proposal, but in return you gain knowledge and the high potential for an immense sum of money.\n\n\nedit: I'd like to emphasize that this whole trading education program is completely free. The future \"look over my shoulder\" educational service is completely optional.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is neither an ad for a trading service nor is it my intent to recommend certain stocks or investments. It is an educational service, where I teach people how to analyze market psychology with chart analysis. I am only sharing my opinion and each individual must be responsible for making their own informed decisions.
