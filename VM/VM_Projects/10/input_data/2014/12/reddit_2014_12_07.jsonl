Price matching and the addition of sales tax in most states has erased much of the competitive edge they used to have. They have invested in terrible products like the Fire Phone. I just don't see any catalysts and the stock price is enormous compared to its intrinsic value.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As far as retail goes, the future battleground is going to be next-day and same-day services. The biggest reason for Amazon's recent bottom-line misses is the building of more fulfillment and sorting centers. I think the only real competition they have to fear with those services is Walmart. Walmart has been realigning their infrastructure this past year so they can leverage their stores and distribution network to be able to take Amazon on in this field.\n\nI am mixed on the growth potential for Media. Kindle will certainly continue to dominate books, but margin growth? I don't know. For video, HBO was a big win, they have had critical success with recent original content, and I think that Amazon Prime is compelling versus Netflix if you have the funds for only one streaming service. And there is the rumored ad-supported video service. Music, I don't even know what they are trying to accomplish there.\n\nI think the most undervalued aspect of Amazon is Web Services. It accounted for nearly $4bn of the company's revenues in 2013 and I think it will grow to be four times that by 2019.\n\nPeople make a big deal about the Fire Phone, but really the $170m write-down in Q3 had an inconsequential effect on margins. This is $170m against $20.5bn in revenues for the quarter. There may be another $60-80m write-down in Q4, but Amazon is also forecasting $27-30bn in revenue. Despite the apparent success of some of Lab126's products over the years, hardware really is not Amazon's core business. It is a far distant third to Retail/Media and Web Services. If bets like the Fire Phone continue to miss, or if they are substantial enough to actually have an effect on margins, then I think there would be cause for concern. I think that compared to the other Kindle and Fire hardware, the Fire Phone would have provided a negligible bump to media salesâ€”even if it was a reasonable success.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}
