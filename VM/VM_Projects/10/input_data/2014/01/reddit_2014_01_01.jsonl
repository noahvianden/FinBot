{"title": "I've been talking with AmericanPegasus - here's my $3000 challenge", "selftext": "So the mods know me pretty well by now. I never really disclose my stuff other than ACTC, but I've decided to see if I can replicate AP's success.\n\nUnlike AP, I'm starting at a position of weakness. After the recent NQ gains I sold off all of my shares and then bought some puts. My gains from my original NQ stock **are not** included as that is in a separate account. They would most definitely pad the stats, but I want to own up to my mistakes. I bought these puts when the stock was around $13.50. As many of you know, the stock has continued to pump and these puts are killing me. Still, I think I have a good strategy. After NQ, this will only be a longs and calls account. Here it is:\n\n---\n**NQ** - $11 strike Jan 18 puts, 20 @$0.50/contract *$1k investment* (Complete Loser) \n\nAt the moment I believe that the stock is higher than it will be in a few days. However, I will never see some of this money ever again. The MS investment and the short squeeze has made it so this stock will probably not drop below $13 before the news. I don't plan on holding onto these contracts beyond next Monday, if that. I am looking at around a $500 loss here depending on activity. I think I'll see a little less than that leading up to the weekend.\n\n**LPSN** - $14.78 share, 62 shares, *$916.36 investment* (Less risky)\n\nI really like this company. They are less than $1B market cap right now and not as well known as some of the bigger tech companies out there. At the same time, they have some big time clients that make up a lot of their revenue - Microsoft and Verizon, to name a couple. They are growing every quarter, have a lot of upside still, and their competition is getting outmatched. I think they have a lot of expansion opportunities and I'm looking to hold onto this for a month or two, depending on where it goes. I see it going to around $17 or so while I hold it.\n\n**SZYM** $15 strike June 14 Calls, 7 @ $0.50/contract *$350 investment* (More Risky)\n\nThis is a gut bet. Oil is making a pretty huge rebound right now. I think that they are in a good position to increase their revenue by having a \"renewable\" component to their product. While it's a big load of bullshit from talking to some guys knowledgeble in the field, it lowers their tax base and makes it less susceptible to swings than its competitors. Their revenue last quarter outperformed and I think they'll do it again this quarter.\n\n**WTSL** $4 strike June 14 Calls, 35 @ $0.10/contract *$350 investment* (Very Risky)\n\nI noticed a trend in the garment industry a little bit ago. International brands such as Wet Seal, such as New York & Company (NWY), follow the exact same pattern. Analysts tend to talk a lot about receding retail markets, lower or higher profits, but they never do a cross company comparison on their analyses. If you overlay the graphs, no matter what the reasons are, they follow the exact same trend. So, while everyone is saying WTSL is trading down on poor earnings and in a position of weakness, every competitor is trading down right now also. Industry analysis  doesn't show the same trend because all of these companies are grouped into the retail/clothing industry. You have to get really specific to see this trend. This is a risky play, but I think it's one that will pay off. There are talks of privatization going on, so this will help keep the price afloat while I wait for a turnaround.\n\n----\n\nI am holding out the last amount for some calls in Tile Shop Holdings (**TTS**). I heard about this one from Motley Fool and think that they're spot on with their analysis. Haven't been able to get the price I want since it's below the Black-Scholes price point, but I'll eventually get in. I've also looked into **MDNT** but still have trouble grasping the market potential that they have. \n\nSO: here we go. We'll see what I can do to provide AP some healthy competition. I don't believe in ONCS really, so we'll see how I perform against that/him. (I also don't believe in dogecoin, but hey if it blows up one day more power to him).\n\nPROOF: http://imgur.com/ueKliC6\n\nAs with him, I'm open to opinions, flames, and ideas. I started with **$3,000** and current value is approximately **$2,700** since Monday due to NQ. I'll get back on track with these picks in no time and I'll provide updates as he does. \n\n  ", "id": "1u51p2", "created_utc": 1388549714.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "LOL, we literally just posted our topics at the same time.  \n  \nI just posted the new 2014 $10k Challenge.  \n  \nI suppose if all you have is the $2700, and that's a psychologically significant amount then you can just apply a ratio to it.  \n  \nThe principals are similar.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, I have $10k but I don't have $10k I can lose.
