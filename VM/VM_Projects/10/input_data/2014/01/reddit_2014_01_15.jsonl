{"title": "NFLX Tumbles Like A House Of Cards", "selftext": "Leading streaming movies and TV content provider Netflix Inc (NFLX) is declining sharply today. It seems the stock is falling after a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's Open Internet Order which had prevented Internet Service Providers from charging Internet content providers fees. The stock was immediately downgraded by Wedbush. Short term day traders can watch the $305.15 level for intra-day support. This is just a day trading level and not a long term support area. \n\nNicholas Santiago\nInTheMoneyStocks\n", "id": "1va94g", "created_utc": 1389804467.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Net neutrality is the big story here.\n\nI am seriously concerned about the repercussions of this ruling, this judge does not know what he just unleashed.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "I had assumed this could be corrected if a law were passed explicitly giving the FCC authority to dictate NN?
