{"title": "New TMUS trade (8/19/2014) Next expected catalyst..-Early September!", "selftext": "\nhttp://imgur.com/a/TJ6Gs\n\nfirst, lets look at the fib levels and see if theres support around here.  \nyes, there is!  However, the stock still has enough room to go about 80-90 cents lower before the bounce.\n\nthe second picture, shows us Tmus might fill that recent gap it created after it denied a bid from another wireless company.  This downtrend we have seen a million times, but I like it now bc it has established a very nice base.  the blue line indicates a rough estimate of when the stock should break the trend channel, and hopefully it will trade higher.  So ready up, see what you would like to put behind this idea, and I think this could be a big winner for us in the near term.\n\nHere is my anticipated trade on this one.\n\nWe just have to keep in mind that there is some room for downside to this   play, of roughly 80-90 cents on the stock from where its at right now, but I like to plan my trades ahead of time to mentally prepare myself for it.\n\n\nAll my option trades have looked the same and since people here and IRL always ask me what options i buy, ill just recap on some of my personal option guidelines which have brought me success even with stocks like NQ. Some of you have either seen this when we PM'd or in my posts but ill recap.\n\nTRADE CRITERIA -2-4 month option window\n\n-expect catalyst to move price of stock(earnings, rumors, news)\n-slightly out of the money option, so even without catalyst the market usually makes option go ITM in the next 30-60 days\n\n-never hold option in last 45 days of expiration\n\n-dont buy the ones with wide bid/ask spreads\n\n-oh, and never trade options on friday or thursday\n\nWHats my bet here?\n\nBest case scenario:\n\nTmobiles stock takes a week as planned to bounce off and break the downward trade channel and option goes ITM..  ill hold as it trades, my expected option return is 50-200%, hold time is expected to be a minimum of 3 week till 90 days maximum\nworst case scenario:\nTMUS stock trades flat when it reaches the first week of september.  If its still flat and biulding that base, It might be a good time to get out.. If this happens, I still have equity in the trade and may sell without loosing too much $$$, still preserving equity.  \n\nTherefore, there are a few ways to play this depending on what kind of trader you are.  \nFIrst, is the easiest and least risky, which is buying the stock at these levels.. This might actually be the best best if you are looking to buy a good chunk of stock for 20-50k and are willing to earn 5k over the next 3 months.\n\nSecond, is to buy 4-5 month calls either this tuesday, wed, or next weeks Tues or wed, no later.\n\nThird is to do a spread, but if youre at this level of trading, im not going to tell you exactly what to buy, thats up to you, but keep in mind this one is only worth holding for a 2-3 week timeframe, so use that as a basis for your trade.\n\nMe personally, IM going in between, and ill be buying Janruary 31 calls.\n\n LEts see how it plays out!", "id": "2e0itm", "created_utc": 1408478353.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "May I ask what exactly is the catalyst you are expecting to occur?

Thanks in advance.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "When traders look at a stock like this and they see it channeling like it has been recently in the last few days, they begin watching where it goes.  There is obviously support at about the $28 level, so when the trend continues down and nears 28, they begin placing large limit orders, hence creating a base like the one u see.  Algorithms create trend lines like the quick one I drew up, and once the stock breaks the trend line or nears it, the trade software alerts the trader that a new trend line has been broken and may cause them to scurry to enter new orders.  With tmus nearing the downtrend line, but bouncing off the support as time goes on, it should drastically change direction once it breaks out of the trend channel.  \n\nThe only question us where will it go? Up or down is really dependent on investor and shareholder sentiment..and in this case I feel like its positive.  The company has been taking new subscribers like crazy, recently showed first signs of a bidding war behind closed doors, and also-last Mondays earning report..they beat by 48cents but the stock has barely moved.  There are certain covenants in institutional invments charters that specify they HAVE to invest in certain stocks which meet a certain criteria (listed in SNP, market cap >50bn, etc ...just for example ...and of course a company that beats reports by a certain percentage)..what it shows us is that there is still a large amount of interest in the stock that has still not taken position in the stock, and that it will happen slowly over the next few days and weeks.
