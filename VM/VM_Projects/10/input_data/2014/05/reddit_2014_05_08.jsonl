Woke up the next morning to find Crocs trading in the 40's.  I greedily sold the puts (it was several thousand dollars).  That was sad, because I had been bearish on the prospects of the company *in general* for at least a year before that, and firmly believed that the company was headed straight to the shitter.  I think CROX ultimately fell to the $1 range.\n\nI'm not saying you should not sell your TSLA puts - I'm bullish on the co (and an investor).  \n\nIt's hard to tell with bad news.  It's almost always worse than you think it is.  I held a lot of SPY Puts heading into the financial crisis.  I sold most of them before the whole Lehman thing hit.  I just had no idea how bad it could really get. ", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Details?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Way to go.  Unfortunately.

They're doing a lot of things right, and they're continually going to be at the forefront of EV's and eventually, electric transportation in general. \n\nBut it is currently overvalued. People are speculating heavily on their future, and because of that, there's been wild swings in each direction. I've been playing those swings and it's been profitable, but once it comes down to earth, I'm going to get back in.  I'm long on TSLA, but I'm not naive. The love is for what they could do (which is revolutionary and world-changing), not what they're currently doing (which is merely amazing).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I drive one, a Model S. Great cars and I owned the stock long for a while, sold after last earning at $220, a bit too soon as it rallied up to $260 shortly after. However I've been trading it but also bearish on it for a while, it got too far ahead of itself.\n\nSolid company, solid product but very niche right now, by the time they have the less expensive models out, they could find a lot of competition. I'm bullish on it also, perhaps at around $120 if it ever sees that again, it's possible for sure as it's greatly overvalued and presents a lot more risk than people know, I would buy it here.\n", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}
