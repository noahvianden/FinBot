I added more to my position today. Also somebody bought 127k shares after hours today and sept 20th, $20 strike were flying off the shelf today. Hes the technical analysis im quoting\n\nOK- girls\nWe're going to break out of the proverbial pack here- because... well we can- we have the technology.\nThis will help give us our own analysis of the GTAT/Apple facility capability and even put yield issues into a context-\nWe've been listening a lot to different numbers and trying to assign quality-of-belief to them. So I thought we'd just put our own set together to measure against those from others.\n\nIt's boring- but here we go:\nLet's start from the top- When GT released their new ASF165 commercially early this year- they could do 165kg sapphire boules all day long ('at a much reduced cost of operation'). At that time they also said they had 'already developed a more advanced ASF technology capable of producing boules significantly greater than 165 kg. The company intends to keep this more advanced ASF system captive for some extended period of time.' This statement and some other sleuth work produced very solid evidence that Apple locked up the new system for the GTAT-Apple MESA plant. That's what produced the 200-235kg boule furnace (by the way - competitors had done this as well). Given GT themselves said significantly greater then the ASF165, we'll conservatively use the lower end of the range of 200kg boules for each ASF. This also lines up perfectly with their roadmap from 3 years ago to reach less than 1/2 cost and 8\" diameter boule with a scalable ASF (that 1/2 cost by the way correlates perfectly with the now GT quoted $12 screen price vs $25 former)\n   \n\nSo all that to somewhat be comfortable with the ASF producing 200kg boules (may in fact be up to 235kg), and 8\" diameter size. Remember most all analysts now accept this as fact as well- not much conflict here.\nIn addition. the MESA furnace count has been pretty well acknowledged to be 2000 - 3000 (plus whatever MA has 300? - we won't count those).\n\nNow the blind faith part has until now, come in the form of how many iPhone screens can be made per furnace per year. Sleepy took a crack at sapphire per ASF with 4000kg. But other analysts haven't divulged how they got the number and who knows maybe they all use the same wrong source. So we're going to make our own computation from scratch, and see where that puts us. Some try to figure the slice and boule size- we're going for more accuracy using the actual rated weight- 200kg.\n\nThe new (4.7) iPhone dimensions are approximately 6.5cm x 13cm > 85cm2 (skip the larger one for now, you'll see why later- but it fits on the 8\" (20cm) diameter boule anyway, so really doesn't make much difference and the bigger volume by far will be the 4.7)\nthe current thinnest GGlass (iPhone 5) is 600 micron (.06cm), so let's say conservatively, the sapphire is no thinner than that- so 85cm2 x.06cm = 5.1cm3 sapphire volume per screen.\n\nThe density of sapphire is 4g/cm3, so each screen at 5.1cm3 will weigh 20.4g.\n\nAn 8\" (20cm) diameter 200kg boule at 4g/cm3 yields a per boule volume of (200,000g / 4g/cm3 =) 50,000cm3, and a length of (50,000cm3 / 10cm radius squared x 3.14 =) 159cm.\nLooks about right from this picture of full boule in the smaller furnace:\n \n(The 159cm boule lengths are likely cut into 4 sections of 40cm with the Meyer Burger cutters all reports show they sent to MESA)\n\nBricking the boule (cut into straight sides for screen slicing)- eliminates 37% of the boule, but doesn't effect the number of screens per boule as the bricks are the same length (159cm) and cut to X screens per slice- (side note the 37% is useable for smaller pieces- iWatch, camera lens, home button, so not all waste when considering cost). This 37% comes from simply geometry converting 8\" (20cm) diameter to square sides delivers 14cm equal side square (note for the bigger screen you can brick a taller, narrower dimension).\nThe calculation uses total boule volume of 50,000 cm3, then total brick volume of 14cm x 14cm x 159cm = 31,200 cm3 brick volume for screens (63% of the boule 50,000 cm3). We must remove the 37% weight from our weight based calculation since that cut off weight is not used for the screen. This makes each Brick 200kg x 63% = 125kg (remember this is likely very conservative as 235kg x would be 148kg). So in summary, we have each boule-Brick measuring 14cm x 14cm weighing 125kg. From that, we now slice our .06cm thin screens. Since they measure 6.5cm x 13cm, we miraculously get 2 screens per slice. Now isn't that a coincidence (I think not)- taking 13cm x 13cm of each 14cm x 14cm brick- so 13x13x159/14x14x159 of the brick is actually screen = 86% (14% final trim waste); So our 125kg Brick uses 125 x 86%= 108kg for actual screen\nEach screen measuring 6.5cm x 13cm x .06cm in sapphire 4g/cm3 density weighs (6.5 x 13 x .06 x 4 =) 20.3g\nSummary:\nEach Brick (from Boule) consists of 125kg x 86% = 108,000g for the actual screens sliced\nEach screen will weigh 20.3g\nBy itself, this would mean (108,000/20.3 =) 5,320 screens per Boule. But we're not done because cutting the screen has it's own waste from the diamond cutter kerf (cutter diameter)\n\nFirst, can we even slice that thin without Hyperion? and if we do how thick is the diamond wire slicer, which eliminates it's own thickness as kerf loss of sapphire when cutting. For answers we look to the Meyers Burger sapphire cutter systems Apple bought in 2013 for installation throughout 2014. Although, they never mentioned the customer per usual, this comes from Meyers Burger own ER reports and they in fact do have the world's leading system for this. It's the Meyer Burger DW 288 most advanced. It is a completely automated system, that has many multi-wires per cut cycle (multiple slices per brick cut for high throughput). Let's have a look at the specifications of this Apple purchased system and cover some of the post processing issues, until now left to our imagination:\n\n \n \n \n\nWe draw particular attention to it's boule diameter size capability of 8\". That MUST be yet another complete engineering coincidence pfftt..\n\nIn addition, we note it can slice sapphire sheet all the way down to 100 microns. 6 times the thinness we require. hmmm-- pretty good; We also observe it can use multi-wire diameters all the way down to 100 microns. Let's see what that does for us. We have to cut a 600 micron thin slice; Let's give some slack and use 120 micron diameter diamond cut-wire (Meyer Berger sold the wire to Apple with the systems- some $3m worth in fact). That would produce 120/600 = 20% kerf factor (this is where I got my number- shared earlier).\n\nfrom our Summary above:\nEach Brick (from Boule) uses 108,000g for the actual screens sliced\nEach screen will weigh 20.3g\nProducing 5,320 screens minus 20% kerf loss = 4,256 screens per Boule.\n\nWe know the furnace Boule cycle time is approximately 18 days (GT cycle time for the currently available ASF). They aren't giving the time for the larger one, but should be very similar (crystal growth is not a function of size but of heat and cool cycle). But lets be conservative once again and use a 20 day cycle (remember it's completely automated, so runs 24x7). Each ASF then can make 365/20 = 18 Boules per year\n18 Boules per year x 4,256 screens = 76,600 screens per year per ASF x 2500 ASFs =\n191,520,000 screens per year for the MESA plant.\nIf they actually have 3000 ASFs = 230m screens per year.\n\nGiven iPhone6 part of a 200m record breaking year (say 70% to account for legacy and 5c production)- 140m would be sapphire.\nthat provides a 30% cushion for yield and other issues over a year's time.\n\nWe now have our own analysis that validates the numbers being thrown around as if they come from some magical place.\n\nYou can nit-pick and argue of course with little pieces of assumptions- but none of it will substantively change the biggest problem. IF you believe Apple-GTAT actually built the plant and put the furnaces in and bought the Meyer-Burger post equipment ( virtually a given for the evidence)-- Let me turn the question around? What do you think Apple-GTAT meant to do with all that? And if there are yield problems (somehow new from the years of experience) that are unsolvable, to throw all of that away? Are you really betting against that scenario?\n\nThis forum now possesses it's own independent analysis of the numbers. Make your own decisions accordingly.\n\n\np.s.\nFinally- regarding Corning 20% increase in GG;\nGiven (as Nova points out) only 47% comes from top 3 clients, one of which surely is Apple. Let's say 35% from Apple. Since Apple is ordering record 100m 2014 - 50% higher than last year alone. Given 1/3 of that is likely legacy (even in our own numbers) - how is that not consistent with 20% overall, if the other clients are adding 20% themselves? And if the other 53% is adding ? 30% ?- it all fits.\nThe question should be with Apple (fully 1/3 of GG business) adding 50% to iPhone orders, how is GG only growing 20%?
