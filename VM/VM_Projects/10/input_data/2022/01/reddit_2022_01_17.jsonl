King is the only non-U.S. president to be honored to date, and the only African-American to enjoy this honor.\n\nBorn on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, King delivered his famous speech \"I Have a Dream\" on August 28, 1963. He and several leaders of the civil rights movement pushed for the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, which outlawed segregation and racial discrimination.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzef6j5zc7c81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f1beb3e0c2e113229ba449386dc209adeb63cba\n\n**After the Fed's March rate hike, it will be difficult to communicate future policy direction to the outside world**\n\nAs the Fed's January meeting approaches, officials are less confident that inflation will fall below 3% by year-end, as expected, and have begun to say that they may need to raise rates sooner than expected.\n\nThis month, a number of officials raised the possibility of a rate hike in March and the possibility of needing to raise rates four times this year, or even five times. Just a few weeks ago, they were expecting three rate hikes in 2022; a shift that will overshadow the Jan. 25-26 meeting.\n\nIt also highlights one of the biggest challenges to providing policy guidance as the epidemic continues unabated: how can future policy actions be communicated to the outside world as economic data fluctuates up and down forcing the Fed to constantly revise its economic outlook.\n\n\"Forward guidance has previously been a tool of expediency in the face of low inflation and downward inflationary pressures,\" said Derek Tang, economist at LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington. \"If the risks are two-way or skewed to the upside, it's not clear if it's still sustainable.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qknw2281d7c81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f373989c68badf25e152c1dddfdcd5830ef24a8\n\n**Soaring U.S. Inflation Leads to Surge in Demand for Inflation-Protected Savings Bonds**\n\nThe government sold $2.78 billion in Series I savings bonds in December, after previously selling $1.07 billion of such bonds in November, according to the U.S. Treasury. the December figure was $1 billion more than the record annual high set in 2018, when rising oil prices pushed inflation to 3%.\n\nIn December 2021, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier and 7 percent from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year increase in 40 years since June 1982, according to data released last Wednesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe only positive factor was a slower year-over-year increase - 0.8% in November 2021 compared to 0.9% in October. Excluding food and energy, which have volatile prices, the consumer price index rose 5.5% year-over-year in December.\n\nIn fact, demand would have increased even more if the government had not placed a $10,000 per person per year limit on buying the bond online.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhipay42d7c81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9dfd73a3273a2683dc5cc7bdcd85a8d3bae536f\n\n**Wal-Mart is quietly preparing to enter the meta-universe**\n\nSince Facebook announced it was changing its company name to Meta to signal its ambition to move beyond social media, numerous companies have been rushing to figure out how to fit into the virtual world, says trademark attorney Josh Gerben.\n\nWalmart appears to be trying to enter the meta-universe with plans to create its own cryptocurrency and NFT.\n\nThe major retailer filed several new trademarks late last month indicating its intention to manufacture and sell virtual goods, including electronics, home decor, toys, sporting goods and personal care products. In a separate filing, the company said it will offer virtual currency as well as NFTs to users.\n\nWalmart filed the application on Dec. 30 last year, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In all, seven separate applications were filed.\n\nNike filed a series of trademark applications in early November last year previewing its plans to sell virtual branded sneakers and apparel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubs0dzs3d7c81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e2a2617a9fe268d9d25080ddb97ba6711bf6590\n\n**Tech Stocks See Worst Annual Start Since 2016 Fears of Rising Interest Rates Loom**\n\nWith doubts about runaway inflation jeopardizing the high valuations brought on by the market rally of the past few years, stocks of U.S. technology companies are off to their worst start to the year since 2016.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to invest heavily in growth stocks after several attempts at a strong comeback failed this week, and there are still no major signs that the pressure on tech companies will ease in the near term.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 is down more than 4% this year, and Friday's late-day rally erased some of the losses from earlier in the week, but did little to help. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell for the third straight week.\n\nSome high-flying growth stocks are bearing the brunt of the growing belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon begin withdrawing the massive monetary stimulus that has been in place since the outbreak of the epidemic.\n\nData this week showed that U.S. consumer prices rose last year at the biggest rate since June 1982, and U.S. retail sales fell the most in 10 months in December, suggesting that higher prices may have kept consumers on the sidelines, all of which fueled concerns about interest rate hikes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m27ys746d7c81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddd9644077fc6bd42d066c7b75302d243063e6ad\n\n**Vito Group: Oil Prices Could Rise More Due to Tight Supply**\n\nCrude oil prices, which have risen more than 10 percent this year, could rise even more because of tight supplies, the world's largest independent oil trader said.\n\n\"These prices are reasonable,\" Mike Muller, head of Asia for the Vidor Group, said Sunday. \"Strong spot premiums are very reasonable,\" he said, referring to a bullish pattern in which short-term futures are more expensive than later futures.\n\nOil rose for the fourth straight time last week, its longest streak since October, with signs that oil consumption will keep growing despite the spread of the Omnicron variant. Meanwhile, idle capacity is declining as some of the world's largest producers work to boost output.\n\nBrent crude is up 11 percent this year to more than $86 a barrel, extending last year's 50 percent gain.\n\nWhile natural gas prices have climbed enough to cause some industrial users, including Pakistan and Europe, to reduce consumption, the oil market has not yet reached that point, Mueller said.", "id": "s5yedl", "created_utc": 1642405571.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Give me more FUD.

{"title": "Learning from history: how did the U.S. stock market turn out in all rounds of the Fed's rate hike cycle?", "selftext": "Within the first dozen trading days of 2022, the 10-year U.S. bond yield climbed sharply, something that hadn't happened in more than 30 years. U.S. stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, have also pulled back to some extent. But with only two weeks to go, no one can say for sure how the market will move in the future.\n\nHowever, one thing is almost certain: the days of \"easy money\" in U.S. stocks during the epidemic are over. Benchmark interest rates are on an upward trajectory, and bond yields, which have been stable at historic lows, are destined to climb along with them.\n\nAs of Friday's close, the 10-year U.S. bond yield was at 1.788%, which means it has climbed about 30 basis points in the first ten trading days of 2022, the strongest start to the year since 1992. The two-year U.S. bond yield, which is more sensitive to Fed rate changes, also jumped 24 basis points to push the 1% mark.\n\nNow one of the biggest concerns of the market is that the Fed will raise interest rates several times this year. The past week, Fed officials have been \"hawk\", coupled with the market push, investors have gradually reached a consensus on the Fed's three rate hikes this year, and JPMorgan Chase CEO hinted that the Fed may want to raise rates seven times a year, directly to the Fed's rate hikes this year is expected to pull full.\n\nSo, how big is the impact on U.S. stocks each time the Fed steps into the interest rate hike cycle? Will a rate hike really cause U.S. stocks to plunge?\n\nAnd historically, the U.S. stock market tends to perform strongly in the middle of the so-called rate hike cycle.\n\nIn fact, since 1989, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has averaged a return of nearly 55%, the S&P 500 has returned 62.9% and the Nasdaq Composite has averaged a positive return of 102.7% during periods of Fed rate hikes. Strong returns are also generated during Fed rate cuts, with the Dow up an average of 23%, the S&P 500 up 21% and the Nasdaq up 32%.\n\nRate cuts tend to occur during periods of economic weakness, while rate hikes occur when the economy is somehow perceived as overheating, which may explain the disparity in stock market performance between the two.\n\nTo be sure, it is difficult for the market to generate excess performance returns during periods when the economy is experiencing 1970s-style inflation. Now, based on the stock trends so far in 2022, many investors expect that double-digit returns are unlikely this year.\n\nWhich U.S. stock sectors are the most \"beaten\" in anticipation of a rate hike\n\nSo far this year, the sector that has gained outsized gains is in energy, with the S&P 500's energy sector up 16.4% so far in 2022, while the financial sector is up 4.5%. The other nine sectors of the S&P 500 are flat or lower. Meanwhile, the value sector is making a more pronounced rally, with the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF returning 1.2% so far this month.\n\nWhich sectors are \"in the wind\"\n\nSo far, growth stocks are taking a hit as bond yields rise, as the rapid rise in yields reduces the value of their future cash flows. Higher interest rates are also hampering the ability of tech companies to fund stock buybacks. Biotech stocks have been hit, with the iShares Biotech ETF down 9% so far this month.\n\nAnd Casey Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) fell nearly 5% last week and was down 15.2% in the first two weeks of January. Retail holdouts that suffered a blowout during the outbreak also took a hit, with GameStop down 17% last week and down more than 21% in January, while AMC was down nearly 11% last week and down more than 24% so far this month.", "id": "s65n6f", "created_utc": 1642430825.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Casey Wood?
