Potential support level at 59, will watch for more upside if it holds up.\n* TSM: Potential resistance level at 126, could provide shorting opportunities if it fails to break over that level. Will watch for upwards movement if it can hold up over 126. Potential support level around \\~124.¬†\n* VIAC: Will be watching 36 as potential support level. Potential resistance level around 38.¬†\n* BUD: Potential resistance level at 64.¬†\n* BMRN: Potential support level at 88, will watch for upwards movement towards 90 resistance if it holds up. Could provide shorting opportunities towards 86 support if it fails to hold over 88.¬†\n* UVXY: Potential support levels at 13.25 and 13. Will look to play this if we see more overall weakness, particularly for SPY.\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* LULU: Potential resistance levels at 336 and 340. Will be watching for more weakness if it fails to get over those levels.¬†\n* TSLA: Will be watching the 1,000 level as potential support/resistance this morning.\n* TTWO: Potential support/resistance level at 150. Could retrace towards 145 if it fails, room for upside if it can get back over resistance.¬†\n* ABNB: I'll be watching for shorting opportunities if it breaks down below 160 support.¬†\n* NET: Potential support level at 100.¬†\n* AFRM: Potential resistance levels at 78 and 80.\n* MARA: Potential resistance at 28. Potential support level around 27-27.50.¬†\n* GME: Potential resistance levels at 136 and 140. Could see more choppiness if it fails to get back over those levels.¬†\n\n**Momentum Watchlist:**\n\n* RVPH: Appears to have found premarket support at \\~3.25. Will watch for more upside if it can hold up. Won't be too interested if it breaks down and cannot recover.¬†\n* DNAY: Will be watching to see if it can get back above the 10.50 level. Won't be too interested in trading it otherwise.\n* OCGN: Potential support level at 4.20, potential resistance around 4.50.¬†\n* TLRY: Potential resistance levels at 7, 7.25, and 7.50.\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks¬†are¬†looking to open lower to start the week after we saw some selling off towards the end of last week. We could be in for some more choppiness, as omicron cases saw another surge. Treasury yields also continued to rise, with the 10-year seeing its biggest weekly move since late 2019. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but it could be another day for shorting.¬†\n\nS&P Futures are down \\~60 basis points, Dow Futures¬†are down \\~30 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down a bit over 1%. Gold¬†and silver are trading slightly lower. Crude oil¬†is¬†down a bit as well, now trading back below the $80 resistance level. Banks are showing continued strength, with several banks pushing through to fresh ATH levels. This could continue given the uncertainty surrounding Fed financial policy at the moment, as an interest rate hike is likely on the horizon. Chinese stocks¬†are mixed in premarket trading after closing last week with relative strength compared to the rest of the market. Airlines and cruise stocks¬†have seen decent strength over the past couple weeks, but are still trading below previous support levels. If they reject those levels over the next few days, they could be in for more weakness. Meme stocks had some pretty intense intraday sell-offs on Friday, still worth keeping an eye on them to start the week though. The crypto market¬†is¬†seeing continued weakness after a relatively uneventful weekend. Bitcoin is¬†currently trading around 40,800. I'll be watching around the 40,000-40,500 level as potential support, but I'm expecting more choppiness. Crypto-related stocks¬†are down in premarket trading as a result.¬†\n\nRemember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter.

{"title": "Heere is a Market Recap for today Monday, Jan 10, 2022. What an insane day", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, January 10, 2022**\n\nToday was one of the wildest days I‚Äôve seen in the markets in a long time. After sinking more than 2.5% in the morning, the Nasdaq (QQQ) staged a remarkable red-to-green move as market participants piled in to buy the dip in technology stocks. This comes despite concerns about elevated inflation and anticipation that the Fed will likely raise interest rates ‚Äúrelatively soon‚Äù.\n\nSignificantly, volume in the tech-heavy Nasdaq was roughly double the average volume traded, with 90 million shares traded today, compared to an average volume of 46 million shares traded.\n\n**Markets Today (listed from lowes of the day to closing price)**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -2.0% lowes, 0.12% close \n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.70% lowes, +0.07% close\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.56% lowes, -0.42% close\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.20% lowes, -0.35% close\n* Volatility Index (VIX): +9.91% highs, +3.36 close\n* 10-year Treasury yield: 1.765%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -4.11% lowes, +3.03% close\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.66% lowes, +0.56% close\n* Zynga (ZNGA): +40.33%\n* Take-Two Interactive (TTWO): -13.18%\n* iRhythm (IRTC): +27.44%\n\nLast week, the Fed signaled that an interest rate hike could come ‚Äúrelatively soon‚Äù, sparking widespread volatility among technology and growth stocks. Moreover, the Fed‚Äôs comments resulted in a sharp rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, further pressuring high growth stocks. \n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.\n\nLooking ahead, there are two big developments to keep in mind. On Tuesday, Jerome Powell will give his confirmation hearing to Congress (he was recently re-elected as Fed chair). He is expected to lay out to lawmakers his expectations for inflation moving forward and signal on what the Fed plans to do. His hearing could potentially spark volatility, so watch out for that.\n\nIn addition to Powell‚Äôs confirmation hearing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December‚Äôs Consumer Price Index, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. \n\nAt the end of the week, big banks including JP Morgan (JPM), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Wholesale inventories rose by 1.4% in the Commerce Department's final monthly print for November, coming in above the 1.2% rise previously reported. This came following a 2.5% increase in inventories in October. \n* Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida [will leave the central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220110a.htm) two weeks earlier than planned, following increased scrutiny into financial transactions he made in 2020.\n* JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, \"It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.\"\n* Tesla Inc on Monday said it has signed its first U.S. supply deal for nickel, choosing Talon Metals Corp's Tamarack mine project in Minnesota. Tesla will buy 75,000 tonnes of nickel over six years and buy cobalt and iron ore as well.\n* Ferrari unveiled leadership changes aimed at boosting technology as the company transitions to EVs and higher-end technology. Ernesto Lasalandra was hired from STMicroelectronics (STM) to become Ferrari's chief research and development officer, while Silvia Gabrielli, who joined Ferrari in 2019 from Microsoft (MSFT), was appointed chief digital and data officer.\n* Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the electric carmaker will raise the U.S. price of its advanced driver assistant software dubbed \"Full Self Driving\" to $12,000 on Jan. 17.\n* Apple Inc supplier Foxconn will reopen its shuttered iPhone manufacturing facility in southern India on Jan. 12, government officials and a legislator in the region where the plant is located told Reuters. The plant has been closed for about a month following a worker‚Äôs strike. \n* Intel (INTC) appointed Micron‚Äôs (MU) former finance head as its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and executive vice president.\n* The New York state gaming commission finally gave the green light to allow sports betting in the state. \n\n‚Äú\"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.

{"title": "Fed minutes, how to sting the nerves of the market?", "selftext": "On Jan. 5, the U.S. stock market fell in response to the release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes. $S&P 500 (.SPX)$ $NASDAQ (.IXIC)$ $Dow Jones (.DJI)$\n\nThe core issues are two: **Rate hikes and tapering.**\n\nIf you have not understood these two concepts before (skip if you do) -\n\n**Interest rate increase**, as the name suggests, is one of the most basic monetary policies by raising the U.S. is raising the benchmark interest rate in the market, thus making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow and further forcing the market to carry out an increase in interest rates as well. Its objectives include reducing the money supply, depressing consumption, suppressing inflation, encouraging deposits, and slowing down market speculation.\n\nThe \"table\" in the **Tapering table** refers to the Federal Reserve's \"balance sheet\". Although the Federal Reserve is the \"central bank\" of the United States, it is a private institution. If we think of it as a company, then the Fed also has a \"balance sheet\". Although it should not be understood in the same way as an ordinary company like $(AAPL)$, the Fed's balance sheet still includes assets and liabilities. And the action of tapering means that the Fed will reduce the assets (and liabilities) it holds.\n\nBoth of these actions are significantly **reducing the money supply in the market and lowering liquidity.**\n\n**This time, the U.S. stock market led the global stock market to pee**\n\nIn fact, the Fed minutes don't throw out every word and every sticking point from the meeting. It is actually a very purposeful and appropriate addition to what the Fed did not express in full after the December meeting, or what the market interpreted as overly optimistic/pessimistic, **a deliberate additional message from the Fed to the market.**\n\nFor example, at the December meeting, the Fed's knowledge of the Omicron virus would obviously not be as comprehensive as it is now, and even if the Fed could speculate on possible measures by the U.S. government, it could not anticipate what other countries would do and react. The reaction of other countries, in turn, will affect another important factor - the supply chain, which is a factor that actually pushes up inflation in the United States.\n\nFor example, the Federal Reserve's description of inflation until December has been \"temporary\". Whether it is to give the Biden administration to save face or really this bunch of old-fashioned information lagging or not, this expression delivery is \"wrong and lagging\". So the Fed is eager to delete the original \"temporary\" expression, and to instill more aggressive expectations in the market, as an expression of \"correction\".\n\nWhat we can be sure of now -\n\nOne, we see the contents of this December meeting minutes, **far more hawkish than then Fed Chairman Powell after the meeting statement.** The market plunge is \"fixing expectations that were not expressed in place\". Including.\n\nThe pace of interest rate hikes will be faster than previously expected at the meeting.\n\nThe rate hike will probably follow the tapering.\n\nOf course, the rate hike will have a greater impact on technology stocks,inflation rising too fast will have a greater impact on large-cap technology stocks and growth stocks.\n\n**Second, more than the interest rate hike, the stock market is actually afraid of tapering! Taper! Taper!**\n\nFirst of all, why does the Federal Reserve want to shrink the table? How about looking at the Fed's balance sheet changes first.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgbqqmwnwta81.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=00d405c618bfda4017b09c4380603adbb1de927c\n\nObviously, this wave of \"expansion\" after 2020, directly from the previous level of $4 trillion to the current level of $8 trillion. The degree of water release can be imagined.\n\nThe Fed's table shrinkage in 2018 made the S&P 500 honestly the largest retracement of the year since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Fed has a large percentage of U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, **and once it has to shrink its balance sheet, it will inevitably have to sell Treasuries and take money back out of the market,** thus reducing the liquidity of the market. Financial institutions will also have to adjust their risk exposures and liquidity accordingly, and will also reduce the proportion of risky assets (such as stocks), so the impact on the stock market is very direct.\n\n**At the same time, the faster \"tapering\" is expected to enhance the \"signal effect\" .** At the current zero interest rate floor, the effect of \"expansion\" will be \"significantly enhanced\", while when interest rates are well above zero, the effect of expansion is not obvious.\n\nThis concept appears in St. Louis Fed President Bullard's 2019 study, \"When Quantitative Tightening is Not Tightening. It is simply understood as a form of market \"expectations management\" (forecasting). Obviously, this anticipation is more pronounced in the stock market.\n\n**Why did the Fed go to such lengths to warn the markets?**\n\nIt must be trying to shake things off - don't blame us for not warning you when the time comes!\n\nOf course, the Fed is seeing the risks.\n\n**First, its inflation target has been reached, the monetary policy is now to catch up with inflation and accelerate the \"normalization of monetary policy\".**\n\nIn fact, it also shows that the Fed is not a \"prophetic\" organization, but more in line with the changes in the market. And, in today's increasingly rapid transmission of information, the old guard may receive feedback from the market is increasingly slow. Only 2021 exceeds the expected inflation will be enough for them to mention a few pots.\n\n**Second, political pressure to influence their statements**\n\nDemocrats in power, often in the funding to open wide, Powell since it is to the Biden administration, naturally to take care of their face. Coincidentally, the current Secretary of the Treasury is the previous Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen, and Powell and Yellen used to work together for so long, many policies heart to heart, but also more convenient to pass gas. Therefore Yellen's attitude, but also expressed some of the Fed's helplessness.\n\nFor example, **the recent Yellen repeatedly shouted \"lower tariffs\", the main purpose is to alleviate the logistics problems, supply shortages and rising demand brought about by rising prices.**\n\nBecause the Fed does not have many tools at hand, and without the assistance of fiscal policy, many monetary policy will be greatly reduced.\n\n**Final tips**\n\nFirst, liquidity in the market must be lower and the liquidity tightening must be no better than in 2018!\n\nSecond, **few fund managers in the market have experienced the economic cycle in its entirety,** and many institutions have no idea what a rate hike environment looks like.\n\nAnd the current market is dominated by quantitative, everyone moves surprisingly consistent, which can also explain why the end of January 5 can deflate so quickly.\n\nSo, the situation that we are facing now is probably brand new in 10 years.", "id": "s0g1br", "created_utc": 1641806701.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "The global stock market is pee-ing?\n\nWouldn't that increase liquidity?", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "I see what you did there", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I do too sometimes :)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Goddamnit, I really forced myself through all that and was ready for a conversation only to have this be the first thing I read", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "OP still hasn't fixed it yet?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Too smart for an average wsb user.
