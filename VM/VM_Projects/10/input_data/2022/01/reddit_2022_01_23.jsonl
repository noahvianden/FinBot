{"title": "One day long straddle for earnings play", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI usually do single legs options, short iron condors and strangles, but never done straddles. For earnings play, I usually buy put or call on the day of after-bell earning and close it next day once market opens to avoid crashing IV as much as possible. So far, I had success 90% of the times.\n\nMSFT earning is coming this week on 1/25 and I am not sure which direction will go this time. I am thinking of buying ATM straddle on 1/25 afternoon and close it immediately next day morning.\n\nI know long straddles will require high capital, and profit could be in small percentage even with big movement. Theta will be very high but my plan is to keep it overnight only.\n\nWhat do you guy think? Anybody has tried straddles for earnings play.", "id": "saudwj", "created_utc": 1642946777.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "I have traded earnings strangles for more than a decade and often play MSFT because it has the kind of profile that often pays with this kind of trade.\n\nBefore I forget to say it, an earnings strangle trade is a directionally neutral tail-event bet.\n\nLast quarter earnings date Oct 27 (Tue) MSFT you could have paid the following had you entered the trade following your strategy (except this is a strangle) - an entry at 3:24:46 PM, MSFT stock at 310.60 (B/A peg, not Last) 312.5 Call at 2.97 and 307.5 Put at 2.960, Friday expiry.\n\nHad you sold at open, say 9:31:08, you would have experienced a modest profit, absolute log rate of return of 2.5%. Call was worth 5.85, Put was worth 0.23.\n\nHad you sold about an hour later at 10:47:22 the gain would have been considerable, log rate of return at 70.75% (discrete rate of return more than 100%) because the stock continued to rise, Call at 11.90 and Put at 0.11.\n\nDoes this imply that one should not sell at open after earnings but instead wait a few hours? Not necessarily. I have documented and studied the \"Trade at Open vs. Wait to Trade\" issue with over 120 trade-tested samples (data based upon actual trades only) and the issue comes down to 50/50. For this reason, given that I buy multiple contracts, I usually, but not always, trade out half at open and half later in the day.\n\nA similar trade for the MSFT 27Jul21 report yielded a tiny gain of log 1.90%.\n\nThe 27Apr21 report broke even exactly except for fees (tiny relative to trades).\n\nThe 26Jan21 report yielded a large loss, log return -43.98%\n\nThe 27Oct20 trade yielded another large loss, log return -37.63% market open, -7.42% at 10:30:27.\n\nPrior to those trades I was using a different tracking model, so I can't offer meaningful comparisons. But long-run analysis that I do shows that MSFT is only a marginal candidate for earnings trades. Since 2018 there has not been a single earnings report that has offered a massive pop up or down (like the NFLX trade earlier this week that offered up epic profits - and NFLX has done that before) like NFLX, AAPL, FB, and GOOG. It is those huge tail events that make this kind of strategy pay. \n\nYou might want to experiment with paired single contracts (i.e. 100 shares each side) to get a feel for this, and, as I have said in posting multiple times in this sub, there is no better way to learn the subtleties of options and their greeks (because they, and IV versus HV are all in play big-time), not to mention your own trading practices (great way to test your emotional control), than trading strangles.\n\nWhy strangle rather than straddle? Because straddle has an implied directional bias. One option is ITM, the other is OTM, and the ITM has a higher delta. \n\nDon't be swayed by the old specious \"IV crush\" argument. I have addressed that multiple times on this sub. This is a tail-event bet and your are betting that one of the legs moves close to one-delta. What is happening to options that are close to the money but miles away from your winning strike is of no relevance (obviously if your stock doesn't budge you suffer from IV collapse and, more important, time decay if you have an option that expires on Friday, always the case with me).\n\nI recommend this as an experiment. DO NOT YOLO or do something stupid like that. This is a tough game where a majority of trades lose (about 60% in my case) but where you can also get a blowout trade like NFLX (but that will be one trade in 12, if that).\n\nI recommend against trading TSLA or any of the meme stocks (I don't trade them), they don't perform as well as the tech standards. TSLA did have blowout report - when, like AAPL, they announced a split.\n\nI should add that I machine-trade with algos - I give discrete permission, thumbs up or thumbs down, but all transactions are thereafter, including limit order decision criteria, placement, and modification, are made by a Linux workstation running Python/Numpy using the IBKR ib_insync API. That means that I get better transactions results than you are likely to get in a wildly volatile, choppy, fast-moving market.\n\nYou might consider looking at my post history. I have made many large posts on this general topic, including more strategy details.\n\nBest of luck. Remember that these kinds of trades can humiliate you if you get emotional - they are complicated and hard to pull off, which is why you might want to learn more about yourself by trying one or two.\n\n[Edit: multiple corrections]", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you very much for this amazing response.
