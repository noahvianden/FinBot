It was a superior platform from the ground-up, but the market chose PC's and laughed Steve Jobs off the stage.  Go back to when the iPhone was originally released...no one took it seriously and deemed it \"too expensive\".  We were branded as \"fanboys\" and told to go play Oregon Trail because that's all Macs were good for back in 5th grade.  \n\nThe reality is that we were the adults in the room who realized a good product and company management when we saw it and the innate bias that the financial analysts (typically non-creative, business-types) had over this company.  In their minds, Apple is a beat away from doom and gloom.  You will see this at the next \"misstep\" and how hard and fast AAPL gets unloaded.  When iPhone growth \"peaked\" a few years ago, you could just tell it was the moment they were all waiting for.  The inflection point of Apple's demise.\n\nAs I've said in other posts, look at the P/E history for this company for the past decade and you'll see throughout its growth to being the most valuable company by far, it rarely ventured above 20.  It was treated as a value stock and the market completely misunderstood Jobs and his vision, and it's carried forward through the phenomenal Cook years.\n\nI also blame the accounting rule somewhat too.  The handset revenue has to be recognized over two years, which mutes the EPS that everyone relies on but rakes in the cash flow, which is why Apple amasses so much cash relative to the stock's P/E.  It's a cash cow.\n\nTo us, yes, the stock should be at $4T or more...pick a number.  But the market makers aren't going to let us get there easily.  Tesla, on the other hand, gets a P/E of 370 after becoming profitable for a few quarters.

If the short moves against you and you start losing money on the short, like say it would cost $4 to buy back for a $1 loss, look at the up and out call you could roll to and if it's at least $2.50 in credit, roll. That way you net a credit of half of the old position, because $3 - $4 + $2.50 = $1.50 credit.\n\nIt's best not to think of the long call as somehow bailing you out of losses of the short.

I think the market will continue its strength, but any negative catalysts could cause some volatility. Fed monetary policy and COVID figure to be the two biggest potential catalysts, and they'll continue to be hot topics of discussion throughout 2022.  \n\nRemember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter.

{"title": "YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO TAKE TESLA’S ‘IMPRESSIVE DELIVERIES’ FOR FACE VALUE", "selftext": " \n\n* Tesla' ‘Blockbuster Q4 deliveries' doesn't quite tell the whole story\n* Due to safety issues, nearly half a million models were recalled\n* Tesla is up 10% and approaches 2021 high's as investors latch on to Q4 positivity\n\nOverall, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) had another stellar year. Sure, there were a few bumps in the road – Musk’s twitter-sparked stock sell-off led to sizeable retracement; but nothing that the EV market cap giant couldn’t recover from. Tesla has been around for a while now, but more importantly, so has the hype. \n\nTesla has earned somewhat of a reputation as the ‘golden child' of the EV family; trustworthy, consistent, and well-known, Tesla has made its way to the top through a perfect blend of top-end engineering, the formidable personality of its CEO, and a general aura of excitement…\n\nIn light of recent news, disguised by Tesla’s winning vendetta against the global chip shortage, concerns are arising regarding safety issues in its Model 3 and Model S models. Strangely, investors still appear to be latching on to Tesla’s stand-alone stance when it comes to the chip shortage that has hit EV manufacturers but hasn’t affected the dramatic growth of Tesla sales. \n\nThe crux of it is, Tesla is currently recalling nearly half a million of its vehicles to address these safety issues that apparently, in the words of the U.S road safety regulator, ‘increase the risk of crashing’. Unfortunately for the high-end company, this wasn’t a one-off misdemeanor – the cars affected ranged across model years 2014 to 2021. So looking at the shiny, lucrative exterior of Tesla – it’s easy enough to be enticed, and to be frank, investors would have relished the 50% rise in Tesla stock price from 2020; but a bit of polish won’t always cover the cracks. \n\nOut of the 936,000 vehicles delivered in 2021, Tesla has had to recall 475,000 – nearly equating to the total amount of deliveries in 2020. This should really raise a few red flags for investors, but yet Tesla stock is currently showing a daily gain of around 9% – are Tesla investors blinded by unconditional trust in Musk? Or are these callbacks nothing more than a minor pothole in the long road to market share domination? Or perhaps it is the company's chip-shortage navigation that puts the company one step ahead. \n\nRamping up China production has been huge for the company; [cashing in on government-issued EV subsidies.](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/buyers-flock-to-nio-xpeng-more-to-avoid-2022-subsidy-cuts/) Should safety issues continue to be reoccurring features of Tesla vehicles, we might find inventors opting for other, reliable companies that still offer a low-price entry. However, [Tesla is still very much a force to be reckoned with;](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/hype-aside-these-are-the-3-ev-stocks-you-need-in-your-2022-portfolio/) and buyers will most likely continue to drown out periods of short-lived volatility.

{"title": "Curious about this strategy....haven't really given it LOTS of thought but it seems intriguing...your thoughts?", "selftext": "In broad strokes the idea behind this strategy is to sell a weekly CSP near the money with about 14 dte while also buying a long dated (\\~ 100 dte) put on the same underlying at a slightly lower strike price and then either rolling the short put if needed or just rinse & repeat on the short put week to week as conditions dictate while leaving the long put in place until theta begins to accelerate at which time you just roll it out on the calendar.  This approach limits both the capital requirements for the short put as well as the maximum loss if the underlying moves against you in a big way. \n\nFor example with MSFT trading around 328 yesterday the 1/14 327.5 put ask was 4.60 and the 4/14 325 p ask was 16.40.  The delta and theta on the 1/14 put were 0.4656 and -0.2487 while the corollary values for the 4/14 325p were 0.4435 and -0.0892 respectively.  If I understand this correctly then in theory the cost to put this trade on would be a net of -$1180 ( +460-1640) with a securitization requirement of $250 ((327.50 - 325)x 100) per contract.  It's clear in this example that this approach would not be profitable unless one could repeatedly sell short puts week to week - for example assuming the $4.60 premium was constant it would take 4 trades (weeks) to break even on the long put. However for the next 2-ish months (\\~ 8 weeks) you wouldn't necessarily have the long put expense so if you could rinse/repeat 8 times that brings you $3680 in premium  with the just the notional security requirement of $250. The clock, so to speak, then would reset when you roll the long put out on the calendar.   All this said MSFT likely is not really well suited to this approach given it's low IV and the 'break even' would likely happen faster with a higher IV underlying.  As I see it one of the biggest advantages to this approach (if I have the math right) is that it would allow one to trade options on more expensive stocks with less capital. \n\nI don't know if the weird kind of calendar spread really makes a lot of sense and was just wondering what the brain trust here might have to say about this strategy.

But what you have is a calendar and the biggest risk with a calendar is price movement. You don't want your 16 dollar option to turn to zero (or even 5) as fast as the 4 dollar option turns to 0.\n\nSome alternatives do exist. Many people trade poor man's covered call (PMCC) but that moves the long away - so instead of 325, your long could be 300, 250 or even 200. A PMCC can also be simulated as a put diagonal (which is what I use). There are different risks with these but the structures ensure that the theta on the long can be lower (extrinsic of 3-6 instead of 16) and that helps you defend the trade better against big moves.\n\nSee the example. I don't mean to say you trade it as is since it has a huge downside risk but compare the extrinsic. With this setup the time value i am losing is much smaller and I can rinse and repeat this 50 times but I do have a much much bigger price movement risk (or margin requirements).https://i.imgur.com/Y5q8EJL.jpg", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "For your April setup I like this https://i.imgur.com/hr8ciKe.jpg\n\nAs I said PMCC is better in terms of risk and trade management, and classic PMCC wants long delta to be 70-90 range.

If this happens a few times, you will actually end up negative theta on the long leg the longer the short leg stays near 1 or 0 delta. \n\nOverall, this is effectively a calendar in terms of function, and while it can be very profitable if you can manage the position, you can end up losing if the stock chooses to dump/run up and stay there.\n\nI personally have some calendar spreads right now, and trading them is really all about timing and manage of the weekly rolls to capture as much premium on the short as possible. I actually got a 325C MSFT 2/18 calendar and it is current doing ok, but had some pretty annoying times last week.\n\n>As I see it one of the biggest advantages to this approach (if I have the math right) is that it would allow one to trade options on more expensive stocks with less capital.\n\nThis is correct. The main downside is getting pegged to one side or the other on the price and not being able to recover your long premium before expiration, which means you end up losing the net debit.

The advantage is it ties up significantly less capital than a CSP.\n\nI prefer a long **call** diagonal calendar spreads instead because the value of the long call increases as the underlying increases.

But the number of tests reported by states is still below the 2021 peak.\n\nMeanwhile, the PCR test positivity rate was 17 percent, the highest since April 2020.\n\nThe data suggest that many cases of omicron are not being detected as it rages, possibly because people are doing their own rapid testing at home or not doing any testing at all.\n\n3.

They are seeking to restore remaining capacity at a pace that just meets the recovery in oil demand, avoiding a price spike or sending the market into a new slump. So far they have had the desired effect, with international crude prices nearing $78 a barrel.\n\nAccording to a report available, the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee is now forecasting a surplus supply of 1.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2022, about 25 percent less than it predicted a month ago.\n\nThe committee believes that the impact of the omicron variant is expected to be \"mild and short-lived\" as \"the world becomes better equipped to deal with the new crown epidemic and the challenges it presents.\n\n4.

Turkey ordered exporters to convert 25% of their income into lira\n\nTurkey's central bank said in a decree on Monday that once exporters receive payments in dollars, euros or pounds, the central bank will buy 25 percent of them.\n\n7.
