If we focus our attention on how much inflation we’ve already endured, we may miss clues about how much inflation we have yet to endure, which is the most important question.\n\nInstead of concentrating on the here and now, most reports put the year-on-year inflation rate in the headline.\n\nNot to pick on anyone, but here’s how The New York Times reported Thursday’s report on the consumer price index: “Consumer prices rose 8.2 percent in the year through September, in a report that dashes hopes that inflation in the U.S. may be slowing down.”\n\nThat’s not wrong, but it’s seriously misleading. I’ll show you a more useful way to think about the numbers.\n\nMaking sense of economic data is often a matter of finding the right context, which means the first thing you should do is ask yourself how you want to make use of the data. There are several correct ways of displaying the data, but some are better than others at answering specific questions.\n\nWhat’s inflation done over the longer run?\nFor instance, if we want to know how much inflation we’ve already endured, it might be best to look at the year-on-year increase in the CPI. (The same logic in this column applies to the Fed’s preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index.) We would compare current prices with prices a year earlier. This may be the most common way the CPI is reported in the media right now, because it puts the intensity and persistence of inflation into a perspective that readers can relate to.\n\nThis method answers the question: How far have we come?\n\nIn this case, we would find that consumer prices have risen 8.2% since September 2021. That’s very high inflation, but it’s lower than the 9% year-on-year increase recorded in June, which was a 40-year high.\n\nIf we looked just at the year-on-year increase in the CPI, we might agree with the Federal Reserve’s assessment that there hasn’t been an “appreciable decline” in bringing inflation down to the 2% target.\n\nThe year-on-year perspective is good for seeing how far we’ve come, but it’s not so good at predicting where inflation is going, because it’s essentially a backward-looking measure. It gives equal weight to inflation in September 2021 and inflation in September 2022. Yet the inflation rate from a year ago has little bearing on what the inflation rate will be going forward.\n\nThe best predictor of this month’s inflation rate is last month’s inflation. The CPI is dominated by so-called sticky prices that don’t change very often. Inflation is pretty persistent from month to month.\n\nWhat’s inflation doing lately?\nSo if we wanted to know how hot inflation has been running lately, we’d look at a shorter period of time, say, one month. The media frequently report the CPI this way, using the month-to-month percentage change rather than an annual rate.\n\nIn this case, the data would say that the CPI rose 0.4% in September after a 0.1% increase in August.\n\nBut using the monthly percentage change seems like a weird choice when we use annual rates for the year-on-year gain. It’s like talking about miles-per-hour and then switching to feet-per-second.\n\nThat’s why many analysts prefer to convert the monthly change into an annual rate so that it’s comparable to the year-on-year inflation rate. The data say that the CPI rose at an annual rate of 4.7% in September versus the 17.1% pace in June, which was a 17-year high.\n\nThe monthly data seem awfully noisy. So let’s find the underlying trend by taking a three-month average to smooth out the bumps. In this case, the data say that the CPI rose at a 2% annual rate from July through through September, down from 11% in June and 11.3% in March, which was a 41-year high.\n\nThis perspective answers the question: What’s happening with inflation yesterday, today and tomorrow?\n\nIf we look at the three-month smoothed annual rate, we might disagree with the Fed about how much progress they’ve made. Going from 11.3% in March when the Fed started raising interest rates to 2% now isn’t nothing. It looks like — dare we say it? — progress.\n\nThe Fed has actually hit its 2% target over the past three months, but of course the Fed is concerned that inflation could accelerate from here, especially in the hugely important shelter category, where hot inflation for the next year or so is baked into the cake.\n\nWhat question do we want to answer?\nAll these measures of CPI are correct; they just come from a different perspective. Which one should we pay attention to? The one that says no appreciable progress has been made, or the one that says some-but-not-enough progress has been made? If we have a bias toward which story we want to tell, the answer is obvious.\n\nBut if we want an honest account, we’ll use the perspective that answers the question we are asking and let the chips fall where they may. (What you don’t do is start with the answer you want and then work backwards.)\n\nThat’s why I think the best way to think about the inflation we’re seeing now — and which is likely to persist in the near future — is to look at the three-month smoothed, seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n\nThat perspective is a lot more honest than the other way, and it’s a lot more hopeful, as well.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Why make it so complicated instead of simply looking at month over month which came in at 0.6%. 1.006^12 = 7.4% per year.\n\nhttps://m.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-cpi-56", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Because, every month from here to June 2023, inflation yoy will drastically drop.

Core CPIs are CPIs calculated without counting the most volatile elements: food and energy. \n\nOverall CPIs, including food and energy, give a measure of what inflation has been over the past month. \n\nCore consumer price index that excludes food and energy is projected to rise 0.4% in September from the prior month and 6.5% from a year earlier, matching the rate seen in March that was the highest since 1982. But about a third of economists in a Bloomberg survey expect a print of 6.6% or more.\n\n The overall CPI, however, is expected to decelerate to a still-rapid 8.1% annual pace, restrained by a decline in gasoline prices, based on the median estimate. \n\n**In the next few hours we will know if the Fed's strategies are working.** \n\n[GO TO MY PROFILE](https://etoro.tw/2DGv45L)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ag1bhaso6jt91.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb295934f8654ae255557605783266eaed8bc198", "id": "y2szb1", "created_utc": 1665648560.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y2szb1)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y2szb1)\n    \n>TL;DR: - The Fed is watching inflation closely and will act if necessary", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I don't really understand what this table is telling me.

If the same bear market rally occurs we will be taken to around 390ish by mid Nov. this year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong-term outlook: Bearish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk5n974nkmt91.jpg?width=1602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec6db85c33dba454d3934890dce366568e3b4e76\n\nOkay let's look at that 348 level; see how in 2020 we made a HUGE double bottom from Sep. to Nov.? Well, the top of that double bottom is the exact point we bounced from. Also, we didn't turn parabolic until AFTER we broke 348. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, we are probably going to the 390 level by mid Nov. and then starting our next decline to most likely 330 because that is top of the previous bull run. I suspect we get a good rally from 330-320 when we reach it. That area is both the top of the last bull run and the bottom of the HUGE double bottom. \n\nHappy Trading you degenerate gambling addicts!", "id": "y37ugc", "created_utc": 1665690009.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|22|**First Seen In WSB**|11 months ago\n**Total Comments**|5219|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wx5c9y/update_bearish_case_imo_im_pretty_autistic_so/) [x](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) [x](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/udx02f/google_play_this_upcoming_split/) \n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y37ugc)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y37ugc)\n    \nHey /u/KoGamer01, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: After midterm elections by buying puts at around 390.

Granted, it was an odd time (somewhere around 4pm) but still, I didn't see very many people there at all.  What I did see were a bunch of filled bins for self pick-up so they must be doing some business that way.  And also about 1/6th of the store is now a Sephora; there were no customers in that huge Sephora section, though, not one. I didn't buy anything but saw some cute things in the home section.\n\nWent to Victoria's secret a few months ago and it was okay, didn't notice many people but I was there around the time you were and just going into shops while a friend got her Apple repair.  Five pairs of panties for $32 isn't so bad when Kohls is selling 3 pairs for around the same price and Kohls aren't as nice imo. I didn't buy them at either place but I would have bought VS over Kohls.\n\nBBWI where I live usually has its fair share of customers in the store which will  probably increase headed towards the holidays.  I don't think I've gone a single Christmas without receiving gifts from BBWI from family or friends. I agree with you on the move to natural products, that's what I've personally used for years and only go into BBWI when shopping with friends. I haven't shopped there for myself in years.\n\nHaven't been to Gap since shortly before COVID so I don't have firsthand knowledge on that one.\n\nHope this adds to your retail research beyond your own city.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It does thank you for your input!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You're welcome.
