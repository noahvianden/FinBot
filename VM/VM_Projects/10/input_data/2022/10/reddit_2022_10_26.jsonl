{"title": "Earning Express| Microsoft drops 6% in premarket after Q1 net profits down 14%", "selftext": "On Tuesday, Oct. 25, after the bell, [**Microsoft**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/) announced its results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023 ending Sept. 30.\n\nThe financial results show that Microsoft's eps for the first fiscal quarter was $2.35, down 13%, but still higher than market expectations of $2.29; operating income rose 11% year-on-year to $50.1 billion, higher than market expectations of $49.56 billion.\n\nDuring the reporting period, Microsoft's operating profit was $21.5 billion, up 6 percent year-over-year. The net profit was $17.6 billion, down 14 percent year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft reached the most severe net profit decline in more than two years and the lowest revenue growth since 2017.\n\nFiscal first-quarter intelligent cloud revenue of $20.33 billion was essentially unchanged from analysts' expectations of $20.31 billion. Microsoft Cloud's revenue of $25.7 billion was slightly higher than analysts' expectations of $25.66 billion, and personal computer revenue of $13.33 billion was higher than market expectations of $13.08 billion.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system fell 15 percent in the fiscal first-quarter quarter, with PC sales down this year after a spike in sales during the epidemic. revenue from the Azure cloud computing platform and other cloud services grew 35 percent, but that growth rate has slowed significantly compared with 50 percent a year ago. According to a recent report by market research firm Canalys, global shipments of desktops and laptops fell 18 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. The technology analyst firm said laptop shipments were hit particularly hard.\n\nIn addition, the strong U.S. dollar has hampered Microsoft's growth. The U.S. dollar index has risen nearly 15 percent since the beginning of the year. Nearly half of Microsoft's sales come from overseas, and the strong dollar means less revenue.\n\nIn the earnings conference call, Microsoft executives expect currency factors to cause a 5% cut in full-year sales growth, an $800 million in additional energy/power costs for the year. Microsoft sees Azure sales growth to slow by 5% in the second fiscal quarter, PC revenue expected to be $14.5-14.9 billion, and operating expenses expected to be $14.3-14.4 billion, with poor PC demand reducing full-year operating profit.\n\nAfter the release of the Q1 financial report, [**Microsoft**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/)'s share price fell 6% in premarket trading.\n\nIn terms of new business, computer games are becoming an increasingly important business for Microsoft, but the company has to face the reality that people are spending less time on games as the epidemic ends.\n\nDespite this, Microsoft bets heavily in the industry by buying Activision Blizzard for $75 billion, which expects to close by the end of June next year.\n\nAs companies grapple with high inflation, rising interest rates, and economic concerns, Microsoft said they are using more of its software and cloud services to improve efficiency and flexibility. \n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft said it would cut jobs to adapt to the changing outlook.\n\nSo far this year, [**Microsoft**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/) shares fell about 25 percent, slightly better than the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is down 28 percent.", "id": "ydvuq0", "created_utc": 1666784196.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 day ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ydvuq0)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ydvuq0)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy the dip YOLO", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just wait the market to digest the bad results and buy the dip![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy the dip", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nothing to worry ,  Steiner will buy the dip.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I am not surprised by these results.

In April, Twitter accepted Musk’s unsolicited offer to take the company private at $54.20 per share before the parties became entangled in a six-month legal tug-of-war, with Musk trying to pull out of the deal as Twitter sued him to close the acquisition.\n\nSURPRISING FACT\n\nThe banks plan to keep the $13 billion in debt for the time being after facing a likely $500 million loss on any sale, according to Wall Street Journal and Reuters, a rare step for debt financiers. That would make this the largest stalled deal ever, according to Business Insider.\n\nCRUCIAL QUOTE\n\n“They’re big boys, they can deal with it,” JPMorgan Chase Dimon told CNBC earlier this month when asked about his rivals potentially taking a massive loss with Twitter.\n\nSource: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/10/25/elon-musk-reportedly-tells-bankers-hell-buy-twitter-by-friday-deadline/?sh=87f4e364a4ca](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/10/25/elon-musk-reportedly-tells-bankers-hell-buy-twitter-by-friday-deadline/?sh=87f4e364a4ca)\n\nDo you think Elon Musk will be able to close the $44 billion Twitter acquisition deal on Friday?", "id": "ydzj7f", "created_utc": 1666794617.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|382|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|94|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ydzj7f)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ydzj7f)\n    \n>TL;DR: Elon Musk has reportedly told the banks financing his $44 billion Twitter acquisition that he plans to close the deal by Friday, a deadline set by Delaware state court judge.

Kind of priced in, but it's not a good thing nevertheless.\n\n4.) **Weak economic outlook**.

I think it would be really cool if they did have some sort of cross-platform connection where you could plug a Quest Pro into your console or even use AirLink but considering the quest 2 is the most used steam VR headset and it’s not even a PC-first headset, they would only really be buying out competition, wouldn’t really give them any sort of success or high-ground that they don’t already have.

{"title": "The Recession has already happened, and you missed it", "selftext": "I'll get right to the point and keep it simple cause I know you all got YOLOs to YOLO.\n\nTLDR: The 1st 2 quarters of negative GDP growth this year were due to the decline in federal government spending between 2021 and 2022. That decline will not continue, and therefore GDP growth will return to being positive. The Q3 GDP report will show a return to growth, and we are unlikely to get any negative GDP reports in Q4 or in 2023. First test of this is the GDP report tomorrow, if it's negative, make fun of me.\n\nGDP is this equation:  **Y** = **C** \\+ **I** \\+ **G** \\+ **(X − M)** \n\nGDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + (exports - imports). I'm focusing on government spending. During COVID Federal spending skyrocketed. This graph shows a seasonally adjusted annual rate starting in Q1 2021 because I'm focusing on the change from 2021 to 2022. Federal spending was $8.178 Trillion annualized in Q1 2021 because that was when we all got $1,400 checks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Those were the days](https://preview.redd.it/ihlj8bbbc7w91.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddea191906cb1e80a5f7b44436bc6cc397dd26c5)\n\nFederal spending in Q1 2022 was $5.891 Trillion annualized, a decline of 28%, and GDP growth was -1.6%. Between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022, the annualized rate of spending changed from $7.649 Trillion to $5.935 Trillion, a decline of 22%, and GDP growth was -0.6%. This is probably the fastest decline in federal spending since the end of WW2. Not only are no new checks being sent out, but unemployment has dropped, which reduces demand for a ton of federal programs. \n\nFederal spending is now flatlining around the $6 Trillion per year level. It is unlikely to decline further - lots of spending is automatically inflation adjusted, meaning there is significant upward pressure on spending even without any new initiatives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this \"recession\" the US still created several million net new jobs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7fu6ar4g7w91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d4fe71445e3f93f48c91d1d30d8561bb46da76f\n\nFor the overall economy to decline by 1.6% and 0.6% in Q1 and Q2 in the face of such giant government spending drops means that the other parts of that GDP equation are strongly positive.\n\nWith the \"G\" component of that GDP equation no longer sharply negative, unless consumption, investment, or net exports drop significantly, GDP reports will continue being positive. The Atlanta Fed projects growth of 3.1% in Q3 ( [GDPNow - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) ) which would be considered pretty healthy. \n\nInterest rate hikes might still make stocks decline further, but the decline in GDP is going to stop, at least for the immediate future. \n\nPositions: UPRO (3X SPY) and TMF (3X long-term treasuries, yes I'm waiting for that Fed Pivot, yes I've been wrong so far, no you should not listen to me)", "id": "ye7mnq", "created_utc": 1666815048.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|43|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ye7mnq)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ye7mnq)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You wrote a well articulated post, thank you OP.\nSo, in a nut shell, assuming you are right, wouldn’t this be a sign that the FEDs must continue hiking rates until they do effectively determine  contraction of the economy, and consequently can finally start pivoting ??\nI believe this would affect the stock market adversely for the time being", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Entirely possible.

{"title": "10-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well today was one wild day that’s for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. \n\nI have had a LOT of questions about what a “level to level” play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad\n\nOkay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. \n\nThe way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren’t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn’t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. \n\nI played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. \n\nNow you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sriqbh5m68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=48078874afaf12dd694dffb79a5b62516666b1d0\n\nKey support- 381.6 -> 378.9 -> 378 -> 374.3\n\nKey resistance- 385 -> 388.6 -> 390.1\n\nI am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple…. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8vo4ipm68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f5c2338cf936f05d3078fded0dc6a483c555d14\n\nSomething else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncrnug5n68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf95fba0118ebdf0005446324132cf850c708848\n\nHere is a little excerpt to kinda help explain it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bowchjn68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2c39316cd1e6b2cdd678135245fa4cb5de0f3b7\n\nYou know those little maps that say “you are here” when you are lost at the mall?

I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. \n\nAs you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak… apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover… its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. \n\nKey support- 3840 -> 3805 -> 3770\n\nKey resistance- 3875 -> 3925\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khdd3q1o68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=294783afc532d3880c7fbea998d610a3294c2acc\n\nThat rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn’t very bullish… \n\nWith MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing… technically Tesla beat but missed revenue… its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before… But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don’t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. \n\nKey support- 149.3 -> 147.3 -> 145.5\n\nKey resistance- 150.9 -> 152.4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a\n\nWho loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today… So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. \n\nOverall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. \n\nSomething I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. \n\nKey support- 219.3 -> 214.4 -> 209.9 -> 205.6\n\nKey resistance- 225 -> 229.5 -> 234\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3t8eesp68w91.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9f254fdcf97f3a345399b90ad6a06737c32de66\n\nAs if the VIX couldn’t become anymore detached from reality… we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? \n\nWell I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers… however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That’s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nAs I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6pyzwbq68w91.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=c34d32dfbab4ca5bd9d2f3bf31a37fb338518bd6\n\nI had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dkmofsq68w91.png?width=327&format=png&auto=webp&s=3125de1eff1dfd432c241c6824ed39354e3c931d\n\nWish me luck…. Im hoping im not remind why I don’t do overnight swings and why I don’t play earnings at open tomorrow…. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4woo38r68w91.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=abaafefce87b6d1831a3e0441c9dca6802614ef1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/515srqpr68w91.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e06371a7308cf8a59d859691c3e910af22a3bfa4", "id": "yeasba", "created_utc": 1666822917.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Tomorrow…should be interesting.
