He believes the US banking system is in much better shape now than it was during the 2008 financial crisis, partly because of the new regulatory measures; and the Fed has done a very good job in terms of maintaining the financial stability.\n\nHowever, Bernanke still expressed his concern that the Fed faces a very difficult challenge to achieve a soft-landing without triggering a recession. And although he is confident about the current financial system in US, he believes there are other issues that may raise global concerns.\n\nFor example, the disruption of natural gas supplies as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict could put pressure on financial institutions.

[U.S. stocks closed in the red](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-19-2022-112856309.html), eating into the prior two days' gains.\n\nWhile the small-cap Russell 2000 index declined the most — down 1.7% — it has outperformed the major indices recently. This performance has caught the attention of Wall Street, which is laser-focused on the impacts of the strengthening U.S. dollar and surging Treasury yields.\n\nBoth of those factors likely led to Wednesday's decline in U.S. stocks. Small-cap companies — which generally have market capitalizations of less than $2 billion — tend to be less affected by currency fluctuations than larger cap companies. The stronger dollar is less likely to take a toll on these companies, as smaller caps are more likely to do business in the U.S. rather than overseas.\n\n \n\nWhile the Russell 2000 index sold off sharply from mid-August to early October with the other averages, it didn't break down through its June low, while the so-called major averages did.\n\nThe Russell bottomed on Sept. 26 — putting in its most recent low — days ahead of the Dow and two weeks ahead of the lagging Nasdaq.\n\nThis relative outperformance by small caps is catching the attention of Wall Street because, as Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, [pointed out in a tweet](https://twitter.com/LizYoungStrat/status/1582694219860168704), \"small-caps have outperformed large-caps coming out of recessions 6 out of the last 6 times (all that we have data for).\"\n\nWall Street might debate whether we're in a recession, but it's undeniable that many stocks have declined this year.
