{"title": "The insane potential of the NEW rumored Tesla App Store!", "selftext": "[Thankyou for opening your Tesla Folder! üìÅ](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/) and welcome to my deep dive!\n\nThe Apple app store, is one of the most profitable revenue streams in history, generating as much revenue and profit than companies like Johnson and Johnson and UPS .. In this article, I cover the recent breaking-news about the release of a Tesla App store, how the Apple app store works, and how by 2030 the Tesla App store could generate **$13 billion in pure profit..**\n\nNow lets talk about what the Tesla App store WILL BECOME BY 2025, because itis very **shocking**‚Ä¶\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zn8uh93ufgh81.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=65c052d7c8eda9d511e6091b5afdf294103f033f\n\n# Apples ‚Äúmoney printing‚Äù App-Store üçé\n\nCurrently the Apple app store generates around $85 billion in revenue per year. Of which about **$66.3 billion is pure profit,** that is an insanely high profit margin of *78%*!\n\nWe cannot understand how impactful a potential Tesla app store will be, without actually knowing how *the biggest* app store in the world works. So before we dive into the billion dollar profit scenario of aTesla app, lets look first at the billion dollar profit example of the Apple App store.\n\nUnvealed nearly 15 years ago now, the Apple app store has changed the way we interact with out phones permanently. With the click of a button users can now install Netflix to watch their favourite shows, install productivity applications to help with work or even purchase games to keep you entertained whilst you sit in the bus, train or even‚Ä¶. your car. (See where I‚Äôm going with this?). The Apple app store has long been a core component of Apples growth. **Doing nearly $90 billion in revenue per year** which is nearly equal to the total revenue generated by companies like UPS, Target and Johnson & Johnson. So how does this money-printing machine actually work?\n\n**‚úì**\n\nApple has different revenue splits with their developers based on the TYPE of subscription/purchase. In the 2021 during the court-case against Fortnite maker Epic Games, Apple *was* willing to say in the courtroom that Apples commission, the rate that it charges developers to host an app on its store, has declined over time.\n\n>‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs 30% commission does not apply to everyone, and 85% of the apps are free, with no commission‚Äù Cook said.\n\nOk, but what fee *actually* applies for *what* type of purchase? Let‚Äôs break it down quickly. There are 4 main comissions that apple takes:\n\n1. 30% of all one-time payments\n\nThe Apps that make the most money on the app store tend to be video-games which aren't subscription based purchases and thus because these are one-time purchases Apple colects 30% of the revenue.\n\n2. 15% of subscription based payments\n\nApple *only* takes 15% of the payment if there is a subscription involved. Apple takes 30% off the first subscription payment and then collects 15% of all payments afterwards until the subscription is cancelled (if it is cancelled).\n\n3.Purchases outside the app-store.\n\nApple takes no Revenue from apps where the purchases/subscriptions happens outside of the App store. For example, you purchase a Netflix subscription via the internet, not the app store.\n\n4. Free applications\n\nLastly we have Free apps which account for 84% of all available apps, So Apple receives no comission from supporting, hosting, and distributing these apps as no payments occur in these apps so ofcourse Apple takes no comission.\n\nGiven this information we now have a better understanding of how the Tesla app store could function with regards to revenue. So now that you‚Äôve passed the course on, ‚ÄúWTF is the Apple app store‚Äú let‚Äôs go to the next topic and confirm the legitimacy and accuracy of the **recent breaking Tesla-App store news..**\n\n# Why the Tesla App Store rumours are legitimate.. üß™\n\nThe updated news that Tesla may be launching an App store was sparked multiple times in 2020, 2021 and even earlier in January this year. However this time it is different, the the recently rumoured news that Tesla may be launching an appstore of its own gained significant traction late sunday night, when multiple respected accounts confirmed , that *they too* had heard, the rumour that a Tesla app store is coming soon. This all started after [u/Teslascope](https://www.reddit.com/u/Teslascope/) on twitter released the following statement:\n\n[https://twitter.com/teslafolder/status/1490611334630809600?s=20&t=FuW1GMMfW7ZHZZQDa3l\\_qQ](https://twitter.com/teslafolder/status/1490611334630809600?s=20&t=FuW1GMMfW7ZHZZQDa3l_qQ)\n\nIn subsequent tweets, it was mentioned by Teslascope, that;\n\n>‚ÄúThe anticipated release was this year around Q3, although should be fully baked before deliveries of Cybertruck. Been in the works for almost a year now.‚Äù\n\nThis is reinforced by a leaked patent Tesla had applied for regarding the Cybertruck, in which there appears to be some functionality similar to an App-store feature.\n\nInterestingly enough this leak appears to be backed up by the fact that there is literally a Tesla App store website page *(apps.tesla.com*\\*\\*)\\*\\* which mysteriously you cannot log into *yet*, but the page clearly shows a warning that states download to use ‚ÄòTesla Apps‚Äô.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ickmfqvfgh81.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe8d7c4825685ac222c9e30d358df9a0551edb6\n\nThese facts all seem to point towards the obvious release of a Tesla App store, but the question you are asking is when will it be released?\n\nI asked respected Tesla Investor [Sawyerr Merrit](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt) about the validity of these rumours and when we may expect a Tesla app store to be launched and he said;\n\n>‚ÄúAgain, the rumor is just that, a rumor, but I do think **Tesla launching an app store of their own makes sense** and is a natural step forward for the company. I don‚Äôt expect it this quarter or even the next. My guess is we would probably be looking at late 2022 at the earliest.‚Äù\n\nThis would align with Tesla‚Äôs 2022 ‚Äúproduct-roadmap‚Äú update in which Elon musk repeatedly mentioned that 2022 will be the year of software. In the recent Q4 earnings call he stated multiple times that\n\n>‚ÄúEverything pales in comparison to the value of a robotaxi or full self-driving,‚Äù When Level 4 Autonomy is reached, you‚Äôre going from an asset that has a utility of 12 hours per week as a passenger car ‚Äúto maybe around 50 or 60 hours a week, so a (five times) increase in the utlity of the asset‚Äù Musk said.\n\nWe know Elon is super bullish on FSD, so with Saywer‚Äôs estimate about a Tesla launch in late 2022 this would allign well with the continious improvements we‚Äôve been seeing with FSD as we approach full self driving vehicles in the near-future.\n\n>[Twitter user StatsTeslaApp ](https://www.maadotaa.com/)believes that Tesla will allow ‚Äúthird-party developers to create apps that show up alongside current apps that are provided by Tesla (eg, Spotify, Tidal, messages, etc). For example, some of the functionalities included in apps like (the) Stats app for Tesla which is currently (only available) for iOS/iPadOS can be ported to an app in (the) Tesla App Store. For instance, the battery health functionality of Stats app is a good candidate.‚Äú\n\nThe possibilities for a Tesla app store are endless. Now let‚Äôs look at‚Ä¶\n\nLet‚Äôs now look at **how** the Tesla software and apps are currently integrated, and how they actually already have some sort of subscription that could paint the picture of how a future Tesla app store may work and how *much money* that will generate‚Ä¶\n\n# How Tesla‚Äôs current software works¬†\n\nCurrently the functionality of the Tesla touch-screen display **is far from its potential.** At the moment you have the driver features, such as being able to map out your journey, see where super-chargers are located you also have limited games available and apps like Netflix and spotify available. Interestingly enough, Tesla themselves have to adapt these apps as there isn‚Äôt any public developer kit for companies to port their apps to the Tesla system. This would need to be changed in the future if an App store would be introduced, and the difficulty of creating this is potentially one of the reasons an app store hasn‚Äôt been released yet. So at the moment the Tesla apps are great and fun but not yet the ground-breaking profit machine it will become.\n\nCurrently there are nearly 3 million Tesla vehicles on the road, by the end of 2022 that number will approach 4.5 million *(Assuming 1,5million vehicles delivered).* Why is the number of Tesla‚Äôs on the road important?\n\nElon musk explained this quite succinctly on the lightning podcast in 2019, keep in mind at the time Tesla had less than a million vehicles on the road.\n\n>‚ÄúIn order for it to be worthwile for somebody *(a company)* to write *(develop)* an app, there has to be enough of an install base *(userbase)* to warrant the effort. Even if you are going to port something, it's still got to be worth the effort. As our number of vehicles grow, it starts to potentially make more sense to develop games and other applications for Tesla. **We just need** ***a lot*** **of cars.**‚Äù\n\nTesla ofcourse doesn‚Äôt need the app store, but introducing the app store would produce Apple like profits and increase Tesla‚Äôs already strong moat. You can bet that legacy automakers who are struggling to replicate Tesla‚Äôs success with EV‚Äôs will similarly struggle to introduce an app store. Remember, Tesla is a tech company. A Tesla app store becomes just another one of the 100 selling points for the Tesla brand, whilst strengthening the Tesla ecosystem.\n\nIt is important for you to know that Tesla already has alot of functionality in their display compared to competitors. You can play graphically intense games like The Witcher on a Tesla but not its competitors.\n\n>Sawyer Merrit believes that ‚ÄúI would expect them to develop and release their own apps on the app store. They are developing so many things in house. In terms of what apps Tesla could create, I think it would be a brand spectrum from games, maybe safety tracking, fun car quirks, subscription based apps, etc.‚Äù\n\n**‚úì**\n\nFunnily enough Tesla are actually already providing alot of functionality *for only $10* a month with their Premium Connectivity subscription that you can purchase. **So what** **is this subscription and what does it mean for a Tesla app store?**\n\n# Premium Connectivity - A sign of things to come?\n\nTesla already provides many features that help set-up their ability to create an app store. Late in 2020 Tesla launched Premium Vehicle connectivity. *It allows users to stream music or videos, to browse the internet or to see live traffic.* This feature is often overlooked, it is a strong source of powerful recurring revenue and is one of the many ways Tesla is increasing the potential revenue of their vehicles. Tesla has introduced this feature such that the company can offer similar services ot its customers. Tesla already has entertainment with Tesla theater and Tesla arcade which could become very similar to Apple TV+ and Apple arcade. This Premium Connectivity package provides alot of features you might envision are already \"apps\" on the Tesla system.\n\nCurrently with the Premium Connectivity you get access to the following features\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kso3e50xfgh81.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=22b65dd64b9c2b3cfa73d3f803f587e0b1cf1770\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla can either introduce similar features and sell them seperately on their app store, or they can increase the pricing of these features. Again Sawyerr Merrit is kind enough to share his thoughts, believing that Tesla will increase subscription costs;\n\n>‚ÄúPrice(s) will likely go up as the feature list and functionality increases. As more features become available, they (Tesla) could have various subscription tiers so people can choose the features they want instead of having to pay for everything or get nothing. Subscription based things will likely bring a lot of revenue in for Tesla. This is a model Apple has been adopting for years, and it has been very successful.¬†\n\nThe already existing subscriptions such as FullSelfDriving (FSD) or the previously mentioned Premium Connectivity subscriptions provide a great foundation point for Tesla to introduce more features, in the future these subscriptions may all be managed through the Tesla App store. But, OK, how would a Tesla app store look like? Function? How much money would it generate? **Let me answer those 2 important questions‚Ä¶.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k70gw2fxfgh81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8df8e9b15147a3b37aa32c23fbba94dd5888062b\n\n# How the Tesla App Store will work\n\nIn the not-to-distant future, Tesla‚Äôs will be driving themselves. When this happens, a Tesla app store will mean Tesla does less work creating application integrations themselves, has more applications to offer users, will earn significant comission on in-Tesla-app purchases and will generate a win-win-win scenario, a win for Tesla, the consumer and the app developers.\n\nThere are some problems with the current Tesla software that a Tesla App store could address and fix, namely the fact that currently the spotify version in a Tesla is missing features compared to the online version of Spotify. Tesla has to put in work to integrate these music streaming services and must manually port games like the witcher to their vehicles. By opening up their Software Developer Kit (SDK) to developers, the experience will improve greatly for users as developers will make the apps themselves. Thus, for example, Spotify can have a dedicated team for Spotfiy in Tesla, Tesla approves the app and the overall experience thus increases. With the possibility of an FSD future, we know that these developers will definitely want to create Tesla versions of their apps. Tesla could also introduce and allow paid applications such as games, productivity apps or a screen-mirroring app or even stock-trading apps your Tesla will virtually become a moving smart phone.\n\nThe interest for developers to create apps is already really large. Twitter user [StatsTeslaApp ](https://twitter.com/StatsTeslaApp)who is the developer of the famous Tesla Statistics said he was interested in developing a portable version of his Tesla Stats App, he said \"\n\n>‚ÄúMost likely, yes (I would create a Tesla version of the app). All the statistics shown in the Stats app (eg, efficiency, phantom drain, battery health, battery capacity, etc) are good candidates for the Tesla AppStore‚Äú\n\nSpecifically, the features StatsTeslaApp believes to be the most important to make the app store useful and viable are such that;\n\n>‚ÄúTesla should provide access to the current Tesla API and it would be great if Tesla can also provide access to some of the information that is currently provided only on the CAN bus (eg, battery temperature and battery voltage)‚Äù\n\nNow ofcourse, there is severely limited capability of the Tesla App store, IF, Full-Self-Driving isn‚Äôt achieved. The Average American spends about 1 hour per day driving their car. **That is about 6% of your day** assuming you sleep 8 hours. Now without FSD the Tesla app store becomes much less important, as you simply will be using it less. Currently the Tesla Apps are nearly all used when the car is idle or stopped, or for the people (children most likely) in the rear seats. If FSD is achieved the use of Tesla Software and Apps increases dramatically, and so thus would the demand for Tesla apps. A 10 hour car journey instead of being tedious, becomes a 5 hour Netflix session and 5 hours of work and zoom calls, the productivity and usage of the car changes dramatically. Currently the Tesla FSD software is priced at $12,000, Sawyerr Merrit shares his thoughts on the future pricing of FSD.\n\n>‚ÄúI think for now Tesla will stick with its $2k price increase increments at a time, so maybe $14k by late this year (2022) or early next year potentially. Eventually I could ***see FSD as a whole costing tens of thousands.*** it will be the main feature of the car. I think it will become so useful and increase safety quite a bit to where you wouldn‚Äôt want to buy a car without it‚Äù\n\nIf this ends up being the case, you can imagine the value of the Tesla App store will be significant because of that 1 hour everyday in which you no longer need to pay attention to the road and can focus on other things, like entertainment or work.\n\nSpeaking about the value of the Tesla App store, let‚Äôs jump into some projections on the true financial potential of a Tesla app store by 2**025. The math is shocking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.**\n\n# The Maths - The Value of the Tesla App Store\n\nObviously this section wil not be 100% accurate, but it will provide you with a phenomenal understanding of the implications that FSD and a Tesla App store would have for the company. For this section we will not look at the value of FSD but instead at the value of a Tesla-App store, assuming that Level 4 Autonomy has been reached. (So again, that 1 hour of driving everyday frees up time for entertainment or productivity)\n\nThe Apple-App-store generates alot of revenue, partially because the Iphone has billions of users. So we must *first* look at and project the amount of Tesla‚Äôs on the road in 2025. In 2025 Tesla will have **sold** a cumulative of 10.6 million vehicles assuming 35% YoY growth. *(Note, Tesla is likely to hit 50% YoY growth so this is slightly pessimistic).*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8g07gtdyfgh81.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c81c60eb8615b4a733c24f2509b85b9b38c44402\n\nThankyou to user u/brandude87 for the graphic!\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Apple generates, per user, a revenue of about $138 via Apple app store purchases/subscription comission in 2019. The Average purchase price (cost of the average transaction) is about $0.80 cents on the app store. Tesla can already run and offer users to play games like *The Witcher* which costs about $34 usd at the moment on PC.\n\nSo we already know that Tesla will be able to offer more intese applications so the average purchasing price, or cost of the average transaction, on The Tesla App store will be significantly higher than that of the App store. The most popular bought game on the App-store is Minecraft which costs $7 to install. That is thus 8.75 times the average App-store transaction. So for our Tesla example we are safe to assume that given the average price of a paid application (like Minecraft), that it will be proportionate to be about 8.75 times more expensive than the average Tesla app store transaction. Minecraft on the PC costs about $27, so **about 4 times as expensive** as on the iPhone.\n\nNow, this is a HUGE assumption but, we now assume that the average amount spent per year on the Tesla-App-Store per user, will thus also be 4 times the average amount spent per user in the Apple App store, so:\n\nAverage amount spent per year on Tesla Appstore\n\n*Average amount spent in the Apple App store in 2019 by paying customers) \\** (4) = The Average Amount spent in the Tesla App store\n\nWhich is:\n\n138 \\* 4 = $552 per year\n\n*\\[Ignore this if you‚Äôre reading online.* ***If you‚Äôve received this article via email,*** *please visit the online version to view the entire article, due to the length of this in-depth article the final 1/4 can only be viewed online\\]*\n\n$552 per year doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable as we know that owning an EV saves users hundreds of dollars per year on gas, so the $552 per year doesn‚Äôt seem crazy. Especially if the purchase of a video game through the Tesla-app store carries over to your other accounts like on your computer or playstation. Ok, so we now know the average amount spent per year on Tesla apps per average paying user. Now it is important to know *that only about 5% of Apple users spend money on the app store*. Now because I believe the Tesla app store will simply have so much more functionality, more games, better games, more features for work, relaxation and productivity. I can almost guarantee that more Tesla users will spend money on the Tesla app store compared to to the Apple app store. We can look at the current $10 monthly Premium connectivity subscription as an example for what the take-rate might be for users paying in the app store. Twitter user StatsTeslaApp believes that;\n\n>‚ÄúI do not have numbers based on any measurement, but I would guess is more than 80% (of Tesla owners have bought the Premium Connectivity‚Äù\n\nSimilarly we can look at the current amount of FSD users, and as Sawyerr Merrit explains the current % of Tesla users who have purchased FSD (remember it costs now $12,000!) is 7.3%.\n\n>‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt any firm data on what the take rate is for PC (Premium Connectivity). It‚Äôs certainly significantly higher than the FSD take rate though, which is estimated to be 7.3% globally (based on [@TroyTeslike](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike) estimates). As the feature list grows though, more people will subscribe.‚Äù\n\nThis is insane, Tesla FSD costs significantly more than an app store purchase, and already it is estimated that 7% of Tesla users have bought/subscribed to FSD. Thus in our assumption we will assume that 60% of all Tesla vehicles will partake in the Tesla App store.\n\nBy 2025, there will be, as previously mentioned, baout 10.6 million Tesla‚Äôs on the road. So 60% would equate to about 6.36 million Tesla vehicles.\n\nUsing this number, we now know how many users will spend money in the app store, and we previously already calculated that the Average amount spent in the App-store by users will be roughly $552 per year. So we can now calculate the amount of revenue per year that a Tesla app store would generate in 2025 and beyond.\n\n2025 App store revenue = 552\\*6,360,000\n\nThus using these numbers, **I estimate it is possible that in 2025 a Tesla App store generates‚Ä¶..**\n\n# Tesla App Store generates $3.51 billion in 2025 üìàüìàüìà\n\n**$3.51** billion per year. Of which, (using 78% profit margins) **$2.738 billion is pure profit**.\n\nThis would provide a value of 2,738,000,000 / 1,033,507,611\\* = $2.64 per share in profit, using a P/E ratio of 50 that means a Tesla App store could be worth $132 per share in 2025. *(\\* note, As of January 31st, 2022 there are a total of* ***1,033,507,611*** *shares outstanding of Tesla stock. )*\n\nProfit and Revenue projections (The final formula)\n\n0.6 \\**(Cumulative number of Tesla vehicles sold*)\\*(552) = Revenue generated per year from the Tesla App store.\n\nYou can extrapolate this estimate into the future, you can see in the diagram below that again given the 35% YoY growth and the previous assumptions. You see here the data for Tesla App store revenue and profit per year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b09rs3xzfgh81.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd5b19dd42afac03c4e350d96e6144bb632f9ed\n\nYou can see from the graph above that **the estimates are staggering**. And after having read this article you should be able to see the insane potential of the Tesla App store, and why the recent rumours are so promising! Now let me summarize for you the‚Ä¶\n\n**TLDR**\n\n‚öôTesla is currently working on their own App store.\n\nü§ëThe Apple-App store currently generates $66.3 billion in profit per year.\n\nüëîWith FSD, the Average american will have 1 hour to work/relax extra per day, time they don't have to spend driving anymore.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 14th, 2022.\n\n# **The Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate debate and Ukraine tensions could jolt markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/11/fed-rate-debate-ukraine-tensions-could-jolt-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between Russia and Ukraine and debate how quickly the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates.\n*****\n> Markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading Thursday upended many Wall Street forecasts for interest rate hikes. Investors were dealt another blow Friday after the White House warned that Russia could invade Ukraine during the Olympics. Both the U.S. and U.K. have called for their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think the Fed is keeping everyone on edge, and this is going to add to that edginess,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúSo we had a three-week earnings respite from the macro. We turned micro, and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again.‚Äù\n*****\n> The major averages slid sharply on Friday afternoon, and Treasury yields came off the highs they set after Thursday‚Äôs report that January‚Äôs consumer price index jumped by 7.5%, a 40-year high. The S&P 500 lost 1.8% for the week, falling to 4,418.\n*****\n> With about two hours left to Friday trading, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told a White House briefing that there were signs of Russian escalation at the Ukraine border. Sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the Olympics, despite speculation to the contrary.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúUp until now, I‚Äôd say it was all about monetary policy. This throws an extra unknown into the works,‚Äù said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ‚ÄúThe dollar is rallying, oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off... Even if nothing happens this weekend, people will be nervous about it in the next week.‚Äù\n*****\n> Boockvar said the Russian tensions complicate the central bank‚Äôs outlook, and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs causing problems for the Fed because this basically would inflate oil prices, food prices, wheat, fertilizers and everything else and just make the Fed‚Äôs inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Fed can‚Äôt back off. You can‚Äôt blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates.‚Äù\n*****\n> He said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact, it could slow hikes.\n*****\n> # Fed‚Äôs inflation fight\n> By Friday morning, some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the Fed to hike interest rates by a half point in March, following the January inflation report. Others, like economists at Goldman Sachs, have raised their views to a faster pace, with as many as seven quarter-point hikes for this year.\n*****\n> Fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead, particularly St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who appears on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù Monday at 8:30 a.m. Bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields Thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point) by July.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish Fed to this more hawkish Fed policy which we‚Äôre experiencing,‚Äù said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency, I think volatility is going to remain elevated, and that‚Äôs going to be more true for high valuation companies.‚Äù\n*****\n> # What to watch\n> The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday. Investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes, the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet.\n*****\n> There will also be more important inflation data, when the producer price index is reported Tuesday. That report is also expected to be very hot, after January‚Äôs CPI. Surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump, and now economists are watching consumer spending closely. That means January‚Äôs retail sales will also be important when it is reported Wednesday.\n*****\n> There is also a final rush of big earnings reports, with Cisco, Nvidia and AIG Wednesday. Walmart reports Thursday, and Deere reports Friday.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting to transition beyond earnings, I think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did,‚Äù said Palfrey. ‚ÄúI think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters, are we able to pass through prices at the same rate?‚Äù\n*****\n> # Fed debate\n> Palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank. Bullard is the only Fed official who endorsed a 50-basis-point hike, while others, like Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it.\n*****\n> Fed Governor Lael Brainard speaks Friday, as does Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Mester speaks Thursday.\n*****\n> Other Fed officials have pushed back on Bullard‚Äôs comments. But still, there is a high level of uncertainty in the market, and bond pros are wondering if the St. Louis Fed chief will walk back his comments Monday morning.\n*****\n> Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank‚Äôs tightening path.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe Fed is full steam ahead. They have to be... They‚Äôre still adding to the balance sheet. We‚Äôre still at zero on rates,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing in my mind, unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens, that makes the Fed say we‚Äôre fine, we‚Äôre going to stay at zero.‚Äù\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre admitting themselves they‚Äôre behind the curve. They let the inflation cat out of the bag. I don‚Äôt think they thought it would have the traction it has had,‚Äù she said.\n*****\n> # Rate rally and reverse\nWhen bonds sell off, yields go higher and they jumped this past week. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.06% Friday. After the Ukraine news, the 10-year yield was back down to about 1.93%.\n*****\n> The 2-year yield was at a high of 1.63% Friday, up from 1.32% the week earlier. The biggest moves were Thursday, and the yield on the 2-year note moved more than 20 basis points Thursday. But by Friday afternoon, it had fallen back to 1.51%.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AfsxRfn.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Jcj7XBM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/19XpJvq.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NI7vGiH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/V8N4ijy.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LCXL18k.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NYvOCrn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yopYS3B.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/putdEKj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CHUCpEa.jpg))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2qU6DwH.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DpZbGJw.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/T4PyWi2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/5JnZqGU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/07zjqDV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/syo3LvC.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # First Trading Day of February Monthly Options Expiration Week DJIA Down 9 of Last 17\n\n> In addition to being Valentine‚Äôs Day, next Monday is also the first trading day of February‚Äôs monthly option expiration week.

The Rams are currently a four-point favorite, and the Bengals could struggle to contain the league's best defensive line. Both teams come into this game with their respective offenses on fire, and the last few weeks of the playoffs have resulted in nail-biting finishes.\n\n> One outlandish market theory suggests that when the NFC wins the Super Bowl the market will perform better than average. Conversely, when the AFC wins, the market underperforms. Although there is no basis of truth to justify these claims, the conclusion has historically been accurate. As you can see from the table below, the S&P 500 averages a gain of 10.3% from the Super Bowl through year-end when the NFC takes home the Lombardi trophy. On the other hand, when the AFC wins the Super Bowl, the S&P 500 averages a gain of 6.2%, which is 4.1 percentage points lower. The positivity rates have slightly favored an NFC victory as well (78.6% vs 70.4%).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/021122-AFC-NFC.png))**\n\n> Neither the Rams nor the Bengals have won multiple Super Bowls. The Rams have won just once (in 2000), and this is the Bengals third time competing in the Super Bowl. Of the teams that have won multiple Super Bowls, the S&P 500 has performed best through year-end when the Steelers, 49ers, Broncos, or Bucs take home the trophy. After the Dolphins, Raiders, and Giants won Super Bowls, forward returns were negative on an average basis.\n\n> Given that the one Super Bowl the Rams won was in 2000, you would think that the last thing a bull would want to see on Sunday is a win by Matt Stafford and crew. On the other hand, in the two prior Super Bowls that the Bengals played in and lost, the S&P 500 was up over 20% for the remainder of the year both times, so it's a bit of a push. Within the Bespoke crew, the Bengals are a near but not unanimous pick, Who has heads on the coin toss?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/Multiple-SB-wins-LETS-GO-RAMS.png))**\n\n***** \n\n> # Do Stocks Want The Bengals or Rams to Win?\n\n> The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but ‚Äúdata don‚Äôt lie‚Äù: The S&P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 55 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won.\n\n> It was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.\n\n> A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl Indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC‚Äîand ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.8% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 7.1% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&P 500 has been up only 65% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**\n\n> So should the bulls be rooting for the Rams? Maybe not. Stocks have actually done just fine lately when the AFC has won. In fact, the S&P 500 Index gained 10 of the past 11 years after an AFC Super Bowl champ.\n\n> ‚ÄúInterestingly, there have been 55 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúOf course, we‚Äôd never suggest investing based on this, but history would say that lately AFC teams have been quite good for stocks, but I‚Äôm also a Bengals fan, so I‚Äôm clearly biased.‚Äù\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**\n\n> Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&P 500 has done following their victories. The author‚Äôs favorite team, The Cincinnati Bengals, isn‚Äôt on this list just yet. Hopefully that changes this time next week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**\n\n> Lastly, Tom Brady won‚Äôt be in this Super Bowl and won‚Äôt be in any more now that he has retired. He played in a record 10 Super Bowls and won a record 7 of them. Maybe something he should be known for is the Brady Indicator, as when he won the big game stocks did well and when he lost, they didn‚Äôt.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CHUCpEa.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/elLih9f.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FEBRUARY 2022!](https://i.imgur.com/11fEwZe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE NOTABLE EARNINGS BEFORE THE OPEN ON MONDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/a78UFuV.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.14.22 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzvZd4I.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 2.14.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yagoJwC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  2.15.22 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YhAT9Vp.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 2.15.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QzVyK9h.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.16.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GXrHNzQ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.16.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/OUAmGq3.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hfMmXlC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.17.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/B4QXENV.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fyju0Me.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.17.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nPlqLbr.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RQcTdyn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.18.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/XVvBCeu.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.18.22 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NVIDIA Corp. $239.49\n**NVIDIA Corp.

{"title": "When To Take Profit In O&G Producers, Again?", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs usual, I am writing this to (a) bounce around ideas and (b) have something written down to check my own self-selective biases and to evaluate my track record as an investor EOY.\n\nI was long in O&G for 2020 (bought XOM at around $32\\*), rode the Delta Wave in 2021, saw a possibility of making a few extra percentages during Omicron. So I exited O&G, shorted them, exited the shorts and then re-entered on the long side. As oil equities have risen around 10-30% YTD, I am again faced with the question: **\"what now?\"**\n\n* \\*As WTI rose, the risk curve of investing in oil equities shift leftward. To maintain my risk appetite and return, I started transitioning to more levered bets on oil (so XOM to OXY, PDS, OVV). The downside of this is that these names are more sensitive to WTI movement both ups and downs, within a range.\n\n**Valuation-wise,** O&G equities are still quite attractive compared to where WTI is. Depending on the stickers and where WTI will be in the next 6 months (as long as it stays btw $65-75/bbl), I think o&g equities have another 10-50% run from here. If bad comes to worse, it's still likely that o&g will yield between 10-30% FCF for 2022, absent a recession.\n\n**WTI price-wise**, $90/bbl WTI, if adjusted for inflation, is actually only equal to about $72 in 2010. Expenses associated with energy consumption as a percentage of GDP per capita (60k today vs. 48k in 2010) are also not outrageous. Unlike most of the oil bulls, I expect the break-even price will rise with inflation as costs of labor and new equipment rise, at least in the short term. If break-even rises to $65/bbl, that $90 WTI doesn't seem so outrageous anymore.\n\n**Supply-demand imbalance**, there is a considerable consensus among heads of commodity traders of the big banks (with a vocal minority of opposing views) that we're still in the early innings of an energy supercycle. Also, the IEA recently [published their report pushing back their previous timeline of when supply will outstrip demand](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-february-2022). FWIW, their views are the market's views.\n\n* I continue to have a middle-of-the-road view btw the two extremes presented by the mega bulls and bears of oil. Conservatively, I think it's safe to say that WTI will continue to stay rangebound btw $65-75/bbl for 2022. However, I expect US shales will become a significant player again and supply will start outstripping demand in 2H2022.\n* As such, I have and continue to position my portfolio toward O&G servicers and equipment. Historically, the servicers' profitability lagged the producers by about 18 months. At this point, I am fairly confident that this pattern will repeat this time, absent a recession.\n\n**Mass-psychology wise**, I continue to think we're in the very early innings of mass euphoria in O&G. There is little to no pumping of O&G in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) or [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/). When there is mentioning, it's usually household names like XOM or CVX. I joke that I will know that we reach peak euphoria when retail starts peddling pre-revenue O&G names. I don't invest based on the assumption that others will become irrational, but it informs my decision of when to take profit.\n\n**In conclusion**, depending on what happens between now and EOY, I plan to take profit in the O&G producers sometime in 2H2022.\n\nO&G moves fast and things can change in the blink of an eye. As usual, I reserve the option to change my thesis as events unfold (will update if I do).\n\nI receive a lot of counterarguments/pushbacks for my shorts during the Omicron Wave.
