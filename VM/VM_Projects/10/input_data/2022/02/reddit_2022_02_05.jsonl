{"title": "Are the days of \"easy\" stock picking over?", "selftext": "I was 100% in the camp of index funds/passive investing until COVID hit.  Then I went all into severely beaten up stocks like airlines, cruise ships, tech stocks, etc. in '20 and heavily invested in lithium stocks in '21 and did very well.  Went mostly to cash in November '21 except for some positions I was trying to get over the finish line to long term capital gains.  Lost 10% of my portfolio balance since November with some positions I held onto, but could have been a catastrophic drawdown if I hadn't gone to heavy cash.\n\nLooking back, I outperformed the \"market\" significantly over those past two years, but I'm thinking, instead of me being some stock picking \"guru\", it was much more due to blind luck and the Fed's balance sheet expansion leading to a bubble in speculative assets that was driving unrealistic long term returns.\n\nThe question is, where do I invest now?  I got so spoiled with my returns the past two years that going back to a 8-10% a year index fund doesn't move the needle for me.  And I'm not convinced the S&P is even gonna reach 8-10% annualized the next few years given higher interest rates and the Fed withdrawing liquidity from the markets.\n\nI did decide to put 10% of my net worth into pre IPO SpaceX shares.  I'm hoping to exceed a 25% annualized return on that investment, but that level of return is needed to justify the lack of liquidity there. Tempted to go up to 30% of my net worth into SpaceX as I think they'll be worth more than Tesla in 20 years, but that's getting too close to having too many eggs in one basket.  I hope SpaceX stays private for many years to come and just keeps going up 30-50% each year in value.  I like the idea of just getting an updated valuation mark once or twice a year instead of having to follow the daily craziness of the stock market.\n\nAre y'all having similar thoughts on giving up on individual stock investing?  I have had the thought of just having some speculative bets in the market still, but just 1-2% max per position with the vast majority of my holdings in \"boring\" index funds.  I do like following the companies' stories and invest in market disruptors, but in the near term the market is not in the mood to ascribe lofty valuations to \"story stocks\" anymore.\n\nI think, looking back, that index fund investing beats picking individual stocks in most \"normal\" time periods, but in extreme crashes ('08,'20), there's easy money to be made to where you can significantly outperform the indices with individual stocks.", "id": "sldnsc", "created_utc": 1644086459.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "You pick through the real rubble now.

{"title": "Am I the only one who thinks the market got Meta Platforms and Amazon.com wrong?", "selftext": "If we delve into the earnings reports for both companies, almost 80% of Amazon's EPS came from it's stake in Rivian as of Dec 31 (which at this point is now much lower). They would have missed earnings without Rivian, and they missed revenue estimates (during a time of 7% inflation, that's actually pretty bad). In addition, their profit margins and FCF decreased. FCF was actually negative, to the tune of $-9 billion.\n\nLets compare that to Facebook/meta. Facebook's advertising income grew 20% YoY, and their VR segment grew by 22%. They beat revenue estimates but missed EPS by 4%. However, they only missed EPS because of a $3.3 billion loss in their VR segment. Without that loss, they would have easily beat EPS by over 20% as well as beating on revenues. Their FCF and profit margins also increased YoY.\n\nIf we compare guidance between the two they both reported disappointing guidance of only 2-8% growth in Q2. However, Facebook is valued at \\~17 PE currently while Amazon has a PE of \\~59.\n\nSo two companies with equal growth rates - however FB has increasing profits and FCF while Amazon has decreasing profits and FCF.\n\nThe only thing I can think that explains this is that the market is completely discounting FB's VR investment and not expecting any profits from this segment, ever. This makes no sense because their VR segment is already making over $2.2 billion in revenues per year (with an appstore that brings in high profit margins) while their losses in VR will slowly decrease as their research & development matures.\n\nIn contrast Amazon has a good AWS business that has 40% annual growth and good margins. However this is heavily offset by a generally low-profit to unprofitable retail business. I'm a little worried about this because other companies that have a high-margin platform/software business combined with a money-losing retail/hardware business (ROKU, PTON) have also been heavily overvalued in the past and fell sharply when they posted even a slight miss in ER.", "id": "sli3ew", "created_utc": 1644098769.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "They still beat on earnings without Rivian. \n\n-\tEarnings per share (adjusted): $5.80 vs $3.57 expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "My understanding for FB was 1) people are concerned about the decrease in active users and 2) apples privacy changes costing it 10B.\n\nMeanwhile Amazon’s doubled their profit.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": ">high-margin platform/software business combined with a money-losing retail/hardware business (ROKU, PTON) have also been heavily overvalued in the past and fell sharpl\n\nAWS isn't even comparable to what the software side of these companies produce... it's miles ahead", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes. That's good news; if you trust your own analysis, you'll be seeing huge bargains here! Time to do some shopping.\n\nAmazon's retail business is only unprofitable if you exclude prime memberships, though. And who cares if they lose money in some areas, and make money in others, when the divisions support each other and the net profit is good?\n\nThe observations regarding the Rivian investment are good. I agree; it is dubious \"income\" since they didn't sell and it doesn't sound like they have any plans to.\n\nSo perhaps Amazon is over priced. FB doesn't \"have increasing profits,\" though. They *had* slightly increased profits, but lost users, and are unlikely to have increas*ing* profits going forward. FB's VR idea is, frankly, stupid. You're conflating their Oculus gaming headset with their social media VR plans. There is *no reason at all* to believe that anything about their plans creates new revenue. Gaming is where there is money, and as you point out, they're already doing that, and it is already fully priced in, including forecasts for their next generation of headset. Don't double-count this simply because they have an idea.\n\nAs a software engineer, I should point out there is no way to replace AWS. It isn't just a \"platform.\" It is a critical service. There are lots of AWS-compatible APIs. Other companies offer drop-in replacements, and you can drop in your self-hosted replacement. Amazon has shown itself, over decades, to do a really good job managing the data centers for this service, having really good uptime, and delivering what they promise. Their is very little danger of losing clients. They're so good at what they do that most other cloud companies don't try to directly compete. For example, IBM's hybrid cloud offerings put the AI in the IBM cloud, and offer integration with AWS for data storage and general purpose computing resources. Being able to inter-operate with AWS is a major selling point for their competitors. That is not going away in the foreseeable future.\n\nI don't hold either of these stocks, and if their performance was reversed, I still wouldn't buy either of them. To go up, they have to do better than professional analysts expect. There is no reason to read their books and think you can make that call on companies this big.

{"title": "Lounge Health Club", "selftext": "Alright, back on track -- movement, exercise, and training. \\[Future me here. Hard to keep it short when it's a passion. You're more likely interested in the second half. The top half is important stuff people would rather ignore.\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost, I really don't care how you choose to stay active. Just make sure you check a few boxes for an easy foundation. Then, do whatever you want on top. Second, incorporate breaks at every level. Rest/cooldown periods within your workout, days off after multiple training days, a week of low intensity after several weeks of intense work, a month of light activity after year+ of dedication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone's well aware this impacts weight management, but not how you think. So let's just clean out some bullshit first. **Cardio and training are not weight loss tools, period**. Exercise is by far the lowest factor in the calorie balance equation. Also, the human body adjusts to metabolic demand. When you intentionally increase exercise, your body will offset that demand by reducing involuntary activity to maintain homeostasis. Focus your fat loss efforts on nutrition. Hell, the daily calories burned by digestion is almost double the amount you can burn in a day from exercise. (The cardio \"fat burning zone\" doesn't exist, never did. The weight training \"anabolic window\" isn't 30 minutes, it's 3 days -- you're still digesting meals from earlier.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, use training to improve your body. A stronger, more capable body will require more calories for maintenance. That is, no single day of training is important for weight management; it's the bodily changes after accumulating several consistent months of meaningful training.\n\nGeneral health is all I'm focusing on here. A sedentary lifestyle is a leading for cause obesity, heart problems, etc. Start adding movement throughout your day, everyone. You could be jacked, lift 2hr daily, sit on your ass for rest of the day -- you're still sedentary and at risk. Getting up, moving around every 20 minutes or so is enough to mitigate sedentary risks. Start progressing in that direction as best you can.\n\nSecond, and I can't be more serious, falling. Don't let yourself become old and immobile, weak, helpless. Falls injure 25% of adults 65+ every year. Falls cause 95% of hip fractures. Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury. Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths, annual 650k globally. And this doesn't come close to fully capturing the problem. Fractures lead to surgery, which can put you in wheelchair, permanently sedentary and a shortened lifespan with a lower quality of life. Recovery take time, it's painful, and it has other risks (which are also lethal), such as pneumonia. (I'm unsure if these stats include deaths from surgery complications.)\n\nBasically this:  [5min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6GHHzIByOk) \n\nAwesome podcast episode:  [S3E4 Training In Your 80s with Sybil: The Interview Series - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAqMsWHGms) (website giving me trouble, so here's the YouTube version)\n\nUse it or lose it. Keep moving. Don't lie to yourself either. \"I *don't* do X *because* I *can't*.\" No, you *can't because* you *don't*. You stopped doing X and now lost the ability. Put on your pants while standing, get off the floor without using your hands, bend over to tie your shoe with both feet flat on the ground.

Have a purpose, train *for something*. Exercise is just doing work. Digging a hole is hard work, lots of sweat. Digging in clay and rock is even harder. Great exercise, completely meaningless. What do you want? Train for that goal. On a similar note: if you see \"fitness\" attached to name, it's almost guaranteed garbage. It's just a generic industry buzzword. \"We'll get you fit.\" Fit for what? You get to fill in the blank. They're selling what you want to hear, not anything specific.

High intensity, short period, \\~90%+ of truly maximal effort -- sprint, weight training sets. Do both, but don't land in the middle. Medium efforts are too short for endurance benefits and not intense enough for maximal benefits -- it's a half-assed version of both with piss poor results.\n\nMusculoskeletal training: direct resistance training is the only way (the above only effects tissue endurance). Looking to improve lean (muscle, bone, ligaments, etc.) tissue mass, strength, resiliency, and specifically bone mineral density. Establish your range of motion, gradually add resistance. Lunge, squat, press, pull, hinge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrain for distance running/cycling/etc. goals:  manage pacing and your usual running sessions as usual, movement throughout your day, incorporate bouts of sprinting a couple times per session, add in basic strength training a couple days per week\n\nStrength and endurance are competing goals, but strength is necessary. Each step/pedal/row (i.e. each rep) requires a minimal amount of force to propel yourself forward. That force can be measured as a % of maximal strength. A stronger body is capable of producing more force, making each rep a lower % of your maximal strength, means every rep requires less effort. Each rep also accumulates fatigue. Since a stronger body uses less effort per rep, this leads to less fatigue per rep. Voila, a stronger body can help you go faster, farther, etc.\n\nBut again, competing goals. As you ramp up your endurance efforts, pull back on your lifting/sprinting efforts. The, pull back on your endurance training, and start ramping up lifting and sprinting efforts. Repeat the cycle, include time-off from both periodically, don't ramp up both simultaneously. (Sprinting is similar enough to both lifting and endurance. Add to either training day as you see fit. But don't both with lifting and endurance on the same day.)\n\n\\[Yeah, I don't really strong recommendations for this part. Not a personal interest beyond the basics. Gonna need some help in the comments!\\]\n\nTrain for lifting goals: pick your program and follow it as written and finish it, your training *must be specific* to your goal, gradually increase load/intensity/volume, add rest as described at the top, spread out max efforts (i.e. do not go all out every time, keep edging closer and closer over time), add *small and infrequent* variations to avoid stagnation and overuse injuries, breakdown your major goal into categories and alternate focus between them every few months, and least important of all, make minor adjustments to fit your personal differences.\n\nTrain for health: move more in general, do some low effort cardio, throw in some sprinting, start some basic strength, check those boxes then do whatever you want on top of the that and focus in whatever direction you enjoy\n\nInstead here are some do *not*s and such: do not confuse an outcome/goal as a cause for improved health (e.g. \"I want to run a marathon to improve health,\" no, the directionality is backwards, you need to be in good health for a marathon, but the marathon training does not cause health improvements), competition is never healthy (stealing the last example: the marathon is a test of your physical ability, and testing your limits is a health *risk*), training for enjoyment is equally valid as other goals and possibly more important, don't limit yourself to one training style and eventually transition through all even if for a short period (Strength ↔ Hypertrophy ↔ Work Capacity ↔ Endurance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHighly recommend: [How Much Should I Train?](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/how-much-should-i-train) // I'm mostly speaking from [Scientific Principles of Strength Training](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/scientific-principles-of-strength-training) above.\n\nAlso recommend: [Muscle and Strength Pyramid](https://muscleandstrengthpyramids.com/) (Training *and Nutrition*, sorry, forgot to include during nutrition week).

I became more convinced about the seriousness of the problem with all the leveraged buyouts of the late 1980s, which made the overall debt situation get worse and worse. I have never believed that the current economic downturn was a recession; I have always viewed it as a debt liquidation, which some people call a depression. It's not simply a matter of a two-quarter recession. It's a problem where you build up years of debt, which will act as a depressant on the economy until it gets worked off over a long period of time.
