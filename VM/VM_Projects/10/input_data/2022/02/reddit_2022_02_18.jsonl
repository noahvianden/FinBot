(Fundamentals)\n\nStock market will long term fluctuate more or less around these fundamentals, depending on news and changes in sentiment. (Volatility)\n\nStocks will rise as long as more people are willing to buy any asset at a given price than sellers offer these assets, any ETF is only spreading the risk of some stocks on an index reflecting a broader market. \nThe principles of demand ( for investments) vs. supply being the main criteria for the direction of the market to go remains the same.\n\nWhile demand for stocks is driven by liquidity and alternatives for an investment in the market, supply is driven by changes in the amount of investors willing to sell.\n\nThe question of going lump sum or to dca over a longer period is the question of timing vs. averaging over an investment period.\n\nBoth have effects on your performance and risk allocation. The first gives you potentially more returns (time in the market) but a greater risk of a bad timing, the second is reducing the risk of buying at a top, while reducing the potential performance in a bull market.\n\nThe significance of the performance difference can be shown in a simple example:\n\nIf you invest a lump sum in an index at 2000 and wait any time period until it hits 4000, you made 100% profit. Investing the same amount spread over the same period of time in equal parts, you pay an average of 3000 (+\\- a bit depending on the exponential growth of your index), so your performance is 33.3% (+\\- a bit) In other words you need about 2.4 times the same time for the same performance as the index.\n\nTo improve this performance you have to invest more in times under the average growth rate and less in times over it. \n\nUnfortunately without „timing“ this is impossible.\n\nProblem is you can only assume where the market will go from any given valuation, based on outlook for changes in either demand of supply of the assets you invest in, or on relation to historical data and comparison to an average of the time frame you choose.\n\nBased on long term average, you have to assume a lower than average performance for the near future or question the long term average to be a valid indicator from here on.\n\nEven continuing to constantly invest or using a 10% correction of the index leaves you above long term average. \n\nIn other words: is the dip a dip, or is it a change from a bull market to a sideway market.\n\nHigh volatility is an indicator that the market is struggling to decide. The longer the market goes sideways, the smaller the confidence in a growing market, the better the alternatives, the smaller the demand for a risky investment.\n\nThere are bullish expectations, bearish once’s \nand many investors are looking for guidance.\n\nSome Data is suggesting that historical performance would lead to a sideway market based on a „logical“ reaction of the market IF focused on this aspect at some point.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-sp-500-returns-could-be-flat-until-2030-unless-you-reinvest-dividends-2020-09-30\n\nWhether you consider this analysis correct or not, the question of when or why did we get so far above average and will we stay there still remains.\n\nChanges in your investment strategy can change your risk/reward setting, reducing your possible profits as well as your possible losses, depending on what the market decides, rather on what you think. \n\nYou can decide how much to invest and in which asset class, but the market will decide where we go, based on CHANGES in fundamentals and sentiment.\n\nSometimes rational, sometimes more on greed/fear.\n\nShort to medium term:\n\n„The whole stock market depends only on whether there are more shares than idiots or more idiots than shares.“\n\nLong term: Fundamental matter more. \n\n(My 5-50 cents)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "As a personal rule anything that loses more than 40% is something I fucked up on and it’s a hard sell regardless of what I feel.
