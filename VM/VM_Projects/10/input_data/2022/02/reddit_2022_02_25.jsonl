He also said the company has too many people and too much complexity, and it doesn’t have the expertise to transition to battery-electric vehicles.\n\nFord, Farley said, can’t just pivot from internal combustion engines to battery-powered vehicles\n\nBut “I can’t turn to the ICE organization and say ‘go be Tesla.’ They may do it on the (auto) body.

{"title": "Can tech continue its rebound into the weekend?", "selftext": "NASDAQ100 futures are currently down 0.8% following Thursday’s wild reversal which saw US equities recover from heavy losses at the open. The technology sector led the bounce as the beginning of the Russian invasion seemed to cool bets on a 50bps hike in March. \n\nMarkets have been pricing-in an increasingly hawkish Fed this year, but with the prospect of a larger-scale conflict clouding economic outlook, the US central bank might look to begin their tightening cycle on a tamer note. Given the amount of bearish pressure tech stocks have already come under in recent weeks, any chance of a more modest approach from the Fed is likely to cause $NDX to rebound over the short-term, and potentially form some sort of a low at the current levels. \n\nHowever, it is still too early judge the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have, and with PCE data also due on Friday, speculation for an aggressive policy approach could quickly return. Speaking earlier, Fed member Waller stated that there is still a strong case for a 50bps hike in March if the economy shows signs of overheating. Therefore, $NDX, and the broader market, could possibly see losses accelerate into the weekend if tonight’s inflation print is hot enough. \n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how the market reacts to the data release, as well as the situation in Eastern Europe and how the West chooses to respond.

{"title": "The Case for $MNDT", "selftext": "I come from a cybersecurity background and do a lot of work on cybersecurity companies to understand their businesses and invest in them.\n\nI’m sharing the research I’ve done on one company in particular, $MNDT, because it’s not only a beaten up stock in value territory that is looking better technically, but it is also more relevant today due to the Russia/Ukraine situation. The stock is ripe for a rally.\n\nAs you may know, $MNDT was formerly $FEYE until they sold off the $FEYE product business and brand. This was actually the best possible move, as the product business was legacy and weighed heavily on the fundamentals of the company. Not to mention the very promotional ex-CEO of $FEYE marred the company’s reputation with investors… an uphill battle the current CEO, Kevin Mandia, has been fighting ever since. As a result, it will take some time for the new $MNDT to re-educate investors about what the company actually does and how it’s different from the old $FEYE. Even though investors will take some time to persuade, the cybersecurity world already has massive respect for Kevin Mandia and his team.\n\n$MNDT is a threat intelligence company made up of some of the most brilliant cybersecurity analysts in the world. They are relied upon heavily by the US government and high risk enterprise organizations that need extra help with forensics, incident response, and intelligence before, during, and after breaches occur.\n\nThe biggest challenge $MNDT faces is resource constraint with their analysts, so it can be difficult to scale their expertise, as there are only so many people you can hire and hours they can work. What they are doing now, is working to use AI/ML to help scale their threat intelligence offerings through Mandiant Advantage.\n\nHere’s where things get really interesting…\n\nBecause $MNDT got rid of the FEYE product business, which included endpoint security, SIEM, network security products, etc. they have actually GREATLY expanded their TAM.\n\nBecause they no longer compete with product companies that sell products in those categories, they can pursue *partnerships* with those product companies instead, and offer to be the threat intelligence layer behind those vendors’ product offerings. That is why you’re seeing partnerships like the one with $S (SentinelOne) starting to form.\n\nMany people who do not understand the new $MNDT and their strategy balked at the idea of $MSFT buying them. I’m here you tell you those people have no idea what they’re talking about. $MSFT has been trying to build a reputation in security for years, and they are getting better at it. After some time, I would expect to see Charlie Bell promoted to CEO of Azure, and Kevin Mandia heading up Cybersecurity at $MSFT, if the acquisition goes through.\n\nThe cherry on top of all of this is that $MNDT is also undervalued from a fundamental perspective, even after yesterday’s rally. It’s trading for 6.5x forward sales. That is dirt cheap for a tech company. When you go look up the numbers and charts, they look skewed because of the sale of the $FEYE product business. They are in transition, so factor that in when you do your own DD, which you should do.\n\nI’m not an investment advisor, I’ve just been working hard to analyze cybersecurity companies for the past several years, and wanted to share my thoughts about this company that gets no love.", "id": "t15emj", "created_utc": 1645799565.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t15emj)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t15emj)\n    \nHey /u/penny2129, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Post your positions.

These two have my attention, as well as $21k of options. Monday these two PE Heavyweights head to the main stage for their earnings release and pullbacks are highly probable. \n\nMarket Data Snapshot as of 02/18/2022\n\n|Symbol|PE Ratio|Annual Revenue|Annual Net Income|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|WDAY|2383|$4.3B (2021)|$-282.43M (2021)|\n|APPF|2027.11|$310.06M (2020)|$158.4M (2020)|\n|CRM|108.75|$21.25B (2021)|$4.07 B (2021)|\n\n  \n**Poor Outlook \\* High PE = $\\_$ $\\_$ $\\_$**\n\nCRM shocked quite a few of us the way it pulled back with lowered guidance for the future. This trend continued to boom as other tickers bled out on poor future guidance – and WDAY/APPF will go the same. Need proof? Look at WDAY’s performance YoY. These figures were before higher inflation – imagine what this will look like at the end of 2022? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Workday YoY Net Income](https://preview.redd.it/auyuqn7jr0k81.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=962e80dd0a8479943ed66817159d95555b9eca25)\n\nAPPF brings a similar set of red flags. The company historically fails to meet expectations with surprises ranging from -20% to -93% QoQ.  You've probably seen this same picture looking for \"APPF Earnings\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[APPF Earnings QoQ](https://preview.redd.it/1arhpcj7s0k81.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=81d563905c4853337fa5dee058b254cdebe41ff9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[APPF QoQ Net Income](https://preview.redd.it/qigsc66hs0k81.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da471b921861c2771db983ee51782ca6027b353)\n\nThis year is expected to be $355m-$357m in revenues. By the numbers, their quarter revs must break $91m to barely meet estimates. Revs aside, the bigger concerning piece is the company’s bottom line YoY and QoQ. Totaling up net income in 2021 YTD puts us at:  \n`03/2021 - 479k`  \n`06/2021 - 2,002k`  \n`09/2021 - 141k`  \n`-----`  \n`Total: $2,340k ($2.34m)`\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[APPF YoY Income: 2016-2020](https://preview.redd.it/tspx7a6ts0k81.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea730a80b7d30424d51c0d6be6a014897e1ad72)\n\nEven if the company doubled its previous best for the year and posted $4m -- the company will be at its lowest profitable year since 2016 ( -8.28M). With inflation in their face, these numbers will only go lower. \n\n*Note: In Q32020 the company sold the subsidiary MyCase for $193m Cash hence the net income of $158.4M for 2020.*\n\nBoth of these tickers will undoubtedly see higher operating costs during this time of inflation leading to a more challenging outlook in 2022. Finally, the sector has seen increased competition from names such as Yardi and Buildium. Both offering an attractive price point and user experience.\n\nTo recap, the following factors contribute to why we may see a sharper pullback than expected:\n\n* High PEs 2000+ compared to industry peers\n* Inflation w/ potential higher fed rate hike\n* Potential Guidance Miss or Lowered Future Guidance ( probable )\n* Continued War Tensions ( I hope not, but also probable )\n\nOverall, I think WDAY/APPF present themselves as probable stocks that will drop this Monday. Possibly even pre-ER as this weekend holds us in suspense.

{"title": "Bets for the incoming inflation / shortages along with the adoption of the digital ID...", "selftext": "So, if anyone has been paying attention to any of the shit that's been going on, you would have caught on to a few really fucked up things like the military grade \"guiding\" of social media and fear mongering to get everyone to adopt mandates etc, the whole World Economic Forum NWO reset etc. There are 2 things that have fucked with the ability for elites to \"guide\" the masses and those two things are the internet and ccr ipto, hence the need to contain the damage those 2 things do. Here is my prediction and would like to know based on this prediction what are some bets we can extrapolate from this... \n\nSo I believe the pandemic has been a power grab, mainly for the vaccine pass, and big pharma rape to everyones pockets all the while inflation is bigger than king kong's shlong. If anyone was watching Canada, we just went full fascist and declared martial law for a few days but pay attention here because while in that state, we allowed the powers towards finance crackdowns indefinite...\n\nNow in case you don't know what a digital ID is, its a programable id similar to china's social credit system. Basically all your shit combined with this ID, but with the ability to make your \"credits\" more like vouchers. So for instance we get a shortage for twinkis and/or its government policy to eat healthier then this ID would have the ability to have a limit to how many twinkis could be bought if any (THIS IS VIOLATION OF TWINKI RIGHTS - no one should be able to fuck with twinkis) And if your fine with that wait till they start denying you fucking crayons, then what the fuck are you going to eat?! \n\nSo the ID is coming, and like the pandemic, there has to be a way for it to be adapted, probably out of fear so my guess is inflation through the fucking roof, likely ukraine will have its pipeline tanked, and it will start the snowball of massive shortages around the world (sound like fun?) With these shortages and mass mayhem, a digital currency along with the programable ID would sound like a reasonable \"sacrifice\" so that we all \"do our part\" in protecting the supply chains and what resources we still have etc. Of course it could go to nuclear war and we all die, but then the bets are pointless so lets continue with this for now...\n\nMy guess is that oil and gas will go sky high, food shortages will hit as a direct result. Governments will target green tech as the saviour to the high gas and oil prices. Mining will go nuts to keep up with green tech.  Thoughts?. BTW still trying to find a way to post my gain and loss porn, managed to buy bkkt calls going from 120 bucks to 4300 (first options Ive ever bought) but haven't figured out how to display that after I sold, its a new broker to me, and yes I pretty much lost that little nugget on puts on mrna just too close the exp. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo TLDR\n\nMassive inflation like youve never seen.\n\nDigital ID to that can be controlled, meaning controlled travel, food, gas etc\n\nShortages starting from the disruption in Ukraine\n\nWhat bets can be made, and what areas can money be stored that can survive the change in monetary structure.", "id": "t1d6yq", "created_utc": 1645819752.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|108|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t1d6yq)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t1d6yq)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Anyone that has watched episode 1780 of joe rogan can start to piece together the shit that's been going on.
