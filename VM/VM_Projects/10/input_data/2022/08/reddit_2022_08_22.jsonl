They were good companies but Everyone Johnny Public bought them in mutual funds- until the p/e multiples got wildly overpriced.  \n\nIt wasn't high p/e growth stocks or stocks growing into themselves like you see today- ones that trade on other valuation metrics- it was stodgy, blue-chip stocks,  like xerox, dow chemical, US Steel, General Motors, General mills, Boeing, Ma Bell, Exxon, Chevron, Alcoa, Sears, maybe Disney, and other industrial stocks with capital intensive industries.  Ok? \n\nThey got overbought because everyone was buying the same stocks.  The closest comparison in today's market is the Trillion Cap stocks- basically 5 stocks that make up 20% of the market cap of the SP500. Right?  They have an outsized outcome on all 500. When Apple goes down- it takes the SPY with it, when Tesla catches a cold the market has a sneeze.  \n\nSo just keep those things in mind.  The context of the market matters.

Our economic growth depends a lot on the growth of communications speed and it follows the pace of growth in communications.

{"title": "Fisker DD- Why it's gonna", "selftext": "man, reddit fucked up my title. oh well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreetings apes, while this sub’s attention skyrockets, I figured it would be nice to spread some love for my favorite little EV stock: Fisker (FSR). Before we really get started, I’d appreciate it if you’d read [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvvalp/fisker_inc_fsr_dd/) DD from a year ago. It explains a bunch of the positive catalysts that give Fisker extreme potential to become a big player in the EV game soon enough. Just letting you know, literally NONE of them have fallen through since. Fisker is on track to meet all of its old goals, especially one critical one coming up in November.\n\nNow looking back 1 year ago, Fisker was at $14. A few months later, it ripped to $24 with some positive news. Shortly thereafter, the market collapsed and the big fish forgot about speculative investments. They crawled back into their holes and continued to get paid to invest other people’s money in bonds and AAPL.\n\nWhy does this matter you ask? Well, let me give those of you who didn’t read the previous DD a quick rundown:\n\nWell, since they last ripped 100%, they’ve managed 50k 250$ reservations and sold out on 5000 down payment pre-orders. That’s quite a few sales and should help their balance sheet pretty significantly. Given the amount of reservations and selling all of their down-payment pre-orders, they’ve got what they asked for and  what they need to succeed.\n\nNow looking at their short interest, they’ve got a short interest of 35% and a darkpool short interest of 58%. So far they’ve stated they’re on track to meet all production deadlines, and there doesn't appear to be undisclosed turbulence. If they produce in November and this stock jumps a little, it’s going to jump A LOT with all that short interest. With that will come a ton of capital for the company, significantly boosting their balance sheets and  allowing them to THRIVE in the future.\n\nI see this as both a solid investment for both the short and long term.\n\nPositions: x2 FSR $10 CALL1/20/23 (I am poor af)", "id": "wuwyb0", "created_utc": 1661182855.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wuwyb0)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wuwyb0)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good boy.

I know it’s a wall of text but it’s a well written and well informed speculation and I’d love to have a conversation about it. So yeah, read away and tell me what you think :)\n\nI’m bearish for 2 reasons + Extra reason at the end (read to see why I didn’t just say 3)\n\nFirstly, the average person has a LOT less disposable income now. I’d imagine less people are going and buying brand new NVIDIA GPUs. For the dedicated gamers who do want to build a pc, they could easily shop around and find a second hand card (I’ve heard a lot of miners are selling cards now, this follows on in my next point) for a way lower cost. I mean, new GPUs are extortionately expensive. Cards still being sold several hundred above MSRP. I love gaming but if I was struggling to keep up with the cost of living, I wouldn’t be buying a pc, or building a PC that’s ultimately going to cost me a fair bit over 1000. Money better spent elsewhere\n\nAnd also, following on about the miner point, Ethereum 2.0 Merge is set to happen around October ish time. Basically, ETH is changing their system which eliminates the need for mining. Therefore the massive amount of cards that got mass bought by miners, will then be sold and hugely inflate the market with second hand GPUs anyway, since miners no longer have a use for them. This further backs up the idea that people spending decent money would probably rather get a massively cheaper second hand card than buying new, which eats into NVDAs profit (hypothetically)\n\nThis happens at a bad time aswell. IF, and that’s a pretty big if because I’m a retard who can’t accurately predict macro economic changes and their effects on consumers\n…but still,\n IF NVDAs earnings are bad for Q3, obviously shares drop. And if I’m right about my theory on NVDA sales continuing to stay low after Ethereum 2.0, that’s lined up HORRIBLY with the buildup to Christmas, which I haven’t checked but I’d assume is when their sales are normally at their highest. That’s horrible for nvda because there’ll (in my theory) still be people all rushing to buy their GPUs, but they’ll be buying the cheap second hand ones. \nThat would make their Q4 earnings bad and probably miss quite hard on their earnings predictions if Christmas is normally their highest sales period. \n…\n\nIm still continuing that train of thought btw I just don’t want it to be a big wall of text.\n\n…\nWhat compounds (my theory of) NVDA’s woes to make it even worse, is that typically, consumers cut back on spending after the new year because people have gone out and spent way too much in the Christmas period, put it on their credit cards etc etc\n (I know this for a fact because my family runs a haulage/transport business, almost all of our work is moving freight for FedEx, and after New Years is always when work is the quietest because general volume is down, oh and the buildup to Christmas is always our busiest time which solidifies what I said earlier about Christmas buildup)\nSo yeah 2023 Q1 could suck ass for NVDA. This is compounded further by the fact that energy+utility bills are set to raise HUGELY around, and after Christmas both in the US and Europe. So people have even less spare money to dump atleast 1000 into what’s ultimately a luxury, and a toy (don’t get mad I have a high spec pc so I include myself in that but I’m just saying it how it is)\n…\nSo yeah, if that part plays out aswell, Q1 could be pretty bad for them. And when investors start to see that NVDA has had 3 consecutive bad quarters, they would have little faith in the stock. \n\nADDITIONAL SLAM DUNK REASON WHY NVDA COULD BE BAD:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) builds THE BULK of NVIDIAs chips. That’s fact btw search it up. Taiwan as you probably know is facing the threat of a Chinese invasion. And the threat has only grown and grown in recent months, with China not long ago exercising live fire ops with their navy, in extremely close proximity to Taiwan’s water borders, in 6 (I think 6 might of remembered wrong) separate locations. Xi Jinping has said publicly a lot of times that he wants to invade Taiwan.\nChina even took to verbally threatening America simply because someone from the US Gov (high up, can’t remember who) visited taiwan on undisclosed business. Taiwan has also been buying a lot of military gear from America.\n\nSee what I’m getting at? I’m not saying there will or won’t be an invasion, but the threat is there. It’s a big, and undeniable threat. TSM produces a large amount of the worlds computer chips, it’s one of taiwans biggest economic strengths. Not that an invasion wouldn’t already end TSMC’s chip export anyway, but it would be high on chinas priority list to destroy TSMC. \n\nSo yeah, that could be NVDAs entire chip supply down the drain. And chip foundries aren’t something that can just be knocked up in a few months. They take years (I think, I could be wrong on that) to construct and get running&operational. If China did invade, NVDA would almost certainly have to pause business.\n\nThat’s the end of my essay. Call me a gay bear if you want. I prefer to be bullish I’m not a perma bear but NVDA imo has the potential to be in for a rough time", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
