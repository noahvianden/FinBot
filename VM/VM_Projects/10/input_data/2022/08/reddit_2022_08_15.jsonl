He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.\n\nBurry shot to fame after his billion-dollar wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in the book and the movie \"The Big Short.\" He's also known for betting against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund last year, and for investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock.\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-q2-stock-portfolio-market-crash-2022-8](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-q2-stock-portfolio-market-crash-2022-8)\n\nMichael Burry reportedly sold all of his US stocks last quarter except Geo Group (GEO) after warning an epic market crash is coming.

{"title": "We‚Äôre not in a bubble", "selftext": "Just my humble opinion obviously. Here‚Äôs why:\n\nI‚Äôve seen a lot of people, including a couple of big names comparing the current market to the 1930‚Äôs and the dot com era. In my opinion the state of the market is nothing like this. \n\nDuring the Great Depression people were way over leveraged, which is what essentially caused the crash, similar to the housing bubble that burst in 2007. Too much borrowing caused a bubble that was not sustainable. Currently margin debt is below average in relation to stock market value. \n\nDuring the dot com bubble there was very clear over pricing of stocks, with the nasdaq composite average P/E ratio exceeding 100 for example. Right now the average P/E ratios are nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nFurther, despite interlinkage of global markets, the US stock market is arguably strengthened due to the weaker Russian, European, and Chinese markets, resulting in US stocks becoming almost a safe haven which could command higher valuations than average being reasonable. \n\nThere are troubling world events but a lot has been priced in and the stock markets have faced and recovered quickly from similar issues in recent decades. I think the crashes and recoveries of the last 20 years in particular have actually instilled a lot of confidence in the stock market, which has brought it to a new level of maturity (despite memes). This market perception is not easy to quantify or even be aware of. \n\nPeople are very aware that markets can crash, which I think is making people overly cautious right now in an undervalued market. At the same time, the markets have withstood many big tests in recent times which they have recovered relatively quickly from, I don‚Äôt see the masses logically losing faith in the markets as a whole like in previous major crashes anytime soon. I think we are going to climb a big wall of worry.\n\nI doubt anyone is going to alter their investment decisions based on my opinion, but obviously don‚Äôt. Think for yourself. These are simple points but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone make much of a logical argument against the whole bubble idea which is why I wanted to share my thoughts.

{"title": "$Coin - How this Icarus can make money", "selftext": "So I made some great money short coin on their first big downfall this year. Glad I had some risk management because round 2 of my positions got absolutely fucking obliterated when Blackrock pumped this shitheap the week before earnings. My thesis was centered around re-entering coin puts between 60-70 for the inevitable shitting the bed at earnings; with no major expected news or catalysts this slam dunk left me feeling secure as I went out of service camping in the beautiful rockies only to return to civilization to find out blackrock was fucking my shit up. RIP. So some loss porn, I had taken about half of my 120k original gain into COIN for round 2... as of now I am going to assume most of that 60k is gone. NGL 6 months of planning changed in one day didn't feel great but take that as a lesson why stop loss and some risk management can save a portfolio (sure as hell did to mine).\n\nAnyway, why I think there is now lots of meat on this bone.\n\n$COIN flew too close to the sun and now they have a very serious operating cost issue with a rapidbly closing revenue window.\n\nFirst some fundamentals from their last earnings and future prospects.\n\nThey are seeing a decline in users, especially in retail which is their bread and butter. Not only was the active users down more than expected in Q2 their Q3 and future outlook expected an additional decline between 10-30% for retail users.\n\nInsitutional activity pretty flat and not much out of their forward guidance on improvement. Even with the blackrock pump about their \"partnership\" which I see at least in any immediate timeframe as a nothing burger, $COIN themselves are not prediciting any immediate impact into revenue or price action.\n\nContinued loss of global market share; this doesn't look good for krep-toe (thanks WSB) US adoption in general. Effectively coinbase went after the generic, taxpaying american user. With a focus on operatering within the US financial system and not pissing off Uncle Sam. At first I thought this was great during krep-toe mania and you can see if in their historical earnings, it was a cash printing plan that would even make the fed blush. Find a way to bridge the most difficult thing that kept grandma from buying the magic internet money was the UI and link to traditional banking. Easy transfer between USD and krep-toe with a simple UI was genius. But the price was to know your user, and let the taxman know about all your assets as well as not directly holding cyrpto in your own wallet \"custodial services\".\n\nBut now this is hurting them. As krep-toe markets retreat and shake out more casual users these are the first audience to jump. More \"hardcore\" krep-toe users likely don't want to pay high fees's, have their assets under the nose of the taxman, and probably don't want their assets in custodial services. We can see the preference on krep-toe volume and global share for offshore exchanges not following activity of coinbase; instead seeing more positive changes in trading volume on their exchanges.\n\nMulti failures to enter other markets. This pairs with point (3), they really seem to be struggling to leave their little US niche. After a fuck up of platform releases in the likes of India and a failed NFT market I do not see Coinbase being able to grow outside the US well. Which limits my scope of analysis to what they may to do in the us. And to give a fair counterpoint, the US market is the most valuable one but leaves them vulnerable to how US regulators decide to get involved.\n\nRegulatory headwinds. We already know the SEC has subpeoned them and has an open investigation. To be honest I am not expecting the sky is falling from this. I think $COIN for the most part has been true to their original plan that they want to be compliant so I think high level execs randomly charged is just not on the table; and major internet coin (youu know which wsb...) are likely safe from a huge upheaval. However, all the alt-coins have a bullseye on their back right now by regulators and they represent nearly 50% of COINs ongoing revenue and activity. Trouble in alt-coin land can quickly destroy a large portion of COINs remaining revenue stream and my opinion is that the SEC is going to look at the more speculative listings as securities.\n\nOperating costs and timeline. They flew too close to the sun, they thought krep-toe infinite money glitch for ever. Well I can't blame them for growing into exploding and mind boggling revenue but that is gone for at least the next 4 quaters even by their own predictions. So they now have a problem where they need to innovate towards a new revenue stream while burning all their cash in the process. I see this as being difficult to balance it is functionally difficult for an immature company with a need for growth to effectively cut costs while finding new revenue streams. I am not optomistic.\n\nNow for some of the auxilliary\n\nBlackRock.\n\nWhen a player this big steps in you should always pay attention. Their recent 13F showed an increase in position sometime in the last months, although their cost average is still above 130$. These guys pretty much increased their position and then said hey want to do a paternship, shady I know but when you are this big and have a hand in everything... well is what it is. They also announced a butt-coin trust. So on a face level this seems bullish for COIN and investors certainly agreed (rip my puts) but I don't see this as an absolute.\n\nThe original announcement between being able to access coinbase prime from alladin is meh. Even coinbase doesn't believe this is going to do anything short term for them, and krep-toe markets didn't seem very excited either. If you want to be a US compliant financial instution you were limited by KYC already, so as of now I look at this as more of QoL change than actual money invested.\n\nThe ability to invest does not always mean the money will follow. Most institutions are not going to want a target on their back. Depending on the outplay of regulators krep-toe may not be that attractive of an investment; and staking is still a massive grey area of risk. Primarily for how illiquid it is. Coinbase agrees. Also the future of major krep-toes is in question right now, 60k butt-coin might be on a horizon too far out for instituional investors who would otherwise see little value in staking coupled with regulatory risk.\n\nSo here are the cases I see for each direction:\n\nDownside:\n\nSEC rules in anyform unfavorably for alt-coins or krep-toe in general. This further hurts krep-toe recovery, altcoin revenue, and can scare way institutions which is where COIN is trying to pivot its revenue too. They may alienate \"hardcore\" krep-toe users as well by trying to play compliant with regulators (good for their instutional adoption) who prefer the regulatory grey area of offshsore exchanges, acceletrating the trend of users to them.\n\nkrep-toe prices flatline or drop. Either right now is revenue destruction. People were happy to pay wild fees to coin when price up 5% in a day, but continued \"krep-toe winter\" simply means less money in. This impacts all their metrics, trade volume, users and revenue per user. Their fees are going to have to drop to remain competative.\n\nUpside:\n\nCyrpto take off. If krep-toe rockets again and butt-coin goes back to 60k well, we will see what we saw before fucking eye watering mind boggling revenue.\n\nFavorable regulatory outcomes. If regulators make coinbase the defacto exchange if don't want Uncle Sam down your throat this could be very beneficial to COIN forcing US based institutions to them. This may also protect their fees. Also if they don't consider alt-coins securities, this will protect their revenue. A strong positive regulatory structure has the potential to legitimize krep-toe in the eyes of main institutions as well, which willl help coin pivot from the retail mania wave that it started out in to a real institutional based exchange platform.\n\nTimeline & Price Targets\n\nMy original price target was ~40-50$ after last earnings which I think would have happened if blackrock didn't jam my jellies. But that timeline is gone.\n\nIf krep-toe remains flatish, the SEC doesn't unexpectadly suck coin dick, and September CPI doesn't show a steep fall off than I think investors will have to re-evaluate the recent pump to $90's in reality against revenue. Krep-toe trading volume is pretty easy to find online and through which exchange, and it hasn't been getting better. This continued trend is going to force another bad quater Q3 which is coupled with further poor guidance I think will bring this stock price back to where it belongs. ~50$. My timeline is 9/30 as the most aggresive with bad CPI and 12/09 to play November earnings and general Dec sell off. My strike target for those plays is 80 and 70 respectively. I have some positions in but am currently waiting for a little of the volatility of the recent rally to clear down and get a better picture of how much legs this rally has.\n\nI am not expecting any major downturn in price in the short term, 90$ is just too sticky right now.\n\nBe on the watch for any indicication that krep-toe is about to rocket or that the SEC may favor COIN; because in that case drop your puts like its the monkeypox and get on the call train because if retail volume trading explodes this company will start printing money again.\n\nTL,DR;\n\nCoin headed back below 60$ EOY with out a major boost in krep-toe prices/volume and favorable SEC outcome. I wouldn't enter positions today or maybe even this week; but keep an eye out for good entry.\n\nThe sucker punch. Blackrock can keep buying stock and keep pumping it by news releases about their \"future coin products\" whether this makes money or not.\n\nAlso I am neither bull/bear on the krep-toe, just as far as I need to see how it impacts COIN. WSB rules make me talk like this...

Intrinsic value is the value of the contract if you were to exercise it that day, so a 10$ strike with a current price of 11 has an intrinsic value of 100$. If the option is worth 200$, that means that 100$ of it is extrinsic value which is affected by theta decay.

Another way to look at is to take the buyer‚Äôs perspective. If you have the 3x strike example, what does it benefit the buyer to purchase your option instead of the stock? Very little is the answer, the buyer has some minimal downside risk protection on the option versus the stock. The holder can expect to get very little premium (your extrinsic value) at that level. The downside protection for the buyer is much more evident at shares values of  $12, $15 or even $20 for that same $10 strike in the moderately distant future, so  you can expect more and more extrinsic value (premium to the current value)as the itm share price to strike ratio drops closer to 1.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nobody tell him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
