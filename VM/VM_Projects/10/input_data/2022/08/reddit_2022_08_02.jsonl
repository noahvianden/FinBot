If you sold calls also, you might balance the delta in a static state, but not if the volatility or price change.

Some firms adjust their delta/shares every few minutes, others daily. A better example would be buying a wide call spread during high IV spike, then sell shares against that spread and wait for IV to drop or wait for the time to pass. Other times at high IV you may sell a call and buy corresponding number of shares. At low IV you could buy a straddle and neutralize it further with shares, wait for IV to spike, in which case delta hedging will result in gamma scalping (collecting profit from higher vol). While mainly delta hedging is a form of harvesting alpha (profit) while neutralizing beta (correlation to the underlying). Let’s say someone tells you that they can make 20%/year more than holding the stock, by using the wheel or some other way of collecting theta or any other strategy. So then you’d ask them why aren’t they delta hedging to eliminate their risk thus collecting pure 20% profit without depending on the underlying stock. (the answer is that they have no clue what they’re doing and they can’t beat the underlying because they rely on it by not delta hedging and thus their P&L moving proportionally to the delta, which is highly correlated to the underlying).", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "You’ve got it for the most part. \n\nOne distinction is that buying shares is static hedging, whereas hedging with an options position is dynamic hedging (as the deltas change).", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "For me, I often have a target delta in mind when getting in. As the underlying moves, any delta from options may change. \n\nI may go in and want to be near delta neutral, or net long, or net short. \n\nTo give an example, say I do a covered call on Apple. In the example, I buy 100 shares and sell a 20 delta call one month out. This initial position is equivalent to being long 80 shares. \n\nIf Apple stock goes down, the delta on the out of the money call goes down. I might roll the call down and out to stay near the initial 80 delta. \n\nIf instead, Apple rallies I might roll the sold call out and up to maintain roughly 80 delta. Micro adjustments tend to be counter productive for retail traders. \n\nOverall delta on different underlyings tends to be best calculated with SPY beta weight. Thinkorswim provides this number. In essence it takes a snapshot of the entire portfolio and equates it to a number of SPY shares, net long or short or perhaps near neutral. \n\nThe beta weight gives a rough idea of risk. If trading very short term options, gamma risk can be significant. Gamma measures the change in delta. \n\nThe rabbit hole can get quite deep.

This was the coked up 80s, and that time s long gone.\n\nNow onto your questions...First, you need to learn about delta hedging by reading books and some online material. Even a single google search reveals what this means https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_neutral - you are trying to achieve zero delta on the portfolio, whether on a single underlyer or multiple underlyings.\n\n\"For example, if I sell a 30d put on AAPL, I'll be long 30d. And if I do that for another 2 stocks for eg, META & AMZN, I'll be long 90d in total.\"\n\nCorrect. You need to sum all deltas, including the shares you own (100 shares are 100 delta), to get to total delta.\n\n\"Now in order to \"manage delta\" does that mean I should sell some calls as well to make it delta neutral? When I sell the calls, should I sell against the same underlyings as my long delta or can I just use beta weighted delta against spy to hedge the delta?\"\n\nYou can sell calls with a total of 90 delta, or sell 90 shares of stock. This is where it gets interesting. You can sell 30 shares of each of the 3 stocks you sold puts on, or you can calculate the correlation of the stocks you sold, and or the correlation to the index that is most representative (SPY, or even QQQ) and then sell the deltas according to that correlation calculation. If the correlation is near 1 among all your choices, then you can either sell calls with a total of 90 delta, or 90 shares of your mix of stocks or index.\n\n\"Also, the reason for this I presume is to not be directional and let theta do it's work?\"\n\nThe reason for this is to decrease directional exposure. Theta has nothing to do with it.\n\nDelta hedging works in both ways - start with a underlying position, then use options to neutralize delta, OR start with options and then use the underying and/or other options to neutralize total delta.\n\nFor instance, you can start with long shares, and then sell covered calls in a delta neutral manner. Like, you own 100 shares of SPY, and then sell 1 ATM call, which carries a negative 50 delta, so you are now at 50 delta, vs. earlier 100 delta.\n\nAgain, study.

{"title": "Powell is still easing, more so after the last FOMC meeting", "selftext": "I have a thesis for why the market is going up after the FOMC meeting and I would like to initiate a discussion regarding the same.\n\nTightening means the value of cash should go up, since the value of any fiat currency is determined by how many folks want to stay in cash compared to investing in assets or spending it all away. Increasing the value of cash hence should involve providing higher returns for deferred cash or debt that beats inflation. I have heard a few people say interest rates should match up to the inflation rates, which I feel is false. To truly tame inflation the Fed needs to provide an estimate of inflation and then give cash holders returns that beat inflation. This means when you get 0.6% Core PCE inflation rise MoM, you need to say that you are going to raise inflation 7.4% rates to incentivize folks to move to cash or spend less. Anything lesser is incentivizing spending.   \n\n\nIn the press conference after FOMC meeting, unlike previous press meets the Fed has dropped inflation projections. This means that the Fed has admitted that they have no estimate of the inflation or how high it might go. Meanwhile they raised the rates by 0.75% this implies they are assuming the inflation has to come down to nearly 0% total over the next 12 months. The market participants saw that the possibility of this happening is very low and is trying to get rid of their cash by buying assets.   \n\n\nIf  my thesis is correct, this means that the stock market is going to see another rip your face off rally  next. And this is not a short covering but just a significant move up.  But unlike other rallies the volume will be decidedly lower as only a few stocks will rally this time especially the stocks that will profit from the destruction of the value of cash.  \n\n\nThis is an opinion that I would like a discussion on and I welcome views opposing mine.", "id": "wdzlcz", "created_utc": 1659406851.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wdzlcz)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wdzlcz)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "“especially the stocks that will enable the destruction of the value of cash” \n\nSuch as?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Let me be more specific, it should be not enablement but profiting from.

Why did he do a 0.5% followed by two 0.75 % rate hikes. He justifies it by higher CPI. Let us assume that he was tightening in March when he first raised rates by 0.25%. If this is tightening, then cash should give a positive return after adjusting for inflation, this means he is assuming the inflation YoY in Feb 23 will be 0.5% or lower. The next increase was at 0.5%, now fed funds rate is at 1% this means that he is saying that the May 23 YoY inflation number will be at 1%. The next rate hike was for 0.75% making the fed funds rate at 1.75%, this means the Fed assumes the inflation rate for May 23 will be lesser than 1.75% or lower. In July the Fed raises rates again by 0.75 %, the fed now assumes 2.5% for June 23. This is how tightening works, you give more return for dollars. Do you see inflation coming down to these levels ?\n\nLet us assume the Fed made a error in judging how much inflation could rage. Now let us check the CPI data from Feb to July mom, 1.2%, 0.3%, 1%, 1.3%. The Fed has not been able to provide an inflation beating return even after taking the fed funds rate from 0.25 to 2.25% as Fed funds rates are yearly while CPI rates i gave are monthly. How is this tightening ?\n\nForget percentages let us talk real dollars, if i hold on to 100 dollars in March at the new higher Fed funds rate, i am at a loss now adjusting for inflation by May by around 1.45% (1.2 + 0.3 - 0.5/6)% approximately. Let us assume I continue to believe Fed is tightening, and keep another 100 dollars in cash after the May rate hike, i am at a loss of 0.92 % ( 1 - 1/12)% by the time June comes around. Okay i am going to be really sure of the Fed's commitment and i keep holding on to my cash i am at a MoM loss of 1.15% (1.3-1.75/12)%. Let us assume that this month inflation really cools down MoM. The MoM inflation rate that would enable my cash to not lose any more value is 0.21% ( 2.5/12). Can it happen, sure it can the inflation data for April MoM was at 0.3%. But if the MoM increase is more than 0.21% i have still lost and my cash position will not have lost money.\n\nLet us take the Core PCE as a metric, the MoM values from March to June are  0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.6. 100 dollars in march would have lost 0.51% (0.3 + 0.3 - 0.5/6) by may. The second 100 dollars would have lost 0.51% (0.3 + 0.3 - 1/12) by June. The third 100 dollars would have lost 0.53 % (0.6 - 1.75/12). So the Core PCE reading for me to make some return on my fourth set of 100 dollars is some number smaller than 0.21% ( 2.5/12).\n\nThis is the math i came up with, i have ignored the compounding effects in my calculations. But if my cash position is continuously losing value both by CPI and Core PCE, where is the tightening ? And with the Fed raising rates by only 75 bps and not 100 bps, inflation really needs to cool down for cash positions to be favored by the market participants.

Intel (INTC) was said to benefit the most from the bill. Among these 3 famous semi-conductor stocks (NVDA-INTC-AMD), which one would you prefer to invest in the most? \n\nThe global semiconductor shortage that has left consumers waiting on coffee makers, computers, cars and medical devices — anything with a computer chip — might have an end in sight.\n\nAfter three years of stops and starts, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $52 billion package last week designed to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and improve competitiveness with China. The bill passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support, and will now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.\n\nThe bill, known as the CHIPS-plus or Chips and Science Act, addresses concerns expressed by both parties that the U.S. needs to bring the production of these vitally important components back home and rely less on Asia-based manufacturers. Supporters, including companies such as Intel and Global Foundries, argued that the bill was necessary since other countries subsidize their semiconductor industry, making it hard for U.S. companies to compete without help.\n\nLast month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, speaking with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, emphasized just how critical it is for the U.S. to begin making more chips at home and why passage of the CHIPS Act was central to that happening.\n\n“Mark my words, if Labor Day comes and goes and this isn’t passed by Congress, companies will not wait, and they will expand into other countries,” she said. “The U.S. will lose out.”\n\nThe bill, of course, doesn’t preclude U.S. chip makers from also producing in Europe and elsewhere, but it does provide financial incentives to make manufacturing facilities in the U.S. more attractive. Intel has already pledged to build a $20 billion chip plant near Columbus, Ohio. The facility is expected to employ 3,000 workers along with 7,000 temporary construction jobs.\n\nThe package making its way to Biden’s desk has a few components, including $39 billion that would give direct financial assistance to companies building chip manufacturing plants at home. A separate $11 billion is earmarked to advance chip manufacturing research and workforce training, and a $2 billion slice is set aside to move lab innovation into military and other applications.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/after-chips-act-us-has-long-road-to-rival-asia-in-semiconductors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/after-chips-act-us-has-long-road-to-rival-asia-in-semiconductors.html)\n\nThe US Congress has passed the $52 billion package Chips-Plus Bill Act and President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law.

The average annual flow has dropped \\~20% since the 1900's, and has made prices for water rights increase over that time. The spike in water prices, however, go further than that. Here are some of the factors driving the current spike.\n\n1. Water authorities are seeing higher costs of securing water supplies\n2. Prices for water treatment are increasing due to higher energy costs\n3. And the prices of already conserved supplies are rising with inflation\n\nLake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States by volume, and has enough capacity to hold the entire annual flow of the Colorado River for 2 years. It helps supply 25 million people across Arizona, Nevada, and California with water. It also creates hydroelectricity through the Hoover Dam, supplying power to the three states. Continuing a 22-year downtrend, water levels in Lake Mead stand at their lowest levels since 1937.

The Hoover dam has been producing less and less electricity as water levels dwindle and will entirely cease to produce power (with possibly no water flowing downstream) if levels fall below 895 ft.
