We think this is an inventory-led recession, and I think that's coming through loud and clear. We're seeing advertisers cut back dramatically,\" Wood said.Recent earnings results from Snap and Meta Platforms revealed that advertisers were indeed slowing their spending on those platforms in recent months, while Walmart and Target have warned that excess inventory will drag on their profits this year.\n\nWood's view of the current status of the US economy differs from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's view, who said last month that he isn't seeing signs the economy has entered a recession. But Powell and the Fed are mostly focused on lagging indicators, Wood said, like the employment market and inflationary readings like CPI.\n\nThat means the Fed likely won't acknowledge the economy is in a recession until it's already happened.\n\nSource: [https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/ark-invest-chief-cathie-wood-thinks-the-us-is-in-a-recession-but-says-her-funds-growth-strategy-has-already-bottomed/articleshow/93281793.cms#:\\~:text=Ark%20Invest's%20Cathie%20Wood%20is,coming%20through%20loud%20and%20clear](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/ark-invest-chief-cathie-wood-thinks-the-us-is-in-a-recession-but-says-her-funds-growth-strategy-has-already-bottomed/articleshow/93281793.cms#:~:text=Ark%20Invest's%20Cathie%20Wood%20is,coming%20through%20loud%20and%20clear)\n\nARK Invest's (ARKK) Cathie Wood says that the US has already entered a recession.

Look at most of these tech companies, most of em are just companies who bet on the explosive growth they saw during the pandemic would remain post-lockdowns or startups trying to reduce burn rates. Like Peleton thinking people would still buy their bikes when lockdowns lifted.\n\nIf you look at Shopify for example, most of their job losses are coming from tech-adjacent sectors like marketing and HR (talent acquisition). Prepandemic (2019), they had 5000 employees  and there were hiring at a pace of 1000 employees each year roughly. At their peak (2021), they had 10000 employees and with the 10% cut, they have now 9000 employees. Still well above their previous hiring pace, probably will see more cuts if things go really to shit. But they are still hiring senior engineers and team leads.\n\nSame thing with Google. Apparently with Meta there is a legit hiring freeze across all levels. But for Google, there is definately a hiring freeze for \"Early Career/New grad\" engineers but for seniors engineers and higher, there's been no slowdown in hiring and reaching out for candidates.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm wouldn't want to lose my job, but to me, its like try to keep a positive outlook, shore up the emergency fund and stay up to date with skills. Identify if the company you work at is one of those at high risk and plan accordingly.
