{"title": "Coinbase will release its Q2 earnings today after market close; Cathie Wood bought COIN at $254 and sold at $53. Will COIN beat or miss earnings?", "selftext": "Without question, the crypto market, which Coinbase Global (COIN) relies on, has been in a massive slump so far in 2022. Crypto investors have shifted their stance on the growth prospects of the entire crypto industry.\n\nThe company has planted itself at the forefront of the cryptocurrency industry to become largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. Its shares have fallen near 80% from their November peak. The company, which generates its revenue via transaction fees from customers buying and selling cryptocurrencies, will report second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday.\n\nIn the three months that ended June, Wall Street analysts expects the Wilmington, DE-based company to post a per-share loss $2.68 on revenue of $830.52 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $6.42 per share on revenue of $1.78 billion. For the full year, ending January, the loss is projected to be $7.76 per share, compared to EPS of $14.50 a year ago, while full year revenue of $3.91 billion would decline 50% year over year.\n\nThe projected year-over-year decline in revenue and wider loss on EPS highlight some of the risks with Coinbase’s current business model which is 90% tied to the crypto transaction fees. In other words, unless investors are buying and selling cryptocurrencies, Coinbase doesn’t make any money. The company been trying to diversify into a subscription service. But it’s still in the early stages of that business which doesn’t yet produce enough to impact the bottom line.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, the company missed on both the top and bottom lines, reporting Q1 revenue of $1.16 billion which declined 35% year over year, missing estimates by $300 million, while the Q1 loss of $1.98 per share missed by $1.73.

That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years.

But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me \"the chicken comes home to roost.\" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a façade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable.

We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, \"but that's another topic\" - drake. You think you're really something special?

{"title": "One day till CPI. Get ready. 8/9/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY.", "selftext": " \n\nGoodmorning traders, one day until CPI. Let’s examine what has happen technically coming into CPI. The First thing that I see is that the daily chart’s MACD has flatten out. One of my rules for swing trades is never short on a vertical MACD. Now that it has leveled out now, we may be able to start hunting for shorts. The weekly chart is still the chart in control and it is in its water break or rest area but it still seems to have a little more sideways action baked into it. Remember, when a chart hits its rest area like a runner in a marathon there is a tendency to run in place (consolidate)while it builds energy to go thru the next level or range. This Consolidation on the weekly chart could be a very large range (possible 421 down to 405). The weekly chart also feels like it is at or nearing the top of its current range. With this down move starting to play out before CPI, remember the market is a pricing model that likes to price in event ahead of time. So, we could be setting up for a sell the rumor and buy the fact which goes along with the bizarro world effect we have been in because I can’t imagine CPI being good news. Now if the weekly is the chart in control remember waiting on the turn in the weekly is like waiting on a tanker ship to make a U-turn. Knowing this we have to watch the daily and 4-hour for early signs and entries. This is all setting up for a very nice pop back up during or after the CPI report where we can start looking for swing short.\n\nKey levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)413-414, (queen)415-416and (king)417-420 area. Support (jack)411-410(queen)409-408 and (King)407-403. The main thesis is Bearish bias closing below 412.99 projected target/low of between 411-406. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 412.99 projected target/high 413-419.The current major channel we are in 397-416 and the next major channel up is from 416-425.  Scenarios for the day:\n\n1)  Expanded Range Day structure We could look to set a decision area/ high boundary around the jack or queen resistance area then chopping back down.   Or vice versa **34% probability**\n\n2) Trend day down we open gap down and start with a pop back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king support. or vice versa. **33% probability**\n\n3) Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push lower toward jack or queen support area and find midday chop around either queen or king support before spending the same energy we used going down to come back up the second half of the day or vice versa.  **33% probability**", "id": "wk1ljn", "created_utc": 1660046751.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|38|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|49|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wk1ljn)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wk1ljn)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "as long as CPI is lower than prior reading, this should be taken as bullish, the fed can say \"inflation is going down\"  and slow the rate hiking schedule,  we may get a .5bp in sept and .5 afterward.    \nHOWEVER, on the outside chance cpi is higher than 9 (not likely)  you can count on the fed hiking to .75bp and the bearish scenario on spy        \ni give your TA a 8.5/10   could have used more charts and lines,  i need colors  and pictures cause im a helpless child.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "so either up or down", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Or sideways ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Going around in loops and singing \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\"", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Short everything\n\nBerz run 2022", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for the analysis.

A week ago, it looked like they might ease up, but after Friday’s red-hot jobs number and the passage of the \\[Inflation Reduction Act\\], I’m worried they might lower the boom on us even before September comes,” he said.\n\n“If both numbers are scorchers, we will get a surprise August meeting,” he predicted, referencing the consumer price index and producer price index data coming this week.\n\nThe Senate on Sunday passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a Democrat-backed package aimed at fighting climate change and extending health care coverage.\n\nThe legislation, among other provisions, allows Medicare to negotiate prices with drug companies and puts a 15% minimum tax on large corporations.\n\nThe July jobs report saw stronger-than-expected numbers last week, meaning the central bank could have to continue its path forward on raising interest rates aggressively.\n\n“If I were Chairman Jay Powell … I’d be hard-pressed not to call a special Fed meeting this month to hit us with another 75-basis point rate hike,” Cramer said. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.\n\nInvestors are also looking to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index this week to shed more light on how consumers are coping with inflation.\n\nCramer also previewed this week’s slate of earnings.
