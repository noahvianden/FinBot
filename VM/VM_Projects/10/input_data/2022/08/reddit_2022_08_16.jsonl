Nouriel Roubini, also referred to as \"Dr. Doom,\" said Monday that a recession could bring financial distress \"across the board.\" \n\nDespite a strong jobs report, the U.S. economy has left many Americans seeing higher grocery bills despite a dip in July in overall inflation. The Federal Reserve has attempted to curb inflation by raising interest rates, but some experts say the country is heading for, or may already be in a recession. \n\n \"We are in a sharp slowdown, we've had two negative quarters of growth in the first half \\[of 2022\\],\" Roubini, an Iranian American economist who accurately predicted the housing bubble burst in 2008, told Bloomberg on Monday. \"The recession is going to be long, protracted, severe, and associated with financial distress across the board.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve most recently hiked interest rates another 75 basis points in late July to thwart an inflation rate of 8.5 percent, which followed a similar raise in June—marking the largest back-to-back increases seen in decades. Roubini implied the increases aren't enough to combat inflation.\n\nIn fact, Roubini expects the Fed will need to hike interest rates further to bring the 8.5 percent inflation rate to the target 2 percent.\n\n\"The Fed funds rate should be going well above 4 percent to push inflation towards 2 percent,\" he said to Bloomberg. \"If that doesn't happen, inflation expectations are going to get unhinged, or you'll get a hard landing.\"\n\nYet despite the growing concern regarding a recession, the Fed's interest rates are still relatively low.\n\nAccording to an article by Bankrate, although the Fed has been raising interest rates, its borrowing rate is still historically low. The federal funds rate has remained below its historic average of 4.61 percent since 2007. From 2008 to 2015, the federal funds rate was zero.\n\nThe federal funds rate reached its highest point in the early 1980s, when it soared to 20 percent.\n\nRoubini said he felt although inflation may have peaked, he's unsure of how fast it may fall.\n\n\"I don't think the monetary policy is tight enough to push inflation to 2 percent fast enough,\" he said.\n\nDuring the last week of July, an editing war broke out on the Wikipedia page for \"recession\" after Biden administration officials played down figures showing the United States had entered an unofficial recession following two quarters of negative economic growth. Two consecutive quarters of decreasing GDP is an unofficial definition for a recession.", "id": "wq04d2", "created_utc": 1660670660.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": ">also referred to as \"Dr. Doom\n\nAnd yet when I refer to myself with that nickname, none of my patients appreciate it", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Same.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I can remember my father talking about Roubini and the doom and gloom predictions back in the early to mid 00s.

My conviction is based on the idea that most stockholders I know are incredibly long as a result of the belief in changing food trends: eating habits; long commitment of financial stock communities' beliefs in buying the dip: Financial Education; improving gross margin positions as robotics gets fully implemented next quarter; TTCF receiving a strong line of credit; and profitability only being one year and one quarter away.  \n\nRight now, margin is not where it should be. However, with a slow decrease in inflation, robotics, and scale, margins should start to look better with the quarters coming forward. TTCF revenue grew 15% even though their product's prices are the highest in the freezer aisle. Also, like TESLA, TTCF is vertically integrated. Therefore, they will be able to lower their costs and become more efficient in the long-term. TTCF is in every major retailer. Since the sell through has been high, stores are increasing their shelf space. TTCF is also expanding their product offering with higher margin products in the short term: snacks and refrigerated items. When TTCF starts becoming profitable, this stock will move-especially with the high short position. Wall Street is usually two to three steps ahead. When large investment firms have permission to enter, when TTCF becomes profitable, TTCF will shoot up like a rocket creating an incredible short squeeze. The time to own this company is now when the company is inching upward at a very slow rate. \n\nDisclosure: I do own the stock as well as long-term options extending past the date of when they will likely be profitable. Also, like Jeremy from Financial Education, I am long on this stock. It may be too early for most short-term investors to buy this stock.
