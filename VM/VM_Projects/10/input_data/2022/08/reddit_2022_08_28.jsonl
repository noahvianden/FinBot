{"title": "Expected moves this week. SPY, QQQ, Baidu, Lululemon, Mongo DB and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week ‚Äì** After a period of declining volatility and moves in line with expectations volatility roared back and the SPY declined 4.3% on the week, significantly more than the 1.7% move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week ‚Äì** SPY options are pricing a 2.2% move for the upcoming week.\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX ‚Äì** The VIX closed the week near 26, up from 21 last week and 19 the week before. VIX futures are still higher than spot but no longer the steep curve we saw the past few weeks. December futures are near 28 and Jan 2023 and beyond months are all above 28,\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2.2%** (+/- $9)\n* QQQ **2.8%** (+/- $9)\n* IWM **2.7%** (+/- $5)\n* DIA **2%** (+/- $6.50)\n\n## In the News\n\nThe big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.\n\nThe selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn‚Äôt seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.\n\nThe VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year‚Äôs range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday‚Äôs selloff won‚Äôt continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.\n\nFor its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oi7qt5sgaik91.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c0a2520369a19a5d626487f6fa7f914e3f5b6f\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links*¬†below go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).
