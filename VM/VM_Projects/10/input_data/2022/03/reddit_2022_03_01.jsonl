My upbringing did not include an introduction/education in investing, so when I first learned of Warren in 1984, I was very skeptical and spent a lot of spare time in the university library looking for more information and any contradictory evidence.

He is genuinely folksy and friendly; I think that this masks his raw intelligence and causes those who don't know him well to underestimate him.

On several occasions, both Warren and Charlie have stated that they were aware of only a very small handful of individuals who knew how to properly value companies (that number has ranged from four to six others).  Currently, Berkshire Hathaway has four persons who possess that skill.\n2. Personally, I've been fascinated by the share repurchases, because of the average prices paid and number of shares repurchased each month.  An argument could be made that these average prices constitute a guide to the level of acceptable discount to intrinsic value.  For example, in December 2021, \"A\" shares were repurchased for an average price of $439,625.92 ($293.084 \"B\" equivalent).  One can always try to wait for much lower prices, but don't forget that Berkshire Hathaway will be competing with you to buy those shares.\n3.

{"title": "The Case for $MNDT", "selftext": "I   come from a cybersecurity background and do a lot of work on   cybersecurity companies to understand their businesses and invest in   them.\n\nI’m sharing the research   I’ve done on one company in particular, $MNDT, because it’s not only a   beaten up stock in value territory that is looking better technically,   but it is also more relevant today due to the Russia/Ukraine situation. I  believe this is going to be the year for $MNDT.\n\nAs   you may know, $MNDT was formerly $FEYE until they sold off the $FEYE   product business and brand. This was actually the best possible move, as   the product business was legacy and weighed heavily on the  fundamentals  of the company. Not to mention the very promotional ex-CEO  of $FEYE  marred the company’s reputation with investors… an uphill  battle the  current CEO, Kevin Mandia, has been fighting ever since. As a  result, it  will take some time for the new $MNDT to re-educate  investors about  what the company actually does and how it’s different  from the old  $FEYE. Even though investors will take some time to  persuade, the  cybersecurity world already has massive respect for Kevin  Mandia and his  team.\n\n$MNDT is a  threat  intelligence company made up of some of the most brilliant  cybersecurity  analysts in the world. They are relied upon heavily by  the US  government and high risk enterprise organizations that need  extra help  with forensics, incident response, and intelligence before,  during, and  after breaches occur.\n\nThe  biggest  challenge $MNDT faces is resource constraint with their  analysts, so it  can be difficult to scale their expertise, as there are  only so many  people you can hire and hours they can work. What they  are doing now, is  working to use AI/ML to help scale their threat  intelligence offerings  through Mandiant Advantage.\n\nHere’s where things get really interesting…\n\nBecause   $MNDT got rid of the FEYE product business, which included endpoint   security, SIEM, network security products, etc. they have actually   GREATLY expanded their TAM.\n\nBecause they no longer compete with product companies that sell products in those categories, they can pursue *partnerships*   with those product companies instead, and offer to be the threat   intelligence layer behind those vendors’ product offerings. That is why   you’re seeing partnerships like the one with $S (SentinelOne) starting   to form.\n\nMany people who do not   understand the new $MNDT and their strategy balked at the idea of $MSFT   buying them. I’m here you tell you those people have no idea what   they’re talking about. $MSFT has been trying to build a reputation in   security for years, and they are getting better at it. After some time, I   would expect to see Charlie Bell promoted to CEO of Azure, and Kevin   Mandia heading up Cybersecurity at $MSFT, if the acquisition goes   through.\n\nThe cherry on top of all   of this is that $MNDT is also undervalued from a fundamental   perspective, even after yesterday’s rally. It’s trading for 6.5x forward   sales. That is dirt cheap for a tech company. When you go look up the   numbers and charts, they look skewed because of the sale of the $FEYE   product business. They are in transition, so factor that in when you do   your own DD, which you should do.\n\nI’m   not an investment advisor, I’ve just been working hard to analyze   cybersecurity companies for the past several years, and wanted to share   my thoughts about this company that gets no love.", "id": "t49rsk", "created_utc": 1646146680.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Nice call on MNDT!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you :)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thanks for this analysis and thoughts.

{"title": "HelioGen HLGN is going to be the next Tesla type disrupter imo", "selftext": "**Safe harbor** \\- I'm not an investing expert and this isn't advice. Only invest with money you can afford to lose.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo - HelioGen (HLGN) was created by initial investments from a bunch of heavy hitters (including Bill Gates) where the goal was to fund transformational / disruptive technology that will tackle major global issues. They are also funding next generation nuclear power plants and other stuff.\n\n**What is HelioGen?**\n\nHelioGen is focused on commercializing the concept behind the historical Archimedes' flaming death ray; otherwise known as  *Concentrated solar*.\n\n**The context:**\n\n1. You can use a mirror to reflect / focus the sun's light into a small area and thus create a hot spot.\n2. Big mirrors have a lower efficiency due to distortions / imperfections\n3. Small mirrors are more efficient but you would need to precisely aim A LOT of small mirrors to get a useful amount of heat\n4. The mirrors have to be aimed EXTREMELY precisely to get the desired effect. You are talking about hundreds or thousands of tiny beams of light and only those focused on the target will be useful, no points for near misses. When you factor in the constantly moving sun, cloud cover, atmospheric distortions from humidity in the air and other variables it becomes exceptionally hard to focus a large number of mirrors in a small area over a long enough period of time to achieve very high temperatures\n\n**What makes Heliogen special:**\n\nBy pairing small, mass produced mirrors (called heliostats) with AI software that monitors and adjusts them you can create relatively cheap solar plants able to generate heat in excess of 1,500 degrees C (they are now talking about even higher temps, up to 1,800 degrees C). This is important for a number of reasons:\n\n1. Up till now no one else has been able to do this on a commercial scale. Back in 2019 the HelioGen pilot plant set all kinds of records by getting to 1,000 degrees C with a relatively small foot print\n2. The small footprint combined with the extreme heat means that on site solar / thermal power plants that operate 24/7 (with excess heat captured during the day stored in the form of molten salt or other medium) means that there are commercially viable use cases that up till now weren't addressable. HelioGen is already under contract with Rio Tinto to provide electricity 24/7 on site at a Californian boron mine. This will be a proof of concept in addition to kicking off the revenue generation.\n3. HelioGen is standing up a commercial production facility to mass produce small mirrors (heliostats). Most companies looking to do solar concentration simply buy what is available on the market and the quality and cost aren't ideal. Making exactly what they need in a dedicated facility will allow them to keep costs under control and scale over time efficiently.\n4. The funny thing about getting to temperatures of 1,500 C+ is that there are all kinds of carbon intensive commercial & industrial processes that depend on that kind of heat. Currently they are mainly powered by an assortment of dirty energy sources burned in massive furnaces. That not only is very unfriendly from an environmental perspective... it is also expensive. This means that HelioGen has the ability to offer existing businesses (steel smelting, cement curing, a whole bunch of other stuff) a zero carbon, low cost alternative. Between the cost advantage and the zero carbon energy source it is a no brainer. So anyone who is thinking about HelioGen in terms of solar power is missing a lot of the potential (reminds me of people that say Tesla is just an auto manufacturer)\n5. The ***REALLY SUPER DUPER*** interesting thing about HelioGen's tech is that they are already talking about 1,800 degrees C and they are just getting started. A funny thing happens when you expose regular water to 2,000 degrees C heat... it splits into **hydrogen** and oxygen. Which means HelioGen's tech will allow them to start offering zero carbon Hydrogen production for use in commercial shipping, airplanes, long distance trucking, etc. etc. pretty much anything we accomplish by burning oil / natural gas today could in theory be replaced with hydrogen. The big thing holding hydrogen back is that at this moment the only commercially viable technologies for getting hydrogen involves extremely inefficient methods (like running huge amounts of electricity through the water).\n\n**The investing thesis:**\n\nThis company reminds me an awful lot of Tesla in the early days in that it is a disrupter with the potential to transform several major industries. Even their vertical integration (making their own mirrors) reminds me of the approach Tesla has taken.  And just like with Tesla there is a nice path of stepping stones laid out.\n\n1. They can start producing clean electricity (and are under contract to do so) on site for various commercial and industrial operations. The fact that they need a much smaller footprint and the extremely high temperatures make 24/7 power generation feasible are going to be big selling points.\n2. As they start to scale up production and refine their product their temperatures they achieve will increase. This means that they can start going to concrete manufacturers and steel plants with an offer to cut their expenses (no more paying for loads of electricity or fuel to achieve the necessary heat) and these companies get to incidentally achieve their carbon emission reduction targets. It is a no brainer and there are A LOT of industries that fall into this bucket.\n3. As advancements continue to scale and the vertical integration keeps the cost / efficiency in line there will be an opportunity to become a large volume hydrogen supplier which will be an absolute profit machine as almost all applications that require energy over long distance (trucking, trains, air planes, boats, etc.) will find that the use cases which batteries fail to satisfy can be handled by hydrogen (which will suddenly be available at competitive rates).\n\nI'm getting in long in equity. I don't expect this thing to really take off till they hit their stride in heliostat production (2025) and have demonstrated the higher temperatures at commercial scale (2025 seems like a fine target for this as well although I'm guessing).\n\nLet me know what you think WSB. I may be dumb but I've got the confidence of an idiot!\n\nCurrent position 3/1/2022\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xspeg9miduk81.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a7cc9b0906e3977abf97275b71026d2c57dee2", "id": "t4incy", "created_utc": 1646169541.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|49|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nl2mkg/first_real_post_on_wsb_found_a_walking_zombie_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlsd4t/vsat_probably_gonna_get_owned/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlscd2/first_real_post_on_wsb_found_a_walking_zombie_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlsu85/first_real_post_on_wsb_found_a_walking_zombie_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlslyr/first_real_post_on_wsb_found_a_walking_zombie_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrmsf3/due_diligence_on_ge_a_bull_thesis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlssjw/first_real_post_on_wsb_found_a_walking_zombie_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmkhyz/ge_a_bull_thesis_f_off_haters_imma_go_to_the_moon/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlsi5y/first_real_post_on_wsb_found_a_walking_zombie_and/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t4incy)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t4incy)\n    \nHey /u/RugbyDov, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Please see linked image for position.
