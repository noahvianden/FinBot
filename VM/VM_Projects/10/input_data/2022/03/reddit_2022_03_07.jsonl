{"title": "Europe: Stagflation incoming?", "selftext": "Well, the FTSE and DAX are dropping again today. Why? Well, we've got talks of banning Russian oil imports, possibly Russian gas imports, too. Guess who Europe is depending on for a big part of its oil and gas supply? \"Russia is the origin of 26% of the EU's oil imports and 40% of the EU's gas imports.\" ([https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/russia/index\\_en.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/russia/index_en.htm)). Plus, Russia and Ukraine make up a big part of the world's supply of wheat (check the price action there, too, looks like freaking WHEAT futures have been outperforming the SPX and NDX for the last year even before the war spike).\n\nLong story short, hang on for dear life, fellow Europeans, we are very likely headed for a stagflation situation (economic stagnation coupled with high inflation). Gold and silver may actually perform well in 2022 with all this happening, but obviously oil was the big winning bet if you bought it at any time between the last 6 months and last week. \n\nI don't know what's the outlook for stocks. I think that the FTSE and all other European indices are pretty undervalued so I don't see them dropping as much as US stocks, but at the same time Europe will be much, much more affected by the war in Ukraine than the US. It does feel like this is a good time to stock up on... stocks. I'm personally playing it safe and going for broad indexes because I think a lot of struggling companies may go bankrupt from the inflation and interest power combo. There are a LOT of zombie companies in the UK and US ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zombies.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zombies.asp)). In the UK, we've already started seeing energy companies go belly up over the last couple of months because of gas prices although interestingly enough, the number of company liquidations in England and Wales haven't gone up that much ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/310406/uk-insolvencies-total-number-of-company-liquidations/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/310406/uk-insolvencies-total-number-of-company-liquidations/)) nor have they gone up in the US ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/bankruptcies](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/bankruptcies)). Still, I think that the rate hike in 10 days time will: 1) shake the markets; 2) make a lot of businesses think twice about how they'll be able to keep going on in their business. If we see rates going up to 1.5% over the next 12-24 months AND we keep seeing high inflation, a lot of companies will go bye-bye. \n\nIn terms of specific companies / industries to pick, I am currently going for:\n\n* consumer defensive companies: solid earnings and manageable debt plus a good dividend will keep me sane (hopefully)\n* REITs: I'm trying to profit from house prices (by the looks of it, I won't be getting a house myself soon so gotta get the next best thing!).\n\nOtherwise, I am continuing to buy my global stock market indexes and global tech indexes along with FTSE indexes, the iShares Europe fund and, obviously, gold.\n\nHow are you positioning for the markets?

{"title": "Some thoughts on proactive hedging.", "selftext": "Almost all efficient hedging is done proactively and almost all inefficient hedging is done reactively.  Most people do not think about risk before it's obvious and then panic hedge when it's obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many different ways to prove that people become interested in hedging mostly when it's too late. A simple one is to look up Google trends for SPY puts (Or look for high and low points in the charts and then look for posts in forums from those dates).  Bearish sentiment always spikes into lows. Bearish risk always comes off complacency.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez3anag9fxl81.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1b3f306f1bc6323e64f1c2dbdc91af2251875e\n\nLet's  look at some of the things we see high in all market crashes and see what we can infer from these things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Big Wick Candles\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee these in the first third of all major crashes.  They're always what comes early before the \"Crash\" (Fast and steady move) starts.  What are wicked candles telling us? That the market broke the previous low and then went immediately into a rally.  When a market is setting up a crash, there will be breaks of the previous lows and then fast rallies. [These rallies are quite predictable.](https://www.reddit.com/user/boomerdoomer22/comments/t07zyc/big_rally_like_now_but_4400_4500_bear_risk/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdor8fyjhxl81.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=6477dc17a06459d6ce82217f18ea1130a6cca6b8\n\nObvious in today's chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3lz1c3wpsxl81.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=69405b9aaddfdc48e55160fd46f7b65be06e82e3\n\n# Rallies end inside of last high\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's the nature of a trend, and in a developing crash we're talking about a downtrend. The rallies will fail to make a high higher than the last big rally. What the market previously considered cheap it later considered expensive and this happening consistently is warning that the important players in the market have changed what they are doing.\n\nThese rallies usually match up with fib retracement levels and these are ideal to use to structure points  at which we'd like to hedge into a rising market.  They will also often come in around the levels Elliot wave theory would suggest retracement should end but this is a broader and more complex topic.\n\nResearch points:\n\n[Fib retracements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp)\n\n[Sucker rallies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sucker-rally.asp)\n\n[Elliot wave](https://www.elliottwave.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t3tdqndixl81.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=b498732af432a29b49850d3635bc3b1ad0e10811\n\nObvious in today's chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jox1fp5rsxl81.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=b63514c1791e063b9f52e32cbdaa6a927a6cc276\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bullish Trend Continuation Failure\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther concepts brought to us from fibs and Elliot wave tell us that bulls should defend the 76/78% fib retracement levels while an uptrend is healthy. The breaking of these levels is always one of the first strong warnings the market may be setting up to crash and starting to head into the lower highs part of the move that comes before the capitulation part of the move.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q36lg1urjxl81.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=b95291dfb717ce67d8148ee1d4044e2e482c970a\n\nNotice the market rallies immediately after breaking these levels. This triggers a proactive hedging plan into the rally but most people will have panic hedged into the break and by the time the bear move is setting up they're getting squeezed out of their hedges and reluctant to enter new ones. Often they'll end new hedge into a the next low and repeat the process.\n\nSPX has what may turn out to be a trend failure event when it went through the 4200 level.\n\nObvious in today's chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3br2p9lmkxl81.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c5a5295d22f32bf980906f5e074954ad3bec07c\n\nI went long on the level where [bulls usually defend the trend](https://www.reddit.com/user/boomerdoomer22/comments/szuf5y/got_my_full_long_positions_back_on_today/) but then switched to a plan to wait for a [rally and look for short positions](https://www.reddit.com/user/boomerdoomer22/comments/t07zyc/big_rally_like_now_but_4400_4500_bear_risk/) once this level had failed. The failure of a 76/78% fib level is a strong warning a trend is ending. You should be able to find other instances of people talking about this - I will not be the only one to  have made this observation (And by no means the first to make it).\n\nThis level has a strong historical track record of holding the low when we're in an uptrend, even in the face of big news. Here's March into April of 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex9gmy1flxl81.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=e98d7a1b46b7056c0476bfd04ffa0d8b96c11a30\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Defining Hedging Zones\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost all decisions made in the moment in the market are bad ones. I can only speak for myself and people I've had interactions with along with my observations of the general public - but I think this is a broad rule. Most impulsive decisions are bad ones. While the market is in a trend following the trend will forgive bad decisions, but that does not make the decision good.\n\nBy removing emotion from the trade plan you ... well, have a trade plan. The only three ways I know to remove emotion in fast markets are to be a psychopath (A useful trait for a trader, avoids emotional swings). Be a super-human (Always nice) and to have a plan which you're committed to executing against. I think the planning route is most suitable for most people.\n\nA well structured trade plan is \"If > Then\" based. If this happens, I'll do this. Just like a computer code works.  There are triggers and responses.  Any \"Unless\" conditions are written into the trade plan and you do not whimsically change the plan based upon new information. It should be understood and accepted 90% of people do not make good real time decisions.\n\nVery few people say, \"Everyone times the market really well, they just have to be looking\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ideal Hedge Zones and Emergency Hedge Zones\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdeally it's best to hedge into a rally. If you remove emotion from the equation this is an obvious point. Any decisions you can make at better prices are preferable to ones you can make at worse prices (Caveats for specific types of breakout strategies with their own rules set, which I am sure some people have and do well with).\n\nI always like to define a zone in which I will hedge into the rally and a zone in which I will flip immediately to bearish if we break under there. The breakout and retest one is the easiest to explain because it's not loaded with so many subjective rules. It's simple - If low breaks > Then I will short retest of low > Stop will be above last high.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzvb2puvnxl81.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=944b8ec0bab84cd347f057635cb9ffa9aa71ff60\n\nIdeal hedges into rallies usually utilize concepts from fibs and Elliot.  How easily this is understood in real time depends upon the amount of experience and testing you have using these methods. In the current instance with SPX the implied hedge zone is 4400 - 4500. This is the standard fib retracement zones.  This is how I defined where I'd [become a bear again while we were close to 4100.](https://www.reddit.com/user/boomerdoomer22/comments/t07zyc/big_rally_like_now_but_4400_4500_bear_risk/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0kaeiqkoxl81.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ff0c89ae0de47c7f89b46b27839f974e811581b\n\nI see a lot of talk of ways to hedge positions into the open today - but if the market plays to the norms it often does there's going to be a rally heading to somewhere in the 4450 - 4580 zone and that is where the more apt hedging spot would be. Those who hedge into current prices often get squeezed out on the break of a recent high and do not hedge into the drop itself when it comes (Discussed above).\n\nIn an idealised bear the move, **the market is going to rally strong soon and this will set up the bear drop. The ideal hedging area is 4450 - 4480** (If any of those guys and girls who wrote all the books has any sort of idea what they were talking about and if the market acts now as it has in the past, this is where the hedge comes).\n\nAn emergency hedge would come upon the breaking and retest of 4100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Not Knowing the Future\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA common retort to putting forward hedging plans is to point out the person suggesting the plans does not know the future. Usually the person in question knows that - but without knowing the future you can look at every instance of a large market crash and look to see if there are any clearly defined norms of the move.\n\nWe can define things that would happen if the market was in a downtrend and things that would happen to tell us the market has broken the downtrend. If we're heading into a downtrend, we'd still be *really high* in the move.  Somewhere akin to the highlighted section in the tops shown in 1999 and 2007.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nxqh0f1mpxl81.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=4998f5acf1d7eb466e32d1f57a661d02b8d0e4c9\n\nThe important points are -\n\nWhen fresh lows are made, often the market rallies after.\n\nRallies will not make new highs.\n\nWhen a low is broken for a second time, much riskier for a sell-off.\n\nRallies will not make new highs.\n\nRallies will not make new highs.\n\nRallies will not make new highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point \"Rallies will not make new highs\" is worth repeating because it gives you a very easy stop loss condition. One that is very risk effective if you are taking hedging trades into the 76/78 fibs. The market has retraced 3/4 of the the last fall. If it goes 1/4 more up, you're out of the hedge and this does not cost a lot. These no need to \"Know the future\" - the maths are elementary.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7sntwbuqxl81.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=2119ab19c396f20e8c4af6edf892646f4bfac3f7", "id": "t8lyu2", "created_utc": 1646647492.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Would u please give a basic example of call and puts one must sell based on these charts.\n\nNote: not trying to copy trades as i do not know how to hedge via options.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "With the emergency break level I think the better choice is to short common stock in the underlying to remove delta risk.

In other words, both the long put and the call credit spread are bearish, whereas in an iron condor the put credit spread is bullish.
