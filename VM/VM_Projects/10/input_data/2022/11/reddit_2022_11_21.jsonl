{"title": "Buffet trades positions - BYD for TSMC. Is it really at a buying point?", "selftext": "**Buffet's latest position.**\n\nBerkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares.\n\n**But why now?**\n\nWarren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet.\n\n**What about Taiwan-China crisis?**\n\nOne of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company.\n\n**Buffet trims 20% BYD for TSMC - What does it mean for the semiconductor industry?**\n\n20% of Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nMy take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.\n\n*I'm not a financial analyst, and this is not a recommendation.*\n\n**Adding** [my portfolio](https://www.jika.io/u/Crowman) **performance** just to give you a sense of my investment style\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3daibeirbb1a1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3f8696481c6e19a7934896ecf94bf5719574ec0", "id": "z102te", "created_utc": 1669040232.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z102te)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z102te)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Thanks for the analysis.

{"title": "11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "That was probably one of the worst days to trade that I have seen in months. The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable. The pretty extreme low volume (we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year) made for even harder trading today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im8lk7kgpd1a1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=27eb2cdf258092943a5701d05f273649aec1cdf1\n\nThis is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. \n\nSo we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. \n\nThis next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. \n\nWednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfrxzj5hpd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=191381b89207ff63d8075f2910dae56ddf47af39\n\nLast week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. \n\nThe bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. \n\nWe closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. \n\nThe issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. \n\nBears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. \n\nKey support- 394.7 -> 390.1\n\nKey resistance-398.5 -> 401.3 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/feysfrohpd1a1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=97068f6a4b52222fe178cb484f3dc4dbead51708\n\nFutures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4woaa4ipd1a1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=56818a1864ada48fd356d989717ecd5cbe37bdb6\n\nI removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4dh1vnipd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7488b50427a19e5bfa3253f3bf0b131cbce538fb\n\nOut of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. \n\nBack to futures now.   \n key support- 3960 -> 3925 -> 3910  \n key resistance- 4000 -> 4028\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0sb8hq6jpd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=72da651ab80b0384fc70caa16103d40007d66d2f\n\nZooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy86mnojpd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5225f763631b55f413c3dd6bc3e2cb95122ac2fe\n\nNow looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. \n\nInterestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. \n\nThis is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \n\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \n\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \n \n\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \n \n\nso what does this tell us? \n\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \n\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \n\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6ebxazkpd1a1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a2eda88760c96bf81025455f1a886dc4b406f7\n\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \n\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \n\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \n\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpi4leflpd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f9b70d177ac87572352e1dbb896d87c7b3dee7a\n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddjqa6ylpd1a1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c9c19c0d6b703e697bb85085b2781da8363bacf\n\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \n\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \n\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \n\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \n\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \n\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \n\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!  \n \n\nYoutube will be up later!  \n \n\nReminder I will NOT be trading tomorrow so no pre-market tomorrow morning and I wont be trading at all tomorrow… busy day with the kids and some other appointments.", "id": "z1c41u", "created_utc": 1669069024.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I keep on saying this regarding Tesla.
