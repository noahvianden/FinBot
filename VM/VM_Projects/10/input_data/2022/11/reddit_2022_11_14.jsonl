This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. \n\nWith this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside. \n\nKey support- 393.1 -> 390.1 (key level support) \n\nKey resistance- 398.6 -> 402\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6llij7zhzz91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7646a43193bf7f584230ac459422274c4c8ad4\n\nIdentical pattern on futures right now too… we actually came close enough on Futures to the daily 200ema to call that a daily 200ema rejection and again with these gravestone doji candles I expect this to be the local top and to see a back test of some stronger support levels like 390/ 3905 before we have a fighting chance of continuing up. \n\nSupport- 3925 -> 3905 -> 3863\n\nResistance- 4028 -> 4060\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf8z54qzhzz91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b89ec1b050ba73a72566ac9e698b33028a9039\n\nApple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly. As I had mentioned last week this 100/200ema interaction on Apple is going to take some time and would be more then shock to shoot straight through. However, we could hard reject and retrace instead. \n\nSupport- 146.9 -> 145 -> 141.3\n\nResistance- 149 -> 150.5 -> 153.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxofrf90izz91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b84229e654c53caf7882551a52e055dbe3bbe34\n\nTesla attempted once again to break out over its daily ema and break out of this falling wedge on the daily however was once again unsuccessful. I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week. However, if we can hold support and finally take out the daily 8ema and 196.1 then we can look for the gap fill and possibly a bigger push towards 208.8 resistance. \n\nSupport- 185.9 -> 177.4\n\nResistance- 196.1 -> 201.9 -> 204.9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1cisj53izz91.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=b66d7014dbb362bb7d58c91206c55fbca48e464a\n\nLots of movement on the VIX today. Had a nice 6% green open that led to a hard sell off under that key 23.5 range. However, still not exactly sure what caused it but EOD we had a pretty big spike of the VIX that put it back over 23.5 and caused it to close its biggest green day since October 6th. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1lomof1izz91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=95d2dc18f9a6734e0642d1765bc90716a99c2c47\n\nNot a bad day today.

I obviously I had that crazy 600%/$30k win last week but that was playing a CPI play… strictly day trading today was the best day I have put in in a very long time both with profits, win rate, and consistency. Felt great for sure and I know a lot of other did just a great today! \n\nNO YOUTUBE TONIGHT!", "id": "yvd5de", "created_utc": 1668461157.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3635|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxvyrg/52522_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w5k3q1/the_only_fomc_week_ta_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxkm5u/71222_spy_es_futures_daily_ta_and_cpi_swing_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yvd5de)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yvd5de)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: SPY- Bearish close today. Black bull channel has a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow.
