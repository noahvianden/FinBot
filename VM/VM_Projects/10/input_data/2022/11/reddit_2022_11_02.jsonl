{"title": "Macroscope | The Fed meeting preview: 4th 75bps rate-hike is on the way, is pivot coming next?", "selftext": "The Fed's two-day November meeting will end on Wednesday, and the market has well expected its fourth consecutive aggressive 75 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a 75 basis point rate hike has reached as high as 85.5%, which would raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since 2008.\n\nHowever, given the recent signals released by the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes, the market is likely to be more concerned about further signals from the Fed after the rate meeting on plans for a December rate hike and the direction of monetary policy next year. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been vocal about the need to slow the pace of interest rate hikes at some point since July, and analysts believe he may also reiterate that point at this meeting. Additionally, a report by the \"New Fed Wire\" last week about the possibility of a slowdown in the Fed's aggressive policy in December continued to gather steam, with medium and long-term US bond yields topping out after hitting yearly highs.\n\nBloomberg economists said what is less certain is how Powell will communicate a potential future downshift in the rate-hike pace -- the degree of conviction, the risks around hike sizing, and implications for the terminal rate. Economists expect Powell to use 50 basis points present a 50-basis-point move as the base case and clarify that a downshift in the pace of rate hikes does not necessarily mean a lower terminal rate.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Fed‚Äôs November meeting is also just less than a week before the US mid-term elections. Undoubtedly, how to deal with the Republicans on the high-rise inflation and the risk of recession will become a major problem for Biden. And just last week, two Democratic senators urged Powell not to cause unnecessary pain by over-raising interest rates.\n\nIt has been said that there are now major divergences within the Fed on monetary policy. For example, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley thinks the Fed should start discussions on slowing down rate hikes to avoid sending the economy into an \"unforced slump\". But Kansas Fed President Esther George believes that monetary policy needs to move into a restrictive range, and the strength remains to be watched. Given the recent volatility in the financial markets and the time it takes for interest rate hikes to affect the economy, the Fed cannot act too hastily.\n\nThere are also a few views that do not favour a pivot. Fed governor Michelle Bowman hopes to look for signs of falling inflation before slowing down the rate hike. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he hopes to raise the policy rate to a level that would put meaningful downward pressure on inflation.\n\nTherefore, for this meeting, FOMC members are expected to engage in a heated debate on how to steer interest rates to avoid a troubled economy.\n\n‚ÄúThey may want to go slower just in the interest of financial stability,‚Äù said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge for messaging because they don‚Äôt want to ease financial conditions significantly. They need tight financial conditions to keep cooling the economy off. So he (Powell) doesn‚Äôt want to sound dovish, but he may want to go slower.‚Äù\n\nSome institutions took a relatively cautious view. Nomura believes that the FOMC does not yet seem to have a consensus on the preferred size of a December rate hike, which will limit Powell's ability to provide guidance. The Fed chairman will reiterate that future policy will depend on economic data, including the two non-farm payrolls reports and, most importantly, the latest inflation data. Barclays also released a report saying that the Fed may leave its December policy options open, pending more information on inflation and tightening risks.\n\nThe [J.P. Morgan](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-JPM/) team, on the other hand, made relatively ‚Äúaccurate ‚Äúpredictions on the outcome of this meeting. Analysts believe the most likely scenario going to happen is a 75 basis point rate hike and a hawkish press release, which could allow Powell to retain selectivity for December and next year meetings, while highlighting the current risks of higher inflation. In this scenario, S&P 500 may float between down 1% to up 0.5%. And if the Fed provides clear guidance for the December meeting, this is likely to be seen as dovish and S&P 500 could rise by 2.5%-3%.\n\nIn addition, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also tweeted recently, saying that the ‚Äúgrowing chorus‚Äù for the Fed to pause interest rate hikes very soon is ‚Äúbadly misguided.‚Äù In his view, the Fed should stick to its current course and not pause too soon, especially given that it has a history of ‚Äúpast errors‚Äù.\n\nAside from rate hikes, let's not forget the glooming recession hanging over the US. Concerns were fuelled last week by the inversion in the 3-month/10-year US bond yields. Prior to this, the 2/10-year US bond inversion had been going on for almost five months. Given the historically extremely high success rate of both yield curves in predicting crisis, there is growing concern about how the Federal Reserve will respond to outside concerns about the economy.\n\nNotably, Jerome Powell had said in the press conference after the September meeting that the goal of fighting inflation had not changed and would be maintained until the task completed, and the federal funds rate would need to be kept at a restrictive level for a certain time. But the FOMC had already revised down the US economic growth rate to 0.2% this year.\n\nIt is worth noting that while consumers, the engine of the US economy, are still maintaining spending in the face of inflationary pressures, danger signals are beginning to reveal. The US Department of Commerce said last week that consumer spending growth slowed to a near two-year low of 1.4% from 2.0% in the previous quarter, and consumer purchasing power continues to retreat at a 3% rate and US families are gradually running out of federal financial subsidies in the COVID pandemic.", "id": "yk3wmu", "created_utc": 1667392067.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yk3wmu)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yk3wmu)\n    \n>TL;DR: The FOMC is expected to increase interest rates by another 75 basis points at its November meeting, but the overall tone of the policy statement may be more cautious.

{"title": "Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.\n\nIn a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.\n\nThe move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.\n\nAlong with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a ‚Äústep-down‚Äù in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.\n\nThat language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.\n\nThis week‚Äôs statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that ‚Äúongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.‚Äú\n\nThe new language read: ‚ÄúThe Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.‚Äú\n\nThe statement reiterated that policy changes ‚Äúwill take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.‚Äú\n\nMarkets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.\n\nAlong with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as ‚Äúmodest‚Äù and noted that ‚Äújob gains have been robust in recent months‚Äù while inflation is ‚Äúelevated.‚Äù The statement also reiterated language that the committee is ‚Äúhighly attentive to inflation risks.‚Äú\n\nThe rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.\n\nConcerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago ‚Äì 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.\n\nOn Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn‚Äôt as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.\n\nThere is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.\n\nCurrent market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.\n\nThe fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html)", "id": "ykcice", "created_utc": 1667412764.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|413|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|94|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ykcice)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ykcice)\n    \n>TL;DR: Fed makes usual rate hike.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">The Fed's latest rate hike is yet another example of their complete lack of understanding about how the economy actually works.

I'm overall still bearish for the time being. \n\nThe rate hike that I initially anticipated would be 75 bps for December. It's looking highly more likely that'll it'll be 50 bps. That said, it's looking way more likely that Feb will be 50 bps increase as well in 2023 and will hold it there. That'll push it towards the 4.75%-5% range.\n\nThat said, if economic data doesn't improve halfway through this month going past December, I'm thinking they'll keep pushing rates into Q2 2023 most likely in 25 bps range pushing it over the 5% Fed fund rate point. \n\nPlan your strategies accordingly and expect a bumpy ride. This latest messaging was less clear with mixed economic data coming. \n\nTL;DR: Swing trade until mid December data. Expect new bottoms to form some time over the next couple months and then hit capitulation in Q1 2023. Will most likely go sideways for most of 2023 with solid recovery going into Q4.", "id": "ykj8cn", "created_utc": 1667426846.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|25|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|697|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ykj8cn)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ykj8cn)\n    \n>TL;DR: The Fed is looking likely to raise rates in December and February, but the exact amount is still up in the air.
