Do you agree?", "selftext": " \n\n* A strong showing from Republicans in the midterm elections could spark a rally in energy stocks, CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said Monday.\n* Cramer said oilfield services firms like Halliburton and SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, should be among the industry‚Äôs best performers in that scenario.\n\nJim Cramer said he anticipates a near-term rally in energy stocks if Republican candidates perform well in Tuesday‚Äôs midterm elections and win a majority in at least one chamber of Congress.\n\nOil and gas companies should be among the ‚Äúbiggest winners‚Äù if that were to happen, Cramer said Monday night. He said shares of oilfield services firms ‚Äî such as Halliburton and [SLB](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SLB/), formerly known as Schlumberger ‚Äî should be standouts in that scenario. Cramer‚Äôs Charitable Trust owns shares of Halliburton.\n\n‚ÄúNext up would be the oil and gas producers ... that need more pipelines to bring their product to market,‚Äù Cramer added.\n\nOutside of the energy sector, Cramer said Wall Street would likely interpret a strong Republican showing Tuesday as favorable for financials.\n\n‚ÄúThe Biden administration is considered incredibly anti-bank, so you might want to buy the majors: JPMorgan, Bank of America, or [Wells Fargo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WFC/), the latter being a big position in the charitable trust,‚Äù he said.\n\nTo be sure, Cramer cautioned that the market‚Äôs reaction Wednesday to the election results depends on what happens in Tuesday‚Äôs trading session. On Monday, all three major U.S. stock indexes finished solidly higher ‚Äî a move Cramer suggested was ‚Äúa kneejerk presumption that a Republican victory \\[Tuesday night\\] will definitely lead to higher stock prices.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf the market keeps running \\[Tuesday\\] in anticipation of a Republican sweep, you need to be aware that we‚Äôve already had a big move,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand that may be all we‚Äôre entitled to for now.‚Äù\n\nCramer said unless interest rates move lower or outlooks for corporate earnings improve, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot that stays the same even when Congress changes hands.‚Äù\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/cramer-strong-gop-showing-in-midterm-elections-likely-good-for-energy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/cramer-strong-gop-showing-in-midterm-elections-likely-good-for-energy.html)", "id": "ypr3l7", "created_utc": 1667924651.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Inverse Cramer says to go short on energy then.", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey you know how energy is up like 300% since last year?

It also projected year-on-year global GDP will rise just 2.1% in 2023 ‚Äî which would be the third-lowest expansion in the past three decades.\n\n\"Our forecast approaches something akin to a 'global recession',\" a UBS team led by chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note to clients.\n\n\"For the US, we now expect near zero growth in both 2023 and 2024, and a recession to start in 2023,\" they added.\n\nThat economic slump would likely lead to a period of disinflation, they said. Given the US central bank has increased interest rates rapidly to try to tame inflation running at 40-year highs, that would give policymakers scope to switch to cutting rates to stimulate economic growth.\n\n\"Combined with inflation falling rapidly, the Fed would cut the federal funds rate down to 1.25% by early 2024,\" the strategists said. The rate is currently at 3.75%.\n\n\"The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,\" they added.\n\nExpectations of a Fed pivot could lift the S&P 500 to 3,900 points ‚Äî a 2.4% gain from its close Monday ‚Äì by the end of 2023, according to UBS.\n\nThe bank also predicted that future rate cuts will lead to 10-year US Treasury yields slipping 155 basis points to 2.65% and the dollar slowly falling the ten most heavily-traded currencies as well as gold.\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-crash-downturn-bear-disinflation-interest-rates-ubs-2022-11](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-crash-downturn-bear-disinflation-interest-rates-ubs-2022-11)\n\nUBS says the S&P 500 could plunge another 16% and won't bottom until the Fed starts to cut interest rates and says The S&P 500 will fall to 3,200 points before it hits a low in Q2 next year.
