{"title": "How Congress and corporations can help stop inflation", "selftext": " \n\nAmericans look to the country's most powerful bank, the Federal Reserve, to combat inflation.\n\n\"I think our biggest problem, at least for the foreseeable future, is high inflation,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNBC.\n\nThe Fed can raise interest rates to slow inflation, which ultimately makes the cost of borrowing higher for everyday Americans, and that can be just as painful as inflation.\n\n\"The big question mark is how quickly will inflation come under control?\" Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNBC.\n\nThe central bank already raised interest rates five times in 2022, and there are more rate hikes on the way.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve does not have to take on the battle alone.\n\nFiscal policy enacted by Congress and power wielded by big business can help fight rising costs.\n\n\"Congress has much more targeted tools,\" Claudia Sahm, former Fed economist, told CNBC. \"It's about making the system work more effectively, so all these costs don't get piled up on individuals.\"\n\nFor example, the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act. This $739 billion sweeping tax, health and climate bill aims to reshape the U.S. economy.\n\n\"Taxpayers eventually have to pay for them, but they can release a lot of pressure on families and businesses that are trying to pay the bills,\" Sahm said.\n\nThen there's the private sector's power. As people started expecting higher prices, some are arguing that companies are taking advantage of expectations and increasing prices even further than is necessary.\n\nAccording to the New York Fed, the more inflation an industry saw, the more gross profits increased.\n\nNow, most U.S. companies are recording their largest profits since 1950, at least over the last [two quarters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-30/fattest-profits-since-1950-debunk-inflation-story-spun-by-ceos), according to [OMFIF](https://www.omfif.org/2022/06/corporate-us-making-consumers-pay-for-inflation/).", "id": "yj6m09", "created_utc": 1667303354.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Firstly, their earnings missed expectations and secondly, their guidance for the next quarter was below analyst estimates. This combination of factors has led to investors selling off the stock in droves.\n\nAnother reason why Google may be under pressure today is because of regulatory concerns. The European Union recently fined them €2.42 billion ($2.7 billion) for antitrust violations related to their online search business. This fine could set a precedent for other cases against Google around the world, which could lead to more regulation and higher costs for the company down the line", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for being the only non troll here and the only non incel and for giving a logical explanation.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Because Even though mommy said not too, you still touch yourself down there 👇", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Because you touch yourself during the day ☀️", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "You’re not wrong.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Because you touch yourself at night 🌙", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "Because you touch yourself in your sleep 😴", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "You’re not tough at all", "score": -4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "because you touch yourself all the time", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Cause they gotta get some liquidity for their meme stocks?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Probably not wrong lol", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Advertising $$$ got hit and in the future the outlook slows due to a recession in the wind.

A large price movement occurs at this time , this movement creates a fair gap value , as Powell starts to speak at 2:30 ET a counter move starts to test price movement created at release of hike announcement occurs. This can easily 2x-4x your 0 dte SPY option if it goes well if it doesn’t you lose 100% of your initial gamble I mean investment. This same pattern has occurred for the last two years . It doesn’t guarantee that it will happen again. Risky scalp with large potential for profit/losses. Just to reiterate if price has a large move up at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy puts, if price has a large move down at 2 pm ET than just before 2:30 ET buy calls . This strategy has become rather popular in discord channels/twitter.
