It's been frustrating watching it go sideways or down even though they more than doubled their expected earnings last quarter. I'll list my thoughts individually so someone can poke holes in my thinking if they are so inclined.  \n1) Positive: There is a 5 million home deficit right now, which is predicted to take many years to catch up to.  \n2) Positive: Millennials are the largest demographic in the US and they are technically poised to purchase their first or second homes within the next 10 years. Gen Z isn't as large but the older end of the spectrum should be buying their first homes soon.  \n3) Positive: Wildfires and hurricanes seem routine at this point. That should contribute reliable demand in the form to rebuilds and repairs. Maybe I'm wrong about this and the add on is trivial.  \n4) Positive: I know PE isn't everything, but is it nothing? If earnings for next 3 quarters actually fell a buck a share vs Q1 it would still put this stock at just 5.3x 2022 earnings.  \n5) Positive: Management seems to be laser focused on the shareholder. I believe buybacks topped a billion last year, and half a billion so far in 2022. I've only read positive things about management's reputation, but for all I know they wrote those articles themselves.  \n6) Neutral: Are the baby boomers entering retirement + death a big deal? Are their houses set to flood the market as they pass on or transfer to nursing homes? I haven't heard much about this factor.  \n7) Negative: Mortgage rates have gone up and will continue to do so. The people I know who have built recently or are in the process of building didn't seem to take rising interest rate too seriously when I brought them up. They were shocked by the labor and supply costs though. I guess I haven't taken rising interest rates as seriously as the market does. Are there some folks who believe 9%+ rates within the next 2 years is probable? At that point I will admit to being completely out of my depth trying to guess what that could mean for builds.  \n8) Negative: A general recession would certainly hit demand.

{"title": "Learning from the Past: Money Supply and Inflation Fluctuations", "selftext": "In the 1960s, Milton Friedman declared that inflation is \"always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon ‚Äî in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.‚Äù Simply put, **inflation is a problem of printing too much money (although a lot of today's inflation is also a result of supply chain issues).**\n\nHe's probably rolling over in his grave if he knew about the current 'FREE MONEY' atmosphere driven by fiscal and monetary policy today.\n\n**The Great Inflation 1965-1982**\n\nInflation went from 1.0% to 14.0%+ in the early 1980s before falling to \\~3.5% near the end of the decade. There is much debate on the causes, but anyone with half a brain would know that it was mainly driven by growth in the supply of money (and we know who did it - Federal Reserve: Arthur F. Burns '70-'78, G. William Miller '78-'79, all of Congress) It doesn't end there, after the Great Depression and conclusion of WWII, there was a shift towards government control focused on promoting max employment, production, and purchasing power.\n\n*\\*A. William Phillips enters the chat\\**\n\nPolicymakers subscribed to the Phillips Curve, the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate inflation. This was an attractive policy that was easily translated to lower unemployment could be exchanged for moderate levels of higher inflation. Unfortunately, the troglodytes in our government didn't understand that in a low unemployment environment, participants would learn to expect higher inflation which would gradually shift the Phillips Curve higher, eventually inflation would spiral out of control. \"A False Bargain\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7bf4stcnv0491.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3e414520244ff9df9bc5fd81724beab35cc377\n\nThere was a number of other events and systems that collapsed all leading to higher inflation. Assuming 95% of you would stop reading if I went into all of the details, I'm listing the other factors that contributed to higher inflation in the past. This will HELP you understand the differences and get an idea of where we're headed today (shocking)\n\n* Bretton Woods System / Gold Standard - US now the world's currency; system of payments based on the dollar, which defined all currencies in relation to the dollar.\n* Government Spending! BRRRR - social initiatives, full-employment mandates even-keel policies, fiscal imbalances were created\n* Energy Crisis - oil costs skyrocketed, Arab Oil Embargo (1973), Iranian Revolution (1979)\n* Demand-Pull - macro/monetary policy to promote demand, supply chain issues creating a cost-push into production and retail prices\n* Forecasts/Estimates - Economists and Policymakers were UNDERestimating the inflationary outcome from their policies\n\nThe PUBLIC knew that inflation was a part of monetary policy, but somehow the government didn't have a clue. Sound familiar?\n\n*\\*Paul Volcker enters the chat\\**\n\nThe man, the myth, the absolute unit - Paul Volcker (from NY), shows up while inflation is at 11.0% and unemployment at 6.0%. In October '79, the FOMC begins to target reserves growth rather than fed funds rate to battle inflation. The control of the money supply over time produced a 'slowing' in inflation, but that wasn't going to do it chief (Monetary Control Act of 1980). Volcker wasn't here to mess around, he continued to march on raising rates and slowing reserve growth. This dude raised short term rates to nearly 20.0%.. WHAT the !@#%?\n\n**The Economy enters a recession in July 1981**\n\nUnemployment rises to \\~11.0% and by recession end, inflation was under 5.0%. The FED's commitment to low inflation was (eventually) praised by the public and unemployment began to come back down while the US entered a period of stability and growth. The Great Inflation was 'over' until....\n\n*\\*Jerome Powell enters the chat\\**\n\n* BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR March 2020 - December 2021 (inflation goes higher)\n* December 2021 - March 2022: Tapers the $120bn / month quantitative easing programs (inflation goes higher)\n* Ukraine/Russian War - Energy/Oil spikes $100+ barrel\n* March '22: First 0.25% rate hike (inflation goes higher)\n* May '22: 0.50% rate hike (inflation goes higher)\n* June 1st '22: Quantitative tightening program of $95bn/month (inflation goes... higher *probably*)\n* June '22: Oil at $118+ barrel\n* June FOMC '22: 0.50% rate hike (inflation goes... higher *probably*)\n* July FOMC '22: 0.50% rate hike (inflation goes... higher *probably*)\n\nMy point is, **the FED has printed $5.2 TRILLION DOLLARS SINCE 2019**\n\n*All of that money has circulated into assets, and now the FED is undoing that whole process.*\n\nWe're sitting at 0.75-1.00% fed funds target rate today, Volcker raised rates well over 10.0%+ to combat inflation. I don't think we're going to make it that high, but JPOW and the government have made it VERY clear that they'll continue down this path and that means only one thing, the money printer is now a money vacuum.\n\nConclusion: Valuations and asset prices will come down and it all depends on how long the FED continues their tightening policies. If for whatever reason, they decide to reverse course or begin slowing the pace of their tightening policies, then you would want to be in the market buying as much cheap stocks, real estate, or risk assets as possible. They have complete control on the overall value of everything. If you know game theory, then if you can predict the timing right before JPOW changes stance, then you'll be a very rich person.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes.
