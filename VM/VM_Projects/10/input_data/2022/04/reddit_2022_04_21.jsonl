Success or failure will be a defining part of the Federal Reserve chair’s legacy and the pro-employment policy he’s championed. \n\n “Can we cool down -- sort of -- labor demand without causing employment to fall?” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on April 11. He sounded cautious, calling interest rate policy a “brute force” hammer that sometimes breaks things: “That’s the tricky road that we’re on.”\n\nWhat happens to the U.S. job market, where unemployment currently stands at an ultra-low 3.6%, will rank alongside Powell’s widely-praised emergency pandemic response in dictating how history records his two terms at the helm of the world’s most powerful central bank. \n\nPowell will have one of the final words on the imminent policy outlook before the U.S. central bank enters its usual pre-meeting blackout when he addresses an International Monetary Fund panel on Thursday.

Mechanisms work differently in different economies, but the basic idea is to discourage lending by making it more expensive. In fiat fractional reserve banking systems, ‘new money’ gets out into the economy through banks making loans to borrowers. The greater the amount of money out in the system … laws of supply and demand tend towards that ‘more’ money falling in purchasing power against prices of consumed stuff. If it costs more to borrow, then theoretically the economy will borrow less - and when money is cheap, like it has been since 2008 (and in the lead up to the crash in some places - notably the US), there’s clear indicators that rates of borrowing generally increase considerably. \n\nIncreased cost of borrowing also makes it harder for borrowers to meet the higher payments. Hence, default levels tend to increase. \n\nAlso, bonds issued at fixed coupons become less desirable vs the base rate, and therefore secondary market prices tend to drop, since investors see issuers as likely to have to pay a higher coupon on new debt they raise to attract capital, and less than investment grade debt is perceived as having a higher default risk. \n\n- Stuff is more expensive: inflation calculation methodology is far from acutely honed (baskets of stuff rates are  derived from tend not to reflect the randomness of human consumption behaviour - which is fair enough I feel; we buy weird stuff in weird ways on top of the staples and stalwarts baskets are made up of because we’re all doing our respective uniquely weird life thing separately - categorically not possible to accurately account for in a broad, society-wide base-line). But key things like electricity, gas, fuel, water, core foods - when these go up, they’ll likely be followed by rent, public transport, prices set by other businesses trying to survive, ‘inflation-proof’ commodities investors regularly buy into when prices rise. Life costs more basically. \n\nAnd if life costs more, unless earnings follow suit in parallel, then finding the now-higher repayments on credit becomes harder still. Default rates tend to go up. Lenders get nervous and less accommodating of existing borrowers and new credit proposals. Bondholders want their capital back once debt security terms end, rather than rolling over and restructuring. \n\n- knock-on impact: if stuff is more expensive, corners need to be cut. Often this means letting an employee or two go, not buying the thing you want that would be supplying a third party business with income from their trading, so they have to make ends meet with less, and on and on round and round it goes. \n\nHaving said all this - your parents are nonetheless correct; today’s loan draw down may be worth less in real terms than the sum of the repayments due to inflation chipping away at that purchasing power. \n\nYeah - not the most straightforward of things to parse out!

Last month has been a beautiful time for Norwegian Salmon investors and as we can see it has just set a new record high support line.\n\nFor those of you who have not yet heard about Norwegian Salmon, let me tell you a few quick facts.\n\nFirst of all Biden has set an import ban on Russian seafood, which benefits Norwegian Salmon farmers directly. The looming food crisis and inflation will keep on driving Norwegian Salmon up for a long time. \n\nNorwegian Salmon has the lowest carbon footprint of all animal proteins, and for that reason it is a prime product to fill in shortages in other food products. Also people that eat Norwegian Salmon already have deep enough pockets to keep on consuming even with a bit of inflation. Even without the additional demand, Norwegian Salmon market has been rising for a while since more and more become aware of its health benefits and environmental impact.\n\nMOWI here broke their ATH in revenue and fish stock last year so business is booming and they're prepared for a larger demand.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!

The streaming service reported a loss of 200,000 subscribers in Q1 (first report of loss in 10+ years).\n\n**What's to blame?**\n\n* As a surprise to no one, binging Netflix is a behavior that goes down when people are not under pandemic lockdown.\n* Fierce competition. It still holds the largest global market share of 222 million subscribers, but every company under the sun seems to be launching its own streaming service.\n* Not enough Squid Game and Bridgerton level content to sway the masses.\n\nAnd while they're not going around admitting it, I think we all know punishing subscription base with higher prices and cracking down on shared accounts is not how you go about gaining new fans.\n\n**Beyond tech behemoths moving markets**, the panel discussion between the Fed, European Central Bank and other policy leaders that took place this afternoon cemented a half point interest rate hike in May. The Fed also indicated it is set to begin shrinking its $9 trillion asset portfolio, a double-barreled effort to remove stimulus to curb price pressures... and cause more pain to growth tech.

{"title": "Twitter Buyout & Fed Policy is bad news for Tesla.", "selftext": "Disclosure: I've been indirectly short Tesla for months in more than one way.\n\nI'm sure you've heard the drama involving Mr Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter. As things stands, there's a tentative offer to buy all shares at a premium to the market price and a poison pill contracted drafted which may allow all existing shareholders but Musk buy newly minted shares at a massive discount. Twitter stock has seen increased volatility but little price action. This is highly unusual for corporate acquisitions as normally the price will soar up near to the offered price as merger arbitrage funds swoop in. This price means the market thinks Musk is just as likely to dump his shares as he is to complete the buyout.\n\nElon Musk is the richest man in the world on paper as he is the largest owner of Tesla and SpaceX. While he certainly has the 44 billion needed to buy all Twitter shares, understand that such colossal sums are not liquid (only in the movies do people have checking accounts with absurd sums stored). He will have to file with the SEC in order to sell Tesla shares, and if you think that's bad realize that is also a taxable event so he'll have to sell more over 50 billion dollars worth of shares to pay the tax.\n\nThe alternative is a margin loan, where he borrows from the bank using his shares as collateral. However, Musk has already done this in order to fund other things and there are limits to how many shares can be submitted as collateral (Tesla's board of directors doesn't want one guy's margin call to crash the stock). It is not clear if this is an option for Musk.\n\nThe other thing is interest rates are higher and rising. Long story short rising interest rates means it is harder for everyone to borrow money and lending money becomes more profitable. High growth companies are hurt because they must borrow to grow, destroying their potential future value. Ergo, when interest rates rise, many investors sell growth companies and buy bonds.\n\nAnd Tesla is definitely a high growth company that's knee deep in debt. The fact is that even if investors ignore realism and HODL their shares, loss of profitability, margin calls, and insider selling will bring the stock down to Earth.\n\nThis may turn out to be a very interesting end to the Tesla craze, but the company's long term prospects are a topic for another time. But in the short term: Sell Tesla, hold Twitter if you got it because long term it'll either be bought at a premium or return to normal.", "id": "u90u24", "created_utc": 1650584582.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla said yesterday they have zero debt on the earnings call?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla bonds are a thing, so you may double check.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">Total debt **ex. vehicle and energy product financing** under $0.1B\n\n[Q1 Earnings](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/IOSHZZ_TSLA_Q1_2022_Update_G9MOZE.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2022-Update.pdf%22)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You have no idea what you are talking about.
