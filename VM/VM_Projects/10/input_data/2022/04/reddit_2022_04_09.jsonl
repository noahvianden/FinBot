{"title": "Shorting the SPY with LEAPS", "selftext": "Hi All\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick question: Does anybody have experience with shorting the SPY with LEAPS Options (for example Dec 24  440 Put)?

What are the risks apart of time decay (and obviously the risk that the option may expire worthless)?

And I only found out after buying that I couldn't extract the data at all, which of course makes it a hassle to review any progress. So I finally had an excuse to buy something nice. Extremely happy with the [Withings Body+](https://www.withings.com/us/en/scales).\n\nBeen using a \"traditional-looking\" smart watch for daily wear simply for step counting. It was gift, looks nice, but hard to say I'd recommend buying one just for that. (Not convinced monitoring heart rate all day is useful for anyone, with the exception of medical concerns and your doc finding it's helpful.)\n\nSince I'm happy with the scale, also bought a [Withings smart watch](https://www.withings.com/us/en/pulse-hr), slim and silicone. Finally caved and figured I'll give it a chance for workouts and sleep monitoring (arriving later today). I'll report back with some feedback in a few weeks, or if I return it sooner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApps\n\n[HealthMate](https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us)\\- As someone who hates apps, I actually like this one. It presents useful data, and most importantly, integrates with everything (and an open API, easy import/export). And if you have an app/smartwatch/etc. that can't connect, then it'll just pull that data from the generic Google/Apple app on your phone, which everything should connect to by now.  It even connects to the app my primary physician uses for health records and allows it pull data (weight, BMI, heart rate, blood pressure, ecg, and more). \\[*You don't need any Withings products for the app, free and fully functional using other products*.\\]\n\n[BrainFM](https://www.brain.fm/) \\- Fancy patented AI-powered \"music\" that promotes and helps maintain certain brain states. Been using for sleep for 4 years, also has modes for focus, meditation, and relaxation. (If I wasn't using BrainFM and had dogs on the bed, then I'd recommend [SleepScore](https://www.sleepscore.com/), but watch en route will be my first personal use of any sleep tracker.) [National Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-sleep-apps) has a variety of apps to try.\n\n[JuggernautAI](https://www.juggernautai.app/)\\- the only training app I use, but it is geared specifically for strength training (and limited application for gaining muscle size). But I generally hate training and nutrition apps. I loathe wasting time inputting data. Training apps also, ironically, interfere with my workout. This one is efficient enough and doesn't.\n\nReal Bodywork, [Muscle Trigger Point Anatomy](https://www.realbodywork.com/mobile-apps/) \\- Every so often, especially after a few weeks/months of the same lifting program, you end up with some referral pain. If simple movement/warm-up and basic stretching don't work, I try this app. Take note of exactly what areas are painful and select a zone. It'll list referral pain patterns (order by most common). Select the one that matches yours. It'll list trigger points with a resolution (again, ordered by most common). If your pain pattern doesn't match or a couple attempts to address the trigger point don't work, you can probably rule out referral pain and at least move on to another solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nServices\n\nMisfits Markets / Imperfect Foods / etc. - vegetable and fruit delivery for cheap.

I don't know about you guys, but grocers near us are still have supply chain issues and usually don't have meat on the shelf for a reasonable price. Just got our first box yesterday.

{"title": "Gapped up and gapped down stocks - good strategy potential", "selftext": " Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open?\n\nHere's the basics; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gapping.asp#toc-gapping-trading-strategies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gapping.asp#toc-gapping-trading-strategies)\n\nGapping occurs when the price of a stock, or another asset, opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed; for instance, the result of an earnings call after-hours.\n\nGapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets (money held) and liabilities (money loaned) change over time.\n\nHere's a good example from last week;\n\nHP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) stock price *gapped up* 18.6% after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares¬†.\n\nThis lead to this early jump in price:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjwq58dc9ls81.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ec8ea9b665f008f2a57cbfc85a9183636d0cec\n\n \n\nYou can use sites such as [barchart.com](https://barchart.com/) to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.\n\nMore often that not, a gap-up will encourage a 'buy' and gap-down will encourage a 'sell'.\n\nHowever; you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy, however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such;\n\n1. A breakaway gap: Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gap‚Äôs upper rim.\n2. An exhaustion gap ‚Äì prices pull back into it the next day: The downtrend is over: Cover shorts immediately.\n3. Another exhaustion gap, marked by a lack of new highs after the gap: Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high.\n4. A continuation gap in a downtrend: Go short, with a stop a few ticks above the gap‚Äôs upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later ‚Äì no method is fail-safe.\n5. An exhaustion gap, closed two days after it opened: Cover shorts immediately.\n6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day: No action recommended.\n7. A breakaway gap: Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gap‚Äôs lower rim.\n8. A continuation gap: Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gap‚Äôs lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy, place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.\n\nIn the HP example above, this was a breakaway gap, with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.\n\nIn any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.", "id": "u055wl", "created_utc": 1649547259.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Why yes, people do use that.
