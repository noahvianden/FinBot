{"title": "Can the stock market slump take the opportunity to buy the bottom? Wealthy investors: The worst may not be here", "selftext": "Entering April, the market's expectation that the Fed will aggressively raise interest rates has continued to rise, and US stocks have also fallen sharply. What is even more surprising is that the data shows that as of April 27, the US Nasdaq Composite Index led the decline among the world's major stock indexes.\n\nIt's been a tough year for investors, and the wealthy are no exception. Both U.S. stocks and bonds have fallen this year, making portfolio conversations between Wall Street advisers and clients more challenging. The most conservative portfolios performed as badly or worse than the riskiest portfolios, with bonds offering little or no protection.\n\nSo is the moment to make most wealthy, seasoned investors think that the recent stock market volatility has been \"total zero\" and that it is time to buy the dip? Right now it doesn't appear to be the case.\n\n**First, U.S. stocks fell, but most wealthy investors think it‚Äôs not a good time to hunt for dips**\n\nA quarterly survey by Morgan Stanley's E-Trade conducted in the first two weeks of April found that only 49% of investors with $1 million or more in their stockbroking accounts believed U.S. stocks would trade at a higher rate. The second quarter ended with an uptick. The bullish sentiment reading among these wealthy investors slipped to 52% from 64% in the previous quarter.\n\nMike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Capital Management, said, \"We've just had a really turbulent quarter, and as expected, the bullish sentiment has subsided due to market changes.\"\n\nTwenty-eight percent of investors surveyed expect U.S. stocks to edge up in the quarter, and 18% think U.S. stocks will end the quarter barely flat. However, a closer look at the findings shows that many investors remain reluctant to bet that the stock market has bottomed, a view that has been reinforced this week by the decline in U.S. stocks.\n\n\"Investors have embraced the new reality we face together as investors,\" Loewengart said. He said that due to the current changes in stocks and bonds, there are opportunities to deploy capital, and the survey found that some investors are seeking new opportunities, but they are mainly taking a defensive stance and using inflation as the dominant force in investment decisions.\n\n‚ÄúThe current environment is challenging for all investors. Millionaires are more sophisticated, they recognize volatility is part of the equity process and we have to live with it. At the same time millionaires can see through near-term pressures and wait to pick the right one. investment point.‚Äù\n\nIn fact, volatility is already expected by most people, and as a result, the percentage of millionaires who see volatility as the biggest risk to their portfolios has fallen‚Äîto 36% from 48% in the previous quarter.\n\n**Second, The biggest portfolio risk cited by wealthy investors is inflation (not market volatility)**\n\nAn analysis of how wealthier and more seasoned investors are feeling now can start with the Fed. The Fed raised interest rates to fight inflation, but it risked pushing the economy further into recession.\n\nMore seasoned investors generally understand that the economy and markets are not the same thing, and that the Fed's hawkish turn (entering a rate hike cycle) is a direct byproduct of the strength of the economy. The Fed raised rates because it felt the economy was overheating from a price perspective and was confident that the economy was healthy enough to handle it.\n\nBut the views of the wealthy are divided: Among these wealthy investors, 38% expect a recession; 68% think the economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise interest rates.\n\nAnother point worth mentioning is that the millionaires predict that the Fed will only raise rates two or three times. This could mean: either these investors are thinking about a 50 basis point or 75 basis point rate hike, and if the Fed gets more aggressive early in the cycle, two or three (rate hikes) could mean A full cycle; or they could be expecting the Fed to push the economy into recession after only a few rate hikes.\n\n‚ÄúAll investors right now‚Äîwhether wealthy or ordinary, individual or institutional‚Äîare facing an important question: Will the Fed have to take such a drastic step that it will tame inflation. The only way is to throw the economy into recession?\" Loewengart said.\n\n\"We don't know the answer. We've heard relative optimism from the Fed, but history doesn't support the possibility of a soft landing. But it's also a special time. To some extent we're in uncharted territory right now.\"\n\nInflation (not market volatility) was the top portfolio risk cited by these investors, with 38% citing the risk of a recession this time around, up from 26% in the previous quarter, the survey showed.\n\n**Third, the wealthy investors who hold cash have increased under inflation**\n\nAs stocks fell, some of the bubbles at the top of the market have dissipated, leading to a decrease in the share of millionaires who believe the market is at or near a bubble ‚Äî from 71% in the last quarter to 57% in April, but that hasn‚Äôt helped them improve risk appetite.\n\nLoewengart said the proportion of wealthy investors who said they would not make any changes to their portfolios fell ‚Äî from 44 percent to 36 percent, a ‚Äúsignificant drop.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the current market, investors shouldn‚Äôt be under pressure to make hasty decisions, but choosing where to invest and making rational decisions doesn‚Äôt mean doing nothing,‚Äù Loewengart said.\n\nAt the same time, more investors said they were adding cash. Among wealthy investors surveyed, the percentage of millionaires who said they had increased their cash due to rising interest rates rose from 24% to 31%, while there was also an increase among millionaire investors who said they invested in inflation-protected bonds ‚Äî up from 25% to 32%.\n\nHolding cash during inflationary times is a difficult problem. Because it doesn't help in an inflationary environment, though the increase in the number of investors holding cash may reflect concerns about continued market volatility. Rising volatility means more downside risk to equities, and cash may be the first choice to ride out the storm. Institutional investors did say it's always important to have cash on hand so that they can be ready to pounce when stock market valuations are low.\n\n‚ÄúWe are in a special period and we know that inflation will cause cash to lose its purchasing power, but with the front end of the yield curve and ultrashort debt not immune to volatility, cash is getting more attention.‚Äù\n\n\"They still have confidence in the economy, they just don't have confidence in the market in the short term, and they're preparing for future rotations, and even further corrections in the future,\" Loewengart said.\n\n**Fourth, where are the areas that wealthy investors are willing to invest in?**\n\nInflation now dominates all analysis of stock valuations by wealthy investors, the results of the survey's inquiry into S&P 500 industry sector bets show. Energy, real estate and utilities were the most popular sectors this quarter, while some traditionally defensive sectors less closely tied to inflation, such as healthcare and financials, did not perform as well as one might expect.\n\n\"Inflation concerns are overriding everything, including taking a typical defensive position within the stock market,\" Loewengart said, which is why interest in energy, real estate and utilities is high, but not in financials. \"It's not surprising that there is strong investor interest in sectors that are expected to benefit from a prolonged period of high inflation,\" he said.\n\nOn the tech front, the percentage of investors showing a strong interest in tech stocks fell from the previous quarter after the tech sector‚Äôs rout this year ‚Äì from 37% to 34% who made tech their preferred investment for the quarter .\n\nAmong non-traditional investments, commodities are getting a lot of attention from these investors - the percentage of millionaires who said they would increase their commodity investments increased from 11% to 22%.\n\nHowever, Loewengart said, \"When we see the bright spot is commodities and energy stocks, it is difficult to point out to conservative investors, because we think that they as risk averse investors should not necessarily own commodities.\" He said, \"Having a heavy position in the commodities space could cause problems in the future.\"", "id": "udtl9l", "created_utc": 1651148094.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "As much as we all want certainty, it has been shown repeatedly that the markets are unpredicable.

It's the new FAANG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sx8zpa/atm_alphabet_tesla_microsoft_is_all_you_need_its/)\n\nI feel need to repeat what I had said. Facebook's slowing user growth is not yet priced in and Alphabet is over corrected.\n\nI have had 80% of my portfolio in ATM: ‚ÄúAny time money‚Äù. I have been doing relatively very well in ongoing crash compared to my friends who want to get rich next month.\n\nLong term Problems with Amazon, Facebook and Netflix:\n\n**Amazon:**\n\nTheir prince Bezos is chilling with his girl friend in palace while their engineers are expected to work crazy hours, insist on highest standards and demonstrate great ownership. No great engineers want to work for a leader preaching vision from his hot tub.\n\nThey had first mover advantage in cloud but now there are bunch of small and big players catching up with innovative & reliable web services since cloud is not rocket science.\n\nThey are doing well in online shopping but margins are not great because it‚Äôs less tech and more labor management & customer service, which can‚Äôt scale as fast as pure labor free well written non rushed software (Google search, Microsoft office products, gmail, YouTube, Maps, etc)\n\nAlso majority of online shopping is third party marketplace who are always scared of cheap knock offs driven by fake reviews and Amazon basics so I don‚Äôt think growth there is sustainable.\n\n**Facebook:**\n\nJust set of dying apps. We all know that no one really spends that much time on Facebook, Instagram, messenger & whatsapp. They might have daily active users but those daily active users don‚Äôt really spend more than few mins on the app. Most of the communities and groups in these social media apps are ghost towns. They don‚Äôt rally own any mobile or desktop platform.\n\nAll the talk about meta verse is just the talks. It‚Äôs basically multi player real time game with VR which is not very new. Games (MetaVerse) can do well but it can also easily be very boring.\n\n**Netflix:**\n\nYet another streaming app with all content being more than 30 mins. Even if they come up with great content, No one really has attention span of more than 10 mins these days. Netflix also hasn‚Äôt even developed a proper search engine in these many years. I watch more content on YouTube and TikTok than all streaming apps combined. No wonder YouTube revenue is similar to Netflix.\n\n**What‚Äôs the common problem with Amazon, Facebook and Netflix?**\n\nThey are all tech companies with fear based culture. Engineers are always on their toes cutting corners to meet deadlines for next quarter so they don‚Äôt get fired in next performance cycle. So they never take long term risk or invest in big bets because big failure is not an option. Because they cut corners they also accumulate technical debt over time so basically talented engineers eventually spend more time keeping the lights on rather than innovating on new projects.\n\nFacebook and Netflix hire the top most tech talent and they have no rule rule. But none of their engineers ever came up with disruptive new tech and they are still basically a streaming app after so many years. Facebook similarly had to acquire innovations (Instagram, WhatsApp) because their engineers are too scared to get fired to innovate.\n\nI am also not long on Nvidia, AMD and all other companies whose products are not diversified.\n\n**Apple:**\n\nWell it‚Äôs run by a suit Tim Apple who can‚Äôt code himself. Their flagship iPhone business is going to slow down due to competition from Samsung and pixel. They have already caught up but because some people have never used phones besides IPhone they have no idea how better and secure Android is because it‚Äôs open source. The first thing anyone does after getting IPhone is replace Apple Maps with Google Maps, replace Apple Mail with Gmail, replace Photos with Google Photos and Siri is using Google search behind the scenes anyway. And safari with chrome. Also they store photos on Google cloud.\n\nWhy am I long only ATM?
