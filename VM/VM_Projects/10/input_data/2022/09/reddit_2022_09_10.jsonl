The only problem is going to be that option premiums (unless they are highly inflated by IV) are going to be relatively low with 1 to 3 dte. If you are trying to sell 30 delta credit spreads with 3 dte you arent going to get the 1/3 of the width of the strikes that you would want to have for credit spreads but if this is part of your plan then it sounds like you can make it work. Just know that putting up $250 in collateral to make $50 for a hypothetical $3 wide spread (and realistically it would be like $40 -$45 because you'll want to close before the end of day in Friday) is a big max loss in relation to your max gain and that $250 can be reached rather quickly because the gamma risk is quite high in those 3 days.\n\nI think 65% to 80% is a good goal to set but you should think about the average winner amount and the average loser. If you win $40 65% of the time then you only have $54 to lose the other 35% of the time. ($45 max gain ×100 trades = total max gain of $4500 then x by 0.65 = $2600 for winners - which means $1900 would be losers. $1900 / 35 = $54.28). So keep this in mind if you are trying to have a stop loss plan. But if you implement this type of stop loss strategy you may end up negatively skewing your win rate and since you don't have much time left in these trades to roll the trade or let the stock return to break even or a winner it might get rough on your overall P/L.\n\nI think it sounds like a good theory and it might work out.

For those customers who know what they want and don't need the budtender's guidance, this is a slick convenience. Very few dispensaries in the world have this experience.\n\nAlso mentioned in the PR is the desire to license this tech to other dispensaries and industries which could turn into yet another revenue stream.\n\nDelivery will be made available in as many location as allowed by law, but this offers a fast, convenient, slick way of ordering / picking up. It also cuts down on $$$ spent on budtenders while keeping lines moving.\n\nWith plans to expand in Europe, I could envision a smaller \"Bud Room\" store concept that almost feels like a vending machine. While not discussed in the press release, the stigma of cannabis still exists worldwide, so some might be turned off by the idea of being seen in line waiting at a dispensary.

The VIX is a market index representing the market's expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. However, so far in 2022, the 30 day volatility has been overstated only 61% of the time. So far in 2022, the best time to sell options in the S&P was when the VIX was greater than 30. What about longer dated options? \n\n(We used data from January 3, 2022 until August 12, 2022.

The VIX3M is a market index representing the market's expectations for volatility over the coming 90 days. This year, the VIX3M has not closed a single day below 20. Compare this chart with the previous chart. Notice how the percent of occurrences where volatility was overstated is much higher and the worst spread between IV and HV is lower.

Globalstar said it will raise capital to cover the cost of building and launching the satellites; Goldman Sachs is working with the company to secure financing.\n\n*The most important reason for why Apple chose Globalstar is to stay one step ahead of the competition. The fact that Amazon was so interested in a potential partnership with Globalstar definitely raised the eyebrows of Tim Cook and the crew.\n\nGlobalstar is the perfect partner for Apple.

{"title": "Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) a monster in the making (Re-post because OG got banned for several hours before being unlocked)", "selftext": "# Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) Undervalued? WBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWarner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).\n\n# Streaming and Box Office\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million box office: 405.2 million.\n\nIn regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&T mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).\n\nOn the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like batgirl. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022).\n\n# WBD Gaming\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics.\n\nThe gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Leg0 Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.\n\n# WBD Networks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .\n\n# Debt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%.\n\nZaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters.\n\n# Ratios and comparison with competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)\n\n# What are insiders doing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInsiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Insider Activity Overtime](https://preview.redd.it/qp6qhaf994n91.jpg?width=1526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bac8c9c447b98ed43a5d4e4d10059c1be9d2b8db)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Insider Stats](https://preview.redd.it/5t5d9yua94n91.jpg?width=1964&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4aa968cecb654f4cbeda16a1c0729313bb0e47c1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Latest insider trades](https://preview.redd.it/9bevoc0c94n91.jpg?width=1978&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b77486744f3830a6b5e3e9521e6c22f4ebb0bf36)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Source: Open BB terminal)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years\n\nSources :\n\nQ2 earnings release : [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q2/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf)\n\nQ2 Earnings presentation : [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_presentations/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Presentation-Final.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_presentations/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Presentation-Final.pdf)\n\nDebt Schedule:  [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q2/WBD-Outstanding-Debt-as-of-June-30-2022.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/WBD-Outstanding-Debt-as-of-June-30-2022.pdf)\n\nWBD Finviz: [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\nPARA Finviz: [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PARA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PARA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\nThis has also been posted in r/wallstreetbets and r/ValueInvesting.
