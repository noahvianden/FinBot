In an extraordinary sweep, central banks from the US to Switzerland embarked on what looked like competitive policy tightening.\n\nFred Ducrozet at Pictet Wealth Management totted up the numbers and found that **10 central banks delivered a massive combined total of 6 percentage points of rate rises just this week.** Several rises, including the latest from the US, were of some 0.75 percentage points, three times the usual scale of rate moves. As Pimco economist Tiffany Wilding put it, ‚Äú75 is the new 25‚Äù.¬†\n\nDoing the most damage, for equity investors at least, the US Federal Reserve has turned up the volume on its warnings on just how much further it is prepared to go.  **No more sugar coating ‚Äî Fed chair Jay Powell was clear that further rate rises are coming and that they will involve ‚Äúpain‚Äù**. He was referring mostly to pain in labour markets but the same is true of your rapidly shrinking equities portfolio.\n\nStock markets got the message. The US S&P 500 fell by 1.7 per cent on Wednesday after Powell‚Äôs speech, taking losses for the year to more than 20 per cent.¬†\n\nBut still, it looks like investors are clinging on to some key bets. This is getting dicey. As Bank of America notes, **the drop in government bonds stemming from sky-high inflation and aggressively hawkish central banks is now in truly historic territory**.\n\nLooking at data stretching as far back as 1790 (not a typo ‚Äî banks just love super long-term data for moments like these), BofA **describes this as the third Great Bond Bear Market.** We have seen nothing like it **since at least the Marshall Plan in 1949,** wrote Michael Hartnett and colleagues at the bank.¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpm5ntixurp91.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=feeba85e608ad685362439118ecaaa8d0a2a50a3\n\nThat is striking in itself but it matters well beyond the bond market, because the crash ‚Äúthreatens credit events and the liquidation of the world‚Äôs most crowded trades‚Äù, they said, **including US tech stocks, which of course have an outsized impact on US and global stock market shifts. ‚ÄúTrue capitulation is when investors sell what they love and own,‚Äù** they added.

{"title": "What really grinds my gears - Cost basis", "selftext": "**Why are dividends, fees and covered calls are ever in the same sentence as cost basis?**\n\nSeriously, why? What's the logic? Everybody is just talking about performance?\n\nMost likely my understanding is just too shallow on the topic, but here is why I'm asking: Cost basis is meant to be used to calculate your taxes **not** your performance. I could add all kinds esoteric stuff to my performance calculation but the IRS will be less then understanding.\n\nExample:\n\nYou bought 100 IBM shares for $1000, 30 years ago. Now you sell them for $10 000 and as far as the taxman is concerned your cost basis is $1000 and your profit is $9000.  Why?\n\n1. **Fee**: In 1992 you paid a fee to get the shares, and you promptly wrote that off, as expense, from  THAT years capital gains. It cannot also affect your cost basis 30 years later.\n2. **Selling calls**: You sold a contract, your got money for it, you have to pay taxes on it, THAT year. The fact that you \"happen to have\" shares of that company makes no difference. \"Decreasing\" your cost basis actually sound horrible because it means you will be taxed twice, why the hell would you want that? And yet [Tastyworks talks exactly about this](https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/covered-call)\n3. **Dividends**: You never bought another share of IBM from your dividends. But Even if you would have, getting the money from dividends have nothing to do with your cost basis directly. Acquiring new shares is what affects your cost basis, whether the money comes from said company or from your grandpa is the same thing. So I really don't get this particular [investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060313/what-determines-your-cost-basis.asp#toc-dividends) .Even with DRIP you have to consider the price when the reinvestment happens, so it just seems confusing to even mention it.", "id": "xmt9r4", "created_utc": 1664027079.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "People view cost basis as how much you paid for the stock.

It's a way to view how premium positively impacts positions.   \n\n\nOr you can just think about each trade as separate, that's fine too.   \n\n\nNo it obviously doesn't bring down your taxable cost basis, but you're fighting an uphill battle with what people have affectionately colloquially called the effective cost of the shares.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "I want to share my appreciation for your wheel sheets doc.

Seriously - accounting for tax purposes does not always align with GAAP (eg different depreciation rules)\n\nIf people want to say \"my effective entry price has been lowered by selling CCs' or collecting dividends\" then that is a fine perspective. Just because the IRS makes them account for taxes differently doesn't mean they can't have useful managerial reporting.\n\nAs a simple example : you buy 100 shares of XYZ for $100 each. $10k total.

I think it's very interesting that none of my limit buys on additional crop options (I tried to buy the dip) went through, I was slightly above the midpoint of the spread on all my attempted buys.\n\nMy optimistic case for global harvests is now -20%, hopefully I'm wrong. Every international analysis I've looked at points to excess production from countries that don't have it to make up the shortfall. Supposedly the US is/has prepared a brief on just how bad it is, and that is not available to the public. Tommy Tuberville (the guy who took out the QQQ doom puts at the top) is on the agriculture committee and daytrading crop futures. So congress is definitely getting into this as well. Still waiting on an all-star like Pelosi or Crenshaw to make it obvious to everyone.\n\nAs per one of my [previous DD's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/), we're now seeing increased migration and violence around the world, with a second competing currency bloc forming primarily around Russia and China. There are some other countries that get lumped in with that, but I'm doubtful they all stick, given the tensions between many of them.\n\nI'll take a second to recommend u/Peruvian_Bull 's DD posts on the collapse of the dollar as global reserve currency, there has been absolute chaos and carnage in the Forex markets lately and his stuff from over a year ago is pretty much playing out perfectly.\n\nThere are currently unconfirmed rumors circulating of a power struggle in China that Xi may have lost.  Entirely possible it's nothing, but worth keeping an eye on.  Tehran continues to have increasing protests after the Basij (religious police, everyone hates them) murdered a 22 year old woman for not wearing a hijab.
