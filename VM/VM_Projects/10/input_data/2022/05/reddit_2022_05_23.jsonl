Investors will be monitoring the 3847 level to see if we retest this area once more to head deeper into the bear market.\n\n2- Fed Minutes\n\nOne important data set that will be released this week will be the fed minutes on Wednesday at 2pm est that will share more information on what the fed discussed at their last meeting. Investors will monitor these minutes (transcript) to get any indication for the severity of the next interest rate hike in June.\n\n3- Key Levels\n\n S&P 500 has to hold above 3847 which is the bear market territory and the Nasdaq has to hold above 11,500. If these levels don't hold in the coming week we're going to see drastic declines of going down to 3800 and 11,000.\n\n4- Retail On Watch\n\nAfter Target and Walmart blew up their earnings dragging down the DOW,\ninvestors will be watching earnings from Costco, Best Buy and others to see if they continue to retail bloodshed due to high inflation. If these earnings come out terrible as well then DOW will take another hit.\n\n5- Earnings Continues\n\nZoom on Monday, Nordstrom/Best Buy on Tuesday, Nvidia/Dicks on Wednesday, Costco/Macys/Gap/Alibaba/Baidu on Thursday.\n\n6- GDP\n\nGDP data will be released on Thursday at 8:30am est which will give us an overview of how the 1st quarter performed.\n\n7- PCE\n\nPCE Inflation index is released on Thursday at 8:30am est which is a data set that is closely monitored by the fed. This is just another huge important data set that will be released before the fed interest rate\ndecision next month.\n\n8- Cry-pto\n\nBit-coin continues to struggle to stay above the 30k range, the longer it stays around this range, the most likely it will start heading closer to the mid 20's to retest the previous week low of 25.5k.

Some of  Bostic's colleagues have called for a more aggressive push to put the  rate at 3.5%, which would involve half-point increases at all the Fed's  remaining meetings for the year.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Bostic said he expects a shallower set of moves, with the funds rate ending at a range of 2 to 2.5% at the end of 2022.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>While  there is risk the central bank may have to be more aggressive, \"I'm an  optimist and I'm assuming inflation will have started to definitively  move\" lower by then, Bostic said.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Even  so, there are mounting concerns about a global growth slowdown and about  how resilient the U.S. economy will be to rising rates, falling equity  values, and other adjustments still to come. Bostic said he expected,  for example, that the impact of higher borrowing costs may accelerate in  coming weeks as potential buyers are priced out of housing markets by  rising mortgage rates, and households and firms slow purchases out of  caution over the economic outlook.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The  challenge, Bostic said, is to walk the \"knife edge\" between raising  rates so high as to cause a recession while still ensuring enough is  done to curb price increases.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The  economy's response to higher rates \"is going to accelerate over the next  several months,\" Bostic said. \"If we're not on it, there's a risk that  we will keep moving beyond the point where these markets have found the  equilibrium.\"\n\nVia: [https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/bostic-baseline-is-pause-rate-hikes-september-assess-impact-2022-05-23/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/bostic-baseline-is-pause-rate-hikes-september-assess-impact-2022-05-23/)", "id": "uwamt7", "created_utc": 1653340633.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|57|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|404|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uwamt7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uwamt7)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You gotta hand it to the Fed.
