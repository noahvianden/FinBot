{"title": "For anyone interested in Big Tobacco investments:", "selftext": "Great resource here.  It's a year old, but the most recent and thorough data I could find:\n\n[Trends in nicotine use 2017-2020](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.smokefreeworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Global%2520Trends%2520in%2520Nicotine%2520Report%2520December%25202021.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjp_ICgnub3AhXEMewKHQ0lDpQQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3NzGyN8nWaYHrcHUEYZvfu)\n\n**Summary and additional info I have gathered:**\n\nCigarettes are still the leader in nicotine delivery by far.  Yet we all know that smoking is in decline, especially in developed regions like the US and Western Europe.  Tobacco companies maintain stable growth by raising prices despite stable or declining volume. \n\nBig Tobacco is also investing in so-called \"Next-Generation Products\" - heat-not-burn tobacco, vaping, and tobacco-free oral.\n\n**BTI (British American Tobacco)** is the largest (ex-China) and most international tobacco company.  They have made significant inroads with heat-not-burn (Glo) and modern oral / nicotine pouches (Velo).  Producer of Lucky Strike.  They have a stake in OrganiGram, a Canadian cannabis company.\n\n**PM (Philip Morris International)** sells only ex-US (currently).  They are the #1 in heat-not-burn (IQOS) and are promising a \"smoke-free future\".  They're currently in talks to acquire Swedish Match (SWMAY), which would allow them to distribute the popular Zyn nicotine pouch both in the US and abroad. This may also allow them to distribute IQOS in the US.  They produce Marlboro for sale ex-US.\n\n**JAPAY (Japan Tobacco)** - they sell Camel and American Spirit ex-US.  They have a significant heat-not-burn presence as well, but are being beat by IQOS and Glo.  I'm not sure about modern oral.  I read rumors that they may try to outbid PM for Swedish Match.  They are part owned by the Japanese government and also have a pharmaceutical and processed food business.\n\n**IMBBY (Imperial Brands)** - international presence but mostly in Europe, America, and Australia.  They are smaller than the above mentioned players.  They have had a horrible time the last few years and have failed with next-generation products.  However, recently they brought on a new CEO, Steven Bomhard, and have launched a 5 year strategic plan to steady the ship and transform the business.  Currently cigarette sales have steadied in their core markets, and they are experiencing limited growth with a new heat-not-burn product Pulze and also with Blu e-cigarettes (Blu primarily in the US).  Cigarette brands include Kool, West, and Davidoff.\n\n**MO (Altria)** - they sell Marlboro in the USA.  They split from PM about 15 years ago.  They have acquired a modern oral brand (on!), as well as made strategic investments in BUD and other companies like JUUL. JUUL is a vaping company, but unfortunately Altria has run into a lot of issues with this acquisition due to concerns in the US about youth vaping.  I'm not 100% sure on this point but I believe that MO currently has the rights to sell IQOS in the USA.  That said, heat-not-burn is not popular in the US at the moment.  This may also be in jeopardy if PM decides to dump deals with MO, buy SWMAY, and market IQOS themselves.  MO also invested in Cronos Group, a cannabis company. \n\n**My take:**\n\nThe consensus seems to be that PM is the best-managed business, and this is reflected in how far ahead they've pushed with IQOS and their purported vision of a smoke-free future. A successful acquisition of Swedish Match would be a boon for them, both due to the success of Zyn as well as the opportunity to distribute IQOS in the USA.  Neither would bode well for Altria. \n\nBTI is considered to be behind the curve compared to PM, but still in the game and likely to push forward despite the secular decline of the tobacco industry.  Debt could be a concern. \n\nJAPAY is considered to be poorly run and behind the curve.  Their heat-not-burn has not been as successful as IQOS or Glo.  A bid for SMWAY would be interesting to see from them. \n\nIMBBY is considered to be behind the curve as well, and the market seems to believe that they will not survive the transformation of the industry.  However, recently they've shown resilience and stabilization, and their next-generation strategy, while not guaranteed, appears to be going smoothly.\n\nMO is a fan favorite but is considered to be poorly run when compared to PM. There is talk that PM should dump their deals with MO and go solo in the US, which acquiring SWMAY would allow them to do.\n\nMe personally, as an ex-smoker and also based off what I read in this report, I believe that traditional tobacco (cigarettes) are here to stay for the time being, and tobacco companies can continue to grow via price increases which offset volume declines, as well as mitigation of losses via successful launches of next-generation products.  Buybacks and dividends will return value to shareholders despite ESG concerns and the market pricing in secular decline. \n\nI am long BTI and IMBBY.  I believe that PM is incorrect in their vision of a smoke-free future and that you pay a premium for something that is unlikely (in my opinion) to pan out.  This is reflected by the fact that in Japan, where heat-not-burn had its original success, the growth of heat-not-burn has slowed significantly.  Meanwhile, with BTI and IMBBY you pay a discount for something proven, stable and addictive (traditional smoking).  Of course, regulatory concerns are a risk, especially with the rise of plain packaging and complete bans on smoking for people of a certain age (New Zealand).  \n\nI discard MO due to being a US-only business where smoking is in decline, as well as their failure in the next-generation categories, plus potential competition from PM.  They also trade at a premium vis-a-vis BTI.\n\nI discard JAPAY due to poor management as well as lack of information... I find it difficult to get information about them as a Us-based investor.\n\nAll of this is just my opinion, and again, I am long BTI and IMBBY.  I have no short positions in any of the aforementioned companies.\n\n\nOther tobacco companies to look at:\n\n**TPB - Turning Point Brands**- Zig Zag papers in the US and Canada.  Also smokeless tobacco and vaping. \n\n**VGR - Vector Group** - discount cigarettes US-only.  This is a growing category.\n\n**UVV - Universal Corp** - tobacco leaf grower.

{"title": "Owners’ Equivalent Rent of Residence (OER), the CPI, and why 2022 is going to continue to be a crappy year for risk assets.", "selftext": "I don't mean to add to the chorus of doomsayers but do believe I came across an analysis not mentioned on the financial porn channels (ie CNBC) who are quick to speak of \"peak inflation\" having already passed. I'm also not aware of any real substantive analysis of the inputs into inflation (one in particular I will return to) among the real \"pros\" but I'm not plugged into those circles so who knows... maybe they're keeping it a secret.\n\nI'm just some dude who basically won the lottery and made life changing bank on TSLA calls a few years ago and moved to Puerto Rico.... I'm actally a physician by training, not an economist, so obviously due your own research. But all the talk of inflation seems to be missing something very obvious and I'm hoping to share.\n\nI want to start by saying that inflation in my view isn't as new or scary as some will make it seem. It's simply more demand than supply which causes prices to go up. We've all seen this play out countless times--not enough PS5s or or Yeezys or concert tickets or raw materials as people want and the prices start skyrocketing. The difference between the inflation Jerome Powell (JPOW) talks about and some dude hawking Yeezys at a 500% premium to sticker price is really just how pervasive it's become in so many parts of our lives--food, energy, shelter, ie the basics.\n\nJPOW got a lot of flak for repeatedly insisting last year that inflation was \"transitory.\" **In a philosophical sense maybe he was correct--everything in life is transient said the Buddha. And everything will eventually get sorted out--but it took years to get here. It could take years to get back.**\n\n*In a more immediate sense he was speaking of supply-demand mismatches that are partly a result of \"supply chain bottlenecks\" like chip shortages that cause shortages of new cars that had spill over effect into used cars. This is definitely part of the story. But so too is the confluence of pandemic-era accommodative fiscal (stimulus) and monetary (QE, negative real rates) policies by Congress and the Fed, respectively.* Just as one example, if a family was receiving thousands in stimulus payments and child tax credits (expiring) and also saw the value of their home and retirement accounts double because the Fed kept real rates near zero while buying trillions in bonds to essentially create money then they might have been quick to go out and buy an even bigger home or take a really nice vacation--but because millions of other families were in the same boat lumber prices and airfares started to soar. And in a sense this effect really is \"transitory\" although it will likely take years to mean revert.\n\n**By the end of 2019, the S&P 500 had (already buoyed by 4 previous rounds of QE since 2008) trended up to 3000 and the Nasdaq to 9000. Markets tend to overshoot and overcorrect** so short or medium term it's really anyones guess where things will bottom out but in the absence of QE and the return of higher interest rates I think we are likely to revert back to the pre-pandemic trajectory at some point. **And there's another 20-25% of correction left before we get there.**\n\nFutures are positive this morning and it will probably be a choppy road but the reason in my view markets haven't corrected harder is the hope that the Fed can somehow engineer a \"soft landing,\" or in other words avoid having to engineer a recession to get asset prices back in line. This will be difficult for a number of reasons that are not a secret: The conflict in Ukraine has further accelerated the multiyear supercycle in commodity prices (if you look back in history, commodities invariably go through multiyear periods of extended boom followed by cyclical bust) **that was already underway. Furthermore, extended Covid-related lockdowns in China will cause further supply disruptions and costs increases.**\n\n**And now with all this in context I finally get to the crux of my post:** While the markets are probably pricing in Ukraine and the China-lockdowns and the probably of two 50 basis point increase in interest rates, **the Fed will likely be under even greater pressure to raise interest rates more and possibly faster than markets are already expecting while also drawing down their massive balance sheet for one rarely discussed reason:**\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm)\n\nWe use the BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary gauge of inflation. **In the CPI, there are two components of housing costs: owners’ equivalent rent of residence (OER) and rent of primary residence, which combined are 40 percent of core CPI**, which is the most widely watched because it excludes volatile energy and food prices.\n\nHowever, these are not real-time metrics. Unlike milk which people buy often, people enter into longterm leases and as such the BLS (the government agency that publishes the monthly CPI) divides into 6 cohorts. For the May measure, which will be released in the second week of June, the will ask 1/6th of respondents how much they pay in rent despite the fact that most of respondents entered leases during the pandemic when before wages and home prices started to skyrocket and the measure will be artificially lower.\n\nAn even larger component of the 40% than actual rent is owners’ equivalent rent of residence (OER).\\*\\*The methodology is beyond the scope but basically because BLS considers homes investments rather than consumption so uses an indirect metric rather than asking about actual expenses like maintenance or **mortgage rates (which are rising and not captured)** or taxes. I'm going to defer to a group of economists much smarter than me to explain. One is Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary, Chief Economist for the World Bank, and President of Harvard. This research is supported by multiple others and I will post a longer lit review if enough interest but probably suffice to say this is solid research by world leading scholars with no obvious interest in manipulating markets or selling anything and much more helpful than whatever equity research department at Goldman says.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795)\n\n>\"\\[Last year\\] home prices have jumped by 19.9 percent according to Zillow. The Zillow Observed Rent Index has increased 14.9 percent, and the CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index, likely to be a particularly good leading indicator for OER, had risen by 12 percent in December...  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Dolmas & Zhou (2021) documents that historically the BLS measure of 12-month change in rental prices is more strongly correlated with the 12-month change in housing prices observed 16 months earlier than any more recent reading \\[see [https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824)\\]...  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Using a variety of techniques and datasets, we estimate housing’s contribution to 2022 inflation as almost incompatible with a swift return to trend inflation.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I don't think the 16 month delay is definitive but needless to say the CPI data we are looking at is VERY STALE and at least a year old. While we may say headlines about airplanes fares (only 0.5% of the CPI) we forget that 40% of core CPI measures direct and indirect rents over a year ago and won't capture any decreases until 2023 at the earliest. For this reason, it is my view that the Fed will be under pressure well into next year to continue to raise rates and push markets further down to eventually mean revert to pre-pandemic levels.**\n\nSo what to do?\n\n**C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me aka Delever)**. Even if the scenario of a Fed being more Hawkish than currently priced somehow doesn't pan out the risk-reward profile of markets at present is not favorable in my view. **Keep a lot of cash on hand**. Even if you're still convinced GME is the greatest thing since sliced bread, keep some cash. **Remember that high beta growth stocks are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates since their valuation depends in part on very far out csh flows that need to be discounted to present at a higher cost of capital.**\n\nAlso **consider hedging**. Put options might be an obvious play but also consider (and I usually hate ETFs)  like and ETF that is short ARKK or SOGU (which is short SPACS) or an ETF short emerging markets (which tend to get hit even worse than the US when rates rise quickly) or an ETF short the US housing market on a forward basis... not 16 months delayed like the CPI.\n\nAnd **diversify**. Sounds like boring boomer advice and the energy trade has become crowded but the energy sector and underlying commodities remain attractively priced in my view. Yes you would have ignored me 6 months ago and that \"would have been the time to buy\" but with PEs of 10s and low price to book and sky high dividends and buybacks this sector remains attractive in the face of rising inflation for the next few years until everything gets sorted out.

For this reason CPI could continue to rise for the next year or more, forcing the Fed to raise rates more than expected and essentially popping the pandemic-era everything bubble.

Shah\n\n(Bloomberg) -- \n\nPeloton Interactive Inc. has received orders from debt investors worth around two times the size of its $750 million loan sale, in a rare sign of confidence in the struggling home fitness company. \n\nPeloton has pitched the financing, which was underwritten by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., as a stopgap to support the turnaround plan outlined by new Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. \n\nThe plan is expected to stem a cash bleed as soon as next year, and includes cost cuts, higher reliance on subscription-based revenue and better supply chain management, the company has previously said. \n\nRepresentatives for JPMorgan, which is the lead arranger of the financing, and Peloton declined to comment.\n\nThe banks began offloading the $750 million loan just a week after they committed financing to the company in the wake of poor financial results that sent shares tumbling. The loan has a rare structure that makes it more expensive for Peloton to repay during the first two years, a provision that hands investors a big payout if the firm is sold during that period. \n\nRead more: JPMorgan, Goldman Look to Offload Peloton Loan at 8% Yield\n\nThe loan is making its way quickly through a market that has been battered in recent weeks, forcing other borrowers to put their financing plans on ice. The sale appeared to attract demand from investors in spite of being marketed without credit ratings, which makes it hard for managers of collateralized loan obligations -- the biggest buyers of risky corporate loans -- to include in their portfolios. \n\nThe banks are offering the five-year loan, which pays interest of 6.5 percentage points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, at a discount of 95 to 96 cents on the dollar, resulting in a yield of more than 8%, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Commitments are due on the loan sale by Tuesday at 2:00pm, New York time.", "id": "urs108", "created_utc": 1652809675.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|48|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|106|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq4ryy/dkng_updated_morgan_stanley_detailed_analysis_as/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=urs108)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=urs108)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everyone who wanted a Peloton already has it.
