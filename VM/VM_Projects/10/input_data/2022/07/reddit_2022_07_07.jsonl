{"title": "Pelosi’s Popping Portfolio", "selftext": "Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has recently been a staple of “investing meme” space since early 2022. Throughout social media, she is both famous and infamous for her lucrative investments in the stock market. TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit - throughout various channels of social media, you will find investing influencers publicizing and discussing the congresswoman’s latest stock trades as a proxy to get ahead in the stock market.\n\nAccording to the STOCK (stop trading on congressional knowledge) act, all members of Congress must disclose any financial transaction of stocks within 45 days of purchase, and the trades they make are accessible to the public. Discussion of these trades has especially been active on “r/wallstreetbets”, a subreddit forum where retail investors discuss current stock market trends; the same subreddit in which retail investors banded together to influence the market through the GameStop short squeeze back in January 2021.\n\nPart of the reason why Nancy Pelosi has garnered so much social media attention is due to her successes – one after another…after another. In July 2021, she made $5.3 million by exercising call options to buy 4000 shares of google, moments before the House Judiciary Committee voted on antitrust regulation. Other very profitable stock picks like Tesla, CrowdStrike, and Apple have drawn the eyes of retail investors, even causing a debate about whether Congress members should be allowed to dabble in the stock market or not.\n\nThe multi-millionaire congresswoman has done quite well in the stock market - but she has a competitive advantage: her husband. Paul Pelosi, who was recently arrested and charged with a DUI, runs a venture capital firm and is responsible for all the trades that Pelosi files. According to the New York Post, Pelosi has outperformed the S&P 500 index by nearly 15% in 2020 - Paul seems to be more responsible with his wife's investments than he is behind the wheel. In light of her success, young retail investors are attempting to copy her stock moves to identify long-term winners.\n\nContinue reading: [Pelosi's Popping Portfolio - Nancy Pelosi stock tracker](https://www.jika.io/blog/Pelosi%E2%80%99s%20Popping%20Portfolio%20-%20Nancy%20Pelosi%20stock%20tracker)", "id": "vtf90s", "created_utc": 1657188905.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|4 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vtf90s)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vtf90s)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why can't it be in reverse?

The lowered price target reflects decreased revenue forecasts by \\~2% in both FY’23 and FY’24.\n\n“In our Base case forecast for Apple, we model a revenue CAGR of 10% from CY’19A - CY’23E which we note is an acceleration from the 3% growth the company delivered between CY15A - CY’19A.
