{"title": "Tech Stocks Are Moving Back in Favor. 3 That Are Trying to Break Out.", "selftext": "Technology stocks have been on a tear recently. Traders looking to catch the rally should look to the stocks that have just begun breaking out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 11% from its lowest close of the year in mid-June. That beats the S&P 500’s roughly 8% gain since its mid-June low. Much of what is driving tech’s gains has been related to interest rates. Markets see a higher likelihood that inflation has peaked, and that the Federal Reserve will soon slow down the pace of interest-rate increases. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has slipped since mid-June. Lower bond yields make future profits more valuable—and many fast-growing tech companies are valued on the basis that they’ll churn out a chunk of their profits many years in the future. \n\n**Netflix (NFLX)** is a good example. The stock is up about 31% from its June low. At $218 a share, it’s now above its 50-day moving average of $187. That signifies that market participants are now willing to buy the stock at levels above a longer-term trend. That signals increased confidence in the stock’s outlook. It’s not just lower bond yields juicing the stock. Netflix’s earnings last week revealed fewer subscriber losses than analysts had anticipated, while management said it expects subscriber growth in the current quarter. Analysts are also predicting the company will rely less on upping its spending to accrue new subscribers and grow revenue, which will allow profit margins to expand. Earnings per share are expected to compound at annual rate of about 15% for the next three years, according to FactSet. \n\n**Spotify (SPOT)** is another example of a tech stock that is starting to break out. It has climbed about 20% from its 2022 low hit in mid-May. At $108, it’s above its 50-day moving average of about $105. Plus, buyers have frequently stepped in this year in the low-$90 area, to bring the stock upward. John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote that the stock could have easily hit a “double bottom” in the low-$90 area. Spotify’s earnings are due out Wednesday. That will be a key catalyst keeping the stock trading at healthy levels, or it could send the price tumbling again. \n\n**Amazon.com** **(AMZN)** stock is also looking better. It has jumped about18% from its June bottom and, at $121, it is above its 50-day moving average of $113. A “bullish breakout” is in play if the stock can continue upward, Kolovos wrote.  Earnings for the e-commerce giant are coming Thursday. This all may sound rosy, but there is plenty ahead that could complicate tech stocks’ upward trajectory. Tuesday’s trading is evidence of that: The Nasdaq slid more than 1% after Walmart’s (WMT\\_ earnings warning dented broader market sentiment.

{"title": "Yardeni Says S&P 500 Has Already Bottomed, Sees No Hard Landing", "selftext": "Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech earnings later this week, Ed Yardeni has some words of comfort: the worst has passed for this bear market.\n\nIn the view of the Yardeni Research president, the S&P 500’s plunge last month to a 3,666.77 low likely marked the trough of the 2022 equity rout. Underpinning the sanguine call is the resilience in corporate earnings and the still-healthy outlook for consumers and businesses even as the economy slows.\n\n“It’s never easy to pick a bottom in the stock market, but I’m going to give it a try,” Yardeni said on Bloomberg TV. “The real question is going to be the earnings season, and so far the earnings season is going reasonably well. It has not really thrashed the stock market, and the stock market’s held up quite well.”\n\nThe statement is a large one ahead of a decisive week -- the Fed looks all set for another supersized interest-rate hike on Wednesday, while most mega-cap technology companies, including Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon, Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, will release their earnings reports.\n\nYardeni appears to be in the minority. In Bank of America Corp.’s survey this month, money managers said they’ve cut their equity exposure to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of no faith in recent market bounce. At the end of June, a Deutsche Bank AG poll showed 72% of respondents expected the S&P 500 to fall to 3,300 first, rather than rallying to 4,500.\n\nBut if Yardeni’s track record is any indication, it’s worth heeding the view of a market veteran who coined terms like “Fed Model” and “bond vigilante.” The strategist, who worked at Oak Associates Ltd. and Deutsche Bank before founding his namesake research firm, called the equity bottom the same month when the 1982 bear market ended. He then repeated the success in March 2009 when the S&P 500 reached an intraday low of 666.79 -- 3,000 points below this year’s trough in what he calls another “devilish number.”\n\nRead the full article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yardeni-says-p-500-already-183130142.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yardeni-says-p-500-already-183130142.html)\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX bottomed at 666.79’ says Ed Yardeni, who also predicted the 2009 market bottom. \n\nDo you think the market has bottomed?", "id": "w8ll0v", "created_utc": 1658846608.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|83|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|81|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w8ll0v)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w8ll0v)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Right, and inflation is transitory", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stop the presses!!!!\n\nAn \"expert\" has an opinion.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think we will know a few years from now when we look back and see when the bottom was, until then anything can happen, no one knows what will happen, we may be on our way to 5000 or 2000, the important thing is to look long term, invest only what you are prepared to lose and stop trying to time the market.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "For a moment after reading this comment I’ve thought I was on r investing.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "WTF is this dude smoking.

A total of 19 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla-related investigations, including the most recent fatal Utah crash.\n\nThe Utah Department of Public Safety (DPS) said on Sunday, a Harley Davidson motorcycle was traveling in the high occupancy lane southbound on I-15 near Draper, Utah at 1:09 a.m. when a Tesla collided with the back of the motorcycle, which threw the rider from the bike. The 34-year-old motorcyclist rider suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene.\n\nDPS said \"the driver advised he had the Autopilot setting on\" and did not see the motorcyclist.\"\n\nLast week, NHTSA said it opened a special investigation into the crash of a 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicle that killed a motorcyclist in California. Media reports said a 48-year-old motorcyclist was killed on July 7 after a collision with a 2021 Tesla Model Y on the Riverside Freeway in California.\n\nNHTSA typically opens more than 100 special crash investigations annually into emerging technologies and other potential auto safety issues that have, for instance, previously helped to develop safety rules on air bags.\n\nTesla, which has disbanded its press office, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn June, NHTSA upgraded its defect investigation into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, a required step before it could seek a recall.\nReporting by David Shepardson and Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Chris Reese and Aurora Ellis", "id": "w8vgiw", "created_utc": 1658870417.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|694|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w8vgiw)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w8vgiw)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla drivers are the worst fucking drivers on the road.
