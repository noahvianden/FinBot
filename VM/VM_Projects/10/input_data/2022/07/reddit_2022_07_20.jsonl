With holdings like Teladoc Health Inc. and Spotify Technology SA, the fund aimed to invest in companies that received high scores on transparency. \n\nArk said in a statement that Transparency Global, which shaped the fund‚Äôs underlying portfolio, will stop calculating the index at the end of July.\n\n‚ÄúWhile Ark investigated alternative index providers, it did not find a suitable solution and decided to close the fund,‚Äù according to the release.\n\nThe fund gained only $12 million in assets since inception, a fraction of the $9 billion in Wood‚Äôs flagship fund. It was a rare passive vehicle from Ark, whose active offerings boomed in popularity during the pandemic, with Wood hand-picking stocks that she saw as shaping the future of finance, healthcare and other industries. \n\n‚ÄúThis seemed like an odd fit to me from the beginning,‚Äù said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an investment adviser. ‚ÄúArk made their name by focusing on active management and disruptive innovation. The ARK Transparency ETF was at odds with that approach.‚Äù\n\nThe transparency fund‚Äôs price has dropped more than 30% since its debut in late December. It will no longer accept creation orders after Thursday and won‚Äôt accept redemption orders after July 26, the filing showed. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a difficult year for investors in growth strategies.

Due to this, I got into investing late. Sometime around 2020 right after COVID, one of my buddy recommended me to buy oil and gas stocks. I obliged and put in 20k in GUSH, I think back then it was trading at $40 or so. And also some changes in hotels, GME, AMC, Etc. \n\nAround the beginning of 2021, I was up to 40 or 50k. From there, hearing the news of Ocugen awaiting vaccine approval from the FDA, I was able to scope up Ocugen for $0.10 a share or so, later on in the year I made about 10 to 20k on Ocugen selling it around $8. At this point, I was strictly shares, I did not have any derivatives of any sort. \n\nEnd of 2021, I played around with meme stocks such as PLTR, SPCE, Steel gang, etc. Initially, the success was apparent, WSB was full of pump and dump posts regarding these tickers. I kept a consistent gain selling in morning by monitoring the ticker appearances on the sub. From here I reached around $110k in liquidity starting from 20k in 2020. \n\nAt the end of 2021, I've read about the electric bus program and electric charging stations, and Biden's plan of pushing green energy and passing a new bill. I bought CHPT and PTRA before the bill got passed. This was my downfall. I think my net profit from both tickers was around 10k-20k if realized; however, as a newbie investard I had very unrealistic expectation for both tickers, I think I still do, that's why I lost so much money. \n\nThe gay lord Gabe visited me and gave me the idea of joining the regards of option trading. At first I was doing well, riding the SPY wave up and down and selling in time to cash about 15k of profit. Then March of 2022 hits, I wanted to go for a YOLO play so I bought about 70k of Put option expiring in two weeks, 390P set on SPY. And we all know what happened during March FOMC, stock market rallied, and we stormed all the way back to $460, I still think that shit is crazy as fuck. \n\nThe problem with me is, I get too greedy and refuse to take profits and I sleep too fucking late.

Take a look at this: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSN graph good](https://preview.redd.it/4o8mtlg4jrc91.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ec2825783625374503b3b8a3b7df26dbdf0be8)\n\nWe only need to look at the 1 month here, information overload is a thing and let's be honest, 1 month is more information than we need here, I mean just look at it... It's been going up all month. That's good. Now look at my arrow. Green. That's pointing in a single direction there, UP. If AAL has been been going up all month then more than likely it will be green tomorrow. Don't pay mind to any FAKE NEWS. Spells real good things for their earnings call. \n\nOk, my final piece of evidence here is my inside man. The FEDS HATE HIM, but this one simple trick can make you RICH. See below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx2kzit2rrc91.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=6658bac79c396844631b176224e8f8a03fada781\n\nAnd that's all she wrote folks! As Rasheed Wallace once said \"Ball don't lie.\" What more convincing do you need? Get your calls now, get your money now, get sex now. I know it's pretty late, but put your power to the hour and get in FAST. This right here... This is it. \n\n\\*This is also not financial advice\n\n**TLDR: AAL calls.

{"title": "GEO Group - NYSE: GEO", "selftext": "I currently am looking into undervalued stocks right now, and as interest rates are rising, a lot of the overhyped stocks and alternative assets are being crushed. I am currently using a strategy in which I look for undervalued stocks that have strong catalysts for future growth, pretty much discretionary value investing with a macro focus. \n\n**GEO - The Basics**\n\nGEO makes money through facilities construction and inmate-parolee services. GEO is currently at a market cap of 865 million USD, currently trading at $6.95 a share as of the time I'm writing this. It currently has a large debt burden, but not unmanageable, as debt is at roughly 3 billion and it is currently in the process of restructuring its debt to stagger GEO's payments into the future. It would take several quarters of negative revenue to put it in financial distress, which is unlikely, given that the management team is working with creditors and its operations to reduce costs and debt.\n\n**The Private Prison Industry**\n\nGEO operates in the private prison industry. It is a real estate investment trust that specializes in making money through prison. Republicans are more amicable towards private prison companies, because they see it as an efficient solution to reducing the cost of prison and rehabilitation. Democrats are hostile to those companies, as they view prison companies as profiteering over the corrupt prison system. If democrats stay in power, this company's growth prospects are limited. If Republicans win, this stock can moon.\n\n**What I am doing and why**\n\nI currently put in a small position towards this company because I see the Republicans winning several key races in 2022 and 2024, perhaps giving them control over Congress and the White House. The biggest reasons for this is the economic issues that are being faced over the US, like inflation, rising food prices, and rising gas prices. 2022 might be a wave year for Republicans unless they fumble the bag over the culture war. With Republicans in control, GEO may gain more contracts and would likely trade at higher levels, and it would be much easier for the company to recover from its debt issues.\n\n**Recommended moves**\n\nMy prediction is a price move for November 2024 which would put the company at $24/share. Analyst recommendations are a buy and hold for this year.\n\nAn alternative/less risky move would be to buy some of its debt (if you have enough money).\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are two major risks associated with this play. The first is debt management, the issue in which the company mismanages money and puts it into a debt spiral, and the second is the fact that elections are hard to predict, and as far as I know, I have a 50% chance of getting it right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*This is not financial advice. I am currently buying this stock so take my words with a grain of salt as I am biased.", "id": "w3vziq", "created_utc": 1658347365.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w3vziq)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w3vziq)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I was looking into GEO a couple of weeks ago, but passed on it due to the debt.
