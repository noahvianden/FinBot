Twitter argues that it has every right to do so under a specific performance provision in the deal contract.\n\nThe company, with the help of lawyers at Wachtell (which has also worked for Musk), set fire to Musk’s efforts to drop the bid, which it argued were more about the drop in Tesla’s shares and its effect on Musk’s wealth than anything else.\n\n“Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,” the company said in the suit, adding: “Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” (Musk has not responded to a request for comment.)\n\n Here is what else Twitter said:\n\nThe company gave Musk everything and more on spam accounts, contrary to Musk’s claims that Twitter stonewalled his efforts to get the information he needed to close the deal. But even then, Twitter claims, Musk’s demands became progressively more irrational.\n\n“From the outset, defendants’ information requests were designed to try to tank the deal,” the lawsuit reads. “Musk’s increasingly outlandish requests reflect not a genuine examination of Twitter’s processes but a litigation-driven campaign to try to create a record of noncooperation on Twitter’s part.”\n\nBots do not count as a “material adverse effect” that would justify canceling the deal, despite Musk’s claims that Twitter’s regulatory disclosures, which state that about 5 percent of its accounts are bots, were intentionally misleading. Twitter explicitly said in its regulatory filings that the figures were estimates. And Musk cited fixing the problem of spammers and bots as a primary reason he wanted to buy Twitter, according to the suit.\n\nOn April 9, the day Musk said he wanted to acquire Twitter rather than join its board, he texted Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, to say “‘purging fake users’ from the platform had to be done in the context of a private company because he believed it would ‘make the numbers look terrible,’” the suit reads.\n\nTwitter ran its business in “ordinary course,” meaning consistent with how it previously ran things. Breaking an “ordinary course” provision has gotten a buyer out of a deal before, notably AB Stable’s acquisition of MAPS Hotels and Resorts during the height of the pandemic. Musk accused Twitter of breaking its ordinary course when it, among other things, slowed hiring and fired two executives without telling him.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-lawsuit.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-lawsuit.html)\n\nTwitter filed a lawsuit yesterday in an effort to pressure Elon Musk to finalize his $44 billion acquisition of the company.

FED prefers PCE data as metric for inflation not CPI. \n\n>The CPI measures the change in the out-of-pocket expenditures of all urban households and the PCE index measures the change in goods and services consumed by all households, and nonprofit institutions serving households.  \n\nI guess this is significant because CPI measures prices which might not be because of inflation. AKA sanctions on Russia, oil price fixing. EVs and used car prices....these things cost more for reasons other than oversupply of money. Remove the sanctions, increase the cartels oil production, un-eliminate ICE vehicles so people aren't scrambling to get them to use for parts later.  Because the reality is people actually don't have money to spend which is the opposite of inflation but the CPI says otherwise because of the above.\n\nB. FED uses headline inflation which includes energy and food. That is what Powell said during the last FOMC press meeting. \n\nSignificant because these are the things people have to pay for if they have money or not. Also as stated above, the reading is not necessarily due to inflation. Beating a dead horse when I say, I can tell you my service will cost you 2X more now just because I can afford to. So since my price is higher and is used to measure how much money you have, it doesn't mean you have more money. You can't afford it but my buddy will pay it so I make the same amount.

It shouldn't be a surprise. But it was. In hindsight you can find reports that were correct. These reports actually tracked the prices and calculated the CPI.

In the last 2 years, inflation went up 20%+. Unless if your job is minimum wage, are your salary gonna go up 20%? At low 20% tax bracket, you'd still lose to inflation.

Like how do you not want to buy good companies 50% off? That said, the possibility of another leg lower does exist and if you look back to 2001 and 2002 you would have these multi-week and sometimes multi-month rallies that got everyone on board thinking it was over that finally gave out. Running in all of these day traders that are wearing a bear suit right now would make a lot of sense even if the bottom isn't ultimately in. That's not a prediction, I like buying cheap stocks. I'm 98% long right now, however, I do see a scenario that could lead us lower with earnings revisions and stagnant growth due to lack of productivity globally. It could set up for another 2001 scenario, maybe we don't go as low but it could be just as long. After playing around with some back testing on that one and also looking at the news flow of the time. The single best thing a person could have done is dollar cost average profitable companies or just spy. The ability of just staying out of the markets and letting all of that fall apart was something almost no one could have done. option premiums on the downside also got ridiculously expensive very quickly. I'm sure there were some rock stars that made money shorting that but the smartest way I saw to trade that looking at all the events was to load up on what was going to become the leading sector. Housing. Materials, if you would have bought home builders and steel companies in 2002 and 2003 you would have made a killing 5 years later. So that's the thing right now, keep your eyes peeled for where a future killing is likely to be made.
