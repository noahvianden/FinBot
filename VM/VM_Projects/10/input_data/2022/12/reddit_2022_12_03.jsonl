{"title": "The Wheel , a.k.a \"Sell your winners , keep your losers\" and why do I still use it", "selftext": "There are people here who know more about wheel and they will say I'm all wrong. Whatever, this is mostly for all newbies who ask here \"my cc are itm and I'm going to get assigned, what should I do\".\n\nAnd an obligatory disclosure : all the trades mentioned here were done in the past and should not be considered as a financial advice. \n\n\"Sell your winners\" example:        \nIn September 2016 I bought 2000 shares of AMD at 6.38. \"Great entry\" , someone may say. Well, how about this: by June 2018, through \"sell some high, buy some low\" I managed to have 500 shares with DCA about 0. And then I looked and thought \"What now?\" . If stock doesn't pay dividends then I'm just a proud collector. So I started to sell far OTM covered calls. And then AMD went up and up. I started rolling up and out and eventually I could not without throwing capital in. I gave up the chase and let my 35 calls to get exercised. AMD was at 80 at that time . I was super deep ITM and there were no more 35 strike options in upcoming months. Overall, I sold/rolled  covered calls 38 times. I made decent money on it but it was still less if I held original 2000 and sold at 80 (or even 120 which was top so far). So this can happen to you as well.\n\n\"Keep your losers\" example:           \nIn 2017 bought 1100 Mattel (MAT) shares for 21+ , they paid a decent dividend and I've heard that Barbie dolls were popular in China. And to add to my dividend I was selling covered calls. And then things turned south. ToysRus announced planned closing of stores - MAT goes down, ToysRus closes the stores - MAT goes down again. Well, I still have dividends from it and in the long run it may recover. Then they canceled dividend and stock tanked a lot and the last reason to hold it was gone.  There was a short bump in price on rumors that Hasbro may buy them and I got out at about 9 and some change. I guess, I was young and stupid, I was selling covered calls and waited for them to expire instead of just bailing out right away. Well, it can also be called \"strategy\". Basically, if you sell OTM CSPs and they get assigned you could be wrong about the company. My example shows, there wasn't much wrong with Mattel, it was their distributor ToysRus problems. Moral of the story: covered calls will lock you in and you may not be able to react fast enough. \n\nWhile some may say \"it's not the wheel, you didn't sell CSPs first\", well, I did actually and in case of AMD, several times, that's how I got to DCA of 0. \n\nNow, why I still do it:        \nSame thought, actually - if you have stock that is not paying dividends and you're not selling covered calls then you're just a collector. I do have one position that got to DCA of 0 last year, it's just a money maker now. And I have LUMN that just suspended dividends and is -50% from my average price that etrade shows. Well, after I added up all covered calls I sold and all dividends I got, I'm about to break even . So I can sell more CCs and just hope for buyout - that's right, another lawn, same rake.  And speaking of dividends, over long run, I got more payout from selling CC than from divs. Some food for thoughts.\n\nTL;DR - the title says it all.", "id": "zbqfiq", "created_utc": 1670100946.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Losing trades tend to become my core positions....

And, of course, when the stock is 30% above my strike and it would cost me too much to roll out and up I just say \"well, it's a profit\".

There are too many people who don't realize it's a joke.\n\nAside from taxes, which are a *negative* for the dividend case, there is no functional difference between stocks that pay dividends and stocks that don't. There is no reason to do anything other than accumulate AMD shares if you think AMD shares have good growth potential, on time frames in excess of 15 years. A even if there were reasons, it would never be lack of dividends.\n\nInstead of being ashamed of being a \"collector\", be damn proud that you are not forced by a board room of old geezers deciding when to realize gains on your shares for you (because that's what a dividend payment is).\n\n\"Sell your winners\" is actually a really good way of describing covered calls. It gives just the right twist as a warning. The function of a CC is to sacrifice future gains on the shares in order to get cash today, and \"sell your winners\" is a succinct way of putting that. If you screw up and don't collect enough cash for the gains your sacrificed, that is on *you* for writing a discounted call on your shares in the first place.\n\n\"Keep your losers,\" oof, I felt that one below the belt.
