Did Mercedes or Jaguar pull the plug or something?  They loose their $11B pipeline?\n\nI see 3 hardware sources really:   Nvidia, Intel/Mbly, and self sourced like Tesla (and conceivably Cruise, Baidu maybe others).   What Tesla's experience with their own self driving hardware has shown me (along with data from data center self sourcing like Google and AWS) is that chip building is really hard.\n\nTesla has had 4 tries at self driving hardware.  It's no where near done or good enough.  In fact they have had to de-feature radar to make the computational task less hard.  (Nvidia hasn't they still obviously support image, radar and lidar.)  So Elon is spending in R&D, idk, high $100s of millions to support what, one or two million units a year.   And that's just for hardware.  The software task plus all the money he's spent on Dojo and Supercomputers put it well over $1B at this point.   And then he still need to build chips, install them into the cars already on the street, and new cars, update and troubleshoot those.   It's an expensive mess as far as I'm concerned.  His ego is driving all this.   His company is not a chip design or fabless company at it's core.\n\nGoogle has had a similar experience with their TPU experience.   They also have 4 iterations, it accounts for 11% of their data center/cloud accelerator solution and these are only used internally.  Software is very expensive, as is cooling and deployment in all their data centers world wide.   All their marketing noise about being faster and more task-centric than a GPU, and here we are 8 years later and they have nothing close to H100 performance.   Google to this day buys a ton of GPUs from Nvidia.\n\nMy conclusion here is let the professionals (nvidia) do their job.\n\nI think the EDA tools guys have convinced much of the high tech world building complex parallel computing devices for AI is simple, like baking chocolate chip cookies, just follow the recipe and:  Yours will come out scrumptiously!\n\nThey are all going to beat a path back to Nvidia or Intel.   Nvidia already has carved out their footprint in trucking, auto, agriculture, construction, mining, robots, delivery drones, warehouse automation and on and on.   You can't say that about any other autonomous supplier.

Though of course one day it could all end but at this point that's not a concern.\n\nThat's in contrast with the auto situation where NVDA is currently nowhere close to even being a serious player much less a winner. This topic was broached before but I foresee companies like Mercedes, etc all going out of business, being replaced by the likes of google, tesla, and apple.\n\nThose companies are not going to be interested in an nvidia vendor lock-in relationship even if nvidia's technology is good.\n\n> Google to this day buys a ton of GPUs from Nvidia.\n\nVery important to separate training and inferencing. Wholly different markets. Also very important to be clear headed not just on the size of the market but also its shape and makeup. If a few large companies come to dominate a sector they will be able to eject nvda unilaterally fairly easily. That's not as easy to do for smaller players. \n\n> Tesla/Musk's ego\n\nIt's not clear to me that Tesla is failing with dojo or anything close to that, or if they will return to nvidia. I don't know how serious you are with those comments, they sound super salty LOL. The important thing is nvidia needs to outcompete them, and the fangs, and the chinese versions of those, and everyone else. If they can stay ahead it could be a good business, but the possibility of being squeezed out is high. \n\n> Nvidia already has carved out their footprint in trucking, auto, agriculture, construction, mining, robots, delivery drones, warehouse automation and on and on.\n\nNVDA doesn't really have an advantage over the competitors here, hence the comparison to Tegra. That also carved out a footprint but still ended up being canned. Without an advantage, you need to fight on cost, which is obviously bad.\n\nIn summary, a fail condition is if the auto market comes to be dominated by a next-gen autonomous vehicle ecosystem that's so far superior to what we had before that it represents a total replacement. Think something like the iPhone of cars where one vertically integrated company captures 90% of industry profits.\n\nNVDA can avoid that by just having a great product and shipping faster than competitors. Then they can be a supplier, be the AI OS, like how the Windows ecosystem has a dominant supplier and lots of smaller companies serving it. So time/quality is of the essence.

But that it exists as a risk impacts my investment strategy though.\n\n> Unless you're talking about the teleporter from Star Trek, there is miles of runway for Nvidia ahead in self driving.\n\nNvidia doesn't have to fall behind for market conditions to become bad. Vertical integration is clearly what Waymo, Tesla, and Apple are going to do. None of those 3 companies are going to be buying nvidia. That's just a clear fact. If they (any of the three or all 3) come to dominate, then nvidia is in deep doo-doo even if nvidia's solution is just as good.\n\nCan we establish that as a point we agree on?\n\nI think you're questioning whether or not it makes sense that they could come to dominate, if that is a possible scenario. Chip-making is very hard, it's true. But all 3 of those companies have already done it. Tesla is probably the worst of them, but Apple's chip chops are already proven, and Google's TPUs are good. I don't see a world where they would need to \"call an expert\" as other companies might.\n\nIn terms of dominating the industry, future autonomous vehicles should crush manual cars in sales. It could take 5-10 years. My guess is level 2024 for the initial release of a level 5 vehicle. Apple could produce 100k for that year. https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-car Tesla is of course already producing millions.\n\nIt doesn't really matter how fast it happens, as any business earned during that time would still be semi-pointless. Becoming a blackberry supplier in 2014 is not a huge win. My belief is that a vertically integrated car company would be disruptive in unpredictable ways.\n\nFor example, cars could become loss leaders to sell ads or in-vehicle entertainment. Regular people could stop buying cars in favor of ordering a very cheap auto-taxi service. Cars could also be subsided by their ability to also double as taxis. Apple's vehicle could be shockingly revolutionary if the steering wheel-less, total luxury interior concept is taken seriously.\n\nIf large, vertically integrated companies could pull off disruptive changes better than trad car companies, then they are dead.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> We see the world differently.

{"title": "The Buffett indicator - Everything you need to know", "selftext": "The Buffett indicator is \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\" - This is a quote by no other than the legendary Warren Buffett.\n\nThe goal of this post is to explain what this indicator is, how it is being calculated, the logic behind it as well as the challenges that come with it.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n**What is the Buffett indicator?**\n\nIn one sentence, it is a simple ratio between the market cap of the public companies within a certain country and the GDP of the same country. So, what does this ratio tell us, how should one read it?\n\nTo best understand the logic behind it, let's go to the extremes and imagine that there's a country with the following assumptions\n\n1. All companies are public.\n2. The country is isolated (does not trade with any other country)\n\nIf this is the case, the market cap would represent how much one should pay to buy ALL of the companies that are out there. These companies are also responsible for the output of the goods and services that are measured through the GDP.\n\nOver a long period of time, this ratio would give us an idea of whether the stock market is expensive or cheap, which is the purpose of this indicator.\n\nOf course, in reality, these assumptions aren't true.\n\nFor the US, the Buffett indicator is being measured by taking the Wilshire 5000 (a market-cap-weighted index of the market value of American stocks traded in the US) as it includes a majority of the common stocks and REITs and it is being compared against the US GDP.\n\nBack in the 1950s, a normal ratio (where the stock market is fairly valued) was around 45%. Today, 70 years later, a normal ratio is considered around 120%. (Note, the % mentioned are only applicable to the US)\n\nSo, why is this ratio increasing over time? There are 3 arguments to touch upon:\n\n1. There are more public companies over time - This is the weakest argument as there are also companies that are being de-listed for various reasons)\n2. International sales impact market value, not GDP - This is a strong argument. Numerous companies create value outside of the US and that is captured in their market cap. However, this isn't captured in the GDP of the US.\n3. Technological advances combined with increased productivity increase profits - This is also a strong argument. If a company manufactures chairs and discovers a new more efficient and effective ways to make the same chair, well, the output is the same, so there won't be any change when it comes to the GDP. However, the margins will increase, which means higher profits, and that of course leads to a higher market cap.\n\n**Can the indicator be used for countries other than the US?**\n\nThe indicator can be calculated for almost all countries, but there are a lot of things to keep in mind.\n\n1. It requires obtaining data for a fairly long period of time. A decade isn't enough if the stocks are expensive or cheap throughout the entire decade.\n2. There's no % as a benchmark that can be used to assess whether the stock market is expensive or cheap. This is an indicator that provides insights once it is compared to itself at a different point in time.\n3. Events that have significant value should be identified. These are rare, but there's an example of Aramco, one of the largest public companies, which became a public company a few years ago. Of course, this had no impact on the GDP of Saudi Arabia, but it added 7 trillion Saudi Riyal (around $2 trillion) to the market cap.\n4. If public companies contribute a fairly low % of the GDP, the indicator is almost useless\n\n**How useful is the indicator?**\n\nIn the past,  it is quite clear that the indicator can remain around 1 standard deviation (above and below) for an extended period of time. However, on only two occasions did it reach the height of 2 standard deviations in this millennium. Once, during the dot-com bubble and the second time at the last peak in 2020/2021. In both cases, there was a correction fairly soon.\n\nThis might be another tool in the arsenal for the individual investor to assess where the market is.\n\n**The criticism**\n\nHowever, in my opinion, this indicator should be used in combination with other relevant financial data. The indicator is rightfully criticized for ignoring the interest rate. Of course, this has a significant impact on the valuation of the companies. Although there were 2 occasions where the indicator showed the market was significantly overvalued, in the first case (with the dot com bubble), the 10-year Treasury rate was over 6%. In the second case, it was closer to 1%.", "id": "zchv0s", "created_utc": 1670179627.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "This is a useful post in that it correctly describes reasons to *disregard* the Buffett Indicator.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "I tried to be objective without leaning any way and let the reader decide whether this indicator is useful :)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I find it perplexing that the Buffett Indicator is assigned any consideration in 2022, when companies whose stocks make up the market, do so much international business. \n\nEdit: removed reference to GM to revisit/brush up s bit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "International business by itself is not a problem in the Buffett indicator.\n\nThe issue is repatriation of profits and if they are kept overseas a long time.

I had 20 put contracts of TSLA I re-bought on Friday (very OTM), so I’m mostly out of the market. Don’t know what to do now lmao.\n\nHere’s my bear case:\n- Recession. Most bear markets do not end without a recession.\n- Multiple compression. A recession will cause earnings expectations, which are still very high, to come down. But at the same time we are expecting the Fed Funds rate to reach at least 5% at some point in the near future, so this could cause multiples to compress further and stocks to come down even if there are no change in the fundamentals of the company. \n- Fed policy operates with a lag. The Fed has been removing $100+ billion of liquidity every month since September, so this may not start affecting the market for at least a couple of months. Just remember that most of the bull market after 2020 was a result of the massive amount of liquidity pumped into the market, and now the Fed is doing the opposite. Also if we do go into an economic downturn, it will be made worse by this “lag” of highly restrictive monetary policy for the preceding several months.\n- Capitulation has not yet occurred. Retail has been net buyers of stocks for most months so far with no significant selling. Most of the selling has been done by the institutions. \n- Inflation is still too high and may be “sticky” according to some economists.
