The quarterly triple witching expiration of equity derivatives boosted market movements on Friday as well.  \n\n\nThe performance of US treasuries was mixed, with short-term bonds rallying on Friday. The policy-sensitive two-year yield was nearly 19 basis points lower at the end of the week. The value of the dollar had hardly changed. Oil is up for the week.  \n\n\nEarlier this week, investors cheered softer-than-expected inflation data. However, the euphoria faded as Fed officials hammered home the message that rates will remain higher until they are confident that inflation has been subdued. While the Fed raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, risk assets have been under pressure since policymakers signalled a peak rate that was higher than market expectations. This week saw a wave of rate hikes and hawkish forecasts from central banks around the world, including the ECB.  \n\n\nTraders also had to contend with a slew of US data this week that showed the economy cooling while the labour market remained strong. This did not sit well with investors, as labour market softening remains a major concern for the Fed.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n* **\\[15:32 ET\\]** Fed's Mester: I expect the Fed to hike by more than its median forecast.\n* **\\[12:44 ET\\]**¬†Fed's Daly: If necessary, I'm prepared to maintain peak rate for more than 11 months.\n* **\\[08:35 ET\\]**¬†Fed's Williams: Possible that the Fed will hike more than the FOMC terminal rate forecast.\n\n# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA - Monday December 19, 202\n\nI‚Äôd like to see a backtest to where the 20 MA acts as resistance this week.
