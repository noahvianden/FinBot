Blockbuster does however allow me to watch stuff that I would normally have to order in the mail from Netflix but again, the prices for it is crazy and you still don't necessarily get a the best picture.\n\nThe store front Blockbuster has and the access to discounted game rental is also an added bonus.\n\nWhat else is there that I'm missing?", "id": "loikk", "created_utc": 1319558775.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 7, "comments": [{"body": "NFLX isn't buying back, they bought back at 218 per share.

This is classic \"it was high so it will get back up there\" logic which can cost you a lot of money.  Look at YHOO.\n\nHere is why I'd have no money in Netflix.\n\n1. They have shown HUGE management blunders and even their apologies and explanations to customers and investors were half-assed at best.\n\n2. They were priced for perfection. The P/E is now 19.63 which seems reasonable until you see that AAPL's is 14.37.  A lower valuation from a company that has much better execution.\n\n3. They are losing their biggest competitive advantage.  First is sometimes important, but they own no content.  They must license the content, and they have nothing special that a content owner (Warner Bros., Sony, EMG) cannot do on their own.\n\n4. Shrinking margins.  As the competition gets bigger,  the margins will shrink and content license gets more expensive.\n\nWhy by a 19 PE when I can buy a 14 PE with better management, more pricing control, kicking competitors asses, and huge competitive advantages?\n\nI dont know how experienced you are, but the questions isn't whether or not NFLX is a good buy, but what is a better buy.

It could probably have held in the low-mid 200s for a long time, as earnings caught up to the inflated price. Reed's actions have driven hundreds of thousands of customers to cancel. Countless more, like myself, chose one-or-the-other options and cut my bill (and NFLX's revenue) in half--I dropped to limited 2-disc/mo model.
