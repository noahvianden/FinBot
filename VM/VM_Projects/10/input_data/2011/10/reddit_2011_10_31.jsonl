{"title": "Your opinions on stock trading accounts.", "selftext": "I was just curious on what stock trading websites that you find to be your favorite? I currently am using [Share Builder](http://www.sharebuilder.com) first, because I already had an ING savings account so it is quick and easy to transfer money between the two accounts. I dislike the idea of the $9.95 fee I get to buy then again to sell, but it seems those are the only two fees I get, and as of right now I am not day trading or anything, just sitting on a few stocks. So I like using Share Builder for the time being. I started shopping around and went with [Options House](http://www.optionshouse.com) who offered to give me 100 free trades, then only a $3.95 after that. The thing I disliked with Options House was that the smallest amount I could transfer from my checking account to start trading was $1000 and you got a $15 transfer fee when you did so. As of right now I am only dealing with small amounts when I have the extra cash, so that didn't appeal to me. I then saw [Zecco](http://www.zecco), but again, I could only transfer a minimum of $1000, and I don't recall the other fees. I am feeling confidant and am thinking about investing my tax return into the stock market beginning of next year and am think about using a new site to buy/sell stocks because I dislike thinking that I have to make more that $19.90 at Share Builder to start making a profit. I was curious what everyone likes for their personal trading abilities, or what someone might suggest. \n\nThe other thing I found I like when using Share Builder is that it is really basic and easy to use. When I opened Options House, I felt overwhelmed by the platform, it was very busy and a bit confusing, though I did understand everything. I am also interested in a site that would have an Apple app. Thanks!", "id": "lv982", "created_utc": 1320076114.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I thought I read that you got a $15 fee, maybe I miss read.
