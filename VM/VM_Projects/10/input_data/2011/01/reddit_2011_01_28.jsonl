There are several major, major gaming releases coming up in the late part of 2011 that I don't think are fully on Wall St radar.  My belief in these stocks have nothing to do with the fundamentals of the companies or technical indicators or anything.  It's simply that there are is going to be some major (and unexpected) buzz around several game releases.  Generally, if investors start hearing positive news on a regular basis about a company, that stock will go up, even if the strength of the company is questionable.  I see ATVI and TTWO getting up to $15-17 (one or the other, probably not both), and I see ERTS getting up to $20.  I plan on getting into ERTS (despite their awful management) if the stock drops below $14.50, and I'll be getting into both ATVI and TTWO in the near future.  I'm not sure of the entry point, however.  Though, I agree, TTWO is annoying that it's been bullish lately.  I think that's been premature.  Still, keep your eyes on November....", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm in both ATVI and TTWO. TTWO has been rising on buyout rumors.

I know we all hear it all the time, but to execute this is really the key.  You must, must, must not take action until a trend has broken down.  Yes, Bears have been waiting for a dip for months (actually it has been about two years, time flys by) and MOST Bears have been shorting.  It's pathetic actually.  People often get greedy and have to be in the market all the time.  This Bull market has not broken down, shesh, it's INCREDIBLY strong.  This recently two year bull market may go down in history as one of the most strong Bull markets ever.  Yet, people \"feel\" like we are in a Bear market.  That is the definition of a Bull market, one where prices go up and nobody believes it.  Once everyone believes it then start paying attention to the downside.  I know that Bull markets go on for a long time, but when the time comes (and you have to WAIT for when the time comes) there is a bucket load of cash to make on the short side.\n\nTL;DR No, I don't anticipate a downturn soon, fortunately that doesn't matter", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}
