{"title": "Market Bottom or Bounce?", "selftext": "We now have had two very positive days in the markets with DOW up 250 points.  I would love to say that this is the bottom, it is always easier to make money in market when stocks are rising, but unfortunately I am going to remain cautious here because I am just not convinced.  There just are too many negatives out there which can still happen and this market is very fragile and can get spooked quite easily.  This effect is always amplified in the summer months because usually summer months have much lower volume than the other seasons.  With this a light volume wide range buying day like today can look very positive while a negative tremor can look like a disaster with the averages falling 2%. \n\nhttp://www.vinnystocktips.com/?p=150", "id": "ibvvh", "created_utc": 1309312740.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "quarter end window dressing....sold to you on july 5th.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Timing the market is a waste of money.
