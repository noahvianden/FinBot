The housing market bubble burst in 2007-2008, leading to widespread foreclosures and evictions. This led to a domino effect throughout the economy, as businesses failed and people lost their jobs. The stock market crashed in September 2008, losing trillions of dollars in value. Major banks collapsed and had to be bailed out by the government. The recession lasted for several years afterwards, causing hardship for millions of people around the world. \nThere are a few ways that investors can profit from a recession: buying distressed assets at low prices (such as foreclosed homes), shorting stocks or investing in inverse ETFs (which go up when markets fall), or simply holding cash until conditions improve.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: -How did people see the 08 crash coming?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
{"title": "Behemoth v2: NIO", "selftext": "Hey guys\n\nBack at it with another DD.  Going to keep it short and hopefully it help somebody, had many people pm last time thanking me for last one.  Hope i am right on this one.\n\n\nI'm sure everyone read the news on BABA and how Jack Ma is finally back in China and BABA is to be split into 6 to promote competitiveness.  This in itself is very significant, because the Chinese government has a big change top down and this further shows that they are trying to open up their economy instead of isolating themselves like the past decade especially the past few years.  I firmly believe the next big plays are for Chinese stocks, and it should be in every portfolio as a hedge because their valuation are cheap, and the banking system is heavily regulated so it is not as prone to banking crisis.  China's central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for financial institutions by 0.25 percentage points yesterday to boost liquidity.  That means more money and is in a way QE because it boost the real economy and eventually lead to more spending.  More spending means more EV and better business environment.  On the other hand, US stocks are getting battered, crypto the safe heaven is getting \"regulated\" or whatever you want to call it.   Out of the chinese stocks, I believe the best one to long would be NIO without a doubt.\n\nPros:\n\n- Chinese EVs like NIO are extremely cheap and battered due to the Tesla price cuts and it poses such a big opportunity\n\n- Record deliveries, expect to double sales this year\n\n- 1000 new battery swap stations, there is nothing like it of this scale anywhere in the world.  It's really that good, and convenient.  Huge selling point. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTXptUuKGrc\n\n- On track to break even next year, this is huge, remember when Tesla finally broke even?   https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-maker-nio-surges-says-022624895.html\n\n- Have a huge fan base similar to Tesla, my family just bought an ES8 and they absolutely loves it \n\n- Delisting is behind us\n\n- many many many more\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Geopolitical tension\n\n- Last earning was very bad, but this is where opportunities comes from right?  \n\n- Some scandals with employees \n\nGuys this is a real company, no one will come close to Tesla but this one is as close as it gets IMO.  \nHope this help somebody as always, Good luck!\n\n40253 shares @9.01", "id": "124sy7i", "created_utc": 1680018008.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Something something China Hustle", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "LOL people still think this is a fake company selling fake cars?
