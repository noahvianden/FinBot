Riley Wealth Management. ‚ÄúIt took Jay Powell, over the course of a very brief prepared statement and a Q&A, to get those expectations cemented into a higher place.‚Äù\n\nAs part of his mandated semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Powell spoke Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee then the day after to the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nHeading into the appearances, markets had been looking for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at its meeting later this month, then perhaps two more moves before stopping, with the end point around 5.25%.\n\nThat changed after Powell‚Äôs appearance, during which he cautioned that if inflation data remains strong, he expects rates to go ‚Äúhigher than previously anticipated‚Äù and possibly at a faster pace than a quarter point at a time.\n\nMarkets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/powell-changed-everything-this-week-on-markets-view-of-interest-rates.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/powell-changed-everything-this-week-on-markets-view-of-interest-rates.html)", "id": "11mzwhs", "created_utc": 1678387025.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Powell changed everything this week on markets view of interest rates", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What is this word vomit from CNBC... literally nothing was said that he has not said before in some form or other.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly but this time the market actually understood what he said.
