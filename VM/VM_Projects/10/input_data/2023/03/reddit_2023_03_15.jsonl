This will help you weather any unexpected financial hardships that may arise during a recession.\n\nPay down debt: During a recession, it can be challenging to keep up with debt payments, especially if you lose your job or your income decreases. Paying down debt now can reduce your financial burden later.\n\nDiversify your investments: It's important to have a well-diversified investment portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes. This can help reduce your overall risk and mitigate losses during a market downturn.\n\nEvaluate your expenses: Look for ways to trim your expenses and cut unnecessary costs. This can help you save money and reduce your financial stress during a recession.\n\nStay informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest economic news and trends. Pay attention to economic indicators such as GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment rates. This information can help you make well-informed financial decisions during a recession.\n\nIn summary, preparing for a recession requires planning and foresight.

On a 12-month basis, the index increased 4.6%, well below the downwardly revised 5.7% level from the previous month.\n\nExcluding food, energy and trade, the index rose 0.2%, down from the 0.5% gain in January. On an annual basis, that reading was up 4.4%, the same as in January. Excluding food and energy, PPI was flat, vs. the estimate for a 0.4% gain.\n\nA 0.2% drop in goods prices helped fuel the headline decrease, representing a sharp pullback from the 1.2% surge in January. Final demand foods tumbled 2.2%, while energy declined 0.2%.\n\nMost of the drop in goods stemmed from a 36.1% plunge in chicken egg prices, which had soared over the past year.\n\nIn a separate important data point Wednesday, the [Commerce Department reported](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) that retail sales fell 0.4% in February, according to data that is not adjusted for inflation. The total was in line with expectations and dragged down by a 1.8% slide in auto sales.\n\nFood services and drinking establishments, which had seen strong receipts over the past year, fell 2.2% for the month, though they were still up 15.3% on an annual basis.

HELOCs are one of the things that will bankrupt this country. When house prices tripled in 10 years, people started building a lifestyle on HELOCs. Just doing the minimum payment to cover the interest the whole time. They've even gone to the extend of buying more houses on the equity of the houses. So it's become a house of cards. When interest rates go up and they are leveraged to the max, they can't sell their houses to start paying up some of the debt because the market is also down. Oh we also have 25 year financing negotiated every 5 years... so imagine all this variable rate debt over variable debt just piling up. That's what generated economic activity and now landlords are trying to max their rent income to stay afloat. Anyhow... it's all going down and will crash.

It's super rare that HELOCs are drawn to 100% and I'm willing to bet that they aren't right now\n\nFurthermore loan aging really matters when it comes to mortgages. Home prices (collateral) tends to appreciate over time so a fixed mortgage with a HELOC (which generally don't exceed 90-95%) C-ltv at origination are really like 70-80% C-ltv if originated a few years ago.\n\nEven if people are only making the minimum payment because it's all they can afford right now they can draw on the HELOC to make future payments. This gives the collateral time to appreciate and de-risks the loan despite increasing the balance\n\nAlso important to note:\n\nAll the losses you see banks incurring because of higher interest rates are due to borrowers becoming better off (they are inflating away fixed rate debt)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I understand and am aware of everything you said. Though some markets are not as stable as the US market. This probably doesn't make sense to a lot of Americans but your market is so much more stable than ours here. \n\nI totally agree with working people inflating away their fixed interest debt. That's one reason why some type of MBSs aren't paying as much to the holder today. Normally you'd expect a certain portion of people to pay up their mortgage faster/earlier due to inheritance, bonuses etc. Right now it's melting away with inflation and even against interest on some savings accounts. \n\nI've recently read about private label MBSs becoming relatively more popular in the last couple of years.

Same idea with credit cards - lots of people don't pay but rates are 30% so who cares.\n\nI'm not saying that HELOCS are impossible to go bad on. They do charge off occasionally, and it's important to take into account the loss ratio of those charge offs (often times you can recover a good portion of the loan by reposessing the house). To see any big losses on HELOCs I think property values would need to drop 40% or so\n\nBut - I think the much bigger risk lies in the commercial real estate market.

It looks like lots of loans went to high quality borrowers. Bet you they aren't as high quality as it looks\n\n2- recently originated fixed rate mortgages. High rate, high home price, it's a recipe for disaster\n\n3- mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments.
