But, as I write, TSLA is at 239.79, and the bid on the long is 87.9. Let's stipulate (though this wouldn't actually happen) that when TSLA is ar 254, the long has gained in value in intrinsic value only, so that its bid will be 102.11.\n\nYou get assigned on the shorts. You sell 200 shares short at 252.5. You receive 2 x 252.5 x 100 = $50500 cash for this.  You can sell the longs for 2 x 102.11 x 100 = $20422.  It costs 200 x 254 = $50800 to buy to cover the short shares.  Thus your net P/L is -18010 + 316 + 50500 + 20422 - 50800 = $2428.\n\nThe broker doesn't \"settle\" anything, unless they are Robinhood, in which case they don't do the above, they just exercise the longs instead.  Rather, the broker assigns you on the shorts, and you have to decide what to do next.  If you don't have enough margin buying power to hold those 200 shares short, they will notify you of a margin call, and tell you have to take action to address it.

For a non-professional options trader, do you validate the option price by plugging the variables into a (standard or customised) Black-Scholes model, or do you take it at face value that the option is fairly priced?\n\nThe option is *always* fairly priced, so that is the wrong thing to validate. The market price is the price the market *discovered*. It doesn't come from some magic computer in the sky that sometimes makes mistakes. It's a real-time summary of the market discovering it's consensus.\n\nBut nothing and no one can predict the future and sometimes the consensus is either too optimistic or too pessimistic when compared, in retrospect, to what ends up happening in the future. That's where modeling and forecasting comes in. If you can come up with a more accurate forecast than what is implied by the discovered spot price, by using Black-Scholes or more likely a proprietary model that fixes a weakness in Black-Scholes (like the constant volatility assumption), you may have an edge.\n\nHere is an excellent example of a process of forecasting and uncovering an edge:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/13du9k2/gld_trade_analysis_are_you_too_dumb_to_predict/\n\n> When you write / sell options, do you pick the option's variables and parameters? If yes, then presumably you cannot do this without having a model to price your option, after you've selected the parameters.\n\nNo. At least, not directly. You pick a contract, and the contract carries with it discovered values for variables baked into the spot price. The values of the variables are *descriptive*, not *predictive*. And you for sure don't start with a bunch of values and create a contract to match.\n\n> If there's a stock, is there an option? Do options exist for all stocks, or only the most actively traded stocks?\n\nNo, not all equities have options, not all indexes have options, not all futures have options.\n\nAfter accounting for minimum capitalization and registration requirements for standard exchange-traded options, issuance of options for various underlyings is pretty arbitrary. There is a popularity bias, but since popularity ebbs and flows over time, what you see today is the *peak* popularity of an underlying from some point in the past, which may have been years ago. It's current popularity may be far below the threshold where, if a decision was made today, no options would be issued.\n\nSo a consequence is that there are *more* options issued today than might be called for, given the current popularity of the underlying. But still not every underlying has options.\n\nFor example, SPY and VOO are ETFs that cover the same index, the S&P 500. VOO came later and is arguably the superior product, since its expense ratio is a fraction of SPY's, but SPY got first-mover status and is much more popular for options trading than VOO, so has way more contracts issued.\n\n> The Last == Premium? This is what you pay for the contract * 100. So prices for the different contracts are $610, $211, $89, $100.\n\nNot specifically, no. Premium is a synonym for contract price. There is no one premium, just like there is no one price. You can talk about spot premium, last premium, previous closing premium, premium at open, etc., etc.\n\nLast just means that price that the last order was filled at. You can also think of it as the last discovered price. But since \"last\" can be hours old, it's not all that useful a number. It's usefulness is a function of volume.\n\n> So prices for the different contracts are $610, $211, $89, $100.\n\nNo. See below, and until a trade is filled, there is no one price for a contract. The price is a bounded range, with the bid on the low end of the range and the ask at the high end. It's best to state spot prices as a bid/ask spread. That's more accurate than using last. BTW, the mid-point of the bid/ask is called the mark and that is also not \"the price\". It's just an average that you can use as a placeholder price when the bid/ask is too clunky, keeping in mind that it is just a single-number placeholder or estimate. A guess, if you will.\n\n> Looking at the first and last contracts ($610 and $100)\n\nThat would be a last of $6.10 vs. $0.10 in per-share numbers, or $610 vs. $10 in x100 total dollars. It's best to keep numbers that started out in per-share units in per-share units throughout.\n\n> the changes to the strike price are -2.4% and 3.53%\n\nI don't know what your last column means or what those percentages are. Without more context from the broker UI and full table, those are meaningless numbers. I suspect that even with the full context, they are still meaningless or pointless.\n\n> So, is it right to say that market participants think there's a ~6x higher likelihood that the stock drops 2.4% than rises 3.5%?\n\nNo, or at least, you can't draw that conclusion from only the numbers in your post.\n\n> What is the Open Int.?\n\nThe number of contracts outstanding as of the previous market close.

Yet they're clearly not.  What accounts for the difference?  For example, PLTR and MARA are two stocks currently trading in the same range; they closed on Friday at 18.20 and 18.29, respectively.  In both of their options chains, the 18.50 strike call is the first one out of the money; that is, the call with the lowest strike whose strike is still greater than the spot price of the underlying.  Yet the 12/22 18.50 strike call on PLTR has an ask of 0.44, while the 12/22 18.50 strike call on MARA has an ask of 0.92.  Why are they so different?\"\n\nIs that what you're asking?\n\nIf so, there are several reasons.  For one, the prices of those two stocks aren't exactly the same.  18.20 =/= 18.29.  Also, \"first strike out of the money\" just isn't something that means anything.  What you have to look at is delta.  If you aren't comparing two options that have the same delta, you're comparing apples and oranges.  And the PLTR 12/22 18.50c has a delta of 0.45, while the MARA 12/22 18.50c has a delta of 0.47.\n\nStill, these don't seem like big differences, right?  That's why the other factor is volatility.  MARA is a much more volatile stock than PLTR: almost twice as volatile, in fact.  PLTR's implied volatility (IV) is 59%, while MARA's is 113.33%!
