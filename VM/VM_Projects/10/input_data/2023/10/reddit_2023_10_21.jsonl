I finished the week slightly down, but at one point I was down over 5%. FED Chair Powell spoke but he didn’t really indicate any new information. The markets really seem to be holding onto his every word. I’m still choosing to believe the FED will raise rates by 0.25% basis points on 1 NOV after the next FED meeting (31 OCT – 1 NOV); if not NOV then in DEC.\n\nDespite the 6 positions I closed for profit, this week was marked by my unrealized losses in TLT and TBT. I opened the VIX position as insurance on a broader market pullback, and because the VIX typically doesn’t hang out around 20 for very long; I closed this position on FRI for a small profit. Recently the market has been climbing despite increasing interest rates. This is a particularly unusual occurrence, and it cannot last. \n\nNext week, I plan to close my XLV and XLC Credit Spreads. If my TLT and TBT spreads do not improve I will close them out and open new similar spreads in their place with further out strikes. At this point I am not too far from my max loss on both of my TLT and TBT spreads so I am currently only risking another $180 in total loss but if they move back the other way, I could recover more than $900. That’s a sizeable hedge in case the market decides it wants to surge higher in the next two weeks. \n\nI post my trades within 15 minutes of execution: [https://x.com/HermesLux](https://x.com/HermesLux) \n\nMy rules for opening and closing: [https://x.com/HermesLux/status/1705247698507407526](https://x.com/HermesLux/status/1705247698507407526) \n\nThetagang on X: [https://x.com/i/communities/1712295892877725963](https://x.com/i/communities/1712295892877725963) ", "id": "17d1q8h", "created_utc": 1697892191.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "I was expecting a positive outcome last week since you typically bet on a bear week.\n\nStill a solid job YTD.\n\nDo you capture the interest that you can get from your cash (~5%) somewhere?", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, the TBT and TLT positions I have held me back significantly.
