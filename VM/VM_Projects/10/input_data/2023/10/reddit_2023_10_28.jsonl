{"title": "Free Peer Reviewed & Collegiate (MIT) Courses", "selftext": "I always knew I was a strange kid when in high school I learned about options and became engrossed in learning about markets. For those that don't have that same strange curiosity I do but want a short list to some great free information, here's a list of MIT and other institutions courseware that provide free access. I regularly keep track and take the free courses I can find. I studied stats heavily in my undergrad and grad which has been very useful for me in trading options. \n\nBelow are a few cool courses:\n\n1.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=eG\\_aRPy1KVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=eG_aRPy1KVE)\n      1. This is an hour and 20 minute course on option pricing and their probability duality\n2.

[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-997-practice-of-finance-advanced-corporate-risk-management-spring-2009/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-997-practice-of-finance-advanced-corporate-risk-management-spring-2009/)\n   1. *I really like this one for retail traders to gain a better understanding of how intuitions think*\n5.

This has an hour plus long video included on YouTube covering options utilization - this one is a bit dated but the concepts remain solid.\n\nHere are some of my favorite recent (released within 5 years) white papers.\n\n1. **Easy Volatility Investing (2013)** \n   1. Okay, I lied this one is old but a really great paper that discusses the overly beaten dead horse that is selling options being related to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller (PS. steamrollers are pretty slow, just fucking move)\n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=2255327](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2255327)\n2. **Retail Option Trading and Liquidity: Evidence from High-Frequency Data**\n   1. This paper dives into the impact of options markets on liquidity of stocks. Primary use here isn't really the liquidity impact to retail traders, but to institutions and MMs, which retail traders still work around. \n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4567604](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4567604)\n3. **Why Do Insiders Sell Stocks after Receiving Options?**\n   1. This one is pretty cool and talks about insider trading behavior, specifically trading activity around option grants where net sales after receiving options drastically increases. \n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4587326](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4587326)\n4. **Forecasting Stock Returns with Lstm for Options Trading**\n   1. LSTM is a neat approach to options trading by integrating long short-term memory, it also includes monte carlo simulations. Leveraging different frequency prices as features and incorporating the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing backtesting performance and filtering trading strategies based on expected values.\n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4581285](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4581285)\n5. **A Market Maker of Two Markets: The Role of Options in ETF Arbitrage**\n   1. Another cool study that covers how market makers use options in arbitraging ETFs \n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4395938](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4395938)\n6. **Trading Activity of VIX Futures and Options Around FOMC Announcements**\n   1. These last two are some of my favorites from this years releases. From the abstract:  We provide empirical evidence that the abnormal order imbalances of VIX futures and call (put) options are significantly negative (positive) during FOMC embargoes. Our results remain robust under various empirical approaches for examining FOMC announcements. We also find that the VIX return (trading volume) is negatively (positively) associated with FOMC announcements. Overall, we document short-lived informational advantages in the VIX derivatives market and provide evidence of potential information leakage during FOMC embargoes. \n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4559935](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4559935)\n7. **Do Variance Expectations Overreact? Evidence From the Cross-section of Stock Options**\n   1. Second more recent favorite study. They used IV as a proxy for variance expectations and found strong evidence of overreaction to variance news in a cross-section analysis. This highlights how effective things like straddles are at capturing the overreaction effect (variance premiums)\n   2. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4554103](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4554103)\n\nI stay up to date on these studies because I find them interesting and they give me ideas to test.
