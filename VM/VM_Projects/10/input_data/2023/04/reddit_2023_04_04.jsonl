Their growth recently is crazy from the AI hype, and I’m up way over 20% on them, so instead of gamble missing out on more upside by taking gains now, wouldn’t it make sense to just set a trailing stop if like 10-12% and let it play out?\n\nI mean sure, I stand to lose 10-12% of my gains if they tank from here, but I could lose more if I sold now and they keep going up.

The end result is a bull call spread and a covered call per 100 shares owned. It should be done for the nearest possible expiration.\n\nThe premium received for selling the higher strike should be at least 1/2 the cost of the lower strike so that the ratio spread costs nothing. A credit is even better.\n\nIf the repair does not work out and share price is at or below the strike price of the long call, you'll have the same downside loss potential as just holding the stock, collecting dividends (if any) and hoping for a recovery.\n\nThe short strike should be about midway between the current price and your break even price. You can use higher or lower strikes depending on what the numbers look like.\n\nImplied volatility affects a repair’s cost or credit. The lower it is, the more costly the repair. If higher (for example, pre earnings), the credit will be larger and that may enable you to use a lower pair of strikes which then has a higher probability of the upper strike being reached and the repair succeeding.\n\nDoing a Repair with a lot of time until expiration can be problematic because you won't see the full profit if the underlying reaches the higher strike before expiration.\n\nIf possible, I tend to roll the Repair up and out when the bull call spread has a large profit (before it goes ITM).

{"title": "Trading sideways indeed.", "selftext": "I’ve heard a lot of people suggest that markets may trade sideways for a while since there aren’t many catalysts the last few days. \n\nBut damn, I don’t think I’ve ever seen all 4 futures indices be so close to flat hours into the day. \n\nSeems like there are essentially an equal number of bullish and bearish drivers at play resulting in no clear path forward. \n\nOPEC oil cuts, credit markets tightening, uncertain fed direction, robust earning and solid guidance, geopolitical tensions, domestic politics, a lack of compelling non-equity plays, and the omnipresent impending recession that just continues to be “eventually yes, but not yet” are likely all influencing factors but none seem to be having sufficient pressure to move things in any one direction. \n\nI’m probably missing a lot of obvious drivers of other drivers but the ones I listed are just off the top of my head. \n\nAnd I spent way too much time hoping to see all 4 hit zero at the same moment. It reminded me of the DVD logo cold open from 'The Office' when it hits the corner just right. After 15 minutes I conceded that maybe it is just not possible to see 4x zeros across all the major US indices. \n\nAnd my play on this market is to basically just do nothing. I’m sure there are opportunities to be had, but I feel like holding the large equity positions that make up most of my portfolio for the time being is the appropriate, and acceptable level of risk for now. Maybe some stellar earnings or an unexpected higher or lower jobs report on Friday will kickstart some action. \n\nEdit: things turned positive in the time it took me to draft this post. Hallelujah!
