{"title": "SPY Market Overview week of 4/17 - 4/21", "selftext": "Last week there seemed to be a glimmer of hope that inflation growth was finally contained, with a very promising CPI number of 5% Year on year growth, however it later came out that core CPI was larger than that, so we are still unclear when the CPI tiger will be fully tamed and until when we will get 25 basis points increases in interest rates.\n\nThis is what we can see as the general feel from the options markets:\n\n**Price Action**\n\n* After the initial CPI numbers were released there was a burst of excitement in the market, however this excitement was short live after core CPI was released. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/122w7ckzcfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7d7fe4de7215480291e75669cb1db0b5508615c\n\n**Double Exponential Moving Average**\n\n* The 5 day double exponential moving average, seen here in green, continues being above the 50 day double exponential moving average, seen in red. This would indicate that the upward trend is still in place. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y89n8x1dfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63cf84dbc02aa4bf842a969106340f9b3fe4cd16\n\n**Price Momentum**\n\n* The price momentum seems stable, last week it seemed that it was going down, however the CPI news seems to have broken the downslide and stabilized it around 7. We can see that there is still room to grow to reach the P80 line, once that is crossed we would say that the momentum is too hot and geared for a reversion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43fin2z2dfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b6a301e8dfa9e50ec513d77da39374f1ea9f7d\n\n**Annualized Volatility**\n\n* Volatility remains at its lowest point in the last 6 months. This seems to show an indecision by the market. There are no really good news or really terrible news. We are just marinating in a long stretched uncertainty  period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc7x6p84dfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60645bc307c63703f5e35b504f296748bb7d14a9\n\n**Volume**\n\n* At the end of last week, volume went up above the P20 line, this is likely due to the CPI news and the hunger of the market for some type of certainty.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmexvc35dfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0e4f7795b209c17e31040858aeb39608d209f75\n\n**Call Put Ratio**\n\n* Looking at the options market expiring on April 21st, we can see that the ratio of Puts to Calls is 3 to 1. This indicates an overwhelmingly bearish sentiment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmclen99dfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51c4184da1144ee6354ddf5c718aa85f3674b972\n\n**Open Interest Distribution**\n\n* Looking at the put call distribution over time we can see that the ratios have remained steady on the bearish side. We can also see that not a lot of new open interest has formed since the end of March. Net net there is less than 500k open interest formed since March 27th. In times of distress there tends to be a higher concentration of put open interest because hedge funds and other financial institutions hedging against their massive holdings in the market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqulwlx9dfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59d2e2c9f2a80b8fa6863fd87c56637fe591d4e9\n\n**Implied Volatility**\n\n* Evaluating the implied volatility curve for call options, we can see that at the money options are trading with an implied volatility lower than the current historical volatility. This means that at the money options are trading cheap. We can also see a very clear skew in the volatility chart. This happens when large institutions with big long portfolios buy out of the money protective puts and sell out of the money calls to finance their puts. This raises the prices of Puts and depresses prices of calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayz41gwadfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba25dd0d0c580a4379d31474fec173453ce2bfa9\n\n**IV Rank**\n\n* The IV Rank chart shows the position of the implied volatility at each strike with respect to their historical values. Here we can see that at the money options are trading at a 5% IV Rank, which means that in 95% of this strike’s history, the implied volatility has been higher than now. This is how cheap this strike is trading for. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/swkabqnbdfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa6d33133aa55f66c15a5343f783609fa02070c1\n\n**Open Interest Calls - Resistance Level**\n\n* Analyzing the open interest for call options we can see that an interesting pattern has formed. The highest concentration of open interest has formed around strike $410 which is in the money, followed by strike $415. There 64k open contracts at $410 and 58k open contracts open at $415. This would seem to indicate that strike $410 is going to face a fierce fight before we can surely move onto pursuing strike $415. \n* The reason why these can be resistance levels is that, in general, market makers are at the other side of any open trade. Since most traders are long traders (i.e. buyers of options) , it is reasonable to assume that at the other side of the 58K contracts are market makers. The game theory would lead us to see that the MMs will try to avoid printing 58K contracts (equal to 5.8M units of SPY) if they can somehow suppress the price enough. This is a subjective method to identify resistance levels and should be used with discretion. The reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3g8tnicdfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69add7dce14a92197988f099f9a68e678e3553b1\n\n**Open Interest Puts - Support Level**\n\n* Analyzing open interest for put options we can see another very different but equally interesting pattern forming.  Strike $385 has a gargantuan open interest of 180K open contracts. However we can imagine that this strike and the other strikes that are deep out of the money are actually the protective puts bought by large institutions as insurance for their portfolios and not speculative puts, per se. We talked about this activity when we mentioned the implied volatility skew. Strike $404 has a put open interest of 60k open contracts, and this seems the more reasonable support level for this week.\n* The reasoning for calling it a support level follows a similar logic as with the resistance level, except that we use PUTS instead of CALLS to make this assessment. This is a subjective method to identify support levels and should be used with discretion. The reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6vb9hdddfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8981a9c7badfd2181d47617f6c2aa2cb9b6d5370\n\n**Probability to Breakeven**\n\n* The probability to breakeven for a call with strike $415 is currently 25% This is the probability currently being priced in by the Implied Volatility. We can calculate the probability to breakeven by using the Black Scholes (BSM) pricing model for options. BSM takes into account the current price of SPY, the strike ($415) the days to expiration, interest rates and assumes a volatility. The market prices volatility using IV.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlzg05gedfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e2461a6227a6e71e2bc43180ba2c77eb3047e30\n\n* If instead of using the Implied Volatility, we use the historical volatility then we can see that the probability to breakeven for strike $415 is 31%, which is higher than the probability being priced. This means that strike $415 is being traded at a 24% discount. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnp02qghdfua1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44b73842414792bf56e1c896e9f044c2fb0e7534", "id": "12pblnc", "created_utc": 1681728762.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "“Stocks go up.
