{"title": "Week Ended April 21 - Recap and thoughts for next week- valuation model update - are bears losing?", "selftext": "**Market-moving News**\n\n*1.\tBond market started to price in the “higher for longer” narrative but not the stock market.* The probability of a 25 basis point hike in May is now at 89% (last week I said it should be 100% when it was 66%), and the 2024 year-end Fed rate estimation has increased from 2.99% to 3.13%. However, the market-projected Fed rate path still suggests a 1% rate cut within the year and another 1.2% cut next year, which creates a large gap between market expectations and the Fed schedule, greatly affecting stock valuations (more details in the next section). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdiipbvxrova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3ef42264438dd4c527a9fd08c1f4e1d7b1e840\n\nOn the inflation front, this week’s data is a mixed bag; overall, things are cooling, but there are some warning signs that the disinflation process may not be a smooth ride. You can find all the charts in my daily post, and the table below provides a summary.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lbrlp5msova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=138dd2b8f661e115013bfcf861ac570fd9423741\n\n*2.\tMajor economic indicators were also mixed last week, with four releases showing confusing results.* However, as mentioned in my daily post, \"things are bad, but not all bad.\" For now, it seems safe to say that we are not at an imminent risk of a recession. Here is a summary of the manufacturing-related indicators/components:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kghldy13tova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1661f4041e9cd87f8e41443efab415def57906\n\nClearly, things are improving. Even the Philly Fed data wasn't that bad; many components were down year over year but improving compared to March. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) still looks bad, but that's based on March data. The Flash PMI showed signs of expansion, but the business outlook was still negative, and both input and output prices rose sharply, which is bad news for inflation.\n\n3.\tEarnings are better than expected so far, but still mark the largest earnings decline since Q2 2020. As of last week, 18% of the S&P 500 had reported earnings, and 76% beat estimates by an average of 5.8%, both below the 5-year average (77% and 8.4%). On the revenue side, 63% beat estimates by an average of 1.8%, both below the 5-year average (69% and 2%). Margins declined to 11.2%, the lowest since Q4 2020. For Q2 guidance, only 14 companies had given guidance, and 9 gave negative guidance compared to 5 positive. Analysts' 2023 full-year EPS estimates were slightly higher at $220, but 2024 EPS was slightly lowered to $246\n\n**My positions and predictions**\n\n***US Equity***\n\n*Valuation*\n\nI use a forward PE model, and here are the analyst estimations:\n\n2023 Full Year EPS: $220\n\nNTM: $227\n\n2024 Full Year EPS: $246\n\nCurrent SP500 forward PE is at 18.2, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. However, given the extreme QE situation of the past few years, these averages (especially 5-yr average) may not be the best point of comparison. If we compare current stock valuations to those of 2019, they don't appear to be very expensive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/voaozyw7uova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c1e18b3ad004e87a34543aa84dd1765b64a5180\n\nIf you break it down by growth vs value and MegaCaps, the valuation doesn’t look bad either. We are still at 2019 levels, and in fact, growth's forward PE is lower today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3wdomx8uova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e64e39ed98483ebf1dff76edfe487a1a1afbb05c\n\nBut here is the parameter that really reflects the gap between market expectations and reality: risk premium!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ry2p7ijqxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=588c53d31e78dd66653c2abda409d04b97331683\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqfs0imrxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2a479c5bdc12df2a185d5723490c9f741b65293\n\nThe reason why the S&P 500 is priced at such a high forward P/E multiple is probably because the market is expecting rate cuts this year. As I mentioned in the last section, the market is still projecting a 1% cut this year and 1.2% next year. While I am not sure what’s going to happen next year, based on last week’s upbeat economic data, I certainly don’t expect rate cuts this year, and definitely not as much as a 1% cut! Therefore, I think the “higher for longer” narrative is starting to be priced into bond prices, but certainly not into stock prices yet.\n\nThe 10-year average risk premium is around 3-3.5%. If we use a 3% risk premium for valuation, today's stock should have a forward PE of 15.4. Given that NTM EPS is $227 and 2024 EPS is $246, the SPX should be at 3495 today and 3788 by year end (although it might be higher since the T-bill yield is expected to be lower by year end).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lia9edxtxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7bf0841284a0589134e0ff43e7f3ada67fb5f03\n\n*Now let's look at what's lying ahead:*\n\n*Tailwinds for stocks:* \n\nCooling rent and inflation: Service CPI is currently the biggest problem for inflation, and rent is 60% of the service sector. Last week, rent increases finally crossed over to negative territory. The Fed uses a lagging rent indicator that tracks the 6-month average of rent changes, so we should have seen the peak rent CPI, and the April number may surprise to the downside.\n\nDiving LEI on Fed: LEI has been a very accurate indicator in suggesting a recession. Unlike Empire State and Philly Fed, which are surveys and have a lot of noise, LEI is based on actual data. Historically, when LEI is at this level, we have a 100% chance of entering a recession. So, this number should carry good weight on Fed decision-making going forward. Especially if ISM (to be released on May 1st) is telling the same story, the Fed might decide to pause at their May meeting. I put this in the tailwind, but a recession eventually might not be good for stocks (I will discuss more if May ISM drops again).\n\nStronger than expected earnings: Q1 earnings so far have been pretty good at -6.2% YoY instead of -6.7% YoY as estimated. If this trend continues, analysts might dial up their full-year EPS estimations, which is good for stocks. The stronger economic activity showed in the Empire State and Flash PMI reports also supports better earnings in Q2. Although this might also indicate that inflation could pick up again, or at least be stickier than the Fed anticipated, so not a 100% tailwind either.\n\nInvestors are extremely bearish on equities and bullish on bonds: Unless there is some really bad earnings or economic data or a really hawkish Fed, the pain trade-up (or moving sideways) will probably continue.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vcxng0vxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e906770cbfe7fca3542bc56e581c1214be6c67c7\n\n*Headwind for stocks:*\n\nCB liquidity tightening on track: We might have or about to reach the peak of CB rate tightening, however, most of the CB balance sheet tightening has not even started yet. I mentioned in my post multiple times that global liquidity correlates very well with stock performance and is a leading indicator. But do pay attention to two CBs, PBOC and BOJ. These are the only two CBs that are loosening their liquidity, and both have a deflation problem instead of an inflation problem.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lml8tv9wxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=34a0170a591fc7b9c61b4cdea5ad514b042d427f\n\nDebt ceiling: The debt ceiling has never been a real problem. Anytime the market falls because of the debt ceiling, it turns out to be a good buying opportunity. But this year's problem is that it's coming a lot faster than anticipated. With declining tax revenue and a higher budget deficit, the debt ceiling might come in less than two months. Even though I still don't see how either party could allow this to happen, the derivative market (chart below 1-yr US debt CDS) and bond market (people rushed into 1-month bonds) are apparently freaking out a little bit. But not a single fuck was given in the stock market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pldwgfywxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=31dba7ad28e81c20446f906cd4783b3fd86d0039\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gvg6bmxxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba799f267f8218674b7cea977e1dbba3a6cba7ce\n\nCredit crunch: Even though it feels like the bank crisis is already behind us, the impact has not yet manifested. With the majority of banks increasing their lending standards (especially regional banks, who are losing deposits at the fastest pace in history), more and more small businesses are finding it harder to get a loan. As a result, the number of companies filing for bankruptcy has passed COVID levels. If the Fed continues to hike, this could get ugly really quickly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mlymncyxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ae3a3a75eb868a9ad9b22c47ac49e6d8c574dfb\n\nResilient economy on Fed: As I mentioned earlier, some of last week's economic data showed that both US and global economic activity are beginning to recover. This might not be a good sign for inflation, and remember that the Fed's goal is 1% GDP growth and 4.5% unemployment (we are at 2% and 3.5%, respectively). An early recovery means the Fed has to hike more and for longer to bring the inflation down. Obviously not good for stonks.\n\nTo sum it up, stocks are pricey but not at an extreme level using the forward PE model. Other models like the PE, PS, and PEG models also lead to the same conclusion (data not shown). The risk premium shows that the market has not fully priced in the \"higher for longer\" narrative and a pull back seems appropriate. The majority of tailwinds have already been priced in, as implied by yield compression, but most headwinds have not been, which could lead to higher yields or a recession, and in turn, a pull back in stock price. Overall, I see limited upside for stocks from here, and a pullback might happen soon. However, the current data do not support a major recession in the near future, as I wrote about in Friday's post. US family and business balance sheets are in great shape, with lots of cash and low leverage.\n\n**Update on my year-end projection:**\n\nBase case (orange): No changes from last week. In 2023, SP500 earnings are the same as 2022 ($220), and 2024 earnings are up 10% YoY (the historical average is 7.8%, but given how resilient the US economy is, I still think 10% is appropriate). Inflation will stabilize below 4% and continue to decline. The Fed will schedule 1-2 fewer cuts by the end of 2023 than what is anticipated today.\n\nBull case (green): Reduced earnings estimation based on Q1 results so far.  In 2023, SP500 earnings are up 5% YoY (to $231 based on Q1 results so far), and 2024 earnings are up 10% YoY (to $254; current analyst estimations are at $246). Inflation will stabilize below 4% and continue to decline. The Fed will schedule the same number of cuts by the end of 2023 as anticipated today (Dovish).\n\nBear case (red): Increase earning estimation based on Q1 results so far. We hit a mild recession with a 5% earnings decline in 2023 but expect to swing back to $225 in 2024 (7.5% growth). Inflation will be well under control, but the Fed will schedule 1-2 fewer cuts by the end of 2023 than what is anticipated today but will increase the pace in 2024 (hawkish).\n\nThe light blue box indicates where we are today. If we use the 10-year average forward PE ratio, 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use the risk premium model, we should be close to 3500.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/swry02xzxova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a6ad351b9031766631f55c5007776d845f633b\n\n***US Treasury Bond (TLT)***\n\nMy view on TLT remains the same as last week. The \"higher for longer\" narrative is not fully priced in, so short-term TLT will still be under pressure. But on the other hand, unless inflation is out of control, Fed cuts will be gradually priced into TLT throughout the year. Range movement is likely in the next few months, but once the Fed is clearer about the cut schedule, TLT will start to climb.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bgkutj8yova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a101b2032acd646898eb5c91c45ef0d79d9a6b66\n\n**Current Positions (not changed):**\n\nQQQ May 19 2023 300 Put\n\nSPY May 19 2023 400 Put\n\nTLT leap call spread 110/115\n\nA wise and reasonable investor would do some theta harvesting at current market condition (in a bull market, stocks are expensive but could still go up).
