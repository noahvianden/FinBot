{"title": "Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings Preview", "selftext": "Stocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.\n\nOf course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.\n\nSince that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6\n\nIn other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee\n\nThat's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.\n\nAs far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year.

{"title": "Former Fed Bullard said June FOMC Forecast had \"big element of a recessionary scenario\"", "selftext": "[https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/recession-fears-have-been-blown-out-of-the-water-long-serving-fed-president-says-da0b5461?st=b7za9klbwwdszm1](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/recession-fears-have-been-blown-out-of-the-water-long-serving-fed-president-says-da0b5461?st=b7za9klbwwdszm1)\n\nI will highlight some notable quotes from the recent interview with former St. Louis Fed James Bullard. He resigned on Aug 14, 2023. Although he was known as one of the most hawkish Fed member, he was also correct over the last 2 years in expecting inflation to be sticky, and expecting the Fed to hike way more than what anyone ever anticipated. He is also one of the most bullish, arguing that the economy is more resilient than people think. He is also in the camp of shorter lag for rate hike, arguing that most of the rate hike effect have already passed through to the real economy (you can observe that when he said the easing of financial condition after SVB is feeding into a stronger 2H 2023).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's an interesting statement where he said there're a lot of recession scenarios in the June 2023 FOMC dot plot (not the Fed staff forecast made by economists at the Fed, but the actual dot plot by FOMC members. In June and July, Powell said he disagreed with the Fed staff recession forecast, and the Fed revised up full year 2023 real GDP growth from 0.4% to 1%). No current Fed officials will ever admit they have a recession in their forecast. Only former Fed officials like Richard Clarida and James Bullard can talk openly about these things. To get around using the word \"recession\", Fed officials might use words like \"softish\" or \"bumpy\" landing, which are equivalent to a mild recession. I've even seen big banks like Morgan Stanley consider a mild recession as \"soft landing\", and they were the early soft landing forecasters, along with Goldman Sachs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bullard**: I think it’s turning out that the **Fed’s policy has been very successful**, and I think that will be the **buzz at Jackson Hole**. I don’t know what will be in the speeches, but the **talk will be that this has been quite successful**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were a lot of **heavy predictions of recession**. I think those were just **overblown**.\n\nBecause of the SVB situation, **rates actually went down in the spring**. And there’s been an unwitting **easing of financial conditions**, which is feeding into a **stronger second half for the U.S. economy**. And now everyone’s scrambling to **reprice based on that stronger economy.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe f**aster growth is a bit of a threat** because the **forecast was that you’d have very weak growth or even a recession**, and now that **doesn’t really look like** it is **materializing**. So you’d have to **upgrade your outlook for inflation** probably based on that alone. You still have a **very tight labor market**, and now you have a **reacceleration in the U.S. economy**. The **risks are tilting** a little bit more toward the idea that **inflation won’t fall as fast as anticipated.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBullard: I’m **skeptical that we’re returning** to that **\\[pre-pandemic environment of low interest rate and low inflation**\\]. You’ve got **inflation above \\[the Fed’s 2%\\] target**, and it’s probably **going to be relatively sticky above target.** Roughly speaking, the **policy rate** would **have to be higher than** the **inflation rate during that whole period when inflation is above target**. That sounds like a **higher interest-rate regime** than the **one that has existed since 2008.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in the **’70s, you had similar shocks and the Fed didn’t react enough or fast enough.** They **stopped up short**, and you got a **decade of high and variable inflation**. This time **we reacted more appropriately** and more effectively, and now we’re **getting the fruits of that** by **getting inflation down.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBullard: The \\[Fed’s rate-setting\\] **committee will have to re-evaluate its forecast in September** for the summary of economic projections. And those **projections in June still had a big element of a recessionary scenario**—which at least, as of today, looks like it’s **blown out of the water**. That suggests that the **committee would keep its rate increase in there for sometime this fall**. It seems like you’d **probably follow through on the rate increase** that was **penciled in in June.**\n\nThe bigger question for markets, though, is **whether the economy really does accelerate quite a bit in the second half of 2023** and the **committee feels compelled** to, let’s say, **go above 6% on the policy rate**—possibly because some of the **inflation readings turn around and blip up** or maybe have a little bit of a **sustained increase.**\n\n**I don’t think markets** are really **ready for that.
