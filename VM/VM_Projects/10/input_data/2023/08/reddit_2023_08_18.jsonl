Also I'd need to check the margin requirement to see if I'll need to pay for cash for the future collateral debit.\n\nBut these contracts will settle physically (they're not quarterlies) so it kind of means something like gamma scalping them (maybe using micro e minis) to get profit out and then rolling/closing them before they get impossible to hedge.\n\nMaybe that's why you wanted to \"undo\" the SPX trade with futures and re establish in SPX?

It looks like Qualcomm did benefit from the CHIPs act through global foundries. I don't like to buy anything near new 52-day highs but I think qualcomm still has a great deal of potential upside. I'm sitting in 20% cash to derisk my heavy-semi nosebleed-level portfolio, but I always have it sitting in lower limit buys so it's doing more than making marginal interest. All skyrocketing statistically straight-line trends buckle at some point, and Qualcomm is one of the stocks that I'll eventually buy when there is a week of panic selling, which is how most of my longs started. It's mostly that I have a personal aversion to seeing double-digit red losses in any position that' s not a biotech because I had to buy a stock right now, and right now was the wrong time.  \n\nI like that QCOM's earnings are finally heading in the right direction, which is important to me. I think inference will prove to be a much bigger deal than people think right now, and you don't need NVDA GPUs for that. \n\nThis is highly speculative, but there is a still-secret model called Q-star being developed at ChatGPT. Altman confirmed that it exists, but hasn't said anything about what it is. I think it is based on a model called A-star, and there is are a rumors that it is really great at complex multi-step math and coding, while GPT4 and Claude are pretty decent at relatively simple coding tasks. If it is based on A-star, then the model probably starts with a parent LLM and uses iterated inference to perform a lot of steps. I like that QCOM has inference engines that can handle 100 billion parameters right now, and I think QCOM is better equipped to hook up lots of 100-billion+ parameter engines together than a lot of its competitors \n\nAnother consideration is that around 40% of NVDA's current revenue comes from MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, and META, and they are all irked by NVDA's margins and looking to invest in a competitor. INTC keeps delaying their foundry, and their management really missed the boat for the last decade. Historically, while INTC lost AAPL, who soundly beat INTC at their own game,  AAPL announced that they would be getting rid of QCOM but couldn't do it after spending billions trying. INTC is terribly overvalued compared to NVDA. I think QCOM could be the white-knight of the MAG7, who have all publicly stated or hinted that they want alternatives to NVDA. AMD is great, Lisa Su is a rockstar, retail investors love it, but I don't want to buy a stock with a backward PE of 370 just because it could eat into margins and it does have room to grow. \n\nQCOM has room to grow and eat market share at a PE of 25.
