So if you are long AAPL calls, you would hedge that position with short AAPL shares, weighted by the delta of the calls. Of course, while the hedge is on, that means your calls can't make any money either. You hedge away the potential for gains and losses. Time decay and short borrowing costs notwithstanding.\n\nIf, rather than hedge, you meant *diversify* away from the Tech concentration, find an asset or industry sector that has a negative, or at least near zero, correlation to Tech. According to [this](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=XLK+XLB+XLE+XLF+XLI+XLP+XLV+XLY&timePeriod=2&tradingDays=60&months=36), it looks like that might be XLP or XLE (XLK is tech). GLD is even lower, at 0.18. But a correlation near zero doesn't mean they will move opposite. They may both go down at the same time.

I do 50-delta plays all the time, for example short ES and long SPX (or two ES) calls, and so long as there is movement, one will win (the net delta will be positive on advances in the underlying and negative on declines).
