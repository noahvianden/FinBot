{"title": "Wednesday, Feb 01, FOMC Meeting & Earnings: A Lot of Bearish Sentiments On The Streets. (SPY/SPX)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Chair - Jerome Powell](https://preview.redd.it/jk5nt8221jfa1.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=5508fae55b402b81f17ac2d49790eec266c11857)\n\nWednesday, Feb 01, and the days following will bring a lot of buzz, and there will be some potential in the market. Over the past weeks and months, I have written about such events as the CPI and events like this one, the FOMC - here: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/zlba90/brief\\_analysis\\_for\\_the\\_market\\_open\\_dec\\_14\\_2022/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/zlba90/brief_analysis_for_the_market_open_dec_14_2022/)) ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/109mkak/cpi\\_analysis\\_and\\_market\\_movement\\_for\\_jan\\_12\\_2023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/109mkak/cpi_analysis_and_market_movement_for_jan_12_2023/))\n\n*The purpose of this exercise, like the others, is to examine the current sentiments and settings and gauge what opportunity the market presents.*\n\n**25 Basis Point: The Consensus**\n\nThe FOMC committee is set to raise rate by 0.25% come Feb 01. This 0.25% increase is the consensus rate expected by most market participants. The question is how will the market react to the news of interest rates hike? Before we can answer that, we need to ask - why is this even important to begin with?\n\nThe simple answer - one espoused by many experts - is that interest rates affect stock prices, and it also affects the economy. We are interested in stocks and have already seen how volatile events like this can be. What happened during the last FOMC 0.50% interest rate hike? Take a look SPX chart at Dec 13, 2022 (below) to see for yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPX Daily \\(FOMC Dec 13 Highlight\\)](https://preview.redd.it/p6y8hv6o1jfa1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e26735bf269e81ef18cfd8927fa0892c13c0f77)\n\n**SPX fell for five straight days after the Dec 13 FOMC Rate Increase**.\n\nIt is important to note that the conditions present during the previous rate increase (Dec 13) are not the same as the current one. Namely that inflation and all the other economic indicators (PCE, job reports, etcetera) seem to be getting better. At the surface, inflation, when compared to previous data, is cooling. But not there yet. More rate hikes are expected in the future.\n\nWe have seen how the market reacted to the last rate hike, and with that in mind, the question now is - how will the market react to this FOMC rate hike? Will the market keep running or will it fall like a hard rock from the sky just like the other two rate hikes?\n\nTo really come to a conclusion on what could potentially happen with this FOMC, we would have to work with the information we have on hand. The consensus or the expected rate is a 0.25% increase. Now we take a closer look at the chart again.\n\n[SPX Daily - Jan 30th Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/3j0uj3912jfa1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=d189f0b594fd185ef7b9ed5a56bb7201dffb2570)\n\nWhat does the chart tell us?\n\nSPX has been on a climb since Jan 20 until it reached point \\[A\\] on Jan 27. What happened after it reached this point? It was forcefully pushed down the next day on Jan 30th only to quickly come back up again on Jan 31. This point \\[A\\] is a very critical point just from the reaction when price touched that point. If we extend that line all the way to the left of the chart, we can now see begin to see a clearer picture (see below).\n\n[SPX ](https://preview.redd.it/m70lbko72jfa1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ebab5ace5f0ced49ede82eb0ef921d7b336d57)\n\nDo you see the picture it paints? The chart tells an interesting story.\n\nWe can see that at every run this snake makes, since Sept 6, 2022, that it always gets close to that significant point at \\[A\\] with line running across horizontally. When the price got to point \\[A\\] on Jan 30, it was pushed down, but quickly got back up the next day. This is actually bullish. But we know the reason for that. This bullish action on Jan 30 (yesterday) is, mostly, I suspect, from strong earnings of companies like XOM and etcetera. This is actually a cause for concern if we already had a bearish bias.\n\n[SPX Bigger Picture Extended](https://preview.redd.it/lq7v6mlb2jfa1.png?width=1271&format=png&auto=webp&s=3664f51a204162b7f0132bf3d3865801dfd2f80f)\n\n**The Verdict: Lets set this record straight.**\n\nThe price action from yesterday (Jan 30) is, no doubt, bullish. But we see that this price is fast approaching a critical price point. And this price point (the horizontal line) extends all the way left of the chart to area \\[1\\] which is a tight knot. We can see the importance of this area \\[1\\]. It is a magnet. Price slows down at this area, and this is evident in the chart with those two rectangular boxes besides it. Hence there are couple take away we can note, thus:\n\n**& Assuming the FOMC rate comes in as expected (and it should because the conditions are getting better than it was prior), then**\n\n*1. Price possibly rallies, first, back to \\[A\\] close to the price range where those knots at \\[1\\] are located. This would potentially be followed with more rally. ---> BULLISH*\n\n*2. Price possibly rallies, first, back to \\[A\\] and then come crashing like it did on \\[2\\] & \\[3\\]. ----> BULLISH, then after, BEARISH.*\n\n*3. The third scenario - price falls right after market open ---> BEARISH*\n\n**&** Assuming FOMC rate comes in as 0.5% that would be death sentence for the index. Similarly if there were no hike (1000% unlikely), then the index will rocket straight into the stratosphere never to be seen again.\n\n**Out of all these possibilities, the most plausible is \\[2\\] which is price rising back to \\[A\\] and once it hits that line then it comes straight down. But the story doesn't end there. Why? The rest of the week is really going to be a busy week with a lot of big companies reporting earnings**. Companies like META (earnings on Wed) and Apple, Amazon, & Google (earnings on Thursday). These companies make up a big chunk of SPX and the actions we see post FOMC will largely be shaped by these events.\n\nI am not as enthusiastic on this play, nonetheless, I believe that there is some crops to be harvested with the FOMC.\n\nBe cautious.\n\nGoodluck.

{"title": "Trade META Earnings with Double Calendar", "selftext": "Meta reports earnings for the Q4/FY2022 on Feb. 1st after market close.  The expected revenue is $31.69Bln and the expected eps is $2.23/share. Meta stock price has been rallying since the new year.\n\n[Price Actions](https://preview.redd.it/umw4db8e8nfa1.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee20d2d8753c6ec28adfd83083af1a989aa50f3)\n\n[IV Moves](https://preview.redd.it/6wv1ucnb9nfa1.png?width=1804&format=png&auto=webp&s=407c7ec9d060a54366a764a5774491e27d25682c)\n\nThe IV has remained at 60 and the IV percentile before the earning announcement was about 50%.  Yet IV for the Feb. 3 expiration cycle is dramatically higher than later cycles. Given the huge gap between IV of the front week vs. the rest, I decided to trade calendar spreads.\n\n[IV by Expiration](https://preview.redd.it/timhh7n19nfa1.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=43f4c96a6b42b35e9fe8eb80c0080146027e0167)\n\nMeta stock price as of 3:55pm on Feb. 1 was $153. The at-the-money straddle expired on Feb. 3 was priced at $13.5. This means that the market expectation of the post-earning price move is between $153 ± $13.5. This is known as the implied move. \n\n[Use Front Week ATM Straddle Price as an Approx for Implied Move](https://preview.redd.it/ll2bli0u9nfa1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6d3584f37d58606d1270467b7e98e333ed0d49)\n\nHowever, during the last 5 earnings, the actual moves landed mostly outside the market expectations. As the Meta earning date approached, the sentiment for its Q4 performance had been pessimistic, Tech sector as an entirety has been laying off workers, yet the stock price continued to rally.  My hypothesis was that the slower growth and the gloomy outlook had been priced, and there is no foreseeable headwind or a big surprise for the company in the near future. Therefore I settled with a double calendar trade which is market neutral, betting that the price will not go crazy after earning. I paid \\~$450 debit for this trade.\n\n[Double Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/760ilr2sanfa1.png?width=1837&format=png&auto=webp&s=0854c4a8cd73002c8a070660e3e1f828b63e32d6)\n\nIn this order, I sold 135put and 170call, both expire on Feb. 3rd, and bought 135put and 170call, both expire on Mar. 10th.  Note that this strategy is composed of two calendar spreads, hence called double calendar (Duh).  I choose Mar. 10 expiration cycle because IVs of the earlier cycles are quite high, and may be subject to the impact of IV crush.  \n\nThe payoff of my double calendar is as below：\n\n[Payoff Curve for Double Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/2flwivxdcnfa1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4db3d503507db11ffaf38ae477253b9fafe3a7ca)\n\nThe rationale for this trade to profit is that:\n\n(1) Because the time value of the 03/10 options decreases slower than the 02/03 options, one source of profitability comes from buying the options with a slower value decrease while selling the options with a faster value decrease; and\n\n(2) Anticipation of the price movement.  In this trade, the profit peaks if the price is closed at $135 (with $500 max profit), and if the price is closed at $170(with $600 max profit).\n\n(3) The breakeven price by Feb. 3rd market close is $125 and $188.\n\nExit Plan:\n\nI placed this trade right before the market closed on Feb. 1 with a $450 debit.  I may not hold it all the way to Feb. 3.  I set a sell limit order of $675 to capture a 50% profit target.  Meta stock soared to $180 after the earnings announcement driven by the share buy-back. Despite the wide move, the current is still within my breakeven point.

{"title": "Tesla Q4 Valuation Allowance", "selftext": "I was reading through Twitter earlier today and found an interesting thread.\n\nIt was started by a shortseller/bear (@bradmunchen) who appeared to be criticizing the quality of Tesla's earnings in Q4.\n\nBut more interesting was the response from another Twitter account (@MrMattyJ) which seemed to be defending Tesla.\n\nI don't know enough about accounting so i'm hoping someone who does could help better explain this.\n\n(Correct me if i'm wrong) From what i understand, Tesla was profitable in the U.S. for the first time in 2022. This allowed Tesla to use some of their Deferred Tax Assets consisting of years (a decades?) worth of Net Operating Losses which they've been carrying forward. Doing this offsets their US tax liabilities in 2022, which is the reason for Tesla's low tax rate (6%ish?).\n\nWhere i get confused is when they start talking aobut something called a Valuation Allowance.\n\nHere's the Twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/MrMattyJ/status/1620586220932702209](https://twitter.com/MrMattyJ/status/1620586220932702209)\n\nI have the following questions:\n\nWhat is Valuation Allowance? (i tried looking it up, still confused) Is it just the term applied to any sum of DTA from NOLs used to offset tax liabilites?\n\nWhat exactly happened in 2022 with thes Valuation Allowance? They say it changed by $7b. Did Tesla offset $7b in tax liabilites by using their NOLs or..?\n\nWhat does this mean for Tesla going forward?\n\nIf anyone can ELI5 what these guys are arguing about in the Twitter thread (and the importance of it or not), i would greatly appreciate it.", "id": "10qzkzy", "created_utc": 1675270506.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Valuation Allowance is a reduction in Deferred Tax Assets from NOLs recorded on the balance sheet. From you post above, it appears you already no that a company will recognize Deferred Tax Assets on its balance sheet when it generates tax losses in current years that it can use to offset future income. \n\nValuation Allowances are recognized with respect to such Deferred Tax Assets when the company and its auditors believe it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that NOLs will not be recognized in the near future. There is an absence of guidance here, so these decisions are made on, as the 10K puts it, objective and subjective factors. When you recognize a Valuation Allowance, two things happen: (1) a reduction in the value of DTA on the company's balance sheet and (2) a reduction in net income - this keeps the balance sheet and income statement in perfect balance, as all things should be.\n\nWhat the twitter thread you linked appears to be arguing about, is the reversal of the Valuation Allowance recognized in prior years by Tesla. When you reverse the recognition of a Valuation Allowance, the OPPOSITE the above two things happen: (1) an INCREASE in the value of DTA on the company's balance sheet and (2) an INCREASE in net income.\n\nThere is some argument in the thread on the profitability in the US of Tesla, but from what I can decipher, it appears to me that Tesla has gone from not profitable in the US to profitable in the US for the first time in 2022, meaning that the likelihood that it is able to recognize Deferred Tax Assets has increased and caused Tesla and its Auditors to reverse the recognition of a Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets taken in prior years/quarters.\n\nPlease take all of the above from me with a grain of salt.

To what extent, I don't know. He's even right that VA releases impact GAAP earnings in a way that simply drawing down on DTAs don't.

The creation of the DTA has no effect on cash flow but increases net income (really, it makes the net loss just less big) AND increases assets on the balance sheet (and shareholder equity).\n\nStep 2 is the creation of the valuation allowance. This happens when the continues to lose money, year after year, auditors and the company become increasingly less confident that the company will be able to generate a profit before the DTAs expire worthless (like WSB FDs). This step has no effect on cash flow but decreases net income and decreases assets on the balance sheet (And shareholder equity).\n\nStep 3 is the reversal of the valuation allowance. This happens when it becomes evident that the company will be able to use the DTAs that it had written off in step 2 by way of creation of the valuation allowance. This step has no effect on cash flow but increases net income and increases assets on the balance sheet.\n\nStep 4 is the use of the DTAs. This happens when the company applies its NOL carry forwards to reduce its income tax burden. This step is cash flow positive (since using the DTAs reduces the cash outlay for income taxes) - its also balance sheet neutral since it reduces the DTAs in the amount that cash goes up due to not having to pay as much income tax, lastly its income statement neutral since cash increase corresponds to the decrease in DTAs sitting.\n\nWhat Tesla has done here is step 3 and step 4 at the same time. It reversed the valuation allowance and then used the DTAs. As a result, you would expect what Smack\\_Check said - that DTA balance would not change much. But what is happening all said and done is that the income statement is increased by the amount by which the valuation allowance is reversed. At the same time Tesla uses the DTAs so cash is going up by that amount. What brad is saying here is that if Tesla did not reverse its valuation allowance, then ONLY step 4 would have happened - you have an income statement and balance sheet neutral move that increases cash flow.\n\nRemember that DTAs are something that sit within the assets column of the balance sheet, but they are kind of hard to call \"assets\". You can't sell them, you can't transfer them. This balance sheet entry is just used to track the future cash flow positive effect they will have on your company when you become profitable and get to pay less in income tax than if you did not have those money losing years to generate DTAs.\n\nAssume two equal companies with the exact same businesses, bank accounts, physical assets, and debt balances. One is sitting there with a history of losing money for years. One has zero income tax history. Which company is worth more, today? The one with the money losing history, because all things equal, when both companies start making money, the historical money loser will pay less in income tax and have higher cash flow.
