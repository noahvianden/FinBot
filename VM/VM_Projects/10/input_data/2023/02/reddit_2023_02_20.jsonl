In reality, even though you have positive vega, a rise in IV will often cause your position to lose money anyway.\n\nThis is because vega only measures how sensitive an option's price is to changes in IV. It does not tell you whether IV will change by the same percentage basis for each option. The back month may have a higher vega, but its actual IV will change less drastically than the shorter-dated front month that you sold.\n\nJust gonna make up some numbers here for sake of example. Imagine a situation where volatility increases. You'd expect to make money, given that you've got positive vega, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nShort front month - Vega of -$1.50\n\nLong back month - Vega of $2.00\n\nWhen IV changes it won't change equally for both options. The front one is more sensitive, so its IV might shift by 6% while the back month may increase by only 3%.\n\nSo: 6% change in IV for the front month times $-1.50 means that option gains $9.00 (which we lose because we're short).\n\nMeanwhile our long option also increased in price due to IV increasing, but its IV didn't increase by that much. 3% times $2 means we gained $6.00.\n\nSo even though IV increased and we're positive vega, our calendar position lost $3.00.

I usually open a cal about a week or even a couple of days before the earnings date. This is cos theta decay of the shorts is pretty slow when they are over 2 weeks out and the cals don't start showing any profits, but are susceptible to large underling moves \n\n2) for the shorts, I generally use the weekly options (the same week as the earnings) rather than the monthly. Theres probably about 20-30 stocks which have high enough liquidity on the weeklies to allow this.\n\nOh.....modelling software is of no use in trades like these - cos the short and long IVs change at very different rates, the software gives a very misleading picture.\n\nBottom line - yes, there is money to be made in these trades and the devil is in the detail.\n\nPS - so refreshing to have a real options thread here rather than the usual ones based on covered calls or CSPs.

They use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and experience to predict the direction and potential levels to be reached before a potential turning point.  We, on the other hand, analyze what a stock, bond, ETF, or index is unlikely to do in the future based upon its own historical data.  Unlike RSI, Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators that provide similar information, our measure uses the entire stock/ETF/index trading history to determine what the stock/ETF/index is unlikely to do.  \n\nSo what is it ??\n\nWe have developed a machine learning system that measures a symbols' percentage price change versus time for multiple time periods and compares the symbols recent price behavior to its own past to determine if the current behavior is anomalous.  Think of this as a measure of momentum run amok for the symbol.  Our experience has shown that there are two levels of anomalous stock/etf/index behavior that are of interest: (1) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside of 99% of all prior instances (this is called a Level 1 overbought or oversold condition) and, (2) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside the bounds of all of its prior history (this is called a Level 2 overbought or oversold condition).\n\nWe currently screen 600 stock/etf/index symbols every day - with more being added each week.  These symbols are all traded US stock market exchanges during normal US trading hours.  Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for February 17, 2023\n\n[Figure 1.  February 17, 2023 Stock Screener Subset](https://preview.redd.it/81mahsslvbja1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c813183acff93467d8bcaadd6ed3b2d55b98e7)\n\nIn the first column of Figure 1, we have sets of 3 rows that have Level 1, Level 2, and Data Since labels. The Data Since rows describe the start date for each symbol associated with the date. For instance, SPX has 1/2/1962 which means that the machine learning system contains SPX data since January 2, 1962 for the computations of SPX (S&P 500). Likewise, the symbol INDY has data since November 23, 2009 for its computations, etc. Next are the rows for Level 1 and Level 2. Let's look at Level 1 first. In the rows for Level 1, a number greater than or equal to 1 indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is overbought because it moved farther to the upside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light blue in the screener data. In the rows for Level 1, a number less or equal to zero indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is oversold because it moved farther to the downside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light red in the screener data file. Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except that instead of 99% of the history, it is 100% of the history implying the stock/ETF/index has never moved that far that fast for any equivalent period of time in the data set. Yellow highlighted cells simply highlight symbols that are near overbought or oversold on a Level 1 or Level 2 basis.\n\nIn Figure 1, we can see that TSLA screened as Level 1 overbought, AGG and BAX screened as Level 1 oversold AND UNG and SHOP as Level 1 and Level 2 oversold.  However, in this article, we are focusing on SPX (S&P 500 index) as it is currently neither overbought or oversold.\n\nFigure 2, below, shows a chart of the SPX price action over the last six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4yu1gsnsvbja1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ce4f160ebbcc42b1f5b1b4872ba69b0fddc673\n\nSo how can we use this ??\n\nThe machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for SPX for a subset of future dates.\n\n[Table 1.  SPX Upper and Lower Closing Limits through March 17th, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/wux9dmq1wbja1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=658845a1338dca2254b5f8853dfbba3fe72da9f5)\n\nIn Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to \"No loss since inception\", \"Once Every 10 Years\",  \"Once Every 5 Years\", “Once Every 1 Years”, and \"1% Raw Data\".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled \"Lower Limit\" and \"Upper Limit\".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what SPX is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 2/23/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 2950 and upper limit of 4855 under the No loss since inception column header.  This implies that SPX closing below 2950 or above 4855 on Thursday, February 23, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Likewise, for the 03/17/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 2865 and upper limit of 4890 under the Once Every 20 Years header.  This implies that closing below 2865 or above 4890 on Friday, March 17th, 2023 would be expected to happen once every 20 years.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, no lose since inception (60 years since 1962) corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 15,120 or 0.0066%.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of SPX - including what it's done recently.\n\nSo who could benefit from this data??\n\n•   Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.\n\n•   Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.\n\n•   Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.\n\n•   Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.", "id": "1174bj7", "created_utc": 1676892432.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "So I skimmed this you’re saying buy 0dte put’s tomorrow?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You will not get the premium or liquidity for no lose 0dte strikes for tomorrow but if you go out 2-3 weeks like in my trade above, you will start getting decent premiums (based on current VIX) for no lose strikes.
