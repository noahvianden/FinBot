{"title": "What's the right time to get into NVDA? Would you open a new long position today?", "selftext": "tl;dr  buy, hold\n\nI asked the above question in a different thread to attempt to spur some conversation, to which  [r/nunyabiznasty99](https://www.reddit.com/r/nunyabiznasty99/)  replied:  \"When you get the answer please let the rest of us know\"\n\nFrom succinct observation of reddit communities, I offer:\n\na) Value investors - lmao, you will never see a return on NVDA for 1000 years\n\nb) Growth investors - lmao, NVDA is THE company behind AI, it’s cheap\n\nc) Momentum investors - lmao, AI is the new crypto, everyone on board!\n\nd) WSB - lolz bot puts before earnings, down 6 figures overnight - they're coming to get my wife, kid, car and home.\n\ne) Newbies - does na-vida offer fractional shares?\n\nf) sapped or jaded investors - No worse technology play than buying at the top, Nvidia is the next Cisco, it’s going down hard\n\ng) AMD investors - Our next GPU is the Nvidia killer, buy AMD instead\n\n==========\n\nKidding  aside, as a long term investor who understands both the company  strategy and the competitive landscape, this is what I would say to  anyone about owning Nvidia:  Growth is expensive.  And it's expensive  for a reason.\n\nThere is never a  good time to get into Nvidia. Since 2016 Nvidia has been expensive, but  the share prices has also improved 40X over that time.   That trend will  continue, imo.   But Nvidia share price aways has it's moments of  opportunity.   (And let me just say for sanity folks, do your own  diligence.  I’m not handing out investment advice, what’s here is just  my opinion nothing more.)\n\nIf  you're a traditional investor looking for traditional metrics like FPE  or DCF analysis to make sense, the numbers are, ahem, challenging to  rationalize. Find another stock.\n\nIf  you're more about trade, dip in dip out, then place your bets any time.   There is little predictability in this stock, so short term trading is  basically gambling in my book, chance.  I really can't help you.   (\"Traders\" are how many reddit investors appear to me, \"I need a solid  thing that I can make bank on quickly\" if not down vote)\n\nIf  you are patient and require a good entry, wait and an opportunity will  present itself. Last October was one of those opportunities. There are  other opportunities like Jan 2019. These moments take patience and  courage to buy when everyone else is selling. But there are some signals  ( I provided one last October on this sub).\n\nIf  you are a little less patient, wait for pull backs and dollar cost  average to establish a position, you can do well acquiring this way.\n\nIf you are not patient, don't get in.\n\nMy  view for anyone who wants to get into the stock would be figure how  much discretionary cash you can manage to be without for forever. $200,  $2000, $20000, what ever the number. If you can be without it forever,  assume that it's just gone. Take that money and buy some NVDA shares and  put it in a bottom drawer, and don't look at it. Forget about it for 10  years minimum. Buy a few shares for your kid’s college fund while  you're at it.\n\nThis stock is going  to continue to be volatile.  But it’s going to continue to appreciate in  my opinion.  And there will be set backs in the future, like last year,  there is no doubt in my mind.   Nothing grows straight up.  If you  don’t have a high risk tolerance, stay away.\n\nMy  background is the tech industry. Rarely does life present opportunities  like where Nvidia is today. Think about Windows and Intel in the 1990s  as PCs were just getting ready to launch in a big way.   Or what holding  Apple was like in 2006 at the dawn of the smart phone industry.   That  is exactly what Nvidia feels like today.\n\n\"\\[NVIDIA\\]  has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86%  of the computing power of the world’s six largest cloud services as of  last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.\" [https://techwireasia.com/2023/02/can-a-south-korean-startup-take-on-nvidia-in-the-ai-chips-market/](https://techwireasia.com/2023/02/can-a-south-korean-startup-take-on-nvidia-in-the-ai-chips-market/)\n\nIn  contrast to Intel and Microsoft who split the market in the PC era,  NVDA owns both sides of the equation, hardware and software. They own  86% of AI compute platform in the largest data centers in the world.  They're on the verge of improving that with a new CPU called Grace they  will ship in 2H this year. But the most astonishing thing is their  competition is nearly non-existent.  And the bar is being raised with  more difficult problems on a near daily basis.  Nvidia is responding by  raising the bar to optimize the entire data center for accelerated  computing work loads.  The problem is almost too large for any but the  very largest tech companies.\n\nAnyone  who knows high tech knows competitors are ever-present. Nvidia entered  the GPGPU (general purpose graphics processor unit, or running  non-graphics work loads on a graphics processor) sector in the mid  2000s. Intel caught wind and did a project called Larrabee (killed  \\~2009) to attempt to thwart GPU entry into one of their key markets,  data center.   When Nvidia did enter the Data Center sector in 2014 or  so they grew that business from $0 to $16B today, that's an astonishing  88% CAGR for 8 years assuming $100M year1.  That is primarily at Intel’s  expense, Intel, one of the largest semiconductor companies in the  world, flush with cash, the best chip manufacturer in the world at the  time, who basically knew Nvidia was coming after them.  Today they have  experienced a sustained decline in data center revenue (some of which is  also attributable to AMD).  Now, does Intel have some “accelerated  computing” market share?   Sure, something tiny.   That other 14% or so  is shared with AMD, Intel, Google, Amazon, Baidu and some more  challenging architectures like Graphcore or Cerebrus or FPGAs.   All  these other solutions may share a few percentage points each, and Nvidia  sits with 86% and is basically the default AI platform for the world.\n\nHow  does that happen?   By execution of a long term strategy, management  was on the ball and built a software stack that was forward compatible,  robust and supportable and then infused it with academia, institutions  and research centers (nvidia’s centers of excellence) to train future  generations of computer science professionals.   This effort launched in  2007.  As it came together other solutions had a very very hard time  gaining traction.\n\nI’ve been  invested in Nvidia a long time, and to me a lack of competition should  be a big red flag.  Usually it means you don’t have a market.   In  Nvidia’s case it means the barriers to entry are enormous, that there is  a giant moat around them.   They've been able to protect and grow this  business from nothing to one that is forecast to grow at over 30% a  year. ([https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/graphic-processing-unit-market](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/graphic-processing-unit-market))   And despite years of trying from the best and the brightest minds in  high tech, some of the most cash-rich and largest tech companies, and  billions of dollars in VC money thrown at dozens of startups, Nvidia are  walking away, nearly unopposed, with a very disproportionate share of  the business.\n\nIn the last few  weeks Chat\\_GPT has shown the world the power of machine learning.  They  call AI a revolution, akin to the internet or the printing press.   Chat\\_GPT is just scratching the surface of where AI is going.  And yet  there is only one company making money selling picks and shovels to  industry.   They will continue to make money and they will continue to  grow.\n\nWall Street rewards growth.  It’s that simple.\n\nI recommend the investor presentation: [https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc\\_presentations/2022/NVIDIA-Investor-Presentation-Oct-2022-(1).pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_presentations/2022/NVIDIA-Investor-Presentation-Oct-2022-(1).pdf)\n\nAnd  let me just say one more time for sanity’s sake, please do your own  diligence.  I’m not handing out investment advise, what’s here is my  opinion, nothing more.\n\nLong post,  apologies.   If you’re still with me at the bottom here, let me offer  one tid bit for your patience.

So, if you're looking for a little levity while still getting your daily dose of financial analysis, then look no further! Today we're taking a closer look ***at Target Corporation TGT***. Let's dive in:\n\n**Current**    **10/31/2022**      **7/31/2022**           **4/30/2022**             **1/31/2022**\n\n**Market Cap (intraday)**       76.28B     75.60B           75.76B              106.02B                   103.88B\n\n**Enterprise Value**                  94.36B     92.13B           91.70B              116.58B                   113.39B\n\n**Trailing P/E**                             22.64      18.60              13.51                 16.22                         16.21\n\n**Forward P/E**                          16.81            13.37          17.18                 15.65                        16.64\n\n**PEG Ratio (5 yr)**                       3.53             2.47            3.30                 1.76                            1.40\n\n**Price/Sales (ttm)**                     0.71                0.72          0.74                1.06                            1.06\n\n**Price/Book (mrq)**                       6.92              7.14           6.98               8.27                            7.53\n\n**Enterprise Value/Revenue**        0.87              3.47          3.52              4.63                            3.66\n\n**Enterprise Value/EBITDA**         12.52                53.91        93.66          57.14                        40.34\n\nThese stock stats provide some key financial ratios for the company over the past few months. Here are some observations:\n\n**• Market Cap:** The market capitalization of the company has fluctuated over the past few months, but has been relatively stable between July 2022 and October 2022.\n\n**• Enterprise Value:** The enterprise value of the company has also fluctuated, but generally declined over the past few months. This indicates that the market values the company's equity more than its **debt and other liabilities.**\n\n**• Trailing P/E:** The price-to-earnings ratio based on the last 12 months of earnings has been trending downwards, which can suggest a lower valuation or lower earnings growth.\n\n**• Forward P/E:** The price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months is also trending downwards, which suggests a more positive outlook for future earnings.\n\n**• PEG Ratio:** The PEG ratio is high, indicating that the stock is relatively expensive compared to its expected earnings growth over the next five years.\n\n**• Price/Sales:** The price-to-sales ratio has been relatively stable over the past few months, indicating that the market has been valuing the company's revenue consistently.\n\n**• Price/Book:** The price-to-book ratio has fluctuated over the past few months, but has generally been in the range of 6-8, which suggests that the market values the company's equity at a moderate premium to its book value.\n\n**• Enterprise Value/Revenue:** The enterprise value-to-revenue ratio has been trending downwards, which suggests that the market is valuing the company's revenue at a lower multiple than before.\n\n**• Enterprise Value/EBITDA:** The enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio has fluctuated widely, indicating that the market values the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) at different multiples at different times.\n\nOverall, the trends in the stock stats suggest that the market is uncertain about the company's future prospects and is valuing its various financial metrics at different multiples at different times\n\n# Stock Price History:\n\nBeta (5Y Monthly) **1.04**\n\n*52-Week Change*   **-16.42%**\n\n*S&P500 52-Week Change*  **-9.23%**\n\n*52 Week High*   **254.87** \n\n*52 Week Low*   **137.16**\n\n*50-Day Moving Average*  **161.15** \n\n*200-Day Moving Average*  **160.73**\n\nFrom the stock price history provided, there are a few observations that can be made, but it's difficult to draw a clear conclusion or consensus without additional context or analysis. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n• The beta of 1.04 indicates that the stock is slightly more volatile than the overall market.\n\n• The 52-week change of -16.42% suggests that the stock has declined in value over the past year.\n\n• The S&P500 52-week change of -9.23% indicates that the broader market has also experienced a decline over the past year, although to a lesser extent than the stock in question.\n\n• The 52-week high and low prices of 254.87 and 137.16, respectively, suggest that the stock has experienced a significant range of price fluctuations over the past year.\n\n• The 50-day moving average of 161.15 and the 200-day moving average of 160.73 suggest that the stock has been relatively stable in the short term, but has experienced some volatility over the longer term.\n\nBased on these observations, it's possible to speculate that the stock has faced some challenges or headwinds over the past year, given its decline in value and the wider market trend. However, it's difficult to draw any firm conclusion or consensus without further analysis of the company's financial performance, industry trends, and other relevant factors that could influence the stock price. It's also worth noting that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and that investing always carries risk.\n\n*At the current trading price of* ***$166.96***, it is clear that the stock has recovered somewhat from its 52-week low of $137.16, although it is still below its 52-week high of $254.87. The current price may also impact the interpretation of the moving averages, which suggest that the stock has been relatively stable in the short and long term. Given the recent recovery in price, *it's possible to speculate that the market may be more optimistic about the stock's future prospects.*\n\n# Profitability: \n\n**Profit Margin** 3.17%  \n\n**Operating Margin (ttm)** 4.49%\n\n**Return on Assets** (ttm) 5.55%\n\n**Return on Equity** (ttm) 27.78%  \n\n**Revenue** (ttm) 108.72B \n\n **Revenue Per Share** (ttm) 233.36\n\n**Quarterly Revenue Growth** (yoy) 3.40% \n\n**Gross Profit** (ttm) 31.04B\n\n**EBITDA** 7.58B  \n\n**Net Income Avi to Common** (ttm) 3.45B\n\n**Diluted EPS** (ttm) 7.31  \n\n**Quarterly Earnings Growth** (yoy) -52.20%\n\n**Total Cash** (mrq) 1.01B\n\n**Total Cash Per Share** (mrq) 2.19\n\n **Total Debt (mrq)** 19.47B\n\n**Total Debt/Equity (mrq)** 176.70  \n\n**Current Ratio** (mrq)  0.86\n\n**Book Value Per Share** (mrq) 23.94 \n\n**Operating Cash Flow** (ttm) 3.58B \n\n**Levered Free Cash Flow** (ttm) -2.91B\n\nThe financials provided reveal some key metrics on the profitability, management effectiveness, income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow of the company in question.

Here are some observations:\n\n**• Total Revenue:** The Company’s total revenue over the trailing twelve months is $108.72 billion.\n\n**• Cost of Revenue:** The cost of revenue over the trailing twelve months is $81.04 billion, which means that the company's gross profit over the same period is $27.68 billion.\n\n**• Operating Expenses:** The operating expenses over the trailing twelve months are $22.89 billion.\n\n**• Operating Income:** The operating income over the trailing twelve months is $4.78 billion.\n\n**•Net Non-Operating Interest Income Expense:** The net non-operating interest income and expense over the trailing twelve months are -$453 million.\n\n**•Other Income Expense:** The other income and expense over the trailing twelve months is $61 million.\n\n**•Pretax Income:** The pretax income over the trailing twelve months is $4.39 billion.\n\n**•Tax Provision:** The tax provision over the trailing twelve months is $944 million.\n\n**•Net Income Common Stockholders:** The net income available to common stockholders over the trailing twelve months is $3.45 billion.\n\n**•Diluted EPS:** The diluted earnings per share over the trailing twelve months is $- as it is not applicable.\n\n**•Total Operating Income as Reported:** The total operating income as reported over the trailing twelve months is $4.78 billion.\n\n**•Total Expenses:** The total expenses over the trailing twelve months are $103.94 billion.\n\n**•Normalized Income:** The normalized income over the trailing twelve months is $3.45 billion.\n\n**•Interest Expense:** The interest expense over the trailing twelve months is $453 million.\n\n**•EBIT:** The earnings before interest and taxes over the trailing twelve months are $4.84 billion.\n\n**•EBITDA:** The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are $7.54 billion over the trailing twelve months.\n\nOverall, *the income statement shows that the company has generated significant revenue, but has also incurred substantial costs and expenses*. The operating expenses and interest expenses suggest that the company may be facing some financial headwinds. \n\n# Balance Sheet: \n\nThe balance sheet shows the company's assets, liabilities, and equity as of the last three years. Here are some observations:\n\n**•Total Assets:** The Company’s total assets as of the latest period is $53.81 billion.\n\n**•Total Liabilities:** The total liabilities and minority interest as of the latest period is $40.98 billion.\n\n**•Total Equity:** The total equity and minority interest as of the latest period is $12.83 billion.\n\n**•Common Stock Equity:** The common stock equity as of the latest period is $12.83 billion.\n\n**•Total Capitalization:** The total capitalization as of the latest period is $26.38 billion.\n\n**•Net Tangible Assets:** The net tangible assets as of the latest period is $12.17 billion.\n\n**•Working Capital:** The working capital as of the latest period is -$174 million, which means that the company has a negative working capital.\n\n**•Total Debt:** The total debt as of the latest period is $16.47 billion.\n\n**•Net Debt:** The net debt as of the latest period is $12.79 billion.\n\n**•Share Issued:** The number of shares issued as of the latest period is 471,274.\n\nOverall, the balance sheet shows that the company has significant assets and liabilities, and its common stock equity has decreased over the past three years. T**he negative working capital is a concern and may suggest that the company is facing some liquidity issues.** The total debt and net debt levels suggest that **the company may be carrying a significant debt load, which could impact its ability to invest in future growth.**\n\n*If we consider the current situation of rising interest rates and high inflation, it would change the interpretation of the financial figures. As interest rates increase, it becomes more expensive for companies to service their debts. Therefore, carrying a significant debt load can have a negative impact on the company's financial position, especially in times of rising interest rates.*\n\nAdditionally, **high inflation rates can negatively impact a company's earnings, as it can lead to higher costs of goods sold and other expenses. This could reduce the company's profit margins and ultimately, its overall profitability.**\n\nFurthermore, **negative working capital can also be a concern in times of high inflation and rising interest rates, as the company may face difficulty in paying off its short-term liabilities. This could ultimately result in a liquidity crisis and financial distress.**\n\nOverall, in the current situation of high inflation and rising interest rates, it is important for companies to carefully manage their debt levels, and ensure they have adequate liquidity to weather any short-term financial challenges.\n\n**Analyzing the cash flow statement** in conjunction with ***the income statement and balance sheet,*** and taking into account current market dynamics, the following observations can be made:\n\n•The operating cash flow has declined significantly from $10.5 billion in 2020 to $3.6 billion TTM, indicating that the company is generating less cash from its core operations. This decline in cash flow may be due to a decrease in revenue or an increase in operating expenses.\n\n•The free cash flow, which is the cash available after capital expenditures, has been inconsistent over the past three years, with a significant decline in 2021. This inconsistency may be due to changes in capital expenditures or other investments made by the company.\n\n•The company has negative working capital, which could be a cause for concern. Negative working capital means that the company has more short-term liabilities than current assets, which can result in liquidity issues if the company is unable to pay off its short-term obligations.\n\n•The company has been investing heavily in capital expenditures, with $5.4 billion in 2021 TTM. While investment in capital expenditures can drive growth, it can also result in a reduction of cash available for other purposes, such as paying off debt or returning cash to shareholders.\n\n•The company has been repurchasing its capital stock, which can reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase earnings per share. However, this can also result in a decrease in cash available for other purposes, such as investing in growth opportunities.\n\n•The company has been issuing debt and repaying debt, which can impact its financial position, especially in times of rising interest rates. The company's total debt increased in 2021 TTM, and its debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, indicating a significant amount of leverage.\n\nOverall, **the company's cash flow statement highlights some areas of concern, particularly the decline in operating cash flow and negative working capital, which could lead to liquidity issues** if not managed effectively. Additionally, the company's heavy investment in capital expenditures and repurchasing of capital stock could impact its financial position, and its high level of debt could pose a risk in a rising interest rate environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Analyst Opinions: \n\nBased on the analyst estimates for the next 4 quarters, there is a consensus that earnings will increase over the next year, but at a slower rate than in the previous year. The average EPS estimate for the current year is $5.54, which is lower than the previous year's EPS of $13.56. However, the average EPS estimate for next year is $9.29, which indicates a significant increase in earnings. The revenue estimates also suggest modest growth for the next 2 years, with a 2.3% increase in 2023 and a 2.5% increase in 2024.\n\nThe earnings history and trend suggest that there has been some variability in actual earnings compared to estimates, with a few quarters having surprises both positively and negatively. The current EPS estimate has remained relatively stable over the last 90 days, but there have been some revisions to both the current and next year's estimates in the last 30 days.\n\nOverall, these estimates suggest that there is a moderate expectation for growth in the company's earnings and revenue over the next two years, but there is some uncertainty and variability in actual earnings compared to estimates.\n\n***If the market is worried about inflation and a potential recession, it could have an impact on the company's financial performance and stock price. Inflation could lead to higher costs for the company, which could impact its profitability and margins.*** A potential recession could also impact consumer spending and demand for the company's products or services. This could result in lower revenue and earnings for the company, which could negatively impact its stock price.\n\nTherefore, if the market is worried about these macroeconomic factors, it could lead to a more cautious outlook for the company and its stock.\n\n# Summary (TLDR): \n\nBased on the information provided, TGT stock for Target Corporation appears to have a stable financial performance in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and management effectiveness. However, **there are concerns about the company's ability to manage its debt, particularly in a high-inflation environment with rising interest rates.** The cash flow analysis indicates that the company has been generating positive operating cash flow but has also been carrying out significant capital expenditures and repurchasing capital stock.\n\nLooking at the analyst estimates, there seems to be a general expectation of moderate growth in earnings and revenue for the next few quarters and years. However, the estimates have shown some downward revisions, possibly due to concerns about inflation and a potential recession.\n\nOverall, TGT stock seems to be a stable investment choice, but investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with high debt levels and the current economic climate. As with any investment, it's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\n*This research paper is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be financial or investment advice.

{"title": "‘The market has gone too far:’ Chief global strategist predicts when the Fed will cut rates", "selftext": "Investors should not expect a cut in interest rates until 2024 thanks to a strong U.S. economy and the potential for a delayed recession, according to the chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors.\n\nSeema Shah told CNBC Friday that a tight labor market, fueling inflation, means that the previously predicted third-quarter recession for the U.S. economy will likely be delayed until later in the year.\n\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer is the “scenario that we’re looking at now,” Shah told CNBC’s Julianna Tatelbaum. “You’re looking at tighter policy, which does unfortunately mean that for the market, it is a little bit more concerning.”\n\nThe employment picture started 2023 on a stunningly strong note, with nonfarm payrolls posting their biggest gain since July 2022 despite a rapid increase in interest rates last year.\n\n**‘Absolutely no cuts this year’**\n\nWhen asked when investors should expect a cut in interest rates, Shah responded that it wouldn’t be until 2024.\n\nIt comes as economists appear torn on when the Fed will start to reduce rates, and by how much. Goldman Sachs expects interest rates to hit 5.38% by the second quarter, with the first cut to 5.13% expected in the first three months of next year.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters, however, expect the U.S. central bank to cut rates in the fourth quarter of this year to a range of 4.75%-5.0%, after hitting a peak of 5%-5.25% in the third quarter.\n\nThe U.S. central bank currently targets a range of 4.5%-4.75% for its main interest rate.\n\nShah explained that tracking inflation numbers now and comparing them to the 1970s cycle showed a very close correlation; if rates were cut too early, inflation could increase.\n\nThe 1970s saw double-digit rates of inflation in the United States. As a result, the U.S. central bank was forced to raise interest rates to 20% after inflation initially dipped in the mid-70s but rose again more strongly later in the decade.\n\n“The one big takeaway is that for the Federal Reserve, they clearly have a lot more work to do,” Shah, a strategist at Principal, an asset manager with more than $700 billion under management as of the end of 2021. “We are expecting further rate hikes. Absolutely no cuts this year.”\n\n**Stock market impact**\n\nShah implied that markets had not yet fully priced in the cost of rates staying up this year. She pointed toward a surge in bond yields over the past two weeks as an indicator of “pressure that is building up” for a re-pricing in stock markets.\n\n“I think that the market has gone too far,” she said, referring to the 9% gain for the S&P 500 since September.\n\n“We have seen a number of investors saying: ‘Look at the economy; it is so strong. How can we possibly be negative at this stage?’ ... We’re just saying, the Fed is going to keep going, that means that pressure will continue,” she added.\n\nThe strategist echoed comments made by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who said Thursday that containing inflation remains a work in progress for the Federal Reserve while noting the U.S. economy continues to show signs of strength.\n\n“I have all the respect for \\[Fed Chair Jerome\\] Powell, but the fact is we lost a little bit of control of inflation,” Dimon said in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer during the “Halftime Report.”\n\nDimon himself said he expects that interest rates could “possibly” remain higher for longer, as it may take the central bank “a while” to get to its goal of 2% inflation.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/27/the-markets-gone-too-far-chief-global-strategist-predicts-when-the-fed-will-cut-rates.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/27/the-markets-gone-too-far-chief-global-strategist-predicts-when-the-fed-will-cut-rates.html)", "id": "11dbgx5", "created_utc": 1677503358.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Investors should not expect a cut in interest rates until 2024 thanks to a strong U.S. economy and the potential for a delayed recession, according to the chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "At this rate I’ll be surprised if they even cut rates in 2024", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can we shut up with the rate cuts this year now?\n\n*It’s not happening.*\n\nInflation is out of control and wages aren’t keeping up in any sense of the word.
