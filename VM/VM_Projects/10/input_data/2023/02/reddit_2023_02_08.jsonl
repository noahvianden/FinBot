I have been investing since 2020 and have definitely learned some hard lessons along the way. The past 1.5 years I have greatly shifted focus from a quick buck to planning on never selling. Most of my taxable account is individual stocks with 10-30+ year outlook. Moving forward, all of my focus will be on my roth until I have 401k/trad IRA/have income above roth.

Goal is 30-40% of portfolio\n\n3:RWL: This acts as my exposure to value stocks, an S&P500 fund weighted by revenue rather than a traditional \"value\" fund. Goal 10-20%\n\n4: ANGL: Bond exposure, still learning lots about this market. But I felt this was good initial choice to provide diversified corporate bond exposure and fixed income 10% goal\n\n5: IYK: consumer staples ETF, consumer staples have a history of outperforming the market during periods of economic downturn. Exposure to this sector provides a nice buffer. 10% goal\n\nWith time I plant to add a limiting number of individual stocks, depending on timing, it would be no more than 15% of my portfolio, but my rough list is as follow: AAPL, F, KO, TM, UNH, COST, WMT, TGT, MSFT, MMM\n\nAs I near retirement I would rebalance my portfolio primarily through shedding individual stock as well as VOOG for either more SCHD, VOO, or VOOV.\n\nLooking for any critiques and criticisms so I can continue to learn!", "id": "10wii4g", "created_utc": 1675817207.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Imo, before you start buying in individual companies I would see if they are already in the etfs you own.

I'm old enough to (barely) remember the dot com bubble and when the S&P 500 went flat from 2000-2012 so I've seen the downside risk of large growth stocks. \n\n- RWL is another good choice. Never seen anyone here mention this ETF but I like the strategy because it avoids too much concentration in the usual Apple-Amazon-Microsoft-Tesla stocks. this ETF sort of represents the economy more than representing the stock market. \n\n- ANGL is 'fallen angel' bonds, companies whose bonds have been recently reduced in their credit rating. these are the highest bracket of 'junk bonds' which is why the yield is so high. this is an OK option for what it is, but it's not representative of the overall bond market. junk bonds also tend to move more like stocks, so this is a good one for income but will not add much stability. for that you'd want short-term bonds or a diversified, investment grade bond ETF like BND, LQD, FBND, TOTL or CGCP\n\n- you're right on consumer staples and downturns at least historically, and this sector also tends to perform well over the long-haul. but consumer staples is also verging on overvalued so returns might be disappointing over the next 5-10-15 years.

{"title": "The Country of Jordan Endured a Market Crash and Credit Crunch in 2019 and No One Noticed.", "selftext": "**TL:DR** Several state-backed Jordanian ventures started targeting women to receive small business loans as part of money laundering, tax evasion, and predatory lending schemes. The bubble burst in 2019 and the king stepped in to organize the bailout. The scam started with renewed vigor during the Covid rebound and may have crashed again already but the full picture remains hidden.\n\nJordan is among the countries that unless you‚Äôre part of some highly specific circles, you‚Äôd know nothing of them. However, the place is a fairly typical third-world state: It‚Äôs an absolute monarchy, what little modern industry they have is foreign-run, most of the elites send their kids to college in America or Europe, most fully-employed men make less than 30 dollars a day, and most people are not fully employed but instead are day laborers, street vendors, and work kitchen industries. Most utilities are either broken or don‚Äôt exist, most streets have no names, most houses are not numbered, companies with more than 50 employees are rare, and the few that exist are run by aristocrats. A large portion of the population doesn‚Äôt have Jordanian citizenship since refugees and their descendants do not automatically get any.\n\nIn any case, there are thirteen groups I know of involved in the debt crisis: The Sukhtian group, the Tanmeyah network, Ethmar, al-Ameen, Ahli Microfinance, Arab Jordan Investment Bank, Tamweelcom, the National Microfinance Bank, al-Namothajiah, Vitas, Microfund for Women, Finca, the Bank of Jordan (YES, Jordan‚Äôs central bank), and the Jordanian branch of the UN refugee relief agency.\n\nIn 2010, ‚ÄúMicrofinance for Women‚Äù was introduced as a product, and most of the above groups were formed soon after that because FOMO. Jordan has very low rates of women in the formalized workplace, and as we‚Äôll soon see most of the Jordanian women in the workforce work for their fathers and husbands. It was thought that with a small loan, usually less than 1000 Dinars (1,400 Dollars), they could ply simple trades and join the workforce on their own. Of course‚Ä¶ You also just introduced easy leverage to people who didn‚Äôt even know what profit margins are. These were all unsecured loans and defaulting on debt is a criminal offense in Jordan because they don‚Äôt distinguish between insolvency and fraud.\n\nFew records exist on the type of interest rates and fees for these loans. However, the Bank of Jordan was issuing these loans, and the Jordanian government has a BB credit rating. Their interest rate currently sits around 7% for one-month T-bills, so all banks in Jordan giving unsecured loans to people with no credit must be charging at least 2-3 times that. Ahli Microfinance, however, published a PDF of their prices which I attach below. These interest rates and fees are the same as what most Americans are paying on credit card debt and payday loans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qnse7rsfzga1.jpg?width=1650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea54d34323efb027a36240ddab919df9d6e8b101\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00n4msgufzga1.jpg?width=1650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c93ec8cd1f63da71bdb398e188905e21c8b2828\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dfdjeqvfzga1.jpg?width=1650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b75860b5c590b4fe4051d6f9d15ea66b665ed6f4\n\nI have no idea who is running the UN relief agency, but they were definitely involved in for-profit lending. They even said so on [their website](https://www.unrwa.org/activity/microfinance-jordan) that ‚Äúmicrofinance industry in Jordan is well developed, highly competitive and profitable and, with four per cent of the market, UNRWA is one of the smaller operators.‚Äù They also said they ‚Äúdisbursed 12,986 loans worth US$ 14.15 million‚Äù in 2017 alone, putting the average loan size at 1090 dollars, Yes, this organization receives donations directly. This isn‚Äôt just misuse of UN funds, but it is also tax evasion since the UN is registered as a non-profit in Jordan. I have no idea where all those profits go.\n\nThe Tanmeyah network is run by an aristocrat named Sameh Almahariq who was formally CEO of the Bank of Jordan before staking out on his own. Of course, he made a woman as vice chairman to be the face of Tanmeyah.\n\nAl-Namothajiah is simply hilarious because they allegedly follow Islamic law in finance‚Ä¶ Sharia bans connecting interest on debt. It is a state-owned company run by men whose backgrounds have nothing to do with religion. I‚Äôm not sure, but this is probably another tax evasion scheme since religious organizations are tax exempt in Jordan.\n\nEthmar is also ‚ÄúIslamic finance.‚Äù It was funded directly by Lisa Halaby (AKA Queen Noor al-Hussein), the ethnic Syrian American who became the fourth wife of the now dead King Hussein, making her the current King Abdullah‚Äôs step mother. Their website boasts that their customers see their income raise an average of 42%, with 81% of them hiring an average of 2 additional employees. They also run vocational schools that claim an 80% job placement rate. This is a material misrepresentation of fact as we shall see.\n\nTaweelcom received equity funding from Citigroup and Queen Noor and is also registered as a non-profit. They issue loans up to 2000 Dinars and even have a phone app to receive applications. They claim to have 95,000 outstanding loans, and will even provide booths at street markets for customers to ply their trades.\n\nVitas focuses on business loans and farmer‚Äôs loans. I.E. a loan to a farmer for a seed crop, with the return being part of the profit from the crop. Their loans are exclusively short to mid-term (up to 48 months) that can get large, and they publish success stories of the things people did with their loans. They claim to have 13,777 outstanding loans worth a total of 78 million dollars.\n\nAl-Ameen is one of the few actually registered as a for-profit. However, they also charge an average of 2% interest PER MONTH, which is 26.83% a year. They claim to have 25,000 outstanding loans.\n\nFinca encourages repeat borrowing with their ‚Äútrust loans,‚Äù which I assume is a refinancing product. They offer startup loans, ‚Äúwomen solidarity loans,‚Äù farmer loans, and household needs loans and is allegedly has 660,000 customers all over the world in savings, loans, and insurance. They list a woman as the chairman on one part of their website, but everywhere else she is the ‚Äúvice chairman‚Äù including in her own bio. I can‚Äôt even prove this woman exists as no other info exists outside the bios she clearly wrote (company profile is a copy-paste of her LinkedIn profile). Another woman lists herself as CEO but she lives in Washington DC and spends most of her time in politics and isn‚Äôt listed on the board of directors. By her own statements, she was born into money, so she probably bought that post because she believed this was an actual charity, and she also drinks a lot of wine. All the continuity errors mean I don‚Äôt know who the man in charge really is, but there‚Äôs a lot of European and Arab investment bankers reportedly working for them in all sorts of roles.\n\nArab Jordan Investment Bank is a retail bank, they simply focus on bigger customers and their only requirement for issuing a loan is to verify employment and have a Jordanian ID. This is one of very few actual banks in this drama, and the only one that offers debit cards. It is owned and run by the al-Qadi clan, the puppet opposition leadership in Jordanian politics.\n\n**And my personal favorite**: The Microfund for Women. This is a money laundering operation by the Sukhtian drug cartel. Sukhtian started under Munir Sukhtian who learned pharmacology at the American University at Beirut. He plied his trade in Tulkarm in what was at the time colonial Palestine, but after Jordan annexed the region he became prodigiously successful. He opened up a pharmaceutical factory in Beit Jala (a slum sandwiched between Bethlehem and Jerusalem) making everything under the sun and turned 15-30% growth a year while his neighbors struggled to stay profitable. They would open a new plant in Amman, Jordan and all of the family would learn pharmacology in America. Munir‚Äôs son Ghaith took over after his death, and at this point they had so much cash they were on a spree of purchasing companies all over the world just to store it. Ghaith‚Äôs daughter Muna would marry a Jordanian aristocrat, and part of the company would be bought out by Munib al-Masri‚Äôs clansmen who was Yasser Arafat‚Äôs banker and the current richest man in Palestine (try not to read into that).\n\nOf course, the reality was that Tramadol was displacing hash as the preferred drug in Palestine and Jordan, with residents saying they bought needles and drugs directly from the pharmacies with fake reusable prescriptions trading for around 5 dollars on the streets. The Palestinian government in the West Bank rarely busts anyone for prescription drugs, instead arresting people mostly for hash. Meanwhile, Jordan rarely arrests Jordanians for drug dealing, instead using lethal force against smugglers bringing in captagon from Syria.\n\nThe con here was two-fold. First Ghaith funds the bank by transferring money from his left pocket to his right pocket, then he lends it out to both turn a profit and to make the money look legit. He also used his daughter Muna‚Äôs plastic smile as a front for the company and registered it as a non-profit. Even as the whole bubble collapsed, they were emphatic that they were a non-profit.\n\nThe amount of outstanding debt in Jordan soared in Jordan 2013-2019. There are no official statistics, but corporate statements all say the same thing. On the way up, we see the usual elation when people are winning with leverage. One lady said she was happy now she had money and could run a business selling street foods and hoped to soon open a restaurant. The corporations involved praised their own philanthropy of how they were ‚Äúempowering women.‚Äù It should be mentioned that all of the companies I mentioned have less than 100 employees despite the bosses giving themselves pretentious names like CEO, Chairman, Director, and such. There are also many sole proprietorship banks and even amateur banks in this part of the world called ‚ÄúHawallahs,‚Äù so it is unclear what sort of market share the main players had. Also, note all of this is happening in a small country whose GDP is roughly equal to the yearly income of John Deere.\n\nOf course, a large portion of borrowers only made a few payments than defaulted, with a large portion exceeding the typical 90-day grace periods for various reasons. In 2019, 50,000 warrants for the arrest of women were issued, and it is unclear how many were already in jail and how many men were likewise defaulting (only about 2/3th of the loans actually went to women). King Abdullah personally intervened to stop the madness, pardoning all 50,000 women and organizing bailouts. Only part of the debt was ever bought out, and it is not clear to what extent the king‚Äôs orders were ignored because some women definitely [went to prison](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-05-26/citigroup-backed-bank-in-jordan-sued-1-200-women-over-small-debts?leadSource=uverify%20wall) over a matter of less than a grand.\n\nNone of the bankers I know of were criminally charged nor were liquidated despite all of them being insolvent.\n\nThe bottom of the crash was the Covid Panic, at which point all the lenders report less debt than what they started with. However, by 2021 they were back in business with heavier debt loads than they started with. All reporting ceases with the first quarter of 2022, and we all know why because the US Federal government reversed the money printer and sent interest rates soaring globally. None of the lender‚Äôs have updated their websites since then.\n\nBut on a more depressing note, this predatory lending is nothing new in this part of the world. During colonial days, the Brits there said the ruling clans would give farmer‚Äôs loans with rates of 20-50%, and many were forced by their landlords to take loans they couldn‚Äôt repay. This system was as old as anyone could remember back then.\n\nAlso, I know there's a lot of deep-value people around here who want to bet on companies that can make it big in developing the undeveloped world. However, this is the type of bull\\*\\*\\*\\* you face, where everyone involved is both incompetent and corrupt. You're also dealing with information vacuums, where entire wars and recessions can go completely unnoticed.

Large companies such as Google, Nvidia, Meta, AMD, Amazon have all recently revealed their own developments in artificial intelligence technology. Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) lost $100 Billion after Bard gave a wrong answer during launch demo. This wiped out nearly all of the gains made since they initially announced the new product offering. (Source: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2023/02/08/alphabet-stock-loses-100-billion-after-new-ai-chatbot-seemingly-gives-wrong-answer-in-ad/?sh=907e1a462103))\n\nBut investors who are looking at the confluence of China's re-opening, the competition between Beijing and Washington, and the explosion of opportunity in AI might want to turn their attention to Baidu. The Chinese version of Google announced that their own AI chatbot, ERNIE, will launch in March, and shares jumped 12% on the news.\n\n# All about ERNIE\n\nIt stands for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration and it's a large language model created by Baidu back in 2019. What sets it apart from other language models is its ability to integrate knowledge with massive amounts of data, making its understanding and generation skills next level.\n\nIt's evolved into a series of advanced big models that can handle all sorts of tasks, like language understanding, language generation, and even text-to-image generation.\n\nThe CTO, Haifeng Wang, was hyping up deep learning as the core of AI in a presentation earlier this year and how it's showing major potential. And the Chairwoman of Baidu's Tech Committee, Hua Wu, was saying how AI-generated content could revolutionize film production.
