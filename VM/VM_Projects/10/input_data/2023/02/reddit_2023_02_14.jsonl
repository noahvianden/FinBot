Back from a 3-day ban!\n\nAfter a rough week last week, stocks ended in the green on Monday. As you can see CPI came out this morning. Not going to get too much into that, but the market has had a nice reaction on both sides. In addition to the CPI number, there will be a number of interesting earnings reports, with Restaurant Brands and Coca-Cola reporting before the bell and Airbnb posting results after the close. In other news, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard is set to become President Joe Biden's top economic advisor, replacing Brian Deese. Likewise, longtime Biden confidant Jared Bernstein is expected to soon replace Cecilia Rouse as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. This move could position Brainard to be the next in line for Treasury secretary if Biden wins another term and Janet Yellen departs. Brainard, a Democrat with dovish economic views, is a veteran of the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. As the week progresses, investors will continue to monitor the economic data (which includes the CPI number), as well as earnings reports from major companies. It remains to be seen how the market will respond to these events, but with a new economic team in place in the White House, there could be some changes on the horizon. VIX is also getting crushed so this could potentially hint to a move higher as well. The options market was pricing in a $7 move on SPY... we are no where near that. This means we could see a big move, or the premium sellers win and we do nothing. \n\nIf you want more of this, just upvote for visibility and follow me.

I'll also be doing weekly posts every Sunday on my profile only, so be sure not to miss those. \n\n**Overall Market Outlook:**\n\nSPY - Bullish Marabuzo candle close on the daily TF. We reclaimed the 8 EMA on the daily. And we are in a big symmetrical triangle. Expected Move +/- $6.56\n\nQQQ- Morning Star candle pattern close on the daily TF. Also reclaimed the 8EMA on the daily. Expected Move +/- $7.30\n\n**Watchlist:**\n\nTSLA - Dragonfly Doji candle close on the daily TF. We are squeezing setting up for a move on the hourly TF. Take 210c or 220c Calls above 200 or 201.67 (safer entry). Take 180p or 170p Puts below 190. Expected Move +/- $14.00\n\nNVDA - Hammer candle close on the daily TF. We reclaimed the 8EMA on the daily. And we have a head & shoulders pattern on the 4Hr and 1Hr TF. Take 230c or 240c Calls above 221.20 or 222 (safer entry). Take 200p Puts below 215. Expected Move +/- $13.23\n\nJBLU - Jet Blue moved over its 200 daily MA on February 2nd and is now coming down to test this crucial daily MA. I believe we see a move higher for this outperforming stock over the coming weeks.\n\nRIVN - Rivian fell below support around $19.20, now that we are coming up to test this level I believe we could see a rejection and move lower.\n\nNKE - Nike just traded above support around $125. The stock saw a golden cross in Mid January which implies bullish momentum.

That being said, there are Futures and options where the underlying asset is the VIX.\n\nHence, certain options on SP500 determine the value of the VIX. By extension, the VIX doesn’t cause the market to do anything. \n\nTo be sure, minor feedback loops likely exist whereby traders consider the VIX when trading the SP500 or even other major indices (e.g., QQQ) and only in this way would it have any casual effect on the market; in most cases, however, it’s probably not significant.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
