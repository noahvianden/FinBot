The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.\n\nConsidering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:\n\n**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.\n\n**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.\n\n**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.\n\n**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.\n\n**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.\n\n**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.\n\n**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.\n\n**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.\n\n**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is \"Hold\", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.\n\nHowever, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.\n\nAn addendum that incorporates some extra key points:\n\n**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.\n\n**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.\n\n**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.\n\n**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.\n\n**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.\n\n**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.\n\nIn summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**27 ROKU shares**\n\n**7 ROKU $69 7/28**\n\n**2 ROKU $80 9/15**\n\nall ROKU positions entered today\n\n**1 NFLX $475 7/21 (cheers on being the only streaming company that cuts leeches)**\n\nCredentials: actual Autism Spectrum Disorder with a hyper fixation on the stock market and using being insanely nerdy about shit to make hella bread.\n\nPast decent trades:\n\nLoaded NVDA shares before earnings because I’m a college student and I study Brain & Cognitive Science, so I just talk about AI/ML/ANN all day.\n\nChegg Puts before earnings (20x+!!) because what a shitty company, Quora for idiots who can’t cheat correctly.

There will no longer be any high speed pursuits. EVs only give more power to the police state. And anyone with a microwave gun.\n\nPolice will be equipped with probably a device on the front of their car that can pull you over without you ever touching the brake. Microwave guns need a powerful transformer. They may not use specifically microwave rays, maybe another similar wave that kills electronics. Microwave rays can cause blindness, so most likely won't be used unless for high speed chases, or dickhead LEOs wanting to blind people.\nThe US Government has been blinding people, and covering it up with propaganda since the prohibition. Wouldn't surprise me if they did it again with EVs this time 100 years later.\nI've never heard anyone else mention this first talking point when talking about EVs. \n\nDid you hear about the guy who invented hydrophonic engine, and he was poisoned died shortly after? Strange stuff happens when you threaten the most powerful people and companies in the world. Hydrophonic would be even cleaner than electric.\n\nI would much rather a company make a car with no electronics rather than completely electronic. \nI'm not sure how EVs will help the chip shortage either. Sounds like a 75,000-100,000$  base model car after inflation hits harder and all the chips are gone. We don't have enough chips to build every one an electric car every year, and have enough left over for every thing else we need.\n\nI agree climate change is a huge issue, but EVs do nothing to help in the long run. They're worse than combustion imo. Drives up the cost of every other electronic once more people think they're \"helping\" by driving an electric car. Also they don't last near as long, and aren't as easy to work on as a combustion engine. Think of how a mechanic would feel having to relearn his entire craft. Most mechanics I know don't even like computers. \n\n18 wheelers cause a massive amount more pollution than any daily driver, yet I still see dozens on the road everyday.\nWhy haven't we built more railroad tracks for cargo trains instead of using incredibly dangerous, pollutive, and expensive trucks for the vast majority of our goods?\n\nI wish so many people would stop thinking EVs actually help stopping climate change. Your car isn't going to melt the ice caps, it'll be the huge corporations actually causing the issue and they're still feeding you PsyOps that EVs are going to save the ice caps and stop climate change.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm also right about the pollution fact.
