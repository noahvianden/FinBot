The best course of action is probably just to wait and see what happens from here until next Friday, with some trigger points, and some of these depend on what your paper loss was when you rolled the contract, and what your true break even is. For example, if you were originally paid $1 for selling the 125c and had to pay $2 to close them and got paid $3 to open the 130c you have now, your break even is buying to close for under $2 (1-2+3).\n\nI sell options a lot, mostly on SPY (capital wise), and here's what I would be looking for:\n* Set a Good Til Canceled order to buy the short 130c back for .01\n* Decide what an acceptable loss is on this position.  Adhere to it.\n* If the stock moves to 130, while it is at 130, roll out in time and up in strike for a credit that is acceptable to you for the additional time. I try to target 12% annualized return for risk or greater. Sometimes this is not an option depending on how far ITM the option is.  That's why it's important to roll ATM so the poor schmuck on the other side of the trade is paying you maximum extrinsic value..\n\nI might also just look to calendarize the position or convert it to a spread or straddle, but it would heavily depend on the total amount invested in the position (including rolls).  Then I would hunt for something that can mitigate damages.

I mean rolls are supposed to be neutral to your position and should be used to maintain the same value of index as general market values, correct? \nSo if broker index has value of 15 and general market value is 14 after rolling it should be also 14.\nHowever I have noticed several times at my broker that it does not behave like this. It's usually the other way round. \nI think that behaviour is intentional as for example with vix index having down trend rolling it also down would just benefit everyone that is buying calls(and thats like majority of people who buy puts with vix being at 15).\nSo the platform to benefit from it rolls to for example 16 and index have a lot of space to drop down more -making looses for majority of people (who sit on calls).\n\nIm not the one dorectly affected as since I have noticed that im trying to go in only after rolling with intention of closing positions before next roll.", "id": "143d389", "created_utc": 1686143899.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|28|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: does anyone else noticed that rolls on vix index are favorized to short calls?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">It's possible that your broker is engaging in some sort of predatory behavior with regard to the VIX index.
