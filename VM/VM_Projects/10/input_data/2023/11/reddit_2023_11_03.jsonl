In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.\n\nHere are the daily percentage changes in Dow since 1896 and the Mars/lunar node phases throughout that time\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/42243993/A\\_hypothesis\\_that\\_the\\_Federal\\_Reserve\\_can\\_set\\_interest\\_rates\\_based\\_on\\_the\\_movements\\_of\\_the\\_planet\\_Mars\\_Here\\_I\\_have\\_data\\_going\\_back\\_to\\_1896\\_that\\_shows\\_how\\_the\\_Dow\\_Jones\\_performed\\_when\\_Mars\\_was\\_within\\_30\\_degrees\\_of\\_the\\_lunar\\_node\\_from\\_appendix\\_of\\_Ares\\_Le\\_Mandat\\_4th\\_ed\\_](https://www.academia.edu/42243993/A_hypothesis_that_the_Federal_Reserve_can_set_interest_rates_based_on_the_movements_of_the_planet_Mars_Here_I_have_data_going_back_to_1896_that_shows_how_the_Dow_Jones_performed_when_Mars_was_within_30_degrees_of_the_lunar_node_from_appendix_of_Ares_Le_Mandat_4th_ed_)\n\nThe overall hypothesis is that Mars influences human behavior in a very negative way, not just on investors, but people in general. I have been demonstrating how that same Mars/lunar node alignment also affects military conflict.\n\nHere is the chart for the October 29 stock market crash (notice where Mars is located in relation to the lunar node)\n\n[https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Business:\\_Wall\\_Street\\_Crash](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Business:_Wall_Street_Crash)\n\nHere is the chart for 9/11(notice where Mars is located in relation to the lunar node)\n\n[https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Terrorist:\\_WTC\\_(2001)](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Terrorist:_WTC_(2001))\n\nSee the similarity?\n\nnow read this document and see where Mars is in relation to the lunar node during Israel/Palestine rocket fire conflict escalation dates.

We are currently in the phase of Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node between August 24 and November 15th. The Dow Jones, despite being slightly positive for the year, has dropped 3.5% during this Mars/Lunar node phase thus far.\n\nThe book \"The Mars Hypothesis\" is more geared for Macro-economists, but can be used in tandem with micro trades.\n\nFor micro traders, this book is pretty good.

{"title": "$TEVA - DD inside", "selftext": "It's hard to stay bullish on corporate earnings in the face of high rates, slowing growth, and a strong labor market. So we find a company that doesn't depend much on the economy, a company that had that's on the cusp of inflection. Teva Pharmaceuticals is that company.\n\nBut first some recent history on non-mega pharmaceutical companies. Since the sector blew itself up in 2015 by doing too many leveraged buyouts, killing people (opioids etc.), and fraudulently raising prices to the moon, the FTC, FDA, and DEA encouraged new competition to eat away at the earnings of incumbent firms. It didn't matter whether they were generic or patent protected, pain in the form of competition was the common denominator.\n\nThis resulted in over supply, higher input costs, and lower prices. Then COVID hit and made things even worse for these companies that didn't sell COVID vaccines or tests. The aftermath was a bunch of zombie pharma companies with too much debt, declining free cash flow, and huge intangible write-offs from stupid acquisitions. Sounds like a terrible place to look for a diamond in the rough, so it was the perfect place to look.\n\nIronically it was these terrible conditions that swung the pendulum back into a great setup for non-mega pharmaceuticals. The incumbent firms were more adept in navigating the destructively competitive environment. They killed of a lot of the new competition or bought them out. In the meantime, the same drug abuse that happened when opioids spread to other drugs like Adderall. This time however, the DEA and pharmaceutical companies are working together to limit abuse. Regardless abuse is still rampant and creates lots of demand. This pushes up prices.\n\nTeva sells the generic and biosimilar drugs that have almost or completely expired patents. They also develop their own drugs. They have vertically integrated production. That means they manufacture the active ingredients in-house and benefit from any supply crunch or shortages. Some of their profits come from collaborating on new drugs and biosimilars with mega pharmaceuticals.\n\nBoth chemical generics and biosimilars are protected from competition by first to market (six months or sometimes more if they sue and win against the original creator) and production or distribution complexities. Some are addictive (like Adderall). So the economics of their products are not subject to the level of competition that one expects when thinking about purely generic chemical drugs. It's something in between that and the pure patent protected drugs of mega-pharmaceuticals.\n\nTeva is cheap as hell even in terms of enterprise value due to the bad economics they had since 2015, the opioid and anti trust litigation that they have settled, the war between Israel and Hamas, and the large debt they carry. However, they have paid down that debt aggressively and increased long term cash flow to organically deleverage during bad times. And the times are a changing (for the better).\n\nSo here is the inflection I see:\n\nMuch better economics and competitive dynamics going forward\n\nAccumulated loss balance to offset future taxes\n\nConsolidation and cooperation rampant in a post apocalypse competition landscape\n\nHealthy debt ratio, high and increasing free cashflow\n\nBiggest litigations settled, no big pending legal risk\n\nNot dependent on a few drugs, more like a system of profitable generics funding new drugs\n\nEven the R&D spend is offset by collaboration deals that bring in cash\n\nNo COVID over-earnings\n\nLevered on debt from acquisitions that had good business that they over paid for but that excess intangible basis has already been written off\n\nThey can easily keep raising prices in this high demand high inflation world to boost free cash flow\n\nPeople will keep buying even if there is a recession, demand won't go down\n\nEven on enterprise value to 2023 free cash flow basis, is sitting at 13.5x and free cash flow is about to explode higher\n\n(1) U.S. pharmaceutical industry - statistics & facts | Statista. https://www.statista.com/topics/1719/pharmaceutical-industry/.\n(2) Competition, Consolidation, and Evolution in the Pharmacy Market. https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/aug/competition-consolidation-evolution-pharmacy-market.\n(3) How Did the Public U.S. Drugmakers‚Äô Sales, Expenses and Profits Change .... https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/evidence-base/how-did-the-public-u-s-drugmakers-sales-expenses-and-profits-change-over-time/.\n(4) Global Pharmaceutical Drugs Industry Competitive Landscape Report. https://www.bccresearch.com/market-research/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-drugs-industry-competitive-landscape.html.\n(5) Competition, Consolidation, and Evolution in the Pharmacy Market. https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/aug/competition-consolidation-evolution-pharmacy-market.\n(6) U.S. pharmaceutical industry - statistics & facts | Statista. https://www.statista.com/topics/1719/pharmaceutical-industry/.\n(7) Snapshot of the American Pharmaceutical Industry. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/snapshot-of-the-american-pharmaceutical-industry/.\n(8) Analyzing the Global Pharmaceutical Industry 2015 - PR Newswire. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/analyzing-the-global-pharmaceutical-industry-2015-300114981.html.\n(9) Various $TEVA SEC Filings", "id": "17mz3h9", "created_utc": 1699029204.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|933|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Teva is a low cost drug company that is inflecting from bad economics to great economics.
