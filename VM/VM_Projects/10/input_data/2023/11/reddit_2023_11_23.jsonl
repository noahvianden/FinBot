Expiration date should be 6-9 months\n* How to finance this:  \n\n   * Sell ATM calls on UVXY with an expiration date for the end of the week, i.e. ideally the calls would expire worthless (or I set a take profit at 90% of the maximally possible profit) and I would sell new ones in a weekly frequency.\n   * I set a stop loss at 200% of the received premium --> purpose: In case of a crash, I would be stopped out and could gain from an increased UVXY raise.\n\nThe problems that I see:\n\n* If I am stopped out too often I will not be able to make this self-sufficient\n* The inherent decline of the UVXY price  \n\n   * After 12 months the UVXY should be declined by 90%.
