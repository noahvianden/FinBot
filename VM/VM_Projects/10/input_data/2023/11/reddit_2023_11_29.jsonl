If i close it out great, made 65 but what do i do now, sell another CSP closer to the money?  I feel if i do nothing with the cash just sitting, there it is a waste.  \n\n2) Sell a call and put on SPY, 45 dte.  Market keeps trending up, so after 2 weeks, you move your put side to take the profit, but your still overall losing money on this trade (on the call side).  20 days come and your call side is still losing money,  Do you roll the call side again?  What keeps this trade from becoming worse and worse (by market keep going up).  Do you keep moving the put side in?  (this happened to me alot this year when market keep going up, I would keep rolling the call side and just taking loss after loss).  \n\n3) How much does IV rank matter (I don't really pay attention to it, i mainly sell puts on SPY, and blue chip stocks).

You made $65 in 3 days is an average of about $22 per day, it means you will average the remaining $35 spread over the final 36 days which is about .97, yes, 97 cents per day.  Why would you want to continue to tie up the capital and have a risk of losing some or all of it?  Closing it out makes the most sense.  Opening a new trade on the same or different stock from your watchlist that meets your criteria.  If there is not a good trade to make then letting the money sit may be much smarter then making a bad trade that loses money.\n2. You should have a trading plan that spells out when to close for a profit or loss.  Without this plan you will be guessing and may make bad emotional decisions that causes losses.  Close the trade at the max loss amount in your trade plan is the answer.  If you can roll or adjust to lower the max loss, or possibly give the trade more time to recover and be profitable, then that is great, but not all trades can be saved so some may need to be closed for a loss.\n3. High IV infers the option has a higher price and premium so could be more profitable, but it also infers the stock may move more since it is more volatile and therefore might be challenged.  IMO opening 30-45 dte makes a lot of sense and works for most any trade. Closing or rolling at 21 DTE without regard to what the stock is doing makes no sense to me.

You will see this happen holding until expiration when you will question why you didn't close when you had a nice profit.\n2. You're doing something fundamentally wrong when rolling . . .  A trade can not lose more money rolling if it is done for a net credit.  The additional credits collected lowers your max loss amount, and by rolling multiple times the max loss will be lowered.  When selling puts you do have to be prepared to be assigned shares and then sell CCs.  If selling CCs then you have to open them above the net stock cost which will result in a net profit if called away.   Are you sure you are not rolling for a net debit?  \n3. IV/IVR does rise leading up to an ER and then drops quickly after the report.  This is called IV crush.
