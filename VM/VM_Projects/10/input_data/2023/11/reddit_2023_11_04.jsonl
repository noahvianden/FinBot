If it sounds nonsensical to me, you are advised to double check it. \n\nI have checked their business plans, but there is a major flaw in them. Ginkgo plans to create strains for biotech companies that produce biomolecules. However this market is not that large, the world is full of molecular biologists that can do this. It is not that hard, the scientific literature is filled with these papers, you do not need to invent anything just copy a published method. They claim to create strains that are more efficient in this, but I highly doubt they can do this better than a simple in vitro evolution screen, which can be done in weeks in an academic lab. And actually there are a lot of labs that offer these services. I personally know a guy, who will make you a mammalian cell line expressing an antibody for 100k. Hard to justify Ginkgo's success story, when it produces a service that is abundant in the industry and not that expensive at all.  \n\nAnd if you check their financials, they generate massive losses.
