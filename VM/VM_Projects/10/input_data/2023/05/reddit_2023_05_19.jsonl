Since blowing up my first account, I made it a point to really  get after studying technical analysis, price action, volatility, and most importantly the Greeks as well as prwctice my ass off in sim while doing all this. This is also when i discovered the difference between \"American\" and \"European\" options.

The closer and closer I get ti my savings goal the more I'm trying to make a final decision in wether to take this strategy on SPY or SPX. I feel like SPX might be the answer just because if SPY risk of early excercise/assignment. But I'm also not sure how often that actually happens 🤷‍♂️ I'm open to any answers, input, and/or advice.
