{"title": "COST Earnings is Today! What are we gonna do?", "selftext": "Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results today, May 25. \n\nAnalysts estimate that Costco Wholesale will report earnings of $3.29 per share compared to earnings of $3.04 per share from the same quarter last year. They are also expecting the company to report $54.53 billion, an increase of 3.68% over the prior year quarter. As well as a profit of $14.40 per share this year. A year earlier, the company earned $13.14 per share.\n\nI expect Costco to likely beat the revenue and earnings expectations. It is worth pointing out that despite the pandemic and inflation, the business has managed to grow strongly. Consumers loaded up on essentials in high quantities to keep costs low. However, Costco’s March 2023 sales data pointed to a potential slowdown for the business - with total comparable sales down 1.1% year-over-year (y-o-y), and e-commerce down 12.7% y-o-y. This marks the first time in multiple years that comps declined for the company, largely driven by rampant inflation. However, things improved a little in the April 2023 sales report - which saw its total comparable sales grow only slightly to 1.4%, and e-commerce was down 5.9%. Now that the company’s monthly sales growth looks slow, investors might need to brace for potentially softer quarters ahead. The recent decline might be alarming but Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. The monthly reports do not include any information on Costco’s profitability or segment and membership revenue breakup.\n\n**Revenues expected to be slightly ahead of consensus estimates**\n\n[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/) estimates COST’s FQ3 2023 revenues to be $55.1 Billion, marginally higher than the consensus estimate mentioned earlier. In Q2, Costco’s membership fee income was 6.2% higher than the prior-year period. And the renewal rate remained strong, at 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Even as degenerate gamblers, we need to keep an eye on this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. Also, Costco currently boasts nearly $14 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Its long-term debt is only $6.5 billion, so Costco has a net cash position on its balance sheet. For the full-year 2023, we expect [Costco’s Revenues](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/COST/no-login-required/VPSnY8ac/Costco-Revenues-How-Does-COST-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230525) to grow 8% y-o-y to $245 billion.\n\nCostco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for COST in this report.\n\n**EPS likely to match consensus estimates**\n\nCOST’s FQ3 2023 earnings per share is expected to be $3.30 per Trefis analysis, almost matching the consensus estimate. In the second quarter, Costco’s earnings per share rose from $2.92 (last year), despite supply chain pressure.\n\nA membership fee increase is unlikely this year because of high inflation, but it will happen sooner rather than later. Costco generally raises its membership fees every five years, last raised in 2017. This should help the company boost its bottom line further.\n\n**A membership fee increase may be coming**\n\nAnother potential catalyst that could increase COST shares is a membership fee increase. In the note, UBS Analyst Michael Lasser said now is the right time to raise fees, despite consumer wallets' being stretched. \"This will be a key focus this quarter. We think there's a good chance that COST will bump its Gold Star Membership fee by $5 and its Executive Membership fee by $10 either this quarter or next.\"\n\nLast quarter, membership fees brought in $1.03 billion, which is an 6.2% y-o-y increase as mentioned earlier. Costco last raised membership prices — a Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120 — in June 2017. The company typically raises prices every 5 years and seven months on average, which suggests the next hike is imminent.\n\n**What to do for earnings?**\n\nDue to high strike prices, calls on this stock is kinda expensive. So I'm going to go for a call spread. The company has moved on average about ±4% with earnings, so I'll go for something that it's max profit at a 4% gain. This means buying the 5/26 490c for $510 and selling the 5/26 502.5c for $240. I can get the spread for $270 with a max gain of 4.6x if this goes my way (lol).", "id": "13rmgn2", "created_utc": 1685032528.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|195|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13d0gwm/guys_abnb_earnings_are_today_how_are_we_gonna_get/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13dytg2/my_lotto_play_for_diss_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13byuhu/what_im_doing_for_pltr_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13k7f0x/what_im_doing_for_csco_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13bzvbn/why_im_getting_pypl_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/135v8qm/your_lotto_play_for_amds_earnings_tonight/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "my plan: if it drops buy shares", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes they said they won’t change the price of the dogs.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I hate their parking lots.
