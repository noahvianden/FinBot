A brokerage is not like a bank that takes your money and lends it out; they take your money and buy exactly what you tell them to buy, and sell what you tell them to sell. They do not use the assets under management for their own uses. Are you suggesting Robinhood needs $6B for customers moving the assets out of Robinhood instead say Schwab?\n\nFor example:\n\n> Brokerage firms are structured differently. Their primary business is buying/selling securities and holding them in a segregated account on your behalf. You don’t have cross-contamination of credit between customers, and your ability to access funds is not dependent on the performance of others. Brokerage firms also don’t have the ability to use your assets to pay their creditors in the event of their failure, unless you have borrowed from the firm (i.e., margin).\n\n> This segregation makes brokerages the preferred holding place for cash reserves not needed for normal operations of a company. This safety advantage was illustrated in 2008 when Lehman Brothers, which has both a bank and brokerage, failed. As the New York Fed noted, “Lehman’s bankruptcy caused minimal disruptions to most customers of its broker dealer, Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI). One reason is that, by law, customer assets and Lehman’s own assets were segregated.”1 Brokerage firms also carry insurance for account holders from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to help safeguard assets in the event of a firm’s failure. We’ve provided links at the bottom of this article for more details on SIPC and industry insight.\n\nLehman Brothers failing didn't impact its customers.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "direction mountainous bored fine capable edge trees cover lavish smell\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Nintendo has something like $16 billion cash on hand with zero debt.
