{"title": "If I wanted to short $NFLX through EOY, are buying puts my best bet?", "selftext": "Newb post alert*\n\nI've been a fairly active market participant for close to a decade now but never really with options. Now I'm looking at a few possible methodologies to short through EOY and, while I've taken quick trades in $SQQQ and $NVDS etc in the past, I don't like the idea of the potential for decay over 2 to 3 months. Granted, I'm also aware that Theta Decay is a factor when buying options (although I'll admit I'm not well versed in how to calculate this).\n\nSo, for sake of example, let's say I want to short NFLX in the next few weeks. I see March 15th 2024 options at $315 strike trading at ~$14 ($1400 per contract). Is this too far out? What happens if say, Netflix goes to $290 by December 2023 and I hold one of the aforementioned contracts? I assume it's then 'in the money' and generating some % return? Would I want to continue holding if the share price kept going down?\n\nMy ultimate goal is to (with NFLX or other) enter a short position where I have 3 to 4 months leeway to be 'right' with my price target.\n\nIf anyone has any recommended reading or videos on shorting with puts, duration and assessing things like OI and spread, that would be greatly appreciated!", "id": "16rff6a", "created_utc": 1695607127.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "If you want to offset theta and skew, the best ways to do so are to use a vertical or a diagnal.

Is the idea of just buying the March put as is (no spread or additional legs etc) a bad one? Or would you strongly encourage a spread?

It is a simple binary situation.  On March 15 if the price is above 315 that contract expires with zero value.  You lose the $1400.\nIf nflx is below 315 then the contract has value.  Because you paid $14 for it, you need the price of nflx to reach 301 just to break even.  Any price below creates a profit for you.  The lower it falls the more you make.\n\nNo greeks to consider, it is quite simple.  How confident are you in it moving that far by Mar 15th?\n\nIf you are looking to get profits before expiration, then you have to look at the formula/equation for how an option price is calculated. \nYou already know about theta, each day the time until expiration decreases, but this is just one of the variables.  What about interest rates?  What about emotions (volatility)?\n\nThe greeks are a derivative of the options price.  Each one is a formula/equation.  They change based on the relation of the strike to the stock price, which means they also change based on the variables such as interest rates and volatility.\n\nThe different calculators can give you an estimate of the price of that option at different times and stock prices before expiration, and usually they are fairly close.  But the final result may not be what you expect, depending on what key variables change that are part of the equation that compares the strike price.\n\nWhen and how nflx falls would determine whether 315 is the best strike to play for gains before the expiration or if another strike would be better to buy to make that profit on.\n\nThis is why buying options is so hard to profit on.
