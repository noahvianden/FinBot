If you don't have access, many libraries and universities do. The value of charm is not more difficult than any other greek and the formula is even on Wikipedia.\n\nBloomberg offers Black Scholes discrete (as dividends are usually paid out at certain times as opposed to continous). This requires a PDE solver. With regards to TSLA, you are lucky as the firm pays no dividends. Therefore, the American call price equals the European.\n\nEither way, computing charm will be the easier task, compared to getting the correct IV, dividends (in more general cases) and risk free rate (from swap curves - ICVS in Bloomberg jargon). You can see a few problems with the whole pricing [here](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/73891/54838).\n\nIn any case, I'll show first (with screenshots only) that Black Scholes Discrete and Black Scholes continuous are identical for TSLA (no dividend). Afterwards I will show that the closed form European option formula is identical to the PDE solver solution for American options (in this case).\n\n[Vanilla American BS discontinous](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Bjfm.png)\n\n[Vanilla American BS continuous](https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3CQa.png)\n\n[Vanilla European BS](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ld1QJ.png)\n\nNow let's compute charm (and BSM value). I will hard code the dividend and risk free rate to zero to avoid daycount complications and changing it to appropriate continuous analogue in the example code. For details, you can look at this [OVML](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/70259/quantlib-day-by-day-evaluation-of-option-value/70296#70296) example. Spot, and IV are also hard coded to avoid any decimal precision error that may occur in the GUI (which is rounded unless you manually set to higher precision).\n\nI'll just copy the formula for charm from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Formulae_for_European_option_Greeks). \n\n\nFor example, using [Julia](https://julialang.org/), the complete code looks like this.\n\n    using Distributions,DataFrames\n    N(x) = cdf(Normal(0,1),x)\n    n(x) = pdf(Normal(0,1),x)\n    function BSM(S,K,t,rf,d,σ, cp_flag)\n        d1 = ( log(S/K) + (rf - d + 1/2*σ^2)*t ) / (σ*sqrt(t))\n        d2 = d1 - σ*sqrt(t)\n        value  = cp_flag*exp(-d*t)S*N(cp_flag*d1) - exp(-rf*t)*cp_flag*K*N(cp_flag*d2)\n        charm = d*exp(-d*t)*N(d1) - exp(-d*t)*n(d1)*((2*rf-d)*t -d2*σ*sqrt(t)) / (2*t*σ*sqrt(t))\n      return value, charm/365*100\n    end\n    s,k , t, σ, r, d  = 270, 270, 90/365, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0\n    res = BSM(s,k,t,r,d,σ, 1)\n    DataFrame(Price =  res[1], Charm = res[2])\n\n[Julia code with output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4HUkK.png)\n\nWhich matches Bloomberg to the decimal as you can see [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCPqm.png). \n\nWith regards to the scaling, theta (and as such charm) is expressed in value per year and usually divided by the number of days in a year. Moreover, delta is frequently expressed in percent (40 instead of 0.4). The same applies to the way Bloomberg displays charm, although technically what is displayed depends on your setting. You can read more detail in this [answer](https://money.stackexchange.com/a/154958/109107).\n\nWith American options, provided you have a solver, you can do it with bump and reprice (finite difference). Either you compute delta via a PDE grid or directly via FD as well. Once you have delta, reduce the day by one and compute the finite difference to obtain charm. See [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ADqdn.png) for an example code where I added delta, (exp(-d*t)*N(d1)), to the return statement of the BSM function.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I know someone with commercial access to Bloomberg, will check that out!\n\nI know, it's all out there.

If so, computing the Greeks (and the option value) is more cumbersome because you will need a pde solver and get it from the grid, or do some finite difference computation. If you have the American price, the finite difference is the simplest as you just bump and reprice as shown [here](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/74856/54838) for theta and theta acceleration (second order derivative of theta). As a quick, frequently not so bad proxy because early exercise frequently isn't very important, you can simply use the closed form solution found in any reasonable options textbook or [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Charm). If they are European, just use the formula.\n\nThe notation is a standard second order derivative notation. You start from the option value and get Delta which is sensitivity of option price change with respect to changes in spot. Afterwards, you have Delta change with respect to time. So charm is the change of Delta over time. Just Like theta is [per year](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/74749/54838) in Black Scholes, you get a delta per year value. Therefore you might want to compute the per day value as shown in the link I provided.
