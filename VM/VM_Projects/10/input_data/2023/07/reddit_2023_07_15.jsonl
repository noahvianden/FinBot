I was analyzing how to make them work but got into a lot of \"roadblocks\". If i sold farther OTM for added safety, then adding the long option insurance basically nullifies most of the gains if this long strike is just 1 strike away. If i set the long strike to be farther away, then the max loss protection becomes rather useless because the insurance is so far away. The only combination i found that is worthwhile is if i sell closer to the money, roughly 0.35-0.30 delta and the long has to be tight, just 1 strike away. However, this is to me personally feels very close so i feel like it turns into a gamble. \n\nI'm trying to reduce this gambling risk by only selling when the stock i think is at an inflection point. And testing whether it is better to set up a timed entry into iron condors rather than setting up both sides simultaneously since 0.30 delta on both sides is very tight. I'm thinking of setting up one side at an inflection point, then wait for movement more in the opposite direction first before i complete the other side of the iron condor. This way the channel i create is wider..but this is just my ongoing experiment that i've just started trying, so not sure how well this would go..\n\nI also agree with the difficulty in rolling credit spreads, which im trying to further test now, but i do think the difficulty essentially makes it so that you almost cannot guess wrong", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "SPX Credit Spreads and ICs have been my staple strategy for the past several months..
