In the second quarter of 2023, they reported another massive loss of $257 million, making it a whopping $1.14 billion in total losses for the beleaguered project since December 2019. The Defense, Space, and Security division took a serious hit of $527 million during this quarter, and you guessed it, a big chunk of that was because of the Starliner mess, according to Ars Technica.\n\nAnd also the main reason for this recent loss was the blasted launch delay they announced on June 1. They were supposed to launch the Crew Flight Test on July 1, taking NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore to the International Space Station, but nope, they had to delay it indefinitely because of two major safety issues they discovered. what a rough ride for Boeing and their Starliner", "id": "15cgm4f", "created_utc": 1690597967.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Boeing (and its supplier Spirit) have negative book value, a mountain of debt they'll never escape, profits that are downstream of one of the most cyclical industries (airlines), and incompetent management.
