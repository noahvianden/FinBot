{"title": "Strangles: 50% Delta Roll Mechanics - Simple Process Flow for Strangle Mgmt", "selftext": "Rolling (to me) is the most complex part of managing strangles. To help break this down (see process flow), I've captured when I open positions, how to manage when tested, and when to close. Hopefully, you can use this as a tool to trade more consistently and avoid burnout/blowouts.\n\n(link to process flow) [https://imgur.com/a/z8Wxz3o](https://imgur.com/a/z8Wxz3o)\n\nFor reference, I trade SPX short 12-Delta strangles on a recurring basis as my primary income. Take a look at these details and let me know if you have questions.\n\n**Trade Mechanics:**\n\n* SPX Underline\n   * Reduces stock volatility (based on top 500 underlines)\n   * No early assignment\n   * Continue opening positions until target buying power reached\n   * DTE \\~45 days, monthly expirations\n   * Very liquid\n   * **Alternate underline XSP (1/10th the size of SPX)**\n* Short Strangle Positions\n   * Easy to roll\n   * Opened at 12-Delta (Put position is 12 Delta, Call position is 12 Delta)\n* Profit Targets\n   * 50% original premium collected (calculated when position is opened)\n* Roll Mechanics\n   * When untested position is lower than 50% of tested, then roll untested side to \\~45% delta of tested position.\n* 21 DTE\n   * When position reaches 21 DTE, close position if it’s profitable\n   * Otherwise, roll position next monthly option cycle, 20 Delta (both positions are 20 delta)\n* GTC\n   * Always open GTE orders for each position\n* Logging\n   * Determine 50% profit target when position is opened\n   * Logging original and rolled premium calculates GTC\n* Black Swan and Risk Mitigation\n   * VIX +35 Stop entering trades\n   * VIX +40 exit trades close to breakeven\n   * VIX +50 exit all trades\n* Invest option premium in SWVXX. Sell when position closed (debit) or rolled for debit.\n\nOther than VIX exposition (black swan), this process doesn't define when to exit the strangle for a loss (my process simply continues to roll until profitable). Everyone's risk tolerance is different so you'll need to come up a trigger point to exit (for a loss) and move on to the next position. For context, TastyTrade recommends 2X premium collected.\n\nTastyTrade provides an excellent education and provided me with nearly everything I know.

I wouldn't try this with an iron condor, or rather I would be much more disciplined about closing the trades right away. \n\nwith naked strangles - limiting to XSP/SPX - you can manage for extra credit as long as you have about 1.5-2x the initial mgmt to maintain. this way you won't be liquidated. with fixed condor - especially something too tight like 20-30-wide on SPX, there is a chance if you don't roll ASAP it could be impossible to roll for a credit.\n\nSetup and rolling up mechanics: \n\nwhy 12 delta as opposed to 25? with naked, decay is even faster even if one side is tested, plus rolling brings more money. I guess you were saying you would eventually roll the untested side up anyway... I guess this will even out at the end. \n\nRolling the strangles to the next month:\n\nWith rolling to the next month, you rolled the non-profitable position to 20-delta... but doesn't this mean that the strikes for both the call and put will be different? So this means that it is possible that you would be in the red even after rolling the whole position for another month. Isn't this correct? If the call delta is 0.30 and put delta is 0.18 on the 21st day and you rolled the whole thing for the new monthly 0.2 delta, then you essentially would at best break even or gained minuscule credits. \n\nRisk Management:\n\nI haven't been doing condor/strangles unless I leg in/out with us being in \"hyper greed\" phase (80-82 in CNN's oscillator), we are either going to melt up and continue there for a while, or potential 2-3% pullback that then get bought up within a week.

{"title": "Allogene Therapeutics (ALLO) Potential", "selftext": "As a reminder, clinical stage biotech companies are highly speculative, so there’s considerable risk here – I currently don’t hold any shares or options but am considering taking a small position. Anyway, as someone with an engineering background, here are my thoughts (not financial advice):\n\nAllogene is a leading clinical stage company developing the CAR-T cancer treatment. Without going into too much detail, this involves taking immune cells and [gene editing them to bind to proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-021-00459-7) on the surface of cancer cells to kill them. Currently, these cells must come from the patient themself, which requires individualized preparation that can take up to [6 weeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9439649/) and [cost over $400,000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9439649/) for a single infusion. Despite the challenges, the FDA approved the first CAR-T drug [in 2017](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approval-brings-first-gene-therapy-united-states), validating the safety and efficacy of the technology.\n\nAllogene is investigating a scalable variation called allogenic CAR-T therapy. Instead of using a patient’s own cells, they found a combination of gene edits that allow them to use any [healthy donor’s cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-021-00027-1) instead. This creates an off-the-shelf approach that significantly lowers cost while maintaining [comparable efficacy](https://ir.allogene.com/node/9566/pdf). Essentially, they’re taking the Wendy’s approach to CAR-T therapy – not as personable as a local craft burger restaurant, but far more scalable and affordable.\n\nWith strong [Phase 1 trial results](https://ir.allogene.com/news-releases/news-release-details/allogene-therapeutics-presents-updated-allo-501501a-phase-1-data) released last month and Phase 2 enrollment underway, the company is positioned as a leader in a rapidly expanding market that is estimated to reach [$10B by 2024](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Medical%20Products/Our%20Insights/Driving%20the%20next%20wave%20of%20innovation%20in%20CAR%20T%20cell%20therapies/Driving-the-next-wave-of-innovation-in-CAR-T-cell-therapies-final.pdf). Allogene has [3 active clinical trials with Fast Track Designation](https://allogene.com/pipeline/#), including 1 for solid tumors.\n\nDespite promising prospects, ALLO is currently the most-shorted stock on the NASDAQ exchange with over [45% of shares sold short](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ALLO&ty=c&p=d&b=1) – higher than Carvana. With their strong pipeline, leadership in a rapidly growing field, [support from Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_and_allogene_therapeutics_enter_into_asset_contribution_agreement_for_pfizer_s_allogeneic_car_t_immuno_oncology_portfolio), and sufficient cash runway to last [well into 2025](https://ir.allogene.com/node/9521/pdf), ALLO does not seem to be facing any immediate financial headwinds. The stock currently trades around $5.50, but the median price target is $15, and 14 out of 19 analysts [give the stock a “Buy” rating](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ALLO/research-ratings).\n\nTL;DR ALLO may be over-shorted given the strength of its pipeline and favorable clinical results to date", "id": "155wfxm", "created_utc": 1689965098.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Allogene has a good pipeline imo, could short squeeze, idk why it's shorted so much in the first place though", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
