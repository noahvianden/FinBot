{"title": "US Factory Sector Continues Contraction for Eighth Straight Month, Raising Concerns of Impending Recession", "selftext": "The latest report on the US factory sector reveals a persistent slowdown throughout June, as the overall index remained in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month. Among the details, only four out of eighteen industries experienced growth during this period. The economy is now below its pre-pandemic high, leaving little room to deny the evident slowdown.\n\nOur analysis leads us to maintain our belief that a recession is looming, with today‚Äôs report emphasizing that the goods sector of the economy is likely to be the leading contributor. Respondents of the survey in June expressed concerns about the deceleration of the US economy and more importantly, anticipated reduced demand from customers. \n\nNew orders index also remained in contraction territory for the tenth month in a row. Similarly, the production index fell back into contraction territory in June.\n\nConsumers have been shifting their preferences away from goods and toward services, further exacerbating the situation. \n\nThe combination of decreased consumer demand and accumulated inventories at retailers indicates that factory output is likely to remain sluggish. There is some positive news, as factories have managed to catch up on order backlogs due to fewer new orders and improvements in supply chains. However, the backlogs index, although showing a slight increase in June, remains near the lowest readings since the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nUnfortunately, the slowdown in orders and the reduction in backlogs have started to impact employment, as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction at 48.1 in June. On the inflation front, the prices index witnessed a decline to 41.8 in June, marking the second consecutive decrease after a recent upward trend.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest report on the US factory sector presents a worrisome picture of a persistent slowdown and contraction in June. With the overall index remaining in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month and only a few industries showing growth, it becomes increasingly difficult to deny the evident slowdown. This analysis strongly supports the belief that a recession may be on the horizon, with the goods sector likely to be the primary contributor. Respondents‚Äô concerns about the deceleration of the US economy and anticipated reduced customer demand further emphasize this outlook.\n\nOrder backlogs, which have slightly improved due to fewer new orders and supply chain enhancements, they remain near their lowest levels since the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nRegrettably, the impact on employment is becoming apparent, as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction. Furthermore, the decline in the prices index suggests a possible easing of inflationary pressures.\n\nTaken together, these findings paint a challenging landscape for the US economy. The accumulation of inventories and reduced consumer demand are likely to keep output sluggish in the coming months. Vigilance and proactive measures will be essential to navigate these economic headwinds and mitigate the potential impact on various sectors of the economy.", "id": "14ppyha", "created_utc": 1688406850.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Yup.

Support on the daily is around 440, and again at 430 along with the levels discussed earlier. Resistance remains around the 450 mark.\n\n**Price predictions for next week**\n\nI predict a small pullback to around 438-440 on Monday, given the short trading day and expected low volume. I think a lot of money will be sitting on the sidelines until Wednesday, with a rally to test the 450 level by the end of the week. Provided we make higher highs than last week, a dip to 438-440 would not put a damper on the bull run. If we manage to break that level, I believe support will be found around 430. Only a break below 430 would really dampen this uptrend we are in, if buyers fail to create a higher high next week. If the high this week is lower than last, and we break 430, I would consider that a double top and look for downside. But, everything in the chart is bullish for now, and I think any downside plays besides intraday scalps are not a wise play. For this week and likely the next few weeks until FOMC later this month, the bulls are likely to remain in control.\n\n***Positions:*** *No current positions in SPY, but looking to enter a 440-443c on Monday, expiring 7/7 and planning to exit the position if, and when SPY hits around 448-450.*\n\n**TL;DR:** SPY is continuing it‚Äôs bullish trend with no signs of stopping. A slight pull back may occur, but it would take a major correction to undo the long term uptrend we are in. This week, I forsee a slight pullback to around 440, followed by a climb to retest the 450 area.", "id": "14p876n", "created_utc": 1688356642.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|624|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: SPY is continuing it‚Äôs bullish trend with no signs of stopping.

The significant rise in borrowing costs has raised concerns in the United States that the world's largest economy may slip into a recession later this year.\n\n\"The more motivated people are to tighten rates, the greater the uncertainty around those lags, and the more extreme economic outcomes risk becoming,\" said Mr. Ivascyn, adding that it typically takes five or six quarters for the impact of higher rates to be felt in the economy.\n\n\"We think the market may still be too confident in the quality of central banks' decisions and their ability to achieve positive outcomes,\" stated Mr. Ivascyn. \"We think the market is a bit too optimistic about central banks' ability to lower policy rates as quickly as yield curves suggest,\" he added.\n\nAlthough U.S. inflation has significantly decreased from the highs reached last summer, it remains twice as high as the Fed's 2% target, with a 4.0% annual rate in May. According to Mr. Ivascyn, inflation remains a real concern.\n\n\"Today, we have a legitimate inflation problem. It will likely be harder for central banks to ease their policy even if the economy weakens as long as inflation comfortably remains above their \\[2%\\] targets,\" he stated.\n\nHe further mentioned that the fixed-income asset manager is shifting towards high-quality government and corporate bonds to be \"more defensive and more liquid.\"", "id": "14plzv1", "created_utc": 1688397670.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: PIMCO is bracing for a \"rough landing\" of the global economy, suggesting that investors may be overly confident in policymakers' ability to lower interest rates in the near future.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So someone selling bonds is saying that the stock market is crashing ?", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "‚ÄúYou should buy bonds‚Äù says local bond seller.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "PIMCO is a permabear.", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I'm glad I don't have to worry about things like inflation, I'm too rich and intelligent for that.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "But you don‚Äôt have an ass‚Ä¶ oops, sorry, wrong bot.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Pimcock", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "More like pimpco", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "PIMCO like Mike Wilson are so out of their depth for making a call on up, down or sideways.
