I understand that it is subject to individual’s risk tolerance and knowledge. I am looking for a general advice / suggestion on this. \n\n1. When selecting the stocks for LEAPs, are there any things y’all consider such as fundamental analysis, chart patterns, analysts’ estimates etc.\n\n2. Liquidity of LEAPs: How would you measure if LEAPs are liquid. Non-technology companies (especially bio-tech and Pharma) not really having a good volume / OI for long future dates. Would it be very risky for such companies?\n\n3. Which expiry is a safe/sweet spot of LEAPS (1 year, 1.5 years)?\n\n4. Would y’all be preferring ETFs (QQQ, SPY, XLF… etc) over individual stocks for LEAPs?\n\n5. How about LEAPs on the leveraged ETFs like TQQQ, SOXL etc? Does it affect huge decays as they are very volatile?\n\nCurrently, I own LEAPs of BABA, INTC and SMAR. My selections for the LEAPs partly because of the underlying price (< $100) makes them affordable and are based on Conviction, Fundamentals and growth potential in next 1 year ( I hope/wish they grow :)). I have allocated certain percentage of my portfolio to LEAPS, which gives me a budget of about $10K. I am thinking of 4-5 LEAPs with that. Although I love companies like ADBE, MSFT, BKNG etc. their LEAPs options are very expensive. I would hardly get 1-2 for my 10K budget, which might hinder the “diversity” factor. \n\nAppreciate your responses! \n\nHappy Investing!", "id": "14p1by3", "created_utc": 1688337180.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Generally, consider shares for longer term trades.  \n\n1.

All the bullet items you mentioned could also be applied to buying shares, and in a lot of cases, ought to be buying shares over calls, since there are significant disadvantages to using LEAPS calls.\n\nThe key decision point for calls vs. shares is that (a) the shares cost too much, even for just 1 share, and (b) leverage is more important to you than every other consideration, including all the negatives associated with calls, like time decay and expiration.\n\nOtherwise, apply those various screening techniques to just buy shares.

He anticipates a “harder landing” than other investors, emphasizing that increased tightening measures lead to greater uncertainty and pose a risk to economic stability. \n\nIvascyn argues that the market is too confident in central banks’ capacity to quickly reduce policy rates as implied by yield curves. Despite recent rate hikes by central banks, core inflation remains high, making it difficult for them to cut rates if the economy weakens. \n\nPimco is repositioning its funds to be more defensive and liquid, anticipating potential market volatility and potential opportunities in the higher-yielding space in the next few years. Ivascyn warns that this economic cycle may be different, with central banks being less inclined to provide support to avoid fueling inflation, and the transfer of risk to private markets may slow down credit valuations’ deterioration but not prevent it.\n\nSource: https://www.ft.com/content/c407fdb0-12cc-41cc-a732-554393011f40", "id": "14opdkb", "created_utc": 1688307288.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Bill Gross effed up rate calls just like this right before he was pushed out of PIMCO.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "this isn’t a rate call, it’s a credit call.
