{"title": "Tesla's 2022 Q4 Results", "selftext": "Here's a quick take on Tesla's Q4 results. $81.5B is the FY2022 revenue, a growth of 51.4% year over year from FY2021. The gross margin increased for the year from 25.3% to 26.2%. Net income increased 128% from $5.5B to $12.5B. Expect EBITDA to be at least $17.6B this year, an increase of 9% or so from FY2021.\n\nGiven these results, the valuations are as follows: the invested capital of Tesla is 5.1x LTM or FY2022 revenue -- remember, this multiple includes Tesla's huge cash balance of over $21b. The EBITDA multiple is about 25x while the earnings multiple (over market cap) is around 30.0x. Based on 2023E results, the earnings multiple should be around 26.0x. In other words, they're coming down like many growth companies that turn the corner and report positive earnings. Tesla was EBITDA positive starting in 2016 and earnings positive starting in 2020. The revenue growth year over year is 51.4% from FY2022. Plus these multiples would be somewhat lower if you took out the cash Tesla has: the actual trading multiple based on its businesses would be more reasonable: 4.7x revenue; 17x EBITDA; 30x earnings.\n\nAt $148, Tesla seems to be fairly valued based on continued growth: would expect another 50% sales growth for FY2023 and improving EBITDA and NI margins. The valuation isn't that ridiculous assuming the growth rates and profit margins are reached in 2023 and beyond. The question is how threatening is competition from the new entrants to the EV market introducing their own models.\n\nAddendum: Tesla turned FCF positive starting in FY2019. One concern is the amount of capex necessary to keep churning out vehicles.  The average capex the last 5Y is nearly $4 billion per year.  Assuming that plant capacity hasn't been reached and capex goes down to the $2.5B level, this shouldn't be a concern.

This could be huge for the company and earn it much more revenue in the future.\n\nDespite faltering domestically, Facebook is still growing worldwide.\n\n**Case for selling or holding off:**\n\nFacebook is facing strong competition from the likes of TikTok\n\nFirst mover advantage has very little precedent in the tech industry in which market growth is so high and technological change is so quick that it's easy for rivals to do something better. None of the big tech companies were first movers. Google replaced Yahoo which started out competing with other search engines. Amazon replaced Book Stacks Unlimited (tbf, Amazon was kind of a first mover for overall online retail). Apple replaced Osborne in the PC market before getting overtaken by Microsoft (Apple eventually bounced back with iphones and macs). Facebook itself replaced MySpace. What I'm trying to say is that Facebook's virtual reality is likely to face some serious competition from probably one of the other big tech companies. There is already talk of Apple developing its own virtual reality.\n\n**Personal thoughts:**\n\nI think with everything said, Facebook would be a good buy in the short or medium term but not the long term (investors should pay careful attention to the development of virtual reality by potential rivals). Investors may eventually come to the conclusion that they overshot their fear. Netflix went down 68% in 2022 but has since then doubled.

{"title": "Is AT&T a Sinking Ship or Not?", "selftext": "Hey everyone! I've been looking at AT&T as a dividend opportunity and decided to share my research with you so, without further ado... Behold! AT&T. A stock with history and a stock that has been through a lot. You don't see a lot of companies that hit their all-time highs 24 years ago and are still trading at half price apart from Intel, maybe (they've been having a rough patch, too). Now, I last talked about AT&T over a year ago and I didn't really have a lot of nice things to say about it back then, but has the outlook for AT&T changed in 2023? Well, let's see!\n\n# Operations\n\nFirst of all, AT&T's operations are showing growth in numbers. The telecom company added 2.9 million postpaid wireless subscriptions, 280 thousand fiber net subscription marking the 12th consecutive quarter of more than 200 thousand additions! In terms of 5G, AT&T now covers 150 million people, too! Overall, these are very solid results and better than what analysts and AT&T's management expected.\n\n# Profits\n\nWhat about revenue, earnings and all that? In 2023, AT&T brought in 120.7 billion dollars in revenue and adjusted earnings per share were 2.57 dollars. Reported EPS was actually negative 1.1 dollars, but that was due to non-cash charges, mainly around impairments. AT&T's free cash flow was a 14.1 billion dollars which is okay, but it's not great by any means. The management's forward guidance was also decent. The expectations for 2023 are growth in wireless and broadband of 4% or more, capital investments of about 24 billion dollars, similar to 2022, free cash flow of 16 billion dollars or better which is an expected increase of 12% although AT&T does expect to see a slight drop in earnings per share.\n\nOverall, AT&T performed well in 2022 and is expecting slow, but steady growth in 2023. On the good side, it seems that the Warner Media spin off has not impacted AT&T's business in the way I thought it would. The operations are looking leaner. After we exclude the non-cash impairments, operating expenses in Q4 have actually dropped a bit from 26.2 billion in the year-ago quarter to 25.8 in this quarter. However, there are two big risk considerations here.\n\n# The Two Main Risks\n\nFirst of all, the free cash flow. We are seeing a pretty significant drop from previous years due to the Warner Media spin off. Less free cash flow means less security when it comes to dividend. It also means less money left over for capital investments. Overall, less free cash flow equals lower chances of growth and less money being returned to shareholders. At the end of the day, as investors, we want to make a profit and seeing this drop with AT&T is expected, but still worrying. That is definitely something to keep an eye on. The good thing is that, like we saw, management expects higher free cash flow in 2023, but that is still just an expectation and not a fact.\n\nThe second and much bigger problem I'm seeing is debt. I've never been a fan of companies that rely too much on debt and have a high leverage. I understand why they would do that and with the extremely low interest rates of the last 10 to 12 years, it makes absolute sense. However, it does make a company more fragile and more susceptible during tough economic conditions. Historically, telecomms have been hit harder during recessions, too, which means that AT&T is not really well-positioned for the upcoming year in my opinion. As of the end of the 2022 financial year, AT&T has $135.9 billion dollars in debt. That's a lot considering their equity was 122.4 billion at the end of the third quarter! Their interest payments for 2021 were 7.67 billion dollars. It is looking like the 2022 interest payments will be similar, but given the rising interest rates, it is only a matter of time before the increased interest payments start weighing down on AT&T.\n\n# Valuation\n\nNow, these are two big issues that AT&T desperately needs to work on to get their business in order. However, does AT&T's current price and dividend justify the risk? Let's take a look. I'll be looking at the adjusted ratios because they reflect the underlying business better. AT&T's trailing adjusted PE ratio is only 6.7 and their forward adjusted PE ratio is 7.4. Historically, these are a bit lower since the 5-year average for AT&T stands at 8.7 and 8.9 respectively. However, let's look at their main competitors, Verizon and T-Mobile. Verizon has PE ratios of 7.8 and 8.2 respectively, whereas T-Mobile stands at 21.7 and 66.8 although T-Mobile really has a much different business model and focuses on growth without paying a dividend. In terms of forward price-to-cash-flow, AT&T has the lowest at 4 versus Verizon's 4.5 and T-Mobile's 11.1. It is also lower than it's 5-year historical average which stands at 4.6. Finally, AT&T is again cheapest when it comes to price-to-book with only 1.1 versus 1.7 for Verizon and 2.6 for T-Mobile and historical average of 1.2. Overall, we can see that AT&T is trading at some discount to both its historical performance and its competitors so there is some compensation for the risks that I've outlined above.\n\n# Dividend\n\nFinally, the dividend is one of the biggest arguments for AT&T. Despite the recent dividend cut, AT&T still yields about 5.8% which is a very decent yield. Unfortunately, it is below Verizon's 6.5% yield and below the 5-year historical AT&T average of 6.6%. The payout ratio is similar to Verizon's as both companies have between 45 to 50% there. Plus, chances are AT&T will not raise its dividend until its financials have become improved while Verizon has been showing a slow, but steady annualized dividend growth of 2.5% over the last 10 years.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo, what's my final take on AT&T? Honestly, it's hard to see a strong bullish case for the company. Best case scenario, the AT&T stock is a weak buy simply because it has some turnaround potential. However, I personally would not make it a big bet given that I'm not expecting a very rosy economic outlook ahead. In fact, I would avoid both AT&T and Verizon and instead simply buy some of the Charles Schwab's Dividend Equity ETF. It's a lot more reliable and, while it has a much lower dividend yield, it offers a much better total return in my opinion while being exposed to a lot less risk. I may consider buying AT&T if and only if the price drops further down, maybe about $16. Remember, AT&T is a company that hits its all-time high 24 years ago and is heading into a possible recession with a massive debt burden. There are simply better options on the market.\n\nIf I've made an obvious mistake, let me know, please.

The x axis is the value of the move and the y axis is how many it occurred, *so spikes correspond to the highest occurrences*.\n\n>**‚áí Most historic moves are concentrated between -10 and +10, with however many occurrences of peaks at +15% and drops at -16%, and overall a very volatile stock on earnings**\n\nGiven these informations, we can start looking at possible plays for betting on the stock moving higher than the past average of +/-7% as this is a volatile stock on earnings - if we can find a suitable trade in terms of break-even.\n\nOne thing to always keep in mind is the IV crush: implied volatility rises in the days leading to the earnings release which makes holding options positions through earnings risky where I.V drops significantly right after the release, inflicting a high loss on long options positions if the stock price does not exceed the implied move.\n\nStock price at the time of this write-up is 143.1$, near close Tuesday , so closest strikes is the143$ for the closest expiration of 01-27.\n\n# TSLA 01-27 143p 143c\n\n[***link to position***](https://app.earnings-watcher.com/#/positions?symbol=TSLA&pos=TSLA.147.0.c.01-27;;s;;)\n\nWe see the straddle is showing a small delta of 0.08 and a gamma of 0.15: this position is non-directional, meaning it gets affected in the same way wether the stock moves up or down. Gamma shows us how *fast* that reaction is.\n\nLooking at IV, the call IV is 108% vs 110% for the put. **These values of IV are not informative on their own: they need to be compared to historic IV around earnings, and more importantly, we need to know how they will impact any position when IV drops after earnings. This translates into thee break-even of the position and its p&l for different scenarios of stock moves, and that's what we will be looking into**\n\nThis is the position break-even, calculated for exactly Thursday, taking into account the drop of IV for this position from 110% to 80%:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpcyi6glu3ea1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=504b1ba28536429e1a4ed5a67e4eb0a9fae562d0\n\n>**Break-even**: **-9% +7.8%**\n\nThis is a bit higher than the average historic move of +/-7% and skewed to the downward side given the strikes and IV.\n\n**Worst case scenario of no stock move will yield a -50% loss:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvap36lou3ea1.png?width=3100&format=png&auto=webp&s=326d976a1662afe55abc5097149c9adbe18abd7e\n\n# We can better estimate maximum profit and loss\n\nLet's look at P&Ls for minimum and maximum historic moves from the analysis earlier.\n\n>**Minimum move of +/-0% => P&L: -50%**  \n>  \n>**Minimum move of +/-3% => P&L: -38%**  \n>  \n>**Maximum move of +/-11% => P&L: +50%**  \n>  \n>**Moonshot move of +/-15% => P&L: +70%**\n\n*This can be used to calibrate stop-loss and take-profit thresholds with some margin:*\n\n**Aggressive** (willing to hold for maximum move even through no move at the beginning)\n\nTake-profit: +50% | Stop-Loss: -50%\n\n**Mild** (happy with just an average past move, and cutting it if the move is a bit over the minimum)\n\nTake-profit: 30% | Stop-Loss: -30%\n\n**A good practice is to not activate the stop less in the first hour to give the market time to react, then we either exit at stop loss or take profit,** we are ready for the potential loss so might as well give ourselves more room since most of the loss will occur at open.\n\nLet's see if we can lower the potential loss of 50% and perhaps our break-even too by selling some out-of-money legs.\n\n# TSLA 01-27 long143p 143c short 148c 138p\n\n[***link to position***](https://app.earnings-watcher.com/#/positions?symbol=TSLA&pos=TSLA.143.0.c.01-27;;TSLA.143.0.p.01-27sTSLA.148.0.c.01-27;;TSLA.138.0.p.01-27)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2mu5sxex3ea1.png?width=3104&format=png&auto=webp&s=da83fcab8a22f19bc06c64bf581deca577f22edb\n\nBreak-even is now lower at -7.2% +6% which is lower than the average historic of +/-7%, and we lowered our potential loss to -15%, but on the other hands we also reduced our potential gains:\n\n>**Minimum move of +/-0% => P&L: -15%**  \n>  \n>**Minimum move of +/-3% => P&L: -10%**  \n>  \n>**Maximum move of +/-11% => P&L: +10%**  \n>  \n>**Moonshot move of +/-15% => P&L: +15%**\n\nHope this is helpful, lemme know if you have any questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nData from [*EarningsWatcher*](https://earnings-watcher.com)", "id": "10kor50", "created_utc": 1674616981.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Well good DD bt I m selling strangles 95 put and 195 call expiring 17th Feb .

{"title": "General Dynamics has now the opportunity to permanently displace German competition in the European main battle tank market -> Long", "selftext": "* GD is a fundamentally well-positioned defense contractor with a strong order book, an attractive dividend yield (consistently increased its dividend for 28 years, safe payout ratio of around 41%), and steady share repurchases (reduced the total number of shares outstanding by approximately 22% from 2012 to 2022).\n* Germany has just announced that it will allow the supply of Leopard 2 to Ukraine (and that Leopards of the German Armed Forces will be delivered to Ukraine).\n* The German defense industry is far from being able to replace the tanks supplied to Ukraine. The production capacity of the Leopard 2 manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann was already [stretched](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/plus238759401/Leopard-Panzer-So-gross-ist-der-deutsche-Ruestungs-Rueckstand.html) last summer.\n* Even if the German government were to use the ‚Ç¨100 billion that Mr. Scholz announced at the end of February 2022 for his \"Zeitenwende\" to increase production capacity for German tanks (which would probably be too late now), German defense industry faces a severe ¬†[shortage](https://www.handelsblatt.com/karriere/ruestungsindustrie-von-400-kandidaten-beisst-einer-an-wen-deutschlands-waffenhersteller-gerade-dringend-suchen/28497644.html) of skilled workers.\n* GD now has a unique opportunity to sell M1A2 Abrams tanks in Europe. Poland (which has 247 Leopard 2 tanks and wants to send some of them to Ukraine) has already ordered 250 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks in Q3 2022 and just 116 more Abrams M1A1s. [Some 2000 Leopard 2s are in service with the armed forces of 15 European countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/20/leopard-2-german-tanks-what-are-they-why-does-ukraine-want-them) and defense spending in the EU even [grow by 6%](https://eda.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2022/12/08/european-defence-spending-surpasses-200-billion-for-first-time-driven-by-record-defence-investments-in-2021) before Russia's war of aggression started.\n* Choosing a tank model is a commitment for decades. No army can switch from one model to another overnight. Different tank models require special infrastructure, tank crews need to be trained for a particular model, and a tank model with its special features needs to be integrated into an army. This means that if GD is in, it will stay in.\n* Selling a tank model generates steady revenue. In the third quarter of 2022, for example, GD earned $125 million in \"systems and sustainment technical support services\" and $40 million in spare parts for the U.S. Army's Abrams tanks.\n* Selling more tanks results in more cost-effective production and therefore a higher margin. GD has already a higher profit margin (8.62%) than the sector median (6.74%). McKinsey analysts estimate that doubling the production of a main battle tank can reduce labor costs by [20% and material costs by 10%](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/public%20and%20social%20sector/our%20insights/enlisting%20productivity%20to%20reinforce%20european%20defense/the%20future%20of%20european%20defence.pdf). GD has now the opportunity to become by far the most competitive main battle tank manufacturer. In the long term, the M1A2 could become NATO's standard main battle tank.\n* So I am long in GD.\n\n**This is not financial advice.**", "id": "10l6zzl", "created_utc": 1674674288.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xyz1pg/why_not_att/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10l6zzl/general_dynamics_has_now_the_opportunity_to/) \n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Unless they let them manufacture parts in EU.
