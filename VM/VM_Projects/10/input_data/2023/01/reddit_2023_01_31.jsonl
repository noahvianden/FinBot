The company is expected to report its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, with analysts projecting another decline in the first quarter. Meta lost two-thirds of its value last year.\n\nBosworth was promoted to CTO in 2021, replacing Mike Schroepfer, who had been with the company since 2008. Bosworth is overseeing Meta‚Äôs ambitious and costly endeavor to develop the digital world of the metaverse, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said will define the company‚Äôs future.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that he doesn‚Äôt miss startup life, ‚ÄúI do miss the profound sense of focus,‚Äù Bosworth wrote.\n\nWith limited money and resources, ‚Äúwe were constantly tight on servers, on memory, and on bandwidth,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut over time, Facebook experienced some product sprawl, putting effort into too many different projects. He used nonprofits as an example, noting that in the early days employees would ask Zuckerberg to support a group or cause.\n\n‚ÄúMark would always say no,‚Äù Bosworth wrote. ‚ÄúHe would explain that it isn‚Äôt that we don‚Äôt care about good causes, it is that our comparative advantage wasn‚Äôt going to be making good donations.‚Äù\n\nThat changed as the company got bigger, more employees asked for Facebook contribute and there was enough money to do it. And considering that there‚Äôs nothing bad about supporting nonprofits, ‚Äúwe just stopped saying ‚Äòno.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI picked a cultural example here but the exact same thing happens in our products at a larger scale and with higher stakes,‚Äù Bosworth wrote.\n\nBosworth doesn‚Äôt specify any areas where the current version of Meta lacks focus, and he says the company has a ‚Äúcore feature offering that is strong.‚Äù He did offer an example of how the company can still get off track.\n\n‚ÄúA small feature idea comes up that serves a subset of the market,‚Äù Bosworth wrote. ‚ÄúBut it isn‚Äôt too hard to do and it isn‚Äôt a bad thing, so we indulge. ‚Äù\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúRepeat that thought process a hundred times and you have a cluttered UI, a large team, a slow product, and no obvious path forward.‚Äù\n\nMeta investors have been urging the company to focus on its core online ad business, which has come under pressure from a number of challenges, including a weak economy and increased competition. Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital and a Meta investor, wrote in an open letter to the company in October that the company needs to ‚Äúget fit and focused,‚Äù and he was critical of the hefty investment in the nascent metaverse.\n\nIn November, Meta said it would lay off over 11,000 employees as part of the company‚Äôs plans to cut costs amid a tough digital advertising market.", "id": "10qax3a", "created_utc": 1675200192.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Lol focus on buttering up some Senators and getting TikTok banned.", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well yeah.

{"title": "The treasury market is severely mispricing higher for longer rates, giving regards awesome opportunity", "selftext": "I know this sub usually likes to dip its tits in profitless shitcos mostly, but the market gods have bestowed on us a play that gives proper homage to the 80s degen bond traders that would rip a line of schneef off their quotron and throw their own poo at a bond salesman.\n\nAnyway, the prevailing bias in the treasury market since the GFC has been as you'd expect... unlimited QE, money printing, and ZIRP. Culminating into a treasury market that consists of a bunch of lobotomized regards that think the feds main responsibility is to pump asset markets. This was only reinforced in 2018 when paper shake Powell got bullied by Donny T into feeding the addicted regards what they want most, cuts. Even today, these same regards will use this scenario as proof that Powell will back down.\n\nHowever, inflation has changed the playing field. The U.S. Dollar is one of the primary load bearing pillars of power for America and if that is lost the whole house comes toppling down. I'll spare you the lecture on inflation but it is literally an empire killer that shakes the foundations of a country from the inside and out.\n\nLets not forget, Powell literally lived and worked through the 1970s and saw first hand the de-stabilizing effect inflation had on growth. And subsequently the decisive and powerful kick in the d\\*ck that Volcker gave to the economy to rout inflation and sow the seeds for one of the largest bull markets of the era. Furthermore, Powell has even brought up Volckers ability to remain vigilant in the face of backlash that caused many of his predecessors like Arthur Burns to relent restarting the inflation spiral.\n\nBack to the present, Powell has shown his ability to be flexible and decisive in raising rates up to this point. But lets not forget that real rates are still supremely negative. All these idiots talking about 4.5% yield when inflation is hanging around 6% on the conservative end. To quote the GOAT Stanley Druckenmiller: \"Once inflation goes above 5%, it has never come back down without the Fed Funds Rate exceeding CPI\". The situation is still bleak at best in terms of the inflation fight.\n\nHowever, the prevailing bias I have mentioned still hasn't changed from the unlimited QE lobotomites who have brought us to where we are now. Where a couple inflation prints that show a .2 reduction in a 6 handle inflation as a reason to front run QE, rate cuts, and ZIRP lala land. Giving way to considerable easing in financial conditions. This is what has created the ridiculous mispricing of the treasury market.\n\nPowell has hypothesised out a terminal rate of around 5% for rates. At peak hawkishness on interest rates, the 20 year treasury was yielding 4.5% back in October/November. But, since the slightest reduction in the rate of inflation the yield has since dropped to 3.7% on the 20 year. Essentially slapping Powell in the face. This is where the opportunity lies, Powell will have to whip his sausage out and slap the market with it to continue the fight at some point.\n\nMy instrument of choice in the interest rate campaign has been TLT , the 20yr and longer treasury ETF, I have made some great gains in 2022 from shorting this ETF. But since the considerable easing, IV on TLT has reached a near low of \\~16. Culminating in a severely underpriced scenario for us regards to enjoy.\n\n**Positions/conclusion:**\n\nAdmittedly, I made some tactical errors in positioning for this hypothesis as I discounted just how regarded the bond market is being in trying to get back to sweet sweet ZIRP and have taken paper casualties. Moreover, I got greedy and impatient in opening some of my positions strikes and durations. As well as not closing some gains when interest rates rose in early January, but tis the tide of war.\n\nHowever, the thesis remains strong, shooting for around a 4-4.5%(around 90-95 TLT pricing) terminal rate for longer term treasuries there is ample opportunity for profit off of this market. I would recommend sacrificing some exponential gain opportunity for duration in option contracts. (Time and Patience are the greatest warriors of all) This is also of minor issue because IV is so cheap as of now on TLT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/njf2e4yuiffa1.jpg?width=1729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0de0a65c6520f4f977db9ed6b4ff2936fa710903", "id": "10q7veu", "created_utc": 1675192919.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|764|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wwrr2e/the_treasury_market_is_fucking_nuts_right_now_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xmwfkm/half_of_yall_are_the_equivalent_of_a_german/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vsumkl/guide_to_the_galaxy_vol_1_hood/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10q7mr8/the_treasury_market_is_severely_mispricing_higher/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10q7veu/the_treasury_market_is_severely_mispricing_higher/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Ignore the bond market regarding narrative and trade accordingly.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I think that the market is underestimating the potential for inflation to pick up in the near future.
