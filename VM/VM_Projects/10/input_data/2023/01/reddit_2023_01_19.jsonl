Wall Street was looking for 42 cents a share from $1.68 billion in sales. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Fastenal reported 40 cents a share from $1.53 billion in sales.\n\nIt’s a small top and bottom line “beat.” Fastenal stock was little changed in premarket trading shortly after results were announced, while S&P 500**SPX** **–0.86%**  and Dow Jones Industrial Average**DJIA** **–0.69%**  futures are both off 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.\n\nDespite the muted reaction, there are some positives investors can take from Fastenal’s report.\n\nAverage prices rose almost 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. That was a result of price increases taken in the first three quarters of the year. The company didn’t take any broad pricing action in the fourth quarter. Moderating inflation is a positive for the company and the economy.\n\nModerating demand isn’t a positive. Demand did slow at Fastenal in the fourth quarter, but daily sales from Fastenal locations—the metric Fastenal uses to compare demand from period to period—rose 10.7% year over year.\n\nAnother way Fastenal tracks demand is whether sales to its largest 100 accounts are growing. Sales grew at 79 of the 100 top accounts in the fourth quarter. That figure was 83 out of 100 for the third quarter of 2022.\n\nDistributors such as Fastenal are a good real-time read on the manufacturing economy. They sell thousands of low-price products to tens of thousands of customers across the country. Things aren’t as good as they were, but they certainly aren’t terrible headed into 2023.\n\nFastenal hosts an earnings [conference call](https://investor.fastenal.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2023/Fastenal-Company-Annual-and-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx) at 10 a.m. eastern time. Investors will be looking for more insight on the health of the U.S. industrial economy when management speaks.\n\n[Options markets](https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-investors-can-use-options-trades-to-profit-during-earnings-season-51580520335?mod=article_inline) had implied that the stock would move about 4%, up or down, following earnings. That’s similar to the volatility experienced after earnings over the past four quarterly reports. Shares have fallen three times and risen once over that span.\n\nComing into Thursday trading, Fastenal stock is flat over the past three months. Shares are down about 19% over the past 12 months.

Why never ever talk bi-weeklies? \n\nI was procrastinating heavily today (goddammit) and thinking back and forth about selling bi-weekly strangles, say, on SPX, say, symmetrically at 5-15 delta.  \n\nCuriously to me, the bi-weekly timeframe opens the possibilities for a twist. Hear me out, then destroy me if you can. \n\nHedging for tailrisk (and, in fact, turning the trade on the one-week timescale into a defined risk trade) can be done by purchasing the corresponding one-week-out puts and calls at the same strike. \n\nPlan: Either exit at 50% gain, around 300% loss, or renew the position after a week.\n\nNote, with the hedges on, and exiting definitely after one week, this is a defined risk position.\n\nDepending on the chosen deltas, return on (the defined!) risk can easily be 20%. Premium received upfront compared to the risk can range from 10-100% depending on choice of deltas.\n\nAs a benchmark I take 5 delta on the short legs. At the moment this corresponds roughly to selling  an SPX put and call at 3600/4150 two weeks out, and buying the same strikes one week out. \n\nTaking the probabilty of profit of the (unhedged) strangles as benchmark, probability of profit is easily around 90%. As an alternative gauge, options profit calculator shows that taking the position out would roughly require a 5% weekly move (I was eyeballing this only), which is, I estimate, of the same sparsity (please do speak up if you have exact historical data for the expected probability of a 5% weekly move). \nOf course one can rather straightforwardly use current VIX to get the actual present numbers. \n\nOn a 3% weekly move, or less, returns on risk should be north of 2% a week. To good to be true for sure. \n\nDo you think this is stupid? Or inefficient? \n\nMain risk I see by playing around is hefty drop and corresponding IV expansion (currently 'low' IV might be why the returns are so incredibly high, ie. IV expansion is priced in risk). \n\nHow do you usually hedge strangles against IV expansion?\n\nAny feedback on this is highly appreciated. \n\nI started a paper position today and hope to follow it through for a bit (usually I get bored by losing paper money). \n \nNote: effectively this is selling a fancy crippled double diagonal, just if you wonder.

If you think there is a variant of this play with more favorable expectation value, please give an example such that I can compare.\n\nI guess you mean something that is more balanced in Vega for the money?! I also thought of setting the trade up like this: go to 5 delta on the shorter dated longs and then pick the according longer dated shorts accordingly (roughly gives 12-15 delta on them). Is this something you consider better? This may be more favorable and I'm actually trying both.\n\nIf you say notional risk, it seems you think of naked SPX assignment, right? But this is not the correct way of thinking here as I have my risk defined at all times (besides risk for massive IV expansion). So let's walk this through. What's the biggest risk here? The risk is SPX makes a >3 sigma move on the two week time scale, and exactly such a move only. The strategy wins against any other move, say even quicker, shorter moves or slowly grinding some direction or chopping. \n\nJust to be clear, the odds of such a move would require a multiple successive 2% daily moves to random walk and, at first, exactly cause a weekly 5% move, which I estimate to be 3 sigma move as well (if anybody has odds of SPX historical weekly 5% moves, please share it! The benefit of picking the shorter dated strikes first would be that I can adjust this risk on the first week directly).\n\nNow if a 5% move where to happen on the first week i'd be down deeply because of likely volatility expansion -- for successive 2% days current VIX would have to expand by ~50%. However I would notice that two to three days in the play because I cannot cash out for a profit. However what I can do is to sell the shorter dated long calls and eventually take profit on the untested side (the exact strikes for the longs I still have to fine tune, but they definitely compensate some of the gamma on the longer dated shorts - Vega is the main risk here). Using this money and my collected premium I can either accept the loss, close the trade and move on. Alternatively, turn the tested side into a put spread for a debit, now completely defining the risk (whether this is better than closing the position outright depends on the exact market conditions and expectation for moves in the second week - usually after 3sigma move it should rebound at least a little or consolidate, not throw out another 5% move). Depending on the moves in the second week I can decide how to manage the put spread to recover some of my losses. I can immediately proceed to sell a new combo for the subsequent two weeks, this time at higher IV which is favorable. \n\nNote that the described scenario is the worst case scenario with high move and high IV expansion. For a squeeze up odds are certainly more favorable. In any case, in more than 90% of time I should be able to wait out the moves and let the position expire. It may dig into my buying power but this should be executed on an account that could handle at leat the max loss at end of first week (my estimated 300%) and subsequently the max loss defined by the put spread.\n\nThe two step structure in time turns this play into something like the goat problem of statistics but I will have to think more about this aspect of the play.\n\nEdit: just noted 3 sigma would be lower than 1 delta and all that I said about 3 std. deviations is ment to say 2 std. deviations, math is still OK though. Also note that I always take this as one-sided, while people usually do the two sided cuts, I e. Add the tails and compare to bod of distribution VS. Just take a single tail vs. The rest which, I think would make more sense for example for a short put. E. G. People put 16 deltas as a 1 sigma event while clearly if you are just interested in one side you should actually take 32.5 delta as on std. Deviation this explains my wrong notation.

{"title": "Is Carvana about to get 3-holed some more?", "selftext": "Carvana Co. (CVNA) is an e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars. The company operates an online marketplace for consumers to purchase and finance vehicles, as well as an online wholesale platform for dealers to purchase vehicles. Carvana went public in April 2017, and since then its shares have been volatile, with a high of around $290 in Jan 2018 and a low of around $4 in March 2020. As of 2021, Carvana is valued at $16.9 billion.\n\nLet's see why they might be fucked\n\n1.  High valuation: Carvana's valuation is (still) high relative to its earnings. This means that the company's stock may be overvalued and that investors may be paying too much for the company's earnings potential.\n\n2.  High debt levels: Carvana has a high level of debt, which could be a concern for investors. High debt levels can make a company more vulnerable to economic downturns and can limit its ability to invest in growth opportunities.\n\n3.  Dependence on online sales: Carvana's business model is heavily dependent on online sales, which could limit the company's ability to reach and serve customers who may be hesitant to purchase a car online.\n\n4.  Competition: Carvana faces significant competition from both traditional brick-and-mortar used car dealers as well as other online used car platforms. This competition could limit the company's growth potential and profitability.\n\n5.  Economic downturn: Carvana's business is closely tied to economic conditions. In a recession, consumers may be less likely to purchase a used car, which could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability.", "id": "10g8ux9", "created_utc": 1674152250.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Carvana is a high-growth company with a high valuation and high debt levels.

Additionally , other online competitors such as Beepi have already gone out of business while others like Vroom seem content playing second fiddle thus far 5) While an economic downturn would obviously hurt car sales industry wide ; it seems unlikely that used cars would take quite as hard of hit given that they're generally seen as being more affordable than new vehicles", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Carvana was always a scam, Just look at the originator of the company.

I fully expected that but I really did not fully expect us to open at 389 like we did. I actually was pretty surprised to see that red of a move after hours/ pre market and open red like that.

IF we close over those levels I am very bullish and I fully expect a push over 400 before 380s again.

I look forward to tomorrows close for more information on where we might be going next. \n\nThe most interesting thing about today is that we found a very nice bottom at 387/388 area and made a ton of progress all day long and we suffered one of the bigger power hour sells off on seemingly no news I have seen in a long time. A total $2.4 sell off on a day we only moved a total of $3.82 is quite impressive and frankly seems unwarranted. \n\nI am watching closely for this doji candle to turn into a beautiful morning doji star pattern that breaks us back to the mid 390s tomorrow. \n\nSupport- 387.8 -> 386.3 -> 384.4\n\nResistance- 389.4 -> 390.1 -> 391.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tk4yrqkl2da1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=380d9758e823668c2c8940eb0bc38b9e56e5563f\n\nFutures here I am watching closely this 3920 level at close here… that is my big pivot area here on futures. \n\nWe are seeing closer to a hanging man reversal candle here on futures then we are seeing a doji. When we were trading closer to 3930-3935 it was far more clear and convincing of a reversal to the upside tomorrow. However, this pattern very well could turn out to be bearish. With a rejection and closure under the daily 8ema and closing under the daily 20ema that is bearish. However, we need to see what tomorrow does and more importantly where this weekly candle for spy and futures closes. \n\nKey support- 3895 -> 3872\n\nKey resistance- 3920 -> 3945 -> 3965\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ag6ejj8ll2da1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe8ef6efd931662f392a935bd1289461d27b8927\n\nTesla is one that I am not quite sure how I feel yet. There is a really nice rising wedge formed here. However, after that huge break out to 136 its found support here at the daily 8ema. Realistically until we break through that daily 8ema I struggle to be bearish anymore. When I played puts before and was bearish it was when we were looking to reject daily 20ema and cross back under the daily 8ema and inevitably touch 123 again. However, Tesla is attempting to find support here to continue this move up. \n\nWe are going to have two key levels at 128.9 (daily 20ema) and 125.6 (daily 8ema) tomorrow. Rising wedge support is at 126.5 tomorrow. Three key levels to watch tomorrow. \n\nSupport- 126.5 -> 125.6 -> 122.5\n\nResistance- 128.8 -> 131.5 -> 136.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkijx3yml2da1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=30746651c449163723d427f44ce635858e9f80df\n\none of the biggest thing that is keeping me bullish here is the VIX. As you can see we have a really nice falling wedge that’s been forming over the last 3 months. \n\nWe had a convincing push and breakout here on the VIX over the daily 8 and 20ema, however, we had a massive rejection off that blue trend line and closed with a beautiful evening start doji. With spy showing a morning star doji and VIX showing evening star doji that is not two patterns together I would like to bet against. While macro we could still be bearish I am short term bullish for now.   \n   \n \n\nIf we close under 390.1 tomorrow and close over the daily 20ema of the VIX that might change my mind though. But I think we are going to see some bears very surprised with a push back over 390.1 if not higher tomorrow. \n\nWe do have a ton of earnings next week:  \n Tuesday: MSFT, TXN  \n Wednesday : Tesla, IBM  \n Thursday: INTC, V  \n \n\nThis is the first wave of earnings before the next big wave the first week of February. There is a case to be built of a final run up next week or even the next two weeks. Netflix very well could be setting the tone here. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nToday was yet again another great day of trading with no complaints! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jqzgupinl2da1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=80cb9ed5d4e46cf5e539ef163ad621d59ecf1ae7\n\nThis week if I don’t take a scalp tomorrow will be the first week I have not taken a single scalp since last spring. I primarily was a level to level trader (though didn’t call it that back then…. Called it momentum trader) and with the nature of this 2022 bear market I wasn’t able to capitalize on that how I liked to… with this new trend and new market I am finding that I am able to return to longer dte and longer holds. This has been so much nicer than the scalps that I was forced to trade in order to keep my head above water. \n\nWhile I truly enjoy scalps as I have said since really October the risk to reward of scalps has steadily decreased more and more every day. I really enjoy these longer dte plays and I am lately enjoying some even longer 14-30dte macro plays too.", "id": "10ge9od", "created_utc": 1674164704.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4063|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10bc8s6/are_the_bulls_or_bears_in_control_11323_spy_es/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/109jd7z/cpi_prediction_and_analysis_11123_spy_and_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zhbkpu/12922_spy_weekly_market_analysis_and_recap_plus/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/107r60k/the_fake_breakout_1923_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zazoex/is_the_bottom_in_or_is_the_next_top_in_12222_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I am enjoying the longer dte plays more than ever.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I got trapped on $391 calls for tomorrow was trying to scalp and we instead sold off the end of day which was weird.
