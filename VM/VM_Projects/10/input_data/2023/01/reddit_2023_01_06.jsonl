Sure, it was not exactly an over the top dovish speech, but one that definitely was not overly pessimistic and had moments of optimism.  \n\nMy take, something could be breaking in the financial system because of the severe pessimism people have in the upcoming economy, and those fears are compounding an already existing issue with the swift interest rate hikes. Think an old style run on the banks but in a modern form.  Was Bullard sent out to send a calming message?  If so, will it hold, or will the underlying problem continue to get worse regardless? Either way, I don't see this as a bullish sign, and that is what the market realized too when it sold off after its initial pump.  \n\nSomething wicked this way comes..................\n\nEdit: TLDR; The Fed, using Bullard, is trying to buy time because they need tight financial markets to ease inflation but not so tight that something seriously breaks causing a systemic collapse.
