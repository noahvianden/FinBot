After the initial $1k minimum deposit there is no minimum balance, $4.95 commission for trades which doesn't seem too bad, and the ability to open CDs,buy  bonds/other investment products, so it seems like a pretty useful platform.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's your experience with Schwab? Do they have good customer service? How's their online/app UI? Is there another platform that you would recommend over Schwab for someone looking to do relatively small scale but pretty diverse investing? \n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n", "id": "6nkron", "created_utc": 1500184912.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "I've had various Schwab accounts -- retirement and  regular -- since about 1985.
