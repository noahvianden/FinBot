Im looking to long some amazon call spreads into earnings.  Prime day should benefit the stick as well.  Im looking at the 985/1015 july 21 call spread for 8 dollars.  Im hoping to catch an early morning gap fill then bounce so my trade will execute.\n\nAlso looking at biotech, this time i would buy some time and go out to aug 18 with a 325/345 call spread for 3 dollars.  Biotech had broken out of a multiyear sideways consolidation with a target of 360.  Its been consolidating recent gains around the 310-315 level and im looking for a move higher to at least 330 in the next month and a half.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThoughts on these potential trades?\n", "id": "6md0vq", "created_utc": 1499672645.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Just some humble thoughts.

I personally don't like how the 'healthcare reform' is turning out and if you know better than I, then go for it. But Idk whats positive or negative for IBB. A lot of shakeup between now and Aug.

Also considering WDFC July 21 puts overnight 7/10 for a casino earnings play. History of losses + retail sector (car parts etc) all down big. Its chump change so OTM puts. \n\n3. I think AAP continues to fade (the amazon effect) and I think banks (JPM, C, PNC) do well this week. So I might get August calls in FAS\n\n4. Oh I like Delta also, flew them a couple months ago.
