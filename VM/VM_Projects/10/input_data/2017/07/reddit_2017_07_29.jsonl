It's a pretty sweet deal. I'd even buy one if I had the cash. But once you factor into the conditions it was made under, there could be some defects hidden by the gorgeous wood paneling. \n\nSo, how long would it be before these defects come to light? What will Elon Musk do to distract us? What other cards can he play? \n\nI don't own any shares in TSLA, just speculating.
