However there are options on currency futures.\n\nSo the most sensible solution is, if you buy $1000 of HPQ, then short $1000 in USD.  If USD drops in value against euro, the value of HPQ in USD goes down, but your short goes up equal value.

Then when you sell the stock, you'll have a balance of that foreign currency that you can sell, and in that case you would lose money on the currency.\n\nBuying USD before hand *would* counter this, but at a **loss** because owning 1000 USD which was worth 900€ is now 800€, that's 100€ loss.
