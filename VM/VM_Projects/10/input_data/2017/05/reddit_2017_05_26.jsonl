{"title": "Buying Stocks on Margin - What happens when shit goes crazy?", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm pretty much into FX Trading and figured out that my strategy works out for some stocks as well.\nNow I'd like to \"Trade\" these stocks in the weekly chart (to minimize gapping risk).\n\nRegarding that I got one question:\n\nWhat happens if I buy a stock long on margin (so that I risk 1% of my capital for lets say a stock movement of 2$, at the stock price of 100$) and the company goes bankcrupt?\nIf a company goes bankcrupt, will the price drop by the nature of the markets to zero (without any time involved) or will it crash just like for instance gold sometimes?\nWhat I mean with this is: Would my stop get triggered with some slippage maybe but would still work out? Or would I need to pay the broker all the money I basically borrowed from the broker through the leverage/margin?\n\nThank you ", "id": "6dfyhb", "created_utc": 1495791781.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Depends on the type of order you put in.  There are too many HFT out there that will sell faster than you can read the first letter of the newwire about said company going bankrupt.  No it will most likely not go to 0 but it will go down a lot to what people think the scrap value would be (also depends on what type of BK they file).  And If you set a stop loss.  If it drops below that it will trigger a sell.  So let us say you have a $100 dollar stock with a 10% stop loss and it drops 70% in an instant you will sell at that 70% loss so you might count that as slippage of $60.  But if you use a stop loss limit of $10 at a limit price of $85.  you would not sell if it jumped to 30 bucks.  you would just have an open order to sell your shares at $85.

Standard margin is 2x your equity. If you have a PDT account (US only, >$25k), the intraday standard is 4:1 but you still can usually only hold 2x overnight. For larger accounts and well known clients with good relationships it's possible to negotiate more margin. However, the point is that while yes it's possible for what you're describing to happen, it's unlikely it would be so severe due to the fact that a broker will not let you take on too much margin. Most likely, the most you would ever owe is 2x your equity (for a long). If you're shorting on margin the risk is much higher since crazy shit like DRYS, KBIO, AQXP etc can happen.  \n\nAs far as what usually happens when a company goes bust, in my experience there is usually a number of signs beforehand. I've never seen a company that was previously thought to be healthy randomly announce \"whoops! Forgot to mention were bankrupt, sorry guys!\" ... However that said even a PR that a company is considering bankruptcy protection is enough to turn a company into a penny stock within seconds. Usually it won't just faceplant to $0...it will drop to some value the market thinks it's worth in bankruptcy (e.g. value of assets for common shareholders + cash or whatever).
