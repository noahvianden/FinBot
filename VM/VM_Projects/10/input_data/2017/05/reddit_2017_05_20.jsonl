If you're not in marketing, sales, customer support, or IT then you will probably never interact with Salesforce directly.\n\nThey do not provide services to try and help retailers survive. They provide a comprehensive customer relationship management (CRM) platform that's cloud-based, meaning there are purportedly lower costs to stand up their service for your firm.\n\nMy company uses Salesforce extensively. We use it to communicate with customers, manage orders, manage contracts, and tons of other stuff. It's not our entire workhorse per se; we have other, in-house tools for things like rate prices and waybills and whatnot. But Salesforce brings it all together for the customer. We're probably only using a portion of its potential because of that; other firms may utilize it even more.\n\nThey've also got this new cognitive AI thing called Einstein. I'm not entirely certain what it does, but if it's actually decent, it'll be huge. Companies don't like having to pay a ton of people money to sit around and respond to really simple inquiries all day. It's cheaper to have a bot that can handle the 80% of simple inquiries and just have a smaller staff that handles the 20% of inquiries that actually require human thinking.\n\nHave you ever heard of or used SAP? It's the dominant ERP (enterprise resource planning) tool in most large firms. Its main strengths are in HR, finance and accounting, material management, and plant (maintenance) management. Its CRM module sucks ass, which is why my firm switched to Salesforce.\n\nNow with all that being said... I don't know jack about their financials. It could be run about as well as Enron for all I know. But their product is solid, and as they get more and more companies balls-deep in their ecosystem, they get a larger and larger moat. IT projects to switch to another system are expensive, lengthy, and a pain in the ass.\n\nAlso, $SAP has a market cap of 124B. They've been around for decades and have their tentacles in everything. I reckon 60B isn't too bad for $CRM.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "you're right I don't know much about the field, I'm currently studying medicine so thats about as far removed as possible from anything you mention. Like I said I get it, you guys convinced me, right now salesforce is good at what it does. I just don't know how valuable it will be in 5 years. With all the research going into tech, AI and whatnot is it so hard to believe someone else could surpass them in capabilities and offer it for cheaper soon?

Hope I didn't come off as brusque. \n\nI haven't worked with the tool myself so I don't know how easy it is to set up or use. If they can keep that up, i think they'll be golden. SAP's big fault is that it's very expensive to implement and it's not user friendly. \n\nWithout having read their docs, I'd assume that they're losing money because they're in a rapid expansion phase to get as many big firms on their platform as possible. Once you're hooked into an ecosystem it is very hard to move away from it. That'd be a sustainable moat for a while, though they'd have to continue delivering a good experience lest, as you say, a more nimble competitor starts nibbling away at their market share in a decade. Someone could provide better AI tools but not necessarily affect them; their bread and butter is still the CRM platform and not necessarily the cognitive analytics, that's just the cherry on top.
