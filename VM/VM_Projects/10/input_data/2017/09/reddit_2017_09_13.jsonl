{"title": "Gold and weed is all you need!", "selftext": "Had to post this article since it starts with Chicago's pensions crisis and ends in gold and weed... it's a rant but stick with me especially you Mom and Dad!\ntldr; buy gold (FGADX if you have Fidelity 401k) and weed stocks (APHQF, KSHB, MDCL, ITHUF, EMMBF, GRWG, NXTTF are some to look at)\nThe article insinuates, and I agree, that the Fed will print money to bridge the serious municipal pension gaps across the country = inflation. Today they sell bonds to banks and investors via the FOMC adding to the national debt (20Trill). Eventually the FED will begin to buy a larger and larger share of this US debt, and (one day) conveniently eat it. Currently the FED owns about 10% of US debt ('member QE1,2,3,&4? oh I 'member!), while in a country like Japan the BOJ owns 40% and the ECB is floating near 20%. While this would be unthinkable just 10 years ago, many countries are now facing a serious proposition of \"disappearing\" that debt causing massive inflation, and mild financial chaos. Chaos because printing paper necessitates the FED raising interest rates, thus weighing on both equities and bonds at once, go figure. If I haven't bored you to death yet...\nWith the dollar falling your best friend is gold (or Ethereum pick your poison). Since gold was de-pegged by Nixon in 1971 ($44/oz) it is up over 3000% (~$1350/oz). What this means is that our USD has been depreciating against gold and other world currencies by a staggering amount over the last 50 years. For reference the Dow was only up ~3300% over the last 50 years (not counting dividend reinvestment blah blah). The dollar is falling off a cliff this year and can't catch a ledge. Unless Trump magically becomes not Trump, this is probably going to continue. Keep in mind a Pence presidency could seriously derail this entire gold/weed narrative (wildcard baby).\nSo if gold is the answer in the long term where does weed come in? States need money, like A LOT of money. Even if Illinois doubles its tax rates it will still not fund its pensions anytime soon. Entrar la Ganja. 63 million Americans will be living in recreationally legal states starting Jan 1st 2018. Colorado has 5.5 mil residents, but is set to collect an incredible 250 mil in weed taxes and fees in 2017. That is $45 for every student, teacher, policeman & firewoman, everybody! Will it solve the crisis...? No! (Buy gold remember?) Will it soon be legal and taxed across the 50 states... like duh. I'd like to see Sessions try telling California that they need to forfeit a couple billion they just found hiding in their state budget next to the stale Cheetos and missing remote.
