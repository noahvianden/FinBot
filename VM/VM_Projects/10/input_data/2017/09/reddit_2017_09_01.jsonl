{"title": "POLL: How much is your portfolio up so far this year?", "selftext": "I'll start. I started investing on RH in mid-December and since then I'm only up 1.29% :/. Lost almost 12% of my portfolio gambling on a penny stock (never doing that again), but I've recovered the last 3 months with a 11.1% gain. I'm hoping to have a similar sort of gain from now until EOY so I can beat the market. (How much is it up this year by the way, I couldn't find a number?).\n\nI've held a number of stocks during my short time. My biggest gainer is WYNN (Wynn Resorts - up 42.48%) followed by MRCY (Mercury Systems - up 39.15%). I also swing trade AMD and after running some numbers, the profits have increased my portfolio by 4.02%.\nMy current largest positions are CRUS and AMD. I owned a pretty decent amount of SHOP but I sold today and will definitely buy back on the dip. I also have a smaller position in GPRO which I am long on along with WYNN, MRCY, and CRUS.\n\nNow lets talk about the negatives... I'm down about 25% on UAA and 18% on UA since I bought in. I love the brand and saw and continue to see it everywhere at the time I invested. They also endorse some of the biggest stars in sports and have a huge untapped international market. I'm long on them as well even though they have a baboon running the company. And finally, the dumbest investment I've ever made - I'd actually call it a failed gamble - is ALT (which was a merger that involved the penny stock I owned: PIP). I don't really want to talk about it, just look at the chart.\n\nLooking forward to hearing how everyone is doing!", "id": "6xb5p0", "created_utc": 1504227061.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Youâ€™re a clown.
