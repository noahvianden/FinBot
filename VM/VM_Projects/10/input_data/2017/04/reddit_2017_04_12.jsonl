{"title": "NASDAQ NFLX: Q1 Earnings DD", "selftext": "#Background\nNetflix is a house hold video streaming service that provides both 3rd party and in house content. Its current competitors are Hulu, Amazon prime video, and other streaming services attempted by cable companies and network stations. Currently, it is revered as the leader of the video streaming market.\n\nNetflix itself is a huge growth potential stock. This is shown by its extremely high PE ratio of 337.8. However, it is recently that we are seeing its rise in revenue at a fast degree. For the quarter of Q1 2017, the street's expectations is 0.37 cents per share.\n\nFor Netflix, its PE ratio is meaningless as it is a hyper growth potential stock. To make sense of its performance and to estimate its future performance, we must look at its earnings, its subscribers, and its revenue.\n\nFor its EPS, it has beat its expectations for the past 5 quarters. Looking into the past 12 quarters, it has beat 8 times, lagged 3 times, and met once.\n\nIts revenue has been on a constant parabolic increase, with early on starting at 5 to 6% quarter over quarter with now being 7% to 8% quarter over quarter. This implies the 2nd order increase is about 15m quarter over quarter. In the past 12 quarters with respect to the street expectations, it beat 2 times, matched 4 times, lagged 4 times, and 2 times it is unknown.\n\nThe biggest thing to look at for Netflix is the amount of subscribers. At the end of Q4 2016, there were 93.8m subscribers. Netflix's projection for subscribers at the end of Q1 2017 is 99m however, it usually underestimate its own numbers. In a possible case, Netflix can announce that it has 100m subscribers which should be a huge catalyst for its growth potential at earnings. Looking deeper into its subscriber growth, what we see is that it reports again a polynomial growth with about 5 to 8% quarter over quarter. The 2nd order increase is about 300k subscribers quarter over quarter\n\nLooking at how the market reacted in its past quarters, it was positive for Q4, Q3 2016, Q2, Q1 2015, Q4 2014 and negative for rest of the quarters. This implies a rise 5 times and fall 7 times. During the time it rose, they all had EPS beat except for one which was Q1 2015. The rise for that was due to stronger than expected subscriber growth which cause the stock to still go up afterwards.\n\nFor the time that they dropped, most were still EPS beat but a revenue miss.\n\nUp to now, it has exceeded the price target of 7 analysts which is still a small portion. The analysts it has exceeded have a rating of hold or below. The price targets that has yet to reach have ratings of hold and above with more in overweight and buy.\n\n#Opinion\nNetflix is definitely a great performer and with the look of its current trajectory, a beat is very possible. However, it is going to be stressed by the raising expectations of the street as it looks like it wants to have an explosive growth.\n\nLooking at the EPS numbers, nothing looks like it is seasonal so the street is definitely stressing a higher expectation on Netflix to perform well, which it can with the outlook of the company.\n\nThe definite catalyst for Netflix has definitely been making it available globally in different markets. It is currently available in over 190 countries. The only major market it is not in is China but that is expected with respect to their stance on foreign internet services. If however Netflix is able to tap into China, it would mean an extremely high growth potential that is never been seen before.\n\nOther competitor to Netflix would be Hulu, which is only available in just 2 countries (US and Japan) and Amazon Prime Video which is also available everywhere where Netflix is. However, Amazon Prime Video still lacks the content to rival Netflix. Other competitions would be local cable and network companies.\n\nLooking at it from all these dimensions, it is clear that Netflix is a clear cut leader in the video streaming with no competition to challenge it in the foreseeable future. Amazon might be a respected competition but it is not something that is yet a huge danger to the market Netflix is in.\n\nFor the next earnings, there is a high possibility that Netflix will beat. The question however is whether its stock prices will also go up with the earnings beat. From the looks of analyst price target, there is still a lot of room to grow. Also looking at its current stock value with respect to the previous quarter, it has yet to gain much, just a mere 0.5%. From Q3 to Q4 quarter, the growth was 11.5% prior to the Q4 earnings.\n\nThe lack of growth this quarter in its stock value can be attributed to the slowing down of the entire market as NASDAQ itself is experience struggles to grow.\n\nFor its numbers of subscribers, it is possible Netflix will hit 100m subscribers. This is using data extrapolation with respect to its past performance. Q3 to Q4 and Q4 to Q1 have usually seen a higher subscriber growth. If this trend continues, it is no doubt Netflix can hit this milestone number.\n\nLooking at the options open interest also, there's a high amount open for April 21st $145 calls at 12.4k. The open interest for options around that are also in the thousands while the puts are also matching to that. April 21st $145 puts are at 8.8k which means there is a good amount of people playing a straddle on this. Interestingly enough, there is also a high open interest for puts at $140 April 21st at 11.8k and 8.07k open interest at April 21st $150 calls.\n\nLooking at the week after, there's a huge amount of open interest at puts at the price point of $145 and $140 with about 2k at each of those price points. There are not much open interest for calls.\n\nThe open interest data really does not looks like the traders are strong on whether it will beat or lag. It is possible a lot of people are just playing straddle or strangles because there will be a huge price movement.\n\n#The Play\nIt looks like it's a pretty good time to get into Netflix right about now. The estimation for it to beat earnings with the growth potential can shoot it as high as 10% which is not uncommon. If it hits its 100m member milestone, 10% might actually be a conservative estimate. However, a true conservative estimate for it to beat would be at least 5% jump in price after earnings. This would imply the stock price would be $152.\n\nThe downside, if Netflix would not perform favourably, and there is a likelihood of it happening, it can drop as much as 8% to maybe 12% as shown in previous quarters.\n\nA potentially overvalued and dangerous price mark for Netflix prior to earnings would be $150 as it would 5 more analyst price targets and might become considered as overvalued. If somehow it reaches a price of $155 $160, it would be a definite overvalued and would suggest betting against the company as a positive earnings might still cause it to go down.\n\nIn conclusion, Netflix is a rewarding stock that does come with its risks. The street now have higher expectations as its potential has turned into actual growth. It is at a point for this company to prove itself, which I have a feeling it will, that it can grow and its evaluation now is appropriate.\n\n#Summary\n\t• Netflix is showing good growth and higher expectations from the street\n\t• They are near its 100m subscriber milestone which they are likely to hit\n\t• With respect to analyst, they have yet to hit many of the bullish price targets\n\t• Q4 to Q1 stock prices did not move much, signaling good amount of room to grow after earnings\n\t• Netflix have a very good chance of beating earnings from historical record and its current trajectory\n\t• Netflix however can tumble due to the higher expectations from the street\n\t• Price movement at earnings is huge, most option players probably have straddle/strangles rather than a single sided bet\n\t• Can potentially go up 5% to 10% or more depending on performance reported at earnings, but can also get thrashed and go down 10% if it does not meet the expectations of the street\n\t• Current price point is good value to play for earnings, if Netflix goes to $150 before earnings, then it becomes risky. $155+ would be overvalued\n\n#My Positions\nI have interest in purchasing $5000 worth (approx 40% of my portfolio) of Netflix shares when IB clears my funds.
