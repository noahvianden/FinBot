The time value of the option is in the highest decay rate timeframe. Absent commissions, you're looking at a 20% chance that you make at least $0.01, but that also means you have a 80% chance of a 100% loss. I'm not loving the odds, personally.

The commissions really kill it for any small trades for me.

I don't need the cash and I feel that Apple is a safe investment with good returns. Their financials are strong and I expect some great things out of them for the iPhone 10th anniversary. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, my best suggestion is, don't sweat the intermediate ups and downs. I mean, options are about trading volatility and price action. It's, by its nature, short-term. Options can be, but are not often, about long-term investing. They're about trading.\n\nTo counterpoint myself, options can be used hedge/protect a long-term portfolio. They can be used to enhance return in portfolio overwriting.\n\nHere's the thing, if you're holding for 5-years the only thing you need to be concerned about is whether this is a good entry point or not. You should be more concerned about earnings returns and fundamental factors, demographics, costs of capital, etc. These things are of really no importance in short term trading.\n\nI would advise, choose whether you're an investor or a trader. From the sounds of it, you want to be an investor but you're thinking like an emotional trader. Being an emotional trader is a great way to set yourself up to fail at every turn. You'll get scared out at a $3 loss for no apparent reason. The stock will shoot to $150 and you'll think, \"Dang, I missed it.\" and you'll wait for it to come back down so you can get it. It might come back down, you'll be afraid it won't stop falling and won't get back in. It might shoot up to $160, and you'll think \"Dang! I missed it again. I should have just bought at $150! Why did I ever sell at $140 again?!?\"\n\nBe realistic when you're investing. You might just be buying a perpetual dividend. You might be getting whatever the rate of return is on the dividend--Maybe 1.5% (guessing because I'm being lazy and don't feel like looking it up)? So, that's what you're getting. You get 1.5% yield on your capital and in 5-years you'll have 7.5% +/- dividend increases/decreases and +/- capital return. If you're going to invest, just ignore the price action. It really doesn't matter.\n\nIf you're going to be a trader, then pay attention to the price action. That's about the only thing that matters. You don't care that the dividend is going to be 2.0% in 5-years. You care that the $140 stock is going to be $135 or $145 in 2-months (or maybe $140.15 or $139.85 in 10-minutes).\n\nI hope I'm not preaching too much but whether you're an investor or a trader you'll find your worst enemy is your emotions. You are better than a computer at choosing good stocks. But, the computer wins in most cases because your edge is oftentimes ruined by the fact that you have emotions while the computer is emotionless. That's why you need a plan and you need to stick to the plan.\n\nOh, last point, you can possibly do a poor man's covered call by buying a long dated option and selling shorter-dated options OTM against it and reduce your cost basis. However, I'm thinking you may not have the capital or experience trading options to qualify for spread trading. It's a thought, anyway.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This was beautiful.
