{"title": "JCPenney stock... Is it time to admit defeat and sell?", "selftext": "Hi, guys, new investor here.  I made some good profit (>10%) with Amazon and Apple this week (beginner's luck) but I have a small holding on JCPenney, I thought they will come up a bit during the holiday season, I bought them at around $3.58/share, but after the earning call they are now -36% or something.  Is it time for me to let them go and move on?  I did not invest much so the loss is about 20% of what I earn so far.\n\nOr should I hold onto them?", "id": "7avzvk", "created_utc": 1509861629.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Donâ€™t hold a stock of a store you would never shop in", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "this is a great rule of thumb in general", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Get rid of it.. the company is suffocating and they have been for a long time now.

When the stock is $2 and change, the company is going to start to run out of road; there's not endless opportunities to correct and change if things don't work. \n\nJCP is racing to figure things out and it's one of a number of retail chains that didn't adapt and evolve when they should have. The whole industry basically stuck its head in the sand for many years about Amazon and said things like, \"People won't buy clothes online!\"\n\nAs for JCP, I think it's maybe an example of something I see a fair amount of on this board and that is don't buy something simply because it's down a lot. Buying JCP down something like 60% in the last year and under $5, you have to have some sort of thesis that they have the ability to turn things around. Honestly, I think when you get to $2 and change in something like this, $0 can happen out of sheer momentum as the concern feeds on itself and the decline just snowballs. 42% of the float is short.\n\nSo I don't know, maybe something good happens here and someone comes in or there's some good news, but after the Nordstrom deal didn't go through, there seems to be a little less possibility of taking retail chains private. If nothing can come together fairly soon, the possibility of this going to zero is more than minor.\n\nDo I know what this does short-term? No; with 42% of the float short this will take off if there's any considerable good news. That said, if there isn't any good news, there is a chance that this is zero before Christmas 2018 (and Sears is an eventual zero, too.) Even if there is good news that bounces this short-term, I still think this could still be an eventual zero either way. We're really heading towards a world of less competition in the long-term, with Amazon/Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, Best Buy, HD/Lowes and everyone else. Bed, Bath and Beyond probably won't last, either. Gamestop gone. JCP probably gone long-term, Sears gone. Market share that someone else will pick up.\n\n\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I would suggest selling, never a bad idea to divorce yourself from a bad trade earlier than later.
