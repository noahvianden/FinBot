People might use HV to gauge their views moving forward, but IV is completely a function of the demand for options. If there is a bias toward buying options (because the low IV makes it look like a good deal), it goes up. If there’s a bias for selling (because IV is seen as high), it goes down. If the market feels the IV is about right, then buyers and sellers tend to even out (which is what market makers strive for to keep their books tight).\n\nI’ve assumed vol was so low in SPY because nobody has been afraid of a correction. As a result, nobody has wanted to buy puts and everyone has been willing to sell them. I also assume that people aren’t rushing out to buy OTM calls when the market is already at ATHs, but plenty are willing to sell calls to hedge.\n\nThe SPX put skew always trades elevated relative to the call skew (although 4-6% is a lot). I believe this is because people buy puts because there’s no way to short SPX directly. On the other hand, you can short SPY, so its skews tend to stay together more.

In other words, since buying calls seems like easy money, why isn’t the IV rising to reflect it? My belief is that call sellers continue to outnumber call buyers, which has kept IV low.\n\nThere is also the possibility that these call sellers misconstrue the low volatility for meaning “low movement”, which isn’t necessarily true at all.

Pretty ugly day in the momentum bellwethers.\n\nThere was a fake-out nudge to the upside Tuesday, but can’t say today’s slam down was unexpected. Posted this on my blog two days ago:\n\n *\"This could be tricky since long-term breadth continues to climb (up for the fourth day). Given that, if short-term breadth turns up here in the next day or two (or bless a bottom dollar, three days), the market would get another bullish boost. If long-term breadth turns down, this could very easily become the hook that catches every bull off guard. Although the bull market has so far defied the signs over and over again, it is inevitable that one of these times, like today, when the signals signal a turn, the turn will come. Probably when the bears are worn out and the bulls don’t expect anything of on their blindside.\"*\n\nIf today’s sell off continues, that will be relevant, but there are signs this is done already.\n\nNearly every time TQQQ falls through a one or two standard deviation lines (see the chart in the link below on Screencast), the Nasdaq bounces the next day or two days out. It is as if any fall this far is too far too fast. And oftentimes in this bull market, the bounce becomes another rally. In fact, a look-black on the chart shows this last great upswing in the Nasdaq, which began in late September, started with a touch down on the green lines just like today.\n\nSo I’m looking for the bounce, and looking to ride a rally if it develops here (Santa time?), and if it doesn’t then the suggestion in the quote above might indeed be a sea change in the market.\n\n**[THE CHART IS ON SCREENCAST](https://content.screencast.com/users/diogenes227/folders/Jing/media/d3a374d5-ef99-4598-ad8a-99de5caae449/2017-11-29_1913.png).**", "id": "7gj9n4", "created_utc": 1512011803.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "I hate when people put points instead of %", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Or points instead of dollars — AMZN definitely isn’t down 32%", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I was going to say there are plenty of % in the link but they've asked me not to link here.
