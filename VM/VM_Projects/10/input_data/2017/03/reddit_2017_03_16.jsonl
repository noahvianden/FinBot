I wouldn't even remotely worry about this until the S&P drops by more than 2.5%, which hasn't happened since December. *IF* that happens, then there are different ways to hedge depending on what's available to you and the size of your portfolio. A common way for actual traders with large accounts to hedge is to stack and roll VIX futures.\n\nSince that's obviously not an option for most people here, you can sort of do the same thing with VIX options although it's a little more complicated, because VIX options settle according to VIX futures but you can't trade them continuously (as with VIX futures). Among other details that I don't understand...\n\nAnother strategy is to sell deep OTM call spreads. Using this strategy, you can offset some of the premium you'd be paying. You can easily achieve 100:1 leverage this way. For instance, if you sold 100 of the 230/235 SPY call spreads for March 31 (thinking there'd be a crash in the next 2 weeks), the most you'd lose is $500 (and let's be honest, in this market, it's a guaranteed loss).

When the stock falls to $50 you buy it back and now you have $50 you can allocate back to your long position that is also down in this hypothetical market crash. \n\nSo... Let's say $1000 starting capital. You buy $800 of SPY. You short AMD (as it's in the S&P on Monday) for a position of $200.\n\nAMD has a beta of 3. If the market drops 25% we can roughly expect AMD to drop 75%.  In this situation SPY position is now worth $600 but the AMD position is worth $350. When you close out the AMD position you net $150 cash. Now you have $600 of SPY and $150 of cash with the market down 25%. You can now increase your long position to $750 and ride the wave up. \n\nIf you invested $1000 long you'd be at $750 with a 25% drop but the same share count.

So, if SPY fell by 15% and assuming that you are long $800 of SPY (beta value of 1) and short $200 of AMD (beta value of 3, then your SPY position would be worth $680 while your AMD position would be ((1+(3*0.15))($200)=$290. So your position would be worth $970. \n\nI'm still a bit unsure about why you would want to put on a bullish trade this way. Can't you reduce your net exposure and get more leverage by structuring the same trade with SPY options. For example, you could buy an ITM long dated call option on SPY with a delta of 0.8 and hedge the delta by shorting a certain number of SPY shares. \n\n>You don't buy options because the premium is difficult to overcome.\n\nYou could also buy a Jan 2018 call and sell a further OTM Jan 2019 call to offset the cost of premium.
