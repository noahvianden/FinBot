If you aren't aware what it is, then google it because every company does it and every company has sections of their DRM that don't feel so good. Evidently for Apple, part of their DRM happens to interfere with dumbasses who leave their laptop at home on holiday. For Microsoft or the makers other other competing products, their DRM might pinch you elsewhere. Either way, everyone uses DRM and if you don't play ball by following their processes for getting by DRM then you're in for a bad time.\n\nTwo, you're how many thousands of miles away from home and you want to watch a copy of a movie that you own and don't have with you, on a device that you don't own and you're mad that it isn't quite as easy as you'd like? Are you shitting me? Ten years ago that wouldn't be imagined and you're pissed because it isn't quite as easy as you'd like?\n\nEdit: I don't own shares and I think the company is in the shitter without Jobs. Their latest offering of laptops and computers is a fucking joke and an insult to the professionals that made Apple what it is today.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with you and dumbassery is certainly in my repertoire.Beyond tonight's problem I have been thinking of how AAPL used to drive the market and everyone else was chasing their tech and ideas...Now they are the same shit in a different package. Not faster, smarter, or more fun anymore. AAPL products used to be a sort of status symbol...Now people buy iPhone because their Samsung lit on fire...Not because of greater intrinsic or extrinsic value. I won't buy Tesla now but they are the type of market driver/changer I wish AAPL would be again so I could buy their stuff and feel like it was special and different...Not just a hassle that I want to avoid.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My apologies.

There will probably be some frustration short term but in 4-5 years things should catch up and Apple will be fine. For example, the iPhone 6 was great, the 6s was a great improvement, but the 7 (which I own) is awful in my opinion. Zero innovation or noticeable performance difference.

I'm pissed and am over reacting for sure. But I do my homework and buy products from the companies I invest in.
