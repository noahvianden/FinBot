Only for what you need to consider.)\n\nMost of this thread is rubbish.\n\nYou claim you're a long term investor who's bullish on the company (correct me if wrong). If that's the case, you have two things to think about: 1) if you expect your tax bracket this year to be different from your tax bracket next year, or you anticipate liquidity problems and you have to sell, look up what the \"Wash Sale Rule\" is (your friend is recommending tax-loss harvesting, which requires no trades of TSLA within 30 days before or after your sale... but you only care about that if you're retiring or making no money in the near future from anything, or don't want to pay taxes on money you technically haven't earned yet). 2) Also look up what Long-Term Capital Gains are (they're taxed more favorably).\n\nHere's your homework:\n\n* You think that in a year, TSLA will be at $____ in the best-case scenario (company does well, market-at-large does whatever you expect it to do). You think this has a __% chance of happening.\n* You think that in a year, TSLA will be at $____ in a middle-case scenario (company is doing okay, or does well and people don't believe it yet, etc., and market-at-large does whatever you expect it to do). You think this has a __% chance of happening.\n* You think that in a year, TSLA will be at $____ in a worst-case scenario (company does poorly, people short it more, market-at-large does whatever you expect it to do). You think this has a __% chance of happening.\n\nThe sum of the percent chances must be 100%.\n\n(Now normally we'd compare the price points to whatever you think an index fund will do. But since we're of course effectively gambling, so we assume that's negligible.)\n\nNow given the three scenarios, does it make sense to hold your loser? It makes sense to hold your loser if it's not over your risk tolerance, AND if\n\n    $price1 %chance1 + $price2 %chance2 + $price3 %chance3 > $entryPriceOfLoser\n\n(I assume OP can multiply percentages so I won't elaborate.)\n\nIf it's not, sell your loser and other potential loser(s) if any. You HAVE to tell your broker, BEFORE selling, using whatever configuration or settings they have, whether your tax-lot matching is LIFO (sell most recently-bought), FIFO (the default, selling your first-bought shares), or custom tax-lot matching (sell whichever specific lot you want). Then set the tax-lot matching back to whatever you want after selling. The onus is on you to prove they received the instructions, technically, but the brokers records tax-lot matching to help you prove it.\n\nLong-term capital gains come in if you want to exit TSLA before 1 year has arrived from whenever you bought a specific lot. In that case, some of your holding might still be STCG. In that case, you will be at a tax-advantage if you sell the lots you bought and held over a year-and-a-day, which in this case may be the earliest lots you bought. If you want to exit before a year from now, selling earlier-bought lots will delay your exit if you want LTCG treatment. (Of course, taking an extra 10-20% in taxes may not be worth delaying an exit (or maybe it will go up even higher if you wait, who knows).)\n\nOf course if you traded TSLA in the meantime and didn't just have three transactions, things get a lot more complicated.\n\nAlso look up how LTCG and STCG and LTCL and STCL can cancel with each other and your regular income. And how they can carry over from year to year (it may take some time to use long-term losses up, for example).\n\n(This post should not be relied upon for tax or investment advice.

It's very possible that you sell for a loss and your shares take a down-spin and in a future emergency you're forced to take more losses.  \n\nYes you can offset some of your taxes with capital losses, but you do so at the risk that your stocks lose value.  Whereas you could sell in the profit, pay the applicable tax rate, and continue holding.  If you're confident Tesla has a long term value plan then you're losses could breakeven or become profitable within your holding period.  \n\nConsidering Tesla is one bad news article away from a downward correction it's a good idea to consider 3 important things\n\n1) What do you need the money for, and will you need more in the near future for the same short term reason? \n\n2) What is your effective tax rate and how much money are you liquidating? The taxes may not be too harsh on a smaller amount\n\n3) Is there a way for you to put some of the liquidated funds into a large asset, such as a home? In this case you could pull out some of your winners, place some of the money into your asset, and obtain your winners, cash, and use the tax write-off as an offset to your capital gain tax.  \n\nI'm short Tesla because I see major value builders 6-18 months down the road and the water is too choppy to assume the Tesla chart moves straight up for 6 months- particularly with so many bulls trying Day and night to point out why the shares are overvalued.  So i would personally suggest deciding \"how long\" you're going to hold for and if you have the stomach for a share price near $200 for a while until news of the model X at 35k for sure comes out and Tesla doesn't borrow from the public and there are no major hiccups with the GF- such as a spontaneously combust able batter or some nonsense.  I'd personally take your gains now if you plan on holding Tesla for another 2-5 years.  \n\nTesla in 2-5 years could very well trade near $600 if musks vision turns tangible.  The one thing Tesla has that other companies has is aesthetics.  They're at the forefront of energy technology and it looks good when you see it feels good when you touch it.  He's bitten off more than he can chew right now and most of the profits he calculated in are missing, which is why bears in the near term are pissed.  But it's a no brainer, if he can fully automate the most sophisticated energy products in the world then his costs over time will diminish to near 0 per product manufactured and the profit margin will be absurd.  Tesla will be as cash rich as Apple.  But in the near term that's literally a fantasy; currently the company financials look concerning and any attempt to raise more public capital will be met with the red hammer of hades.  If there an any issues with battery production that hampers total model X production, also brining in the red hammer.  Musk is walking on egg shells right now until he can show some actual consistent profit.
