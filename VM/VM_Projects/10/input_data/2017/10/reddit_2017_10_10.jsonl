{"title": "Selling Covered Calls - Whats the catch?", "selftext": "I understand you are limiting your upside but even so, it still looks to good to be true.\n\nLets pick a volatile stock like AMD.

They tend to reduce volatility versus the comparable long stock position as you might have 100 shares of stock = 100 delta and then a short call at 40 delta resulting in a net 60 delta position (or, at that moment, the equivalent of 60 shares of stock). Other Greeks will still have an impact on the position. If you're unlucky enough to sell in a low IV condition and IV spikes then the value of the option can expand to where your P/L looks pretty ugly.
