So this morning i want to buy $AMZN\n\nWith a leverage of x5 it allows me to buy 200$ of AMZN but it wont let me buy 100$ instead unless i set a x10 leverage \n\nThis doesnt make sense to me. If i set leverage x1 which in a sense should mean buying without leverage, i should be allowed to buy only units of stocks in a sense 1unit (worth around 1000) and the next possible buy be 2 units and so on. So why with x1 leverage am i allowd to invest 500$ in AMZN ?\n \nAnd btw, can you end up owing money, or lossing faster with levrage can only end up loding all your initial ammount only ?\n\nI hope my question is not that confusing, i m new in stocks an investing so i m still learning.

That means that my buying power is $2500, instead of only $500. Now, this involves a lot of risk if the stock drops in price. Another thing to note about leverage is that unlike leverage x1, you get charged fees for holding a position. \n\nWhen you are about to make a trade on etoro, you can see how much you are going to pay daily for holding, and how much are you going to pay on the weekend.\n\nI hope I was clear enough.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Wait, are we paying a daily fee for holding stocks?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Only if you use leverage x2 and above.

When you enter such a contract, the seller (eToro) is obligated to pay to the buyer (you – the investor) the difference between the current value of a stock and its value when you decide to terminate the contract, i.e. close the position. If the difference is negative (i.e. the value of the stock went down), the buyer is obligated to pay the difference to the seller.\n\nYou do not actually own any stock when buying a stock CFD.\n\nThe advantage of trading CFDs as opposed to actual stocks is that you are able to choose your investment amount, as opposed being limited by the constraint of the share price. For example: at the time of writing, the price of Apple stock stands at approximately $447, which is also the minimum amount of capital you would need to buy Apple stock. On the other hand, you can invest in an Apple stock CFD at eToro with just $50.\n\nPlease note: investing in CFDs carries inherent risk as the stock market is unpredictable and prices can fluctuate unexpectedly. You are advised to take the possibility of loss into consideration when making your investment decisions.\n\nThat means that you can invest $500 on Amazon, because etoro let's you \"buy\" 0.50 of an Amazon stock.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

Don't worry about it.\n\nI think they have some sort of protection system, in which they automatically close the trade if you go below of what you own.\n\nLet's say you buy 200 stocks for $10 using leverage x10. So you are using $200 from your own money and $1800 from etoro. If I am not mistaken they will automatically close the trade if you the stock goes to $9, because then your 200 stocks would be worth $1800 (what you own etoro), so you can't go below that because you owe them money. \n\nI believe they also take in account the fees you pay daily. For example, right now I have $1000 invested, but my account has a negative balance of $-1.11 (Fees I have payed so far). So, using that in your example, they would close your position when the stock is worth $9.005 to also cover the fees you own.\n\nI'm not 100% sure about both these things, but I think that's how it works.
