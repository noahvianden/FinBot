Let's say, for argument's sake, that the stock price goes to 161.15 (his \"breakeven\"), and he wants to ensure that his profit is protected. To do this- rather than exercise the option- he will sell a number of shares of underlying AAPL stock such that he is net delta neutral. Now, if the stock price goes down, he loses money from the decreasing value of his option, but this is offset by the increased value of his short- AAPL position. The reverse goes for an increase in stock price (Option gains value/ offset by short stock position). \n\nSo now the questions is, why would he do this as opposed to exercising the option?\n\nHe should (in theory) continue to hold the option/ offset his delta with underlying position (as oppose to exercising the option) because he will remain **long gamma**. Therefore if he is delta neutral at 161.15, he becomes net long delta when the stock goes higher, and net short delta when the stock goes lower (given all else- including implied vol, time decay, etc- remain equal). This is exactly what he would want: he's long the stock when it goes up, and short when it goes down. He can then buy the stock when it goes lower/ sell when it goes higher to remain delta neutral, and continue to profit from moves in either direction. He is now trading a long gamma position via a delta neutral strategy. At the absolute worst, he would likely establish a delta neutral position before unwinding his option/ underlying position simultaneously to profit from both the extrinsic and intrinsic value of the option (as opposed to an exercise, which only benefits from the intrinsic value)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You have some serious misunderstanding on how options work.\n\nI suggest you learn the basic stuff and getting this right first.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You're very, very close to to what you think is a winning strategy.

Ideally the difference between the entry price of the strategy and the strike price is > than the dividend amount.\n\nIn this strategy, you want the calls to be exercised, as you make more money.  If not, you close the position on ex-div, and your profit is the div.\n\nSo in this example, this person purchased AAPL at 135.85 (157-21.15), and tentatively has a \"buyer\" for the stock willing to pay $140.

It is at this price the purchaser of the option is taking a net profit before commissions.\n\n3) Ex-div is a huge factor in a short call being assigned.

Since the option is American it is the buyer's prerogative to exercise or not. So we can only speculate on whether or not they should exercise not if they will.

First you need to understand what the play this person made is. Essentially they are willing to accept all the downside risk below $140 on 100 shares until Jan2018 for $415. Second most options are bought and sold to market and not exercised until they reach parity at expiration.
