{"title": "Spread Trading for Theta Decay?", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm relatively new to this reddit and somewhat options trading in general. So pardon my wordiness, I'll try and get to the point.\n\nFirst, anyone knew about this Tradingology/ist series? It was a series of videos which were done in a very mono-tone voice. On a side note I had discovered my learning disability might be A.D.D because of him.\n\nFrom what I understood it revolves around the writing(selling?) of options to collect theta decay. I just wanted some clarification. The spreads he was setting up where he said he sold a double vertical spread, which is also just the sale of an iron condor in the same month? In addition he used calendar spreads which I have no bloody clue how to make because the price range can't go past a very small range without collapsing in the middle which isn't what I want. \n\nHere's an example of a trade I attempted, http://imgur.com/a/OUc6m\n\nThe calendar should look something like that but with the middle just curving down very slightly, essentially making a tent. \n\nThe only issue in the example with my attempted double vertical spread from what I see is the profit factor doesn't make sense. It's 1:2, but it should be the opposite at 2:1 along with that I am told the edges should curve off or have a near 45-60 degree decent, not have a steep decline.\n\nI don't know what is actually wrong or how to fix it because the person I normally ask, who also showed me the material, doesn't seem to know despite their demeanor or is seemingly just manipulating me to keep me just out of reach. \n\nI'm open to pm's as well, not really looking for a mentor unless you have a lot of patience and will volunteer your time.", "id": "6ufwf4", "created_utc": 1503035115.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Before expiry it will curve rather than go to the 45 degree angles.
