{"title": "Making a case for Footlocker", "selftext": "So I was talking to one of my associates today about acquiring some shoes. He is a self-described sneaker head so I was going to him for some sound advice, as I am not a sneaker head. I just wanted to buy a pair of Jordan’s to see what the hype was about. I didn’t care the color or the year. Long story short while he was doing his sneaker due diligence, I decided to do a little due diligence of my own. He suggested I sign up for a shoe raffle at Footlocker $FL to acquire my shoes as getting them online would be difficult due to others utilizing bots.\n\n\nA few keystrokes later I see that FL has just recently miss earning terribly. They are down 50% YTD. Margins and profits are down YOY, and they are generally in bad shape. Earnings expectations have been adjusted accordingly. Now I don’t see this as a long term play, as I don’t do single stock picking, but I decided to look a little more into this for possibly my first YOLO play. FL is very cyclical with Q1 and Q4 usually being its strongest quarters. This makes sense as this not only incorporates the holiday season, but also coincides with the start of the Football and Basketball seasons in the US. I also believe FL is being dragged down by the entire retail sector as a whole. $AMZN has been fucking up retail all year, and they just recently announced a deal with $NKE to sell Nike products directly on Amazon.com. Basically it has been a total shit storm for FL. This has led to a complete over reaction by shareholders which has caused FL to fall 50% YTD. FL is still making money, albeit on lower margins, but they are also still paying a solid dividend.  They have a pretty solid balance sheet, and they have pretty good brand recognition. While I personally believe their online offerings could use some work, I believe the nature and culture of shoes in general gears towards in store interaction and sales. Buying a new shoe online can be difficult unless you already know the brand and model. They also have the added benefit of exclusive releases that people literally kill for. \n\n\nWith all that being said I see a few Feb. 16 2018 calls with a strike price of $47.00 are just $0.50. $47 may seem like a long shot with $FL trading around $35 today, but once again it is down 50% YTD and was trading at $77 as recently as May. Plus many of the OTM calls are cheap as fuck!!! You would just spend it on blow and hookers anyway!\n\nTL;DR: pick up some cheap OTM Feb 2018 calls for $FL, name your yacht after me. \n\nFull disclosure: I don’t have the ability to trade options yet.
