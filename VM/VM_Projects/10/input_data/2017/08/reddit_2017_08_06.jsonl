They've stated that they're not going to roll over any further Treasury debt.  Nobody is really sure just how much of that two trillion is being rolled over on a weekly basis.  Nobody really knows what happens when the Fed. stops (well, we sort of do vis-a-vis the [taper tantrums of several years ago](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2017/05/10/20170510_EOD1.jpg)).  Nobody knows how much the Fed. is willing to let the market dictate treasury interest rates.  Nobody knows how much the supposed tax reform will impact the Treasury's ability to raise funds (tax reform could *require* the Treasury to mint more debt more rapidly in the absence of Fed. QE debt rollover).  Nobody knows the current administrations appetite for creating debt (well, we sort of do... almost every POTUS has spent more than the last in environments of declining revenue). Nobody is really sure if we're at the Japanization point where interest rates can't be allowed to increase due to the possible reality that the US wouldn't be able to make interest payments on existing debt after interest rates increase.  We're all pretty certain that the Fed. won't let Treasury bond auctions to start failing again, but the Treasury is talking about \"The Crazy Drawer\", which gives one an uncomfortable feeling that maybe the Fed. had a talk with the administration about \"limits\".  We don't know if a failure to properly execute \"tax reform\" will result in these limits being reached.  We don't know if the globalist agenda will stop a war of distraction on the Korean peninsula by causing the US to default.  We don't know if revenue requirements pressure on the Treasury will cause GSE net worth sweeps to continue so that the government can maintain a paycheck-to-paycheck, hand-to-mouth subsistence level of revenue generation, eventually jeopardizing residential mortgage underwriting.  Nobody is really sure what happens when the current administration starts to be dissembled by the Mueller Grand Jury and the Repbus. and starts grasping to reestablish new policy in the resulting vacuum. \n\nThe debt ceiling increase is a given.  What's unknown is everything else surrounding it.  If tax reform fails (and here I always like to ask, \"why would anyone repatriate money from a <5% tax jurisdiction to a ~15% post tax reform US jurisdiction?\"), the \"priced in\" aspect of that anticipated windfall is going to suddenly get \"priced out\".
