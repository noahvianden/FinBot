My dad is a diabetic and in my research, I found a company called Oramed (ORMP) that is developing an oral insulin for diabetics which would replace the injectable route of administration commonly used. My pops can’t stand needles and still struggles with giving himself the injections so I can absolutely see the value in this & see how vast the potential market could be.

Clinical trials, FDA failure rates, dilution potential, all that good stuff, makes it a high risk allocation.

Early stage trials have proved this works (in the majority of patients) and that the science behind the pharmacokinetics is indicative of efficacy. \n\nBottom line, it's risky because it's biotech, but it's also promising because the drug seems to work. \n\nThere's plenty more worth knowing so feel free to fire any questions across to me.

Just from what you've said I assume it would only be for long acting insulin (e.g. lantus or levemir) since the injections are almost an instant admin which would be best for preventing hyperglycemia. Also, insulin is technically a protein which your stomach breaks down pretty easily and that's the main problem with an oral route for insulin. \n\nMy final thought on this (again without reading anything, I will go back and watch the video) is that the oral route does not provide consistent absorption into the body (ie sometimes not a of it would get into your body, sometimes more will). It depends on if you've eaten and when you've eaten last, so the best way to give insulin is still going to be the injections to make sure you are receiving all the dose.\n\nEdit after watching interview: this company is not trying to replace injectable insulin, merely use oral insulin as an adjunct to popular Type 2 diabetes medications. Unfortunately I can't really see where it would fit in current therapy. He also mentioned that the insulin would go straight to the liver, which you bypass by injecting, and that would cause more unstable insulin levels in the body depending on liver function. \n\nSorry man, can't see this going anywhere.

Does the company have diversity in their products that would make it profitable?\n\nAs a diabetic, oral insulin sounds awesome but there are some major hurdles they will need to overcome:\n\n· Every dosage is different based on current glucose levels and what you are about to eat.  How many pills will someone have to take?  Will you have different pills for different units of insulin?\n\n· How soon will it take effect?  Most pills that are fast acting start to dissolve in the mouth. The stomach will breakdown the insulin.  I would assume to buffer the pills so they safely pass through the stomach it would not be fast acting.  How soon before you eat would you need to take it?  That could become a major inconvenience. I mean how many people know what they're going to order before they get to a restaurant?\n\n· Finally insulin is produced in the pancreas.  Most oral meds either increase the cells sensitivity to insulin (like metformin) or causes the pancreas to increase insulin production (glipizided).  I am not aware of the body's ability to pass insulin from the digestive system to your cells.

Let's not overthink this:", "selftext": "We attribute the run to 2 main drivers. \n\n* 1. The stock price has a self-reinforcing tendency (in both directions). Tesla is a serial capital raiser that is widely seen as not yet in an internally self-funding position. As such, its ability to sustain its operations and fundamental value is inextricably linked to the very performance of its share price, creating a self-reinforcing momentum that expresses itself even more strongly given the heavily shorted position in the shares. Yes, this can work (and has worked) in both directions. This time the wind is in its sails (but as we note in our investment risks the winds can change and willingness of capital markets to fund Tesla's strategic and investment ambitions is not a constant). \n\n* 2. Highly encouraging sentiment around Model 3 timing and milestones. How many companies with a market cap in excess of $40bn can you name that are within months of launching a product that could conceivably multiply annual revenues by as much as 5x over a 2 year period? Even if the Model 3 does not lead to positive cash flow or profitability of the company in the short-term (and we expect it will not), this is nonetheless an event that can have a potentially transformational impact on the market's perception of the company's addressable market, competitive position and fundamental sustainability. Please note this factor also serves to strongly reinforce point #1 above. \n\nFor comments we've received from our upgrade, see our note Investor Feedback to our Recent Upgrade (23 Jan 2017). Details of our upgrade on $TSLA from EW to OW can be found in Upgrading to OW on Shorter Delay on Model 3, PT to $305 (19 Jan 2017).
