Operating cash flows are down, CapEx is down, sales are down, costs are up, and they certainly aren't helping things by paying dividends. Couple the dividends with the downward trend in their deferred comp, and since stock/option grants tend to be either for incentivizing new talent to join the company or for satisfying KPIs, the fact that such awards are decreasing tells me their leadership team either can't or won't change course. Am I reading into that too much? Maybe, but healthy companies reward performance. Enough said.\n\nOther highlights:\n\n* Same-store sales and net sales are also on a downward trend, PoP.\n\n* They've closed 9 stores in the period between 11/27/16 and 11/25/17.\n\nPuts sound smart right now.

Malls are usually far apart and Buckle is a shitty mall store that can mostly be found in shitty, declining malls.  I would be careful not to put too much weight on store closures as that is a standard operating activity in retail. It only matters when there are a lot at once. An analysis I would like to see is which anchors are in the same malls as a Buckle store. If you do that you can judge the health of the malls in which it operates. If it's nothing but JC Penny, Sears, and Dillard's then yes, short that bitch.\n\nHistorically, Buckle has underperformed Macy's but in October Buckle outperformed for the first time in a while. However, this was also when Macy's announced a lot of closures and the news is likely the source of that switch.\n\nBuckle is also outperforming JCPenny for the first time and by an even larger margin. What's going to happen when JC Penny goes under? Who is going to fill that large retail space? Nobody. Traffic for that mall will go down even further and every store in the mall will get necrosis. It's just a matter of when.\n\nSo we have Macy's in ICU, JC Penny in a coma, and Sears in hospice care. In the long run Buckle will fail and its only hope is to be acquired.\n\nI think you're onto something here with the puts. Earnings are in February. The stock should fix itself by March.
