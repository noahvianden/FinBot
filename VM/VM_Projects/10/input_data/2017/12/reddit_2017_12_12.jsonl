I am struggling to select which stocks to spread this amount over. I don't trade actively, so these will either be held long-term or sold at an appropriate time.\n\nHere are some stocks I've shortlisted (of course the ones that are worth more than 1,500$ are an exception to my rule of how much I'm spending). The % I've allocated to each share is the likelihood that I will purchase a share or share(s).\n\nNaturally, I will only pick 3-5 from the list.\n\n1. General Electric - 99% Purchase\n2. Barrick Gold - 99% Purchase\n3. Ally Financial - 80% Purchase\n4. United Healthcare - 50% Purchase\n5. Microsoft - Undecided\n6. Intuitive Surgical - Undecided\n7. HubSpot - Undecided\n8. Berkshire Hathaway - Undecided\n9. Citi Bank - 30% purchase\n10. Delphi - Undecided\n11. Mainstreet Cap. - Undecided\n12. Crown Castle - Undecided\n13. AT&T - Undecided\n14. B&M European Retail - Undecided\n\nOther considerations: AT&T, Crown Castle, Exxon Mobil, \n\nAt the moment I have shares in Lloyds Bank, Vodafone and BT.\n\nKindly share your learned opinions.

That's what investing really should be. You are now a part owner of TSLA, a small one albeit but one nonetheless. As an owner, based on publicly available information, are you optimistic about the performance of your company? If you are, you'd be a fool to give up your ownership claim (shares). Why would anyone cede their ownership in a company they feel positive about? On the contrary if you don't like the numbers and think the company's prospects are dim, you can sell your ownership (shares) and find a new company to own. \n\nThink of your stock like Warren Buffett not like people who view it as simply a hold for money. Technical investing is a bunch of BS anyways. You think the public market is going to stop selling their shares on a bad report because it hits a \"support level\"? It's a bunch of bologna.
