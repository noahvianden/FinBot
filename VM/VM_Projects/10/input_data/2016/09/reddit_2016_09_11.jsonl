{"title": "r/StockMarket Stock Picking Challenge for the week of (9/12 - 9/16)", "selftext": "OK, so a couple of things in here folks ... I have some bad news and some goods news to share in here -- first the bad news: I want to apologize to the few of you who had submitted picks in here over the past 24hrs ... somehow someway I literally deleted the original contest thread this morning! Lol ... and no i was not hungover from partying the night before! :P\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way for me to resurrect that thread ... it's a goner ... finito ... done!\n\nThat being said I do have some good news here: since only about 7 of you had posted picks in the original thread not much was lost, and I was even able to save an archive of the thread last night just before I made this blunder this morning so I have saved all 7 of your guys picks. I will post up those picks just as soon as I have this thread setup first...\n\nBut anyway, as promised to all of you who participated on our 1st contest here 2 weeks ago, here we are with our 2nd ever weekly stock picking challenge here on r/StockMarket! :)\n\nSo without further ado, let's get right into the contest rules!\n\n# r/StockMarket Stock Picking Challenge for the week of (9/12 - 9/16)\n\n**PLEASE READ THESE RULES THOROUGHLY BEFORE POSTING UP YOUR PICKS!**\n\n**If you want to be eligible to participate in this week's contest here is what you need to do (REQUIRED!):**\n> * 1.) Post 2 tickers (ex. AAPL = Apple) but **YOU MUST** pick 2 not just 1 or else I will not add you to our list of contestants!\n> * 2.) Choose either Long or Short for each ticker (Obviously LONG - if you think it will go up ... or SHORT - if you think it will go down this week...)\n> * 3.) Both of your picks **MUST** each be at least $2 at the very minimum!\n\n**Contest Rules (READ THESE AND FOLLOW THEM!)**:\n> * 1.) No OTC or Foreign companies.\n> * 2.) No Options, Futures, Forex, stuff like that... Equities ONLY that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange!\n> * 3.) If you don't post both the ticker AND the direction (LONG/SHORT) you won't be added to the list of contestants for this week's stock picking challenge!\n> * 4.) You cannot duplicate someone's exact play! For example- If someone picks AAPL - Long and BAC - Long first then you can only pick AAPL - Short and BAC - Long or AAPL - Long and BAC - Short<-- you may only duplicate 1 pick but not BOTH! This is a first come, first serve basis here.\n> * 5.) Picks absolutely **MUST** be posted in here before the 9:30AM eastern cash market open on Monday morning!\n> * 6.) You are only allowed 1 leveraged ETF. If you choose two, the second of the two does not count and is still up for grabs. If incorrect picks go un-noticed, you risk your position being forfeited! (These are the 2x/3x ETF's)\n> * 7.) Optional - You may post a rationale (either technical or fundamental) for your picks, but it is not mandatory.\n> * 8.) Please **DO NOT EDIT** your picks!! If you absolutely must choose another pick, please use a separate post and state that you are changing your original pick to something else!\n\nI will post up the live contest spreadsheet a little after the market closes on Monday with everyone's picks posted, this will include your opening prices, current prices, P&L, and ROI for each of your picks, as well as an overall average ROI between 2 of your picks, and that will be what we will use to total up both of your 2 picks!\n\nIn addition, since we're doing this contest on Reddit, no one will be able to close out their picks during the trading week... Everyone's picks will close at Friday's close!\n\nGood luck to everyone in here! Let's see who can deliver the 2 best picks for this week and take bragging rights as the best stock picker of the week here at r/StockMarket! :)\n\nIf you have any questions about anything feel free to fire away...\n\nAlso, for anyone looking around for our inaugural contest thread & results here they are:\n\n* **[r/StockMarket Stock Picking Challenge for the week of (8/29 - 9/2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/500y92/rstockmarket_stock_picking_challenge_for_the_week/)**\n\n* **[Congratulations to this week's r/StockMarket Stock Picking Contest WINNER -- bigbear0083!

I have no interest in AMD, but I think the view that I have is that people thought AMD was basically going to not be around (and it did almost get down to the $1 level.) The turnaround happened, but the turnaround is - *at this stage* - the idea that they are going to still be around.
