{"title": "If Trump wins, this is what you should do", "selftext": "Short the health care industry. Trump says he's going to destroy obamacare, and I think he's actually going to do it. All of the poor fags who don't have money to go to the hospital won't be getting free health care anymore. That means less business for health care staffing companies, and all different kinds of shit. You should probably short PFE too, but don't quote me on that because I'm probably wrong. I just want to short the whole industry. I finished watching The Big Short for the second time today, and I feel like this could be the perfect example of a bubble. Everybody is just too dumb to realize how undervalued hospitals are, because all of the low level workers are hispanic. When Trump becomes president, he's going to deport everybody which will destroy backbone of these businesses. This is just a bubble waiting to pop, because all of the underlying securities are subrime. This sounds very complicated, so please feel free to ask any questions if you're a beginner in the market\n\nTLDR: short the health care industry, it's a bubble.

If anything I'd be going long healthcare into the next few years.
