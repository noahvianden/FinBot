{"title": "Investing $300,000 in a diverse portfolio of at least 10 stocks (+ maybe an index)--what do you think of my ideas so far?", "selftext": "Full disclosure:  This is a homework assignment for an undergrad investment analysis class.  I am NOT asking ya'll to do my homework for me, but I am really interesting in creating some discussion around the ideas I have, and to shoot some more off of your brains.  Also--who's to say I won't use this expertise in the RL.  \nThe situation is this:  A couple has $300,000 to invest.  They are interested in saving on their taxes.  They want to eventually (at an unknown date in the future), sell their stocks and buy a second home as an investment.  They cannot currently afford to take a second mortgage.  They do not expect their salaries to change at all in the next 5 years. one big caveat: all the companies must be bay area companies.  \nMy analysis so far:  \nA.  Since the couple wants to save on taxes, I want to primarily choose stocks that are expected to appreciate in value (obviously) and issue no dividends.  If I do choose a company that issues dividends, it had better be a good bet to increase in value substantially; the higher the dividend it issues the better the better the bet it should be.  \nB.  Stocks I am looking at and why (so far)  \nSalesforce (CRM): It's operating margin is positive for the first time in 5 years.  Salesforce is exiting a period of investment and is starting to see returns.  The companies income and market performance should grow significantly in the coming years. Salesforce also has great industry recognition. Now is a great time to invest in Salesforce.  \nC.
