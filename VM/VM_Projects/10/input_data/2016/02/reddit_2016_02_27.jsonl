{"title": "Wanting to invest in AMD, not sure which broker to use", "selftext": "Looking to buy 100 shares of AMD so I skimmed over the various brokers in the wiki. From what I saw, TD Ameritrade is 9.99 per trade over the internet, E*TRADE is the same (0-149 trades per quarter), Fidelity is 7.95 for online unlimited trades, Charles Schwab is 8.95, OptionsXpress is 8.95 per trade, and Scottrade is  7.00 per trade. \n\nSo my questions are, would Scottrade be the best option if I only plan on doing 2 trades, one when buying stock and one when selling? Options like Fidelity say unlimited trades, but would that only be per quarter? Are there any other fees I should be wary of? Any sort of account fees or need to keep logging into my account? Etc.\n\nThank you so much for your help, and if I have no idea what im saying, let me know :)", "id": "47sgdv", "created_utc": 1456533069.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.3, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Why do you want to invest in AMD?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "With their upcoming Zen and Polaris, I believe AMD will finally start to gain some ground in the market.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "..Have you seen their financial statements?...
