The price is very low, but it's low for a reason.  Management can either guide the ship back to better waters or ensure it sinks to the bottom.  The odds of going to the bottom are high right now.

If Zen works out, AMD will grow back and continue to grow, you will have literally years to buy AMD and enjoy increasing stock price due to growth. You can lock in your 5x return or whatever it may be once that happens. What people seems to not understand is that if you buy now you may be shooting for a >6x return but you also risk losing everything you put in. -100% of money you CURRENTLY have hurts a lot more than losing out on 10-16% of your future PROFITABLE return. I want AMD to do well but they have been flailing for a long time, if Zen helps them recapture the market share they've been losing I'd be more than happy to buy in. For a comparison, if you bought Google at $45 at IPO you'd get a 1500% return. If Google flopped after IPO (see GPRO, TWTR) you'd lose most of your investment. If you waited until Google hit $100 and proved themselves to be valuable and have positive earnings, you'd have a much lower risk 1300% return. \n\nSorry for typos, this is from a phone.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Thanks for the information!", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "\"people want AMD to win and will buy their cpus if they get within close range of intel.\"\n\nLOL.
