It would be dropping the ball big time if the CFO of Netflix allowed spending to happen which would place the books at less than guidance.\n\nIf you take it as a given that earnings will be at guidance or better, then I think it's a clear that being bullish on netflix is the way to go (i.e. market does not expect that much better than guidance). \n\nNext, I think we can safely say that the risk of netflix users churning is low since netflix has been making great choices for its originals. There are a lot of articles raving about netflix emmys right now. There are 56 emmy nominations associated with netflix originals.\n\nLast quarter they came in with low expectations for user acquisition. From last quarters letter:\n\"In the US, we added 2.23 million members in Q1, against 2.28 million a year ago, and 2.25 two years\nago. Our forecast for the quarter was low (at 1.75 million) because we underestimated the positive\nacquisition impact of our major original content debuts.\" \nWell, their originals are doing even better now than they were before.\n\nLast quarter they also gave guidance on # of new users for Q2. They estimate 0.5 million. They also state that this includes a modest impact from 'un-grandfathering', i.e. people whose bills go from $8 to $10. I wouldn't be surprised if this is way too conservative and we will probably see acquisitions beat guidance like in Q1.\n\nI think Netflix is low-balling us with the guidance.\n\nbuy NFLX!", "id": "4swzvm", "created_utc": 1468549371.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Fuck you I'm not reading that \n\nInverse fscheumo is the only DD I need ", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Of course netflix is low-balling the guidance, because when the real earnings per share is posted it'll beat their expectations and excite investors.
