The Delta you see is a ratio for an infinitesimal movement in the underlying. As soon as the underlying moves you have to readjust Delta based on gamma. The more in the money your option is the higher your Delta is. It's likely you are seeing a Delta from when the option was still out of the money. The math behind calculating options prices is a bit tricky even with both Delta and gamma, but one thing to remember is that an option will never cost less than it's intrinsic value. So if you subtract the strike price from the cost of the underlying, you can nearly always insure at the very minimum that price on the call (assuming moderate liquidity). If it seems unintuitive then remember that you are trading American style options, which means at anytime someone can exercise them and then turn right around and sell the underlying to turn the intrinsic value into profit.
