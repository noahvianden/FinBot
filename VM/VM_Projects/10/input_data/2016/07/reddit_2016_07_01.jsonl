{"title": "Is PYPL a buy?", "selftext": "I was debating between Square and Paypal and discovered that PayPal is much more profitable than Square. Some predicted that apple may acquire square but that's just rumors.  \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Is it a buy right now or not?\n2) If its a buy, what's a good entry price?", "id": "4qq1av", "created_utc": 1467349354.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "http://www.barrons.com/articles/square-has-no-clear-path-to-profitability-1466614903\n\nSquare is something that may get bought at some point, but it's not a particularly good or well-run (Jack Dorsey, splitting his time between not managing Twitter well and not managing this well.) Square is a small player in a huge industry with a lot of competition. People on here discuss Square and never bring up other names, which is fascinating because to me it's indicative of the idea that they've heard of Square because this sub is so only focused on what is hyped (and often overhyped.)\n\nhttp://www.barrons.com/articles/square-has-no-clear-path-to-profitability-1466614903\n\n\"Square’s business currently generates GAAP net losses, and the company has not provided a clear path to achieve or maintain profitability. While Square generated positive free cash flow in second-half 2015 and should achieve positive adjusted Ebitda growth in second-half 2016, it remains unclear when the company will achieve profitability from both a GAAP and adjusted earnings-per-share standpoint.\"\n\nhttp://www.barrons.com/articles/square-stock-likely-to-set-new-lows-1466224191\n\n\"Falling toward $5 to $6 a share seems like the better bet, given that Square is at least a year away from making a profit, amid questions about parts of its business model. “They represent a real value trap,” says Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush who rates the stock Underperform.\"\n\n\"For instance, Square acts as the retailers’ agent and pays the 20-cent fee per transaction that businesses would normally forward to payment systems managers such as Visa (V). Square’s 2.75% fee is higher than that of rivals like Heartland Payment Systems, Global Payments (GPN), Vantiv (VNTV), and First Data (FDC). They tend to charge about 1.75%, but don’t absorb the 20-cent fee.\n\nThat doesn’t sound like much, but it can be the margin between making or losing money on small transactions. A $5 purchase at a retailer would net Square 14 cents. But once it handed over the 20-cent fee, Square would register a six-cent loss.\n\n“You simply can’t serve this segment of the market at the price points that Square uses,” says Wedbush’s Luria.\"\n\n\" Luria thinks Square may “never reach peer profitability” because of its small-business focus.\n\nAt $9 a share, Square has a market valuation of about $3 billion. It trades at about 36 times its consensus 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $74 million—three times the Ebitda multiple of PayPal. At PayPal’s multiple, Square would trade for less than $3 a share, which seems too low in light of its growth. A price around $5 to $6 seems more reasonable.\"\n\n______________________\n\nResearch the industry, look at other players, realize that Square is one smaller player in a very competitive business. Verifone and Ingenico basically dominate point-of-sale to the point where a major purchase by either would likely result in antitrust issues. \n\nAdditionally, I don't want to be in small business lending, as Square loans money. \n\nThere's other financial technology companies - Global Payments (GPN), Fiserv (FISV), Vantiv (VNTV), Ingenico (INGIY) or Paypal (PYPL) that are actually making money and not just IPO's overhyped to draw in investors. Again, that's not to say that someone won't buy Square, but I wouldn't buy it based on that expectation.  A lot of people bought GPRO and TWTR much higher thinking, \"someone has to buy them.\" Don't buy companies with mediocre or poor fundamentals for the sole reason that \"someone might buy them\", because there's no guarantee of that - and if they do, it could be a lot lower.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Maybe suitors have knocked on the door but, the buyout price could be steep?

Secondly, apple absolutely needs to focus on its \"Apple Pay\" system and square is already there, once they put the apple sticker on square, it will be used by most people; and finally, Apple is in a tight spot when it comes to how they will keep up with the market, they are extremely pressured into upgrading their Apple Pay, otherwise they WILL fall behind.\n\nI'd buy square now, since it's in a low, or watch for the volume, in case insider trading is happening.
