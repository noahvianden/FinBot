The potential upside is like 1% right now, but if the deal were to not go through then the stock would plummet.

There's nothing too wrong with your vague idea but don't post it until you have specifics:\n\n1. What date of puts?  They expect it to close \"this year\".  So the only reasonably dated puts you could buy to bookend this would be January 2017, February 2017 or January 2018 (which is not unreasonable because M&A deals almost always take longer than expected)\n\n2. But let's stick with January 2017 so they're as cheap as possible.  Ok now - what strike price?  Buyout is at $196 but for the premise of your theory you want to buy cheap puts and not risk a lot.  The lower the strike the cheaper the put.  \n\nLook up and down the January 2017 put chain.  LNKD was trading ~$130-$140 prior to buyout.  At best you can guess that's where it would return.  So you have to buy a put above that.\n\nLet's say a $145 put.  Mid price is $2.10.  You can probably get cheaper, it's very illiquid.  But let's say it costs you $200 to buy this put.  And let's say right before it expires deal is called off and stock drops to $130 so you're $15 in the money on something you paid $2 for.  \n\nSo you make 7.5x return holding something that cost you $200 for 7 months on the 1% chance that it happens. If that fits your risk/reward profile - go for it\n\n3.  BUT - if the deal falls through the day before your puts expire...WILL LNKD fall to $130?  LNKD traded up 30%+ from its lows.  Between now and January it will report earnings twice.  There's no particular reason to assume that if you bought a $145 put that if the deal doesn't go through the stock will drop below that.
