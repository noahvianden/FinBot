Their professional CPUs have been annihilated by Intel due to poor power efficiency and high heat output.

Most people will not have access to the supercharger; they will use the standard method which takes even longer (EX: their house is not made for a high voltage service that is easily accessible without paying somebody to come install it). But as Tesla trying to service their customer to get them Fuel on the road, buying the property to install all these chargers is going to be expensive especially in the big city's where they are needed most. They will also need enough space to handle more than one single car. Now you are talking an entire \"car charging station\" like a gas station but for electric vehicles. Sorry but all that property is already purchased by BP and Shell. Good luck getting into that market. They will need to partner with a big oil producer to get chargers at their existing locations. and do not think oil is going to play nice. Haven't heard TESLA address anything at all about this.
