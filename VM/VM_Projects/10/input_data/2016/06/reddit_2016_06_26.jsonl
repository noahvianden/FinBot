{"title": "My attempt at NKE ER DD.", "selftext": "Alright, I'm new to this whole DD thing, but I'm going to take a stab at this: I think NKE might beat their ER estimate, and might even have a nice gap up as a result.\n\n\nNikes posting their earnings Tuesday PM for Q4 2016. Taking a look at last year we see:\n\n\nEPS forecast: $.42\nActual EPS: $.49\n\n\nI'm not as concerned with the fact that Nike beat last year, I'm more interested in their EPS, $.49. If we look at the EPS forecast for this year [it's $.48, lower than last year](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/nke), meaning they're expected to have worse results than last year.\n\n\nHowever, when looking at the (Q3 financial statement from this fiscal year)[http://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_financials/2016/Q3/NIKE-Inc-Q316-Press-Release-03-22-16-FINAL.pdf]:\n\n\n> Futures Orders\n> As of the end of the quarter, worldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel\nscheduled for delivery from March 2016 through July 2016 were 12 percent higher than orders\nreported for the same period last year. Excluding currency changes, futures orders would have\nincreased 17 percent.*\n\n\nSo Nike is expected to report worse earnings than last year, despite the fact that they saw a double digit increase in orders expected to deliver in Q4. Granted, I don't know if these orders were paid for, and counted, in the Q3 earnings but that still seems like a good sign to me.\n\n\nLooking towards the future, I'm guessing Nike will have a positive outlook. I think European sales could see an bump due to the Euros, and possibly NA sales from [Lebron and the Cavs becoming the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals](http://www.si.com/nba/photos/2015/05/18/nba-playoff-3-1-comebacks), which seems important. Or not. Who the hell knows.\n\n\nAnyway, last thing. With Brexit, I think any stock showing signs of stability/promise are going to be priced at a higher premium than normal. If Nike can beat their earnings estimate, and not show shitty guidance, I think there will be a bigger bump than if Britain Bremained.\n\n\nWell there it is, I gave it a shot.

Friday was both a wild day in the market and Russel rebalance so the relative options chain in stocks gets all fucked\n\n2.  Math.  Options are various amounts out of the money.  They respond to changes in the price of the underlying in different ways (you can study this more by learning the greeks - this in particular is delta) but to keep it simple if a stock was at $10, and you're looking at the $9 options and the $8 options - if the stock goes to $9.50 the $9 option is going to move much more because now it's much closer to the stock price.  Additionally, because you're looking at % changes you have to think about how that works.  An option that started the day at a larger value than the one next to it - if they both move similar dollar values the one that started at the lower dollar value would show a much larger % change.  It's just all relative, depends on where things started, the stock price, the move in the stock price, etc.\n\nThe % change in option prices relative to one another is not really a great gauge", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Theta too....
