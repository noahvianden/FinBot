{"title": "The r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the Week of (12/5 - 12/9) is now OPEN for picks! *RATIONALE REQUIRED!*", "selftext": "# Welcome to the r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the Week of (12/5 - 12/9)\n\n**PLEASE READ THESE RULES THOROUGHLY BEFORE POSTING UP YOUR STOCK PICKS!**\n\n*****\n\n**If you want to be eligible to participate in this week's challenge here is what you need to do (REQUIRED!):**\n> * 1.) Post 2 tickers (ex. AAPL = Apple) but **YOU MUST** pick 2 not just 1 or else I will not add you to our list of contestants!\n> * 2.) Choose either Long or Short for each ticker (Obviously LONG - if you think it will go up ... or SHORT - if you think it will go down this week...)\n> * 3.) Both of your picks **MUST** each be at least $2 at the very minimum! If you pick something that is under $2 then you pick will not count, and you will not be entered into this week's challenge!\n\n*****\n\n**Challenge Rules (READ THESE AND FOLLOW THEM!)**:\n> * 1.) No OTC, ADRs, or Foreign companies.\n> * 2.) No Options, Futures, Forex, stuff like that... Equities ONLY that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange!\n> * 3.) If you don't post both the ticker AND the direction (LONG/SHORT) you won't be added to the list of contestants for this week's stock picking challenge!\n> * 4.) You cannot duplicate someone's exact play! For example- If someone picks AAPL - Long and BAC - Long first then you can only pick AAPL - Short and BAC - Long or AAPL - Long and BAC - Short *<-- you may only duplicate 1 pick but not BOTH!* This is a first come, first serve basis here.\n> * 5.) Picks absolutely **MUST** be posted in here before the 9:30AM eastern cash market open on Monday morning!\n> * 6.) You are only allowed 1 leveraged ETF. If you choose two, the second of the two does not count and is still up for grabs. If incorrect picks go un-noticed, you risk your position being forfeited! (These are the 2x/3x ETF's)\n> * 7.) RATIONALE - You **MUST** post up a rationale (either technical or fundamental) for both of your picks or you will **NOT** be entered into this week's challenge!\n> * 8.) Please **DO NOT EDIT** your picks!! If you absolutely must choose another pick, please use a separate post and state that you are changing your original pick to something else!\n\n*****\n\nI will post up the live challenge spreadsheet a little after the market closes on Monday with everyone's picks posted, this will include your opening prices, current prices, P&L, & Total ROI for each of your picks, as well as an overall total ROI and an overall average ROI between 2 of your picks, and that will be what we will use to total up both of your 2 picks!\n\nIn addition, since we're doing this challenge on Reddit, no one will be able to close out their picks during the trading week... Everyone's picks will close at Friday's close! And also everyone's picks will start at Monday's opening prices.\n\nGood luck to everyone in here! Let's see who can deliver the 2 best picks for this week and take bragging rights as the best stock picker of the week here at r/StockMarket! :P\n\nIf you have any questions about anything feel free to fire away on this thread...\n\nHope to see a pretty nice show of participation in here this week from everyone at r/StockMarket! :)\n\nAgain please try to get those 2 picks in before the 9:30am eastern cash market open on Monday! Ready, set, GO!!!\n\nI know it has been a few months since I last ran this challenge here at r/StockMarket, but seeing as I have some free time during these next couple of weeks with the big holidays upcoming I figured to attempt to restart these up again for this week at the very least!\n\nHave fun all and GLTA this upcoming trading week ahead! :)\n\nEDIT: Oh and here are this week's upcoming earnings releases for those who are thinking of playing earnings for this week's challenge -> **[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES!](http://i.imgur.com/ajs0Bvh.jpg)**", "id": "5ggbct", "created_utc": 1480870573.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "CEMP Long - technical breakout at 7.50\n\nITCI long - technical breakout at 15.50\n\nFeels like a longy kinda week!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can I pick ADR shares of a foreign company or do those count as OTC?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "/u/Slightly_Communist very good question there and i just made a quick edit to my OP just in case others were asking the same in the future ... but yes no ADRs of foreign companies for this challenge! sorry about that! but thank you for quickly bringing this to my attention! i should have already had this included in the challenge rules ... whoops! my bad!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So VLKAY is not an acceptable but FCAU is ok", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Yay it's back up!

{"title": "Thoughts about mutual funds?", "selftext": "So i was on a seminar presented by a company which is some kinde of asset consultant. They promary reason why i attendet it was because i wanted to work there. Half through the seminar i kinda realised that its more like an advertisement for them and they need new customars and not employees. Well their main argument was that the intrest on every banking product is so bad that it wont even make up for inflation. That was quite reasonable but then they praised mutual funds like some kindof godly product. They say that average profit of those, they eventually buy with their customars is about 6-8 % and that is very average and everyone can achieve that. They do it thorugh some kind of bank which has given bundles of funds like franklin templeton. So is it true that it is wise to invest atleast some money into mutual funds? Are you allways better of with mutual funds than the common banking products?
