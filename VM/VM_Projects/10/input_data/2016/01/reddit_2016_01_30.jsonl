{"title": "NFLX n Chill got me broke", "selftext": "So I got my first Call-spread strategy from an advisor. The strategy asked for a buy-to-open and sell-to-open on NFLX simultaneously. But since I'm new to trading, my broker did not allow me to do a sell-to-open at the time. So I only traded buy-to-open. As I started reading more about how sell-to-open is used simultaneously with buy-to-open in order to protect your investment, I realized how discounting this part of the spread and trading bullishly with buy-to-open only, was not very smart. NFLX is going down and I have no safety net.\n\nMy question is: If my expiration date is on Feb 19, is it too late to put in an order of sell-to-open to protect my investment?\n\nThanks in advance!

Can you please link an article or explain it to me?  \n\nIt seems like writing the call is the dangerous part, and buying the call at $125 is designed to protect you from infinite losses if the stock explodes.\n\nAnd why are you buying $125 calls for the 19th.  Do you expect to be in the money by then?\n\nEdit: \n\nSo I was right.  This is called a [bull call spread](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullcallspread.asp).  Its designed so you are making your money on the options you are writing and covering the HUGE risk associated with writing calls by buying calls at a lower price.\n\nHonestly I dont really see the up-side to this.  You still only make money if the market goes up since the options you bought are more expensive than the ones you shorted.  Plus you are limiting your profits to the difference in strike prices.\n\nI've never heard of this before and would like to know why this strategy exists and how people use it effectively.\n\nAnd its used when a moderate increase in value is anticipated.  So you need to buy calls that will be in the money while writing calls that are out of the money to maximize your sweet gainz.\n\nMy broker wont let me write calls unless I have enough of the underlying security in my brokerage account to cover them.
