{"title": "My Idea for a play on oil", "selftext": "I have been thinking a lot recently about our situation with US oil. There is clearly money to be made in this sector, and I wanted to run my thoughts past you guys to see what you all think.\n\nCurrently, oil prices are riding low. Let’s analyze what this will do on a macroeconomic scale.\n\n**Low Oil Prices:** \n\n* Discourage companies from searching for alternative energy sources. If oil is cheap, why not use oil. \n\n* Decrease cost of ALL businesses, which in turn encourages growth. \n\n* Hurts alternative energy businesses. If oil is cheap and accessible, why use alternative energy solutions?\n\n\nOil is nonrenewable, and at some point overproduction must stop. When supply goes down and demand does not change, a price increase is inevitable.\n\n**After Oil Prices Rise:**\n\n* The stock market will take a beating due to the now higher cost to run a business. \n\n* Lack of bonus income due to low oil prices will decrease the ability for businesses to expand. \n\n* Alternative energy will again become more useful. \n\n* Oil companies that survive will be valued higher than they are right now.\n\n\n**What To Do About The Current Situation**\n\nAt this time, United States oil might not be at its ultimate low, however one can rarely invest at the all time low. It is key to buy when people are scared to buy and not during euphoria. The US oil sector is hurting bad and the US stock market is riding high. Knowing this, what can we do to make some money. By buying US oil companies, we take the risk of bankruptcy. In order to mitigate this, we should only buy into companies that we believe can take another lick and keep on ticking. I look towards Chicago Bridge & Iron Company (CBI). CB&I designs, engineers and constructs some of the world's largest energy infrastructure projects mainly for oil and gas companies, but also for nuclear and other forms of alternative energy. CB&I is hurting because currently energy companies do not have the required funds or income in order to expand and require new facilities. CB&I is losing money, but is not losing money at the same rate of those who are directly reliant on the price of oil. This gives them an advantage over a typical US energy company.\n\n**My Thoughts on the Future of CB&I**\n\nOnce the downturn of oil reverses, oil companies should start to see their stock values climb once again. The same is not exactly true for CB&I. They do not recover until energy companies begin to require more infrastructure once again. This may take up to a few years after the recovery of oil. If we are certain that CB&I can make the wait, then there is no reason that CB&I would be a bad long term investment.\n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know what all of you think!", "id": "41kn36", "created_utc": 1453146765.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Also, EOG, CVX and RDS/A.
