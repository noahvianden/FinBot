{"title": "Naked Put Rolling", "selftext": "Here's an example trade that I feel I might be missing something on. Lets say on Monday you sell a naked SPY 180 Put for Feb 26 and collect $177 premium.

At this price, lets say you buy back at around a $300 loss and to offset that loss, you sell 4 170 puts for the same expiry for an estimated credit of $372.

Do you discontinue the strategy altogether or do you restart the strategy? Since it would only be worth considering if the latter is true, let's assume that. In this case, you're levering down every two losses (or three).
