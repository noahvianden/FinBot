{"title": "Complete beginner thinking of investing in oil", "selftext": "Hey I'm completely new here and don't know anything about stocks except that there are ups and downs and that it isn't so easy to tell when a stock reaches the lowest point.    As the price of oil is getting extremely low I was thinking about investing maybe 1k into some oil shares as of course they can drop a little further but at least from my understanding as oil is a limited resource I can't imagime that the price will stay that low over a longer period of time.    I wouldn't mind if I won't be able to get my money from the stocks so maybe that would be a good idea for some long term investment?    Any experienced traders out here who could give me some advise and maybe also tell me which oil stocks are good because I absolutely have no idea about all these stocks?

Don't invest a single dollar until you educate yourself. Understand moving averages, candlestick patterns, both technical and fundamental analysis, stop limits, averages...\n\n2. If oil is your focus, you should wait. None of those stocks have reached their bottoms, you will lose a lot of money if you invest this week or even this month.\n\n3. When market conditions stabilize, I would consider FCX, CHK, USO (an ETF). There are dozens more, but oil is still falling.\n\nJust be careful and be patient.

Of course this could take quite a while, but they can't deliver unlimited amounts of oil..    I could only think of two exceptions where you could loose a lot,     \n1. When the company goes bankrupt (that's why I would have to find out which company could afford a huge loss and rise up again)    \n2. Demand decreases drastically (for example better resources found or drastic increasement of electric cars etc.)    \nThe third reason, that would be possible, that a few countries would increase oil prodiction, would only really make sense when the price is high...    \nAnd point number two seems to be unrealistic for near future and it would probably take a long time until oil isn't really needed a lot", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">of course they can drop a little further but at least from my understanding as oil is a limited resource I can't imagime that the price will stay that low over a longer period of time.\n\nWell... it depends who you talk to or which opinion you read. There are a lot of alarmists predicting oil to dip to or below $20/barrel and linger at decade lows for the year. Some (crazy folks*) think oil could run back up to $100/barrel by the end of the year. \n\nKeep in mind it's not only the price of oil that will affect the price of a given stock, it's also the company's ability to deal with the working with thin margins. Even the strongest companies of the past could pull strings to acclimate themselves to lower oil prices such as suspending dividends, announcing layoffs, etc, which then results in panic selling and a stock to plummet further.\n\nI'm sure it's tempting with seeing the market down like this, but it's quite possible we're not at the bottom yet.
