{"title": "When selling spreads: close or keep them open?", "selftext": "I have been confused about this dilemma for a while, and I have read many conflicting viewpoints on this topic. If you keep the trade open and it goes outside of the break even price, you are \"losing\" money in the moment, but it could go back to a profitable range. However, if the price goes too far against you, the maximum loss can be realized very quickly, even if it can still be a winning trade down the line. My question is: Is is ever worth it to take that risk, or is it better to do a stop loss when you hit your break even for a small loss comparatively to the maximum loss which can put one back quite a bit. In the long run, is it better to close out a trade if it is threatened, or keep it open hoping to win?\n\nClosing seems like a wiser thing to do because it feels like you are just gambling if you are hoping for it to go up... I've been paper trading and for the most part have been closing them out, but I kept a few open just to test the theory and I actually lost quite a bit in the recent market crash, so I'm leaning on the side of closing the trade.

The seller wins when the buyer loses, so for her, the probability of profit is 1 - POT/2. Or, to use an example, if you've sold a spread, and probability of touch is zero, then probability of profit is 1 - 0/2 = 1, not 0/2 = 0!\n\nOr, to put it more anal retentively: If the underlying hits the strike, then from there the theoretical odds of finishing ITM are 50%. So P(ITM given Touch) = ~~POT/2~~ 1/2. Now P(ITM) = P(ITM given Touch)P(Touch) + P(ITM given No Touch)P(No Touch), but P(ITM given No Touch) = 0, so P(ITM) = POT/2.

{"title": "DEUTSCHE BANK: We expect the stock market to go 'up and soon'", "selftext": "\"We expect the next 5%+ S&P price move to be up and soon.\"\n\nThat's the gutsy call Deutsche Bank's chief US equity strategist, David Bianco, made in a note to clients on Monday. It follows what's been the worst-ever start to the year for the stock market, which has seen the S&P 500 plunge 8% in just two weeks.\n\n\"We are not panicked by this correction because we understand it,\" he said. \"It's driven by a profit recession centered at certain industries caused by factors that we've long flagged as risks with detailed research and quantified sensitivities.\"\n\nBianco's no stranger to making contrarian buy calls when stock prices are tumbling. As the market was correcting during fall 2011, he cranked up his target for stocks and told clients to buy, drawing all sorts of nasty criticism. His call was later proved right.\n\nIn recent years, he's been one of the most cautious strategists on Wall Street. He's been vocal about the problems with corporate profits. And he's been outright bearish about the market's near-term expectations for energy-sector profits. With his note on Monday, he joins his peers who have been slashing their outlooks for earnings.\n\n\"We now assume zero profits from Energy in 2016 and an oil price of ~$35/bbl,\" Bianco said on Monday. \"It might be better or worse, but zero is not normal and eventually Energy will likely contribute $5-10 to S&P EPS. Thus, 'normal 2016 S&P EPS' is $125 or more and on that basis the index is at a 15.0 PE or less.\"\n\nBianco now forecasts the S&P 500 will hit 2,200 this year on $120 earnings per share (EPS). This is down from his initial targets of 2,250 and $125.\n\nGoing back to his call for a rebound, one key assumption is that the whole economy doesn't go into recession.\n\n\"All GDP recessions coincide with profit declines, but not all profit declines coincide with GDP recessions and that's what makes it a profit recession as distinct from a broad recession,\" he said.\n\nAnd when there's no broad recession, the dip in stock prices reverses quickly. Here's Bianco on the history of stock market dips:\n\nDips of 5%+ are common and happen at least once a year. Only three years since 1960 didn't have a 5%+ dip (1964, 1993 & 1995) and many mid-cycle years saw more than one 5%+ dip during the year (late 1980s and late 1990s). Most 5%+ dips usually stay under 10% and are quick. Of the 80 5%+ sell-offs since 1957, about 2/3rd were less than 10% with an average sell-off of 7% and duration of 27 trading days.\n\nThere were several multi-year periods without a 10%+ correction: Oct 57 – Jan 60, Jul 62 – Jan 66, Aug 84 – Jul 87, Nov 90 – Sep 97, and most recently Apr 03 – Sep 07 ...\n\n\"Gotta swing when you see it,\" Bianco said.\n\nThe S&P 500 was at 1,880 when he published this call.
