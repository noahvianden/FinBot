", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "even with a flat economy picking stock or focused (non index) funds you can still buy dips and sell highs. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You're right... so long as you're prepared for a choppy market and your ideas of what low and high are constantly evolving and accurate.  The problem is, these are both unlikely to be true. \n\nEven if the market stays mostly flat and in a trading range, there are plenty of features that will trip up traders. First, we may experience lower highs, or higher lows. Imagine, for example, a slightly downward-sloped channel. If you buy low, and attempt to sell \"high\" but we experience a lower high and your idea of \"high\" was off slightly, it will simply come down, and since the channel is downward-sloped, the new low will be lower than the previous, and though you thought you \"bought low\" you'll discover the market is now \"lower\"... and if the channel continues, will go lower still. \n\nSecond, in a sideways market, we can expect \"range expansion\".  This is where the market attempts to make new highs and new lows, expanding the trading range from between 2100 and 2000 (ES / SPY), to the wider range of 2100 to 1850. We saw an example of this a few months ago. Right Now, action is still in the top 40% of the wider range, and many market players may be lulled into thinking the range is still just 2000 to 2100, which would be false. If you're buying \"low\" at 2000 thinking its the bottom of the range, you're wrong... it's the middle of the range. The bottom is 1850, and if another bout of range expansion occurs, could be even lower. \n\nAs for \"selling high\" during range expansion, it's worth noting that range expansion usually occurs after a protracted mini-trend of opposite signals. For example, after a small channel down convinces enough people that the trend is down, the market may range-expand to the upside. People will think they are \"selling high\" by selling at the top of this new channel... but the channel has progressed so far that the top of this channel is in fact now center-range.  If you think the channel is the definition of high vs low (ie top of channel is high, bottom of channel is low), then you'd be wrong as the market suddenly and all at once seems to disregard the channel you've been following. You sold at the top of the channel, but you were also at a significant support, and the market decided the support was stronger. You thought you sold high, but you sold low.  By overshooting existing highs, the market will trap more shorts covering and more longs hopeful of getting in at the start of the trend. Of course, those short-covering or getting long late in the action are in fact 'buying high\" when they should be selling high. \n\nWhy are they buying high, though? How did that happen?  Because they thought they were selling high when they sold at 2070 (perhaps expecting this to be the top of the downward-sloped channel), and the range expansion broke to new highs, and they realize that their idea of \"high\" was a bit outdated, or, oddly enough, a bit too \"fresh\", since you forgot the true high of the range and started trusting the newer weaker signals. Then they sell on what they see as the \"breakout\" of the previous 2100 high range to 2130 or something, and only when it comes back down do they realize that while they thought they \"sold high\" and \"had to cover higher\", what htey actually did was sold low and bought high. When it drops back down to center range, they'll realize the folly. \n\nSo yeah... buying dips and selling highs can work in a sideways market. Good luck keeping an accurate and up-to-date image of what high and low mean though. It's more work than you'd think.
