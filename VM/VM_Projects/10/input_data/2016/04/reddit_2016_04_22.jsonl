She basically wondered why, while some of us carefully shop for sustainable products, we don't pay more attention to invest in companies that matter/ are sustainable to the world. She proceeded by showing a nice little chart based on a Harvard study on how 1$ invested in sustainable stocks in 1994 would have double the return today, supporting her argument that sustainable investments does pay off. (https://www.ted.com/talks/audrey_choi_how_to_make_a_profit_while_making_a_difference#t-452881)\n\nRegardless, having some money on the side, I was getting interested in investing only in companies that stand for a better world. Issue is...beside Tesla and a couple of others I don't know of any and these stocks & the info seems hard to find. Any advice on where to find a ranking of the US stock market ranked by \"good for the world\"? thanks!\n\nClarification: The research claims sustainable stocks grew 2x more compared to non sustainable stocks.
