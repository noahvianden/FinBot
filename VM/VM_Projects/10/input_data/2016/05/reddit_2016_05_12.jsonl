{"title": "What do you guys do to get short deltas?", "selftext": "I have a small account of $3,000 and am trying to find ways to decrease my deltas. I'm bearish on the market, but my beta-weighted deltas are about 30, largely due to long positions in AAPL and DIS. When I try to find stuff to do to decrease my deltas, I can't find anything. I like to look for an underlying with high volatility, to sell premium, but besides SLV and Gold related products (GLD, GDX), I can only find stocks that are at or near 52-week lows. As a contrarian, that would only add more long deltas. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nOn a side note, anyone have any advice for a beginning trader? I've been trading for a week and am already down around $200 -- it seems all of my positions have moved against me as soon as I put them on (for what it matters, I've stuck to verticals with one calendar spread in FB). For example, I sold the 92.5/90 put spread in June in AAPL, then today it drops $2. Also sold a put spread in GPS and then overnight it drops 10% and I'm out $120 the next day. These are all high probability trades (70%+) upon entry that seem to instantly go against me.

That is huge, considering the market overall is about unchanged. Maybe look at cutting some positions. The account is likely too small to be opening yet more positions to hedge what you have. And any hedge might turn sour, things that are uncorrelated today, might move together tomorrow.\n\nIt also appears that you had some bad luck. Are you sure that you were at 70% probability? What price was AAPL when you sold the 92.5/90 put spread? Off the top of my head, my guesstimate is that the price had to be like 96 or higher when you sold, to get the probability to 70%. If it were like 93 or less, your probability was closer to 60%, maybe even 50% depending on the costs.\n\nDid GPS have earnings? If yes, you learned the crap shoot nature of earnings reports. Just because IV rank is high, doesn't mean the trade is high probability, if there is news pending. Earnings, and sometimes same store sales reports for retailers can be a crap shoot.\n\nKeep a record of your trades. Try and learn from the mistakes. If it is just luck, luck will turn.

To me the leading indicator is interest rates because when rates go up bonds go up and equities go down because the cost to borrow goes up. Right now Central Banks world wide are keeping interest rates low by buying up treasuries, mortgages, corporate bonds and even corporate stocks (Eg. Bank of Japan owns 10%+ of 90% of their equity markets.) By servicing the bond market with that much liquidity, it allows business and govts to not have to offer a higher yield at bonds maturity thereby artificially lowering the attractiveness of bonds and increasing the attraction of equities which leads to wreck-less speculation/derivatives because who wants 1% return from a bond when equities WERE returning 15%+ year over year for twenty some odd years excluding a few years between.
