Sometimes other people will build better lemonade stands or other products instead of lemonade, or maybe lemonade doesnt exist in 5-10 years. For a lot of businesses there has to be someone to supply the product, and if a new product makes this one irrelevant, someone must supply the new product.  \n  \nGenerally, theres always ways to make more money next year than this year, and if not, other businesses will take the revenue, or a new product will take the revenue. To see negative returns in 40-50 years you must assume that the world is earning less revenue, or people are willing to pay less of a premium to own that revenue (PE ratios and such); the first option i cant see because of compounding interest and time/inflation, but i can see people paying less of a premium (especially when the S&P500 PE is higher than average). Over a 40-50 year time frame though, id rather side with history, specifically the S&P500 and predict 6-10% average annual returns.     \n  \nIts 3:20am but im pretty sure I can stand behind this post.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": ">How do we know that long term investing will generate a positive return?\n\nWe don't. We don't *know* anything about the future. But we can make assumptions...\n\n>Why do we a assume that with a time horizon of 40-50 years we will see positive returns? Can't it just as easily turn out that the stock market in general takes a loss over the next bunch of decades?\n\nIt's not a 50/50 proposition. Historically, I believe the stock market has gone up something like 2/3rds of the time and gone down 1/3rd of the time on a yearly basis (don't quote me on that). So that's why in the long run, we've seen such fantastic results. The overall trend has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\n>Is there any theoretical basis for believing that over decades and decades, investing will outpace inflation?\n\nThere's a historical basis for it. This chart only goes back till 1994, so it isn't the best, but it's what I have readily available, so it's good enough.\n\nhttp://realpricecharts.com/\n\nThe green line shows the nominal price, meaning the price includes the effects of inflation. The blue line shows the real price, meaning the nominal price - inflation. \n\nSo as you can see, nearly half of the SP500's returns have been due to inflation over the last couple decades. Not a very comforting thought perhaps, but it still shows that the stock market can outpace inflation, if at least over that sample size.\n\nAs for a theoretical basis for why it will continue: because the system works. Everyday, millions of Americans go to work each day and build a better tomorrow. Every single day. You have scientists inventing new drugs to help treat diseases. Programmers writing software that makes our lives easier. Teachers teaching our children more and more advanced concepts at younger and younger ages. The list goes on.\n\nThink about it this way, even if real GDP growth (remember, that means corrected for inflation) is only 2% going forward. A lousy 2%. Well over a generation, ie 20 years, that still nearly a 50% improvement. Meaning our country's GDP will be 50% higher, in real terms, in 20 years. \n\nNow the stock market actually tends to increase more than GDP, I believe. I dont have time to double check my numbers, which is typically a good idea, but the general principal is that the stock market has returned something like 6-10% depending on your time frame, while nominal GDP has been closer to 6%, and more recently probably a little lower, say in the 4-6% range.\n\nWhy does the stock market outpace GDP? Well, it's due to multiple appreciation I would have to imagine. \n\nHere's a blog post I wrote a while aog that looks at PE appreciation.\n\nIs the Stock Market Overpriced at a 20 PE?\n\nP/E - Historically, the SP 500's PE has been around 14-15. \n\nhttp://www.multpl.com/\n\nBullshit!\n\nI actually believed this garbage until I started digging into the numbers myself.  Using the numbers from here:\n\nhttp://www.multpl.com/table\n\nI've discovered that PE's have been increasing for a loooong time. This average of 15 no longer exists.\n\nIm too lazy to make a table, but here's the info:\n\nPE  Average starting in Year\n\n23.91 1990\n\n20.48 1980\n\n18.82 1970\n\n18.68 1960\n\n17.59 1950\n\n16.81 1940\n\n16.79 1930\n\n16.38 1920\n\n15.89 1910\n\nNow can be misleading because they can get thrown off by outliers. So instead lets look at the median. According to http://www.multpl.com/ the median is about 14.5.\n\nPE Median Starting in Year\n\n20.35 1990\n\n18.08 1980\n\n17.68 1970\n\n17.76 1960\n\n17.24 1950\n\n15.56 1940\n\n16.28 1930\n\n15.43 1920\n\n14.88 1910\n\nSo it seems strange to say, but it looks like a PE of 20 is the new normal. At least looking at the last 25 years. And despite such high multiples, the rate of return over that time frame has been 9.6%, which is inline with the the 9.9% rate of return since 1965. \n\nhttp://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\n\nI suppose the question may become why has PE been increasing? Is it a bubble? \n\nAre stocks more expensive? Perhaps.\n\nI would speculate that disposable income has grown considerably over the last 100 years, so people have more money to invest.\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well if you have a 2% dividend you'll eventually make a profit in 50 years if the business doesn't go under lol.
