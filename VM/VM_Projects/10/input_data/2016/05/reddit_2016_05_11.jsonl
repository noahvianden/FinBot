Now that's out of the way, let's talk about your novel idea. You're not the first to short the SPX \"cuz economy gonna crash soon\". Problem is, no one knows when it will. Getting long DTE and OTM puts on SPY/SPX is a viable strategy, but I'd go with a spread instead. \n\nSecondly, not sure why you are looking at SDS - fuck that. Look at the options chain for SPY:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/sLhLv\n\nYou can go for an OTM put that you want to pay for, or that you think will become ITM. I would most definitely go for a spread if you are going this out. You can also go for Jan 2017, that's enough time as well.

Secondly the further away to the money the cheaper your Put will be... You need to find some sort of equilibrium between what you're willing to pay. Also, unless the market rapidly declines, like, falls of a cliff, how much money are you thinking of making. You're more likely to lose the 1000$ you might invest than make 2000$ FYI. Last but not least, if the market doesn't head in the direction your expecting, your Put will be worthless and you will lose 100% of your \"investment\" and that could be really quick. \n\nYou could be smarter on this whole theory and use options to hedge positions... or you could short SPY, you would have less chances of losing your entire \"investment\".", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "YOLO a spy put weekly for end of this week and secure huge profits\n\nOne of us, one of us, one of us!!!

Therefore buying puts is a bullish play. Secondly, this ETF sucks. Focus on SPY. The reason it sucks is because the bid/ask spread is so wide so on a percentage  basis you are getting fucked when you buy, and again when you sale. Basically you are garuenteed to lose due to illquidity(terrible spread and volume). Lets look at the Jan 2018 18 strike. It has a 2.40 bid and a 3.00 ask this is about a 20 percent difference so at best you can buy it taking a 10 percent hit (if you get filled on the mid) but as options move away from the money they lose even more illquidity and you could take an even bigger hit when you are taking profits and you will have to pay up big if you want to close out to prevent a loss. So at a minimum, illquidity is costing you 25 percent. Plus you have broker fees. Therefore trading this ETF is worse than buying scratch offs. If you do something more liquid like the SPY you have a way higher chance of success. Also, I'd  suggest you learn about the option Greeks, mostly delta, theta, and Vega to help you understand your risks associated with a certain strike price or option date. Lastly, like others have said, you are trying to predict the future which is rarely profitable so you should consider hedging this trade by using a spread.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Someone just saw the big short for the first time.....", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sell calls and buy puts on the SPX , gl", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "fuck off", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Only problem with your theory is that many other people currently feel the same way, so puts are a bit expensive, and it's nearly impossible to time when the crash will happen.\n\nPlus, the fact that so many people are so bearish suggests to me that a 2008 or 2000 style crash may not actually happen.
