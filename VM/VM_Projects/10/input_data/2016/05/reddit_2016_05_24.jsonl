Usually I NEVER will do that, but I turned them into a pseudospread by selling some puts).\n\nRecap:\n\nFrom a record flat day to a massive rally... what a series of events. I can't lie and say this rally didn't knock me off my feet, but I'll thank my past self for grabbing vix and vxx puts as a hedge. I ended up covering short legs for my near DTE spreads, and added more spreads today and sold a few call spreads as well. Also ended up buying some ratio spreads to hedge myself. It was interesting to watch SPX battle the 2074-2076 channel, where it was stuck for a few hrs. It ended up breaking and getting denied at 2080, and now back to the 2076 level. After today's activity, there is a gap to fill at 2048 (also one at 2040, if I believe from a few days ago). \n\nLots of catalysts tomorrow to watch out for:\n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nNetflix was a money maker today. I'm pretty disappointing that I did not hold my calls (sold in less than 5 minutes), when I had a gut feeling it was going to explode today and it did. I did make good profit on it twice, 16 and 31% and I know some people here made over 50%. I have yet to go back and actually analyze how often NFLX rallies when opening up, and how often NFLX dies when opening down. I'd also have to factor in nasdaq futures into the hypothesis.\n\nI will be watching NFLX again tomorrow morning; my obvious guess is one of these days NFLX will be red (profit taking + overbought). Hoping we can all make bank off netflix in the first hr of market open.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nIt's definitely very important to be hedged and to play BOTH sides. Don't be an idiot like me and be biased to the short side. Good job bulls, you guys feasted today. Bears, hang in tight. It's gonna be a long night lol...\n\n \n\n", "id": "4kvwee", "created_utc": 1464122003.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Actually 450?
