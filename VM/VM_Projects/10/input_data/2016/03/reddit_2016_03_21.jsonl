{"title": "My post from /r/stocks the other night on SUNE", "selftext": "SUNE (SunEdison) has been a popular ticker discussion on r/stocks as a sort of novelty stock. Some may consider it to be unworthy of legitimate consideration due to its high volatility and arguably dubious management activity. In this post, I offer no counterpoints to those claims, however instead, I would like the members of this sub to help me consider a trade strategy that may limit risk while increasing potential reward. My idea is as follows and I make absolutely no claims about the integrity of the idea:\n\nThe idea: Buy shares of SUNE at current market prices (2500 shares, for example at $2.10-$2.15 = $5250-$5375). At the same time, buy 25-30 July $1 puts at ~$0.34 = ~ $850-$1020. Perhaps even buy more so that you are even more hedged.\n\nPros: If the company files for bankruptcy or some form of restructuring whereby the common shareholders are wiped out, the puts allow you to recover most of your losses or potentially profit. If the company reports decent results in their upcoming 10K, then the stock appreciates and the company is likely to survive, thus more than likely exposing the investor to substantial upside.\n\nCons: The stock may stay sideways for more than a few months, rendering the put options worthless if they are not sold sometime before expiry for a significant loss. Worse yet, the stock may stay sideways until the puts expire, and then the company may file for bankruptcy, thus resulting in a total loss of principal investment.\n\nFurther discussion: I think this is a decent strategy to consider because the company is being audited and has delayed releasing their latest financial results twice as of now. They also have pending litigation due to a failed merger with VSLR and an ongoing legal dispute with HECO that is expected to be resolved in the near term. It is speculated that they will have a liquidity crunch, forcing a bankruptcy. All of these factors, and perhaps a few others (such as past insiders raising red flags about the company's accounting practices) have caused the stock to depreciate by over 90% within the last 52 weeks. It is my contention that if they are to file for bankruptcy protection, it will happen before July 15th as they will have had to release their earnings well before then, and the audit committee should, in my opinion, have concluded their evaluation by then. Conversely, if the company is even in poor, but manageable shape, I believe the price per share will at least double, as the company is purported to have around 21b in assets and while debt may be around 17b (don't quote me on that figure), the book value of the company is still around 4b+. This means that the market cap is trading well below 20% of book value likely as a result of all of the aforementioned concerns (note that these figures may change materially when their 10k is released). Thus, if one is to make a fully hedged investment using put options for downside protection, it is my contention that now may be a good time to do so as the company appears to either be in its death throes or on the verge of some type of recovery.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any thoughts and critiques on this proposed trading idea. Please note that nothing mentioned in this post is meant to be considered trading advice in any way. It is merely a hypothetical trading strategy that I would like to discuss.    \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndisclosure: I have pubic lice.
