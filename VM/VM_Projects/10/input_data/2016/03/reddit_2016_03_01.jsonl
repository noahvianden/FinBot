These are companies/stocks built on a future narrative. You buy in hoping that future pans out and generally speaking it's safer to just pick up your winnings and get out once you turn an acceptable profit (exit strategy). Until TSLA makes money, it's a speculative stock based on Elon Musk and a great product. The companies you hold are based on current profits and business. Ford and Disney have been around for a very, very long time. They pay reliable dividends and have weathered many economic storms of varying severity. They aren't GPRO where they wow the world with a single, admittedly cool product, and then fade into oblivion. Cars will be here for a while, Disney will be a household name probably forever. If their share price doesn't produce an amazing return like Tesla, you can at least count on reliable dividends. If shit hits the fan you can expect their share price to drop with the market but it will bounce back.\n\nEdit: You bought at the top of the market, that's only the top until we break it in a few years. The US stock market trends upward and it has for decades and decades, if you believe that the trend will continue then you should hold your huge blue chip reliable companies because they ride the wave.
