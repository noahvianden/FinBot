I am very interested in the long term viability of lithium ion batteries, and their capacity for efficiency improvements that would eventually lead to many American homes being taken completely off of today's utility grids.\n\nOne of solar's primary weaknesses is its inability to handle load fluctuations (i.e. Energy can only be created during the day, with limited ability to store this energy). A large, remarkably-engineered battery could solve this issue.\n\nHowever energy efficiency improvements are limited by the pesky Laws of Thermodynamics, as opposed to the pseudo 'Moore's Law' that many Silicon Valley VCs are accustomed too.
