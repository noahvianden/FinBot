{"title": "Earnings Run-up Strategy [Day 2]", "selftext": "I never did a day 1 as I’ve been all over the place. The purpose of this post is just to document me playing the earnings run-up with simply buying and selling. No Options, No day trades.\n\n**Prestory**\n\nI was pretty much fed up with getting burned on earnings reports. It was way too much of a gamble with even companies tanking after beating top and bottom line. There were little patterns or correlations. Like others have noticed, there are a great deal of stocks that “runup” right before earnings, some an hour before, some a day before, some a week in advance. So my goal is to exploit this. I tried it first with First Solar and even though it swung -12% after its ER I was able to come out 5% and not be a bagholder.\n\n**Goal**\n\n* Beat the market (obviously)\n* 3% daily average gain\n\n**Method**\n\nI won’t go into too much detail with my stock picking method but they are all weighted on a scoring system I made, and from that system I pick the highest ones, buying them all 36 - 48hr in advance. I also take into account whether they're pre or post market hour ERs. When earnings day come around all stocks are sold at the peak of the run up expect those that I explicitly tagged, those are held past earnings. If I expect a volatile swing of 5%+ I sell off half right before earnings.\n\n**Fridays run up**\n\nI was already down last week but acting on this method on Thursday took me from -6% to -3.62% but this was my total portfolio not just this method. I didnt document well hence the reason why I never made a post but ill be conservative and say the method netted me 2%\n\n**Today’s run up and sells**\n\nSticker | run up % | Holding/held post earnings | AH | total profit\n---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------\nFN | 6% | Yes (no half/half)| 4%+ | 10%+ \nSID | 4% | No | -5% | <1% bought in at a high!\nSYY | 2.8% | No | -0.2% | 2.8%\n\nconsidering their weights my estimated percent so far for today is 4% not taking into account FN AH.\n\n**Tuesday run up or Earnings**\n\n* PlKl\n* TJX\n\n**Remaining Current run up Holdings (in no order)**\n\n* TGT\n* WMT\n* DE\n* FL (Holding past ER half/half)\n* CSIQ (Holding Past ER half/half)\n* JASO (Holding past ER half/half)\n* TECH\n* CSCO\n* AMAT\n* PLAB\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI havent done this long enough to see if this is viable but It looks promising. Friday was 2%, today was 4% and increasing. I need to see how this does on a down day for the market. A daily 3% gain doesn't seem like much when you see some biotechs going 10%+ after earnings or seeing a 3x etf open at 5%+, but if you get a constant 3% daily gain it compounds and will net you almost 16% a week. Meaning that an investment of $5000 will make you $800 a week if everything is weighted correctly. Going forward I hope to record data and transactions better (RH sucks), and improve on my scoring system. Also all of this is done manually but I hope to automate it someday hopefully by Q1 2017 earnings. I dont know anything much about CS but I'm a physics major and use python a lot I just dont know where to start.\n\n[some proof pics](https://www.imgur.com/a/3FsPk)", "id": "4xwp15", "created_utc": 1471306641.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Man, I'd kill for 3% a month.

{"title": "Saudi oil gainz (rant)", "selftext": "Something smells fishy and I don't know if crude oil should be going up or going down. My bet is that it will go down, HARD.\n\nSo the Saudi oil chief says something about [stabilizing the market](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-oil-algeria-idUSKCN10M1MQ) and suddenly oil rises 10% to a five week high. The US government had begun [increasing their oil surplus for the past 4 weeks](https://www.tradingfloor.com/calendar/us-eia-weekly-petroleum-status-report) so of course the price of oil should be going up... The Saudi oil king reduces production, the US Gov't reacts by quickly buying more oil... It sounds good, right? All is kosher.\n\nBut let's not forget [THIS FUCK](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-saudi-arabia.html?_r=0) is the one everyone is banking on. We're looking at Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih like he's fucking [Ned Stark](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/71011132.jpg) about to save the world when in reality he's just fucking oil Hitler. Reuters is full of shit.\n\nReuters can be quoted, \"Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest oil producer, pledged during the last OPEC meeting in June that the kingdom would not flood the market with oil.\" \n\nWhen in reality the June 2nd article said, \"While other OPEC members have been urging the freezing or lowering of oil production, Mr. Falih is pushing to keep it high and plow the money into other industries that might prove profitable for Saudi Arabia.\" Mr. Falih can be quoted saying, \"Certainly we will not go with certain price targets.” And the whole point of the article was, \"Don’t expect us to influence the price of crude oil by adjusting supplies.\"\n\nBut nevertheless Reuters quoted Khalid al-Falih saying, \"We are going to have a ministerial meeting of IEF in Algeria next month, and there is an opportunity for OPEC and major exporting non-OPEC ministers to meet and discuss the market situation, including any possible action that may be required to stabilize the market.\" \n\nGreat. We will wait until next month for them to talk it over. But in the meantime lets rejoice in our FUCKING MASSIVE OIL GAINZ. \n\nSeriously, what the fuck. Al-Falih is full of shit. Putin is full of shit. I'd fucking bet Putin is [working with al-Falih](http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Sustains-Rally-As-Russia-Returns-To-OPEC-Negotiating-Table.html) to set up the market. They're propping up the US market. S&P 500 and DOW are at all-time highs rallying behind oil. It's fucking awesome right? But let's face reality, the Saudi oil king [holds all the fucking cards](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/russia-sparks-oil-rally-but-saudis-still-hold-the-cards-2016-08-15). \n\nWill Khalid al-Falih reduce the production of oil, stabilize the market, bring massive gainz to the world, at a cost to Saudi Arabia? I doubt it. Maybe there are world regulations that this guy must surrender to, but the article [Reuters was quoting](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-saudi-arabia.html?_r=0) didn't make Khalid al-Falih sound like a reasonable guy.\n\nBut talk of [oil stabilization](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/energy/2016/04/09/Oil-prices-jump-on-signs-of-us-cutbacks-Doha-hopes.html) isn't new. It happened early April. And the market favored it. But unlike this time, we aren't in a bull market. Shit was in free fall before this \"market stabilization\" occurred, and will return to free fall once everyone wakes up to [THE FUCKING OIL GLUT](http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/stunning-map-oil-supply-glut-leads-to-massive-tanker-traffic-jam-would-stretch-for-25-miles_04142016) we have.
