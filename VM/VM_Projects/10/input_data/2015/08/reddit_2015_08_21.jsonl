The long-term uphill trend you note is natural because of inflation, growth, etc..\n\nBut that's just that, a \"trend\". Doesn't mean it will go up. The DOW at 16,000 in the year 2050 is possible. Likely? Probably not, but possible.\n\nAlso to note the media jumps on any dow number divisible by 1000. The DOW hitting 18,000 is nothing special in itself.

It doesn't have to. Your stock of $100 could go to $90, then up to $95, then down to $80, then up to $90, then down to $70. But then it could go from $70 to $140 in a year. Now your stock doubled from its low to its high, but your wealth only increased by 40%. I'd try not to calculate a base. Stocks don't follow rules.
