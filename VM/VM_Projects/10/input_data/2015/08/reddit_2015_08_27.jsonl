Backwardated futures have positive carry, and futures in contango have negative carry. \n\nUsually VIX futures are in contango, which is why the VXX ETF, which is based on a long position in VIX futures, generally bleeds money -- and why XIV, which is based on a short position in VIX futures, generally makes money.
