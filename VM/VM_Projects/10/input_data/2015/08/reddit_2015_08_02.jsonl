{"title": "Advice on Options", "selftext": "First time trading options, so please bare with me if I make any mistakes or misunderstandings.   I am bullish on TSLA going into earnings, but want to hedge my risk.  I think that either the stock will make slight gains or crash pretty hard.  I have used an options profit calculator and am thinking about buying 28th Aug 240 Call and 18th Dec 300 Put.   Does this strategy make sense?  Is there a way to reduce further risk?\n\nAlso, thinking of doing 28th Aug 175 Call for PANW as I am bullish on this stock as well.\n\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated.

Wouldn't this increase the risk if the stock rises higher?  I wanted to buy the option instead of selling because I thought there is less risk since their is no obligation to exercise the contract.  I'm going for a more conservative approach until I feel more comfortable with options.\n\nWould it make more sense to write 7th Aug 375 Call and 7th Aug 195 Put?  Both would be OTM and it seems would be predicting a more stable price over the next couple days.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "First time, I would be tempted to keep it very simple and just play the big downside with a straight put purchase. If the upside play is the higher probability there isn't as simple a play. I might sell a call vertical, say 10% otm for the lower strike and 10,15, or 20 wide to give a good margin for error and still get some premium.\n\nA trader can get fancy and do both, but for novices, there is a lot to be said for simple, especially for a first trade. If doing both, a person can position the strikes so the entire play is close to zero out of pocket. If TSLA goes up a little, it is break even. If TSLA goes down a lot, it makes a lot of money. If TSLA goes up a lot, the loss is contained by the upper strike call purchase. Just an idea. \n\nAgain, for novices, I suggest keeping things simple, and trading real small. Real small. There are a lot of other stocks to trade, a lot of other opportunities, where things don't have to be so complicated.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I do own a few shares of tesla, which is why I want to hedge the risk on the downside greater than going after the profits.

I don't think I can handle the risk in selling naked calls/puts at the moment.\nThis is what the calculator has [shown](http://opcalc.com/uvH6).

The max profit for a 5 wide is likely about $1 per unit. The calculator might show higher. However, the bid/ask spreads and commissions are likely to take out a big chunk. A trader is paying about $2 for each side of a long vertical, so about $4 debit. One of them is sure to lose. Max profit for any one side is $5 (-$4 means $1 max profit).\n\nGetting out can be problematic if the market becomes fast moving. The bid/ask spreads will widen, eating even more of the possible profit. To me, it seems like a lot of work for a max $1 per unit on a $250+ underlying, and that's if the trade works for you. \n\nWhy bother for $1 is my main question? Especially since that $1 might shrink to 70 cents or less after bid/ask and commissions. You are long premium, so decay is not in your favor. Yes, probability is high like 80% but that is about expected for a trade risking $4 to make $1.\n\nOne idea is to go wider to say 10 wide. There is more risk, lower probability, and need a $10 move, but at least you'll make more than $1 for all the fancy footwork.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}
