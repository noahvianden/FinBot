But how much truth is there to their arguments in general? It does seem like China could be a huge addition to their subscriber base, and they do plan to have a presence in almost 200 countries in about a year. Would it be worth it to buy soon in anticipation of the China expansion?  What about any bearish arguments? For example, the idea that Netflix has too much competition to remain on top, or that if a Netflix-exclusive show flops, they will lose tens of millions of dollars.

Stuff like that.\nThe stock market sells expectation and takes everything into account. Expectations are mostly based on actual results, guesses and speculation only matter on the short term. \n\nIn my opinion there's no such thing as \" overvaluation\". If the company keeps growing and showing us good numbers (profit, lower debt, etc.) there's no reason to predict a consistent price drop.
