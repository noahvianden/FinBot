So suppose you bought a TSLA call, assume the scenario that there was no TSLA puts on the marketmaker's book, he or she would immediately long the equivalent amount of TSLA stock to neutralize the delta of that TSLA call; and throughout the day, the marketmaker would constantly take other orders and the delta/gamma/vega of the risks and make corresponding trades on their books to the level of margin, vega and gamma risk they would tolerate. In the end, their goal is to make money on the bid/ask spread of the options and hope to lose as little as possible from directional risk of the stock. \n\nb) a knowledgeable volatility trader (either retail or institutional), their job is to make profit on the volatility skew of the option series. So suppose they suppose TSLA's implied volatility is too high, so they will execute a myriad of long vega/gamma or short vega/gamma pre-defined risk strategies (e.g., iron condor, butterflies, calendar spread) which one of the short strike of the spread will be cross with your buy TSLA call order. \n\nIf they are right about implied volatility, then you overpaid for your TSLA option regardless of direction. The money to pay you comes from the profit they generate from the other positions in their spread + whatever cash they need to make up the difference. \n\nc) a investor who is looking to hedge/generate income from his already owned TSLA options. Suppose they have a self-directed 401(k) acct where they can only sell covered calls; they are willing to sell you the TSLA options because they think the strike price is where they are happy to part their stocks at. So the money comes from the P&L of their already owned TSLA equity shares. \n\nd) a punter/daytrader who is speculating on TSLA. Although most likely punters would like to bet on direction, but there are also a class of punters who like to short straddles and collect \"nickels in front of steamrollers\". Suppose they trade naked, and TSLA goes up 50%, they are likely to get margin-called, and if they can't pay up, then their broker has to pay. ", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks much.

I'm going to do some more speculating and some back-of-the-spreadsheet calculations:\n\n\n* I'll be using December prices from [1] as an approximation of diesel cost over time (I'm assuming they are still using diesel). I should probably be using an average cost for each year, but prices look relatively flat.

I should really assume that this efficiency was gradually attained over time, and this is likely all wrong and overly simplistic.\n\n\nMy (likely wildly inaccurate: garbage in, garbage out...) math says WMT saved $51.8M on fuel costs in 2014 relative to 2013, and (again, assuming the low, low current diesel price was in effect all year) $69.7M on fuel costs this year relative to last year.
