{"title": "Historical Options Data, Help!", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nNew here, wanted to know if you could possibly help me out. I am in a Financial Derivatives class where we do reports on 4 corporations throughout the semester. My companies are AXP, MSFT, TM(on TSE), BCS(on LSE). I need to retrieve options data for pricing of puts and calls from 2 dates 5 years ago, 2 dates 3 years ago, 2 dates one year ago. Once I get the premiums I then need to price out ITM ATM OTM calls puts straddles strangles etc. and how they would have performed to date if we bought them at that time. \n\nMY PROBLEM: I can not seem to get a hold on the options data from 5 years ago, 3 years ago, etc. I don't want to pay for them but I am seemingly having no other choices... can anyone help me get this data?\n\nThanks a lot!

You can enter the trades you want to price historically in the Trade Analyzer and it will show you how much they would have cost to put on daily going back to 2009.

Go to the Trade Analyzer here [https://www.getvolatility.com/trade/equity/useq.msft/](https://www.getvolatility.com/trade/equity/useq.msft/) and enter the first option you want to backtest. By default it will have a 3 month expiry ATM call in the portfolio. The second chart on the page shows its price historically. It currently costs about 5% of underlying whereas in 2009 it was north of 10%. You can hover over the chart to extract exact dates. If you need prices in $, just multiply the price % by MSFT price on that day.\n\nYou can change the portfolio to anything you want and run the same analysis (e.g. straddles, different maturities, etc.)\n\nHope this helps!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Certainly helped alot, not my last question is how would I get data for Toyota and Barclays, as they are not on here?
