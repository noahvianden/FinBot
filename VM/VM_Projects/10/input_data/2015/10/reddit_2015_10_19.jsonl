If the calls are exercised then they take your stock and give you the money equivalent to the exercise price.  So it limits your profit if the stock goes up, but if it doesn't go up high enough to exercise the calls then you make extra money from the premiums.\n\nCovered puts are the opposite, you short the stock and write a put that has a lower exercise price.  This limits your downside since they're selling you the stock when they exercise the put options.  \n\nSo if you sell $5 covered puts when a stock is at $6, and then it drops to $4 - someone will exercise the puts and sell you the stock at $5.  This saves you $1 and also makes them $1 since they're buying at $4 and selling to you at $5.  So you still have $1 downside on your covered puts, but that's the max you're going to lose basically.

For the past 3 years I've had roughly 95% of all my money in stocks. I've been lucky thus far, but I figured I should start writing calls or puts, thats why I'm asking. \n\nGoing with the \"0 Level\" for now.. and I'm going to research some stocks that pay the highest premium. I'm considering writing some calls for SBUX, Apple, LL, PG, and SCTY. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vCu6YrN.jpg\n\nOne last question, November 13th calls for PG, strike price $69.50 with a bid of $4.85. \n\n- Would I be selling a covered call and getting a $485 premium? \n- On Nov 13th, if the price is above the strike price but a few cents, would the contract automatically be executed, or does someone actually have to manually execute it? ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Premium will change depending upon events - pick solid companies, not just exciting premiums. \n\nExample - Buy CVX last November - sell covered calls.. then watch the oh-shit off a cliff... covered calls not saving you there!  Playing volatility is a completely different topic - and it's quite advanced, so you may wanna avoid that and stick to what you know ;)\n\nFor PG - bid 4.85... they wanna buy for $485.... so that's a healthy premium - likely earnings built in there.  Earnings announcements always drive up volatility - so as a call seller - you can whip up quite a bit there.\n\nIn terms of puts - I'd suggest only doing covered puts... meaning you have cash on hand to purchase shares... otherwise it's quite possible to make a humongous mess of your account by selling call/puts/spreads - without understanding all the implications.\n\nIn terms of execution - I use interactive brokers - 1 cent in, and it's automatically executed.  so if it's 50.01 and you sold 50 calls - bye bye! which is no big deal, because that's the maximum outcome of the situation.  With interactive brokers, if you're long calls - you can instruct them to not exercise - but the short side is not voluntary.\n\nNow - if you wanna get crazy with your covered calls, you can always do some fun shit... I did this, earlier today:\n\n* XOP - 300 shares ~38.00 avg\n* Sold 3 37's (covered) @ $1.48 - this week's expiration\n* Bough 15 39 Calls @ $0.39...  this week's expiration\n\nSpent ~170 or so... but if we get a pop in oil above 39... $$ will flow.  Study option Delta - and the rest of the greeks to understand what's happening.  For this example:\n\n* Under 39 - lost $150 on the options play,  break even @ 38.50\n* 3 covered calls = -235 delta\n* 15 long calls = 450 delta\n* 300 shares = 300 delta\n* net delta  =  515\n\nI've amplified my position by 70% - with only a $150 downside... pretty sweet deal using covered calls - completely safe - unless those 15 come into the money and you don't close them out before expiration, lol\n\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well I appreciate all the help, you've explained things a lot more than anyone else has... \n\nI'm actually getting my MBA in financial management right now... in my first year we haven't gone over all this stuff, but it's a fun hobby.
