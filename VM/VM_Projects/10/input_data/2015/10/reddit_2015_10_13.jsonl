When investors buy and sell options, the positions they take—either puts or calls—the prices they are willing to pay, and the strike prices they choose, all reflect how much and how quickly they think the underlying index level will move. In fact, that’s what volatility is: the pace and amount of change. VIX uses options prices rather than stock prices in its calculation because options prices reflect the volatility buyers and sellers expect. That’s what implied in implied volatility means.\n\nThe options used to calculate VIX are put and call options on the S&P 500. Because the index represents approximately 80% of the total market value of U.S. equities and benefits from one of the most liquid markets in the world, using S&P 500 options ensures that VIX represents a broad—and current—view on volatility. What’s more, VIX uses a specific combination of options that is designed to balance out all the other factors that generally affect option prices, resulting in an index that parallels volatility expectations alone.\n\nThe VIX time frame is significant. VIX anticipates moves in the S&P 500 specifically over the next 30 days.
