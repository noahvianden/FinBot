{"title": "premium selling v. premium buying 51/49", "selftext": "I've seen some advice recently concerning premium selling v. premium buying. It is an important enough topic that it deserves a separate thread. \n\nWhen the ThinkorSwim guys give seminars they often get this question, which is better? Their answer is that over the long term, the odds are slightly in favor of premium selling, but it is slight, maybe 51/49.\n\nI am an old timer, so I would tend to agree with this. I've seen plenty of successful traders that sometimes buy premium. Please keep in mind that the last six years of mostly calm up markets and declining volatility have skewed heavily in favor of premium sellers. Don't mistake a bull market for a permanent condition. The demon-dog of volatility will return at some point and premium buyers may have several years where they tend to have the upper hand.\n\nWhat I always tell novices is that there are a thousand ways to make money in the markets. What is most important it to find a trading style that fits your personality. For some that might be selling options for premium, or selling spreads for credit. For some others, that style might be a poor choice because it doesn't fit their personality.\n\nPersonally, I tend to be mostly a premium seller. My cautious trading style fits my personality. But again, the last six years have favored premium selling. While I am an old timer in the markets, I have become a much more active trader during these last six years. If and when the market flips, I hope to be flexible enough that I can occasionally cross over to the other side.", "id": "2tf8gy", "created_utc": 1422034909.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Buying premium is the player's hand.

The idea being that when IV is high relative to itself it has a better chance of being higher than future volatility.\n\nWhat method do you use to estimate IV compared to future volatility?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My interpretation of IV Rank is that it's comparing current IV to past values of IV. It doesn't track anything about realized volatility. I think you're right that if you sell IV whenever it's high, you have a better chance of selling something that's higher than future volatility. But realized vol never comes into the equation for IV rank. I just think it's an important distinction, and the connection between HV and IV is one that some people miss, and so they might miss out or give up edge on trades. \n\n\nI had a back-and-forth with someone on this sub a few weeks back, he said that even if a stock traded for 3 years, at a consistent 30% volatility, and options are *just opening up*, we would have *no idea* what range implied volatility should trade at. 30%, 90%, 120%, we don't know. One thing that tastytrade doesn't teach (and based on some videos, I'm not sure they're aware of this) is that you can buy an underpriced option, delta hedge every day, and your P&L is driven by realized volatility. This is the thing that anchors IV to any realistic assumption, and it's a huge part of options trading. But I think too many people miss it. \n\n\n\nMaybe you can answer a question I've been having -- is there *one* IV rank per stock? I mean, different options trade at different vols, so I'm also wondering how they take into account skew. And what about expiries? IV trades at different levels for 30day vs 120day. \n\n\nPersonally, I'll definitely look at past IV; historical extrapolated IV for 25 delta put or call, 50 delta ATMs, averaged to 30 days, 60, or 120. But it's just part of the equation. I'm also looking at the spread between a 30-day IV value and a 22 HV. Cool thing is, the spread tends to be mean reverting too, but the behavior is usually different for different underlyings.\n\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There is one IVR for each underlying\n\nThey take a percentile of current IV to historical IV.

Comparing it to the last year/90 days etc..\n\nI found it helpful because it let me know more about the IV for underlyings I didn't follow much.  For instance, SCTY has an IV of 49% and an IVR percentile of 13%.  So although 49% is high IV compared to other underlyings it isn't particularly high for SCTY.\n\nI watch a lot of the tastytrade/dough content, but I'd be interested in hearing more about your strategies.
