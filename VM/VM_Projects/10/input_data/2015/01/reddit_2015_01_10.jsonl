I think this won't be shown for another 6 months with the oil companies and we hopefully won't see it but problems with the rest of the world won't take 6 months. Every time there is a good week with no news the market will drive up and people will buy the dips of the bad oil news or political turmoil. Then an offshore drilling company that was once worth 30 billion might go bankrupt because they need $70 a barrel to stay profitable and then a lot of indexes lose that 30 billion and the selling continues. I predict every time you see one of these dips from the energies companies going bankrupt, North Korea tests some missiles, Russia threatens war against the west for destroying their economy, ISIL blows up some people in Western Countries, and etc people will buy the dip because the US economy is wonderful. This will create a very volatile market that might see 5% gains in one week then 5% down the next all to end up with the S&P barely positive for the year.

I've been trading and investing for about ten years.  I mostly lost for the first five years, broke even for the following two, and have enjoyed significantly more success in the last three.\n\nI use a combination of fundamental analysis (though not in the traditional sense of the word), chart reading (though I wouldn't call it technical analysis...I mostly use Google Finance), and gut feel.  \n\nI subscribe to a trend-following-like model of risk control.  I make small bets with relatively tight stops and get stopped out frequently.  When I'm right, I usually let the trade run for months or even years, and make significantly more in one trade than I lost in all the others.\n\nMy losing bets are too numerous to count, though usually unremarkable because they're small.  Some of my biggest winning bets in the past few years have been long TSLA, long Bitcoin, long BLD calls, and short USO.\n\nI'm up roughly 500% for the past 3 years (combined).  I've been increasing my position size recently due to more consistent success and a larger account size.\n\nSome of my current bets:\n\nLong TLT calls, long GLD puts, long Bitcoin (with the occasional short trade), long SJCX (Storjcoin cryptocurrency), long Ripple (cryptocurrency), long XCP (Counterparty cryptocurrency), long Stellar (cryptocurrency).
