You sell options when you are reasonably confident the price of the stock will not skyrocket, or that the stock will stay stagnant / decline. The options will expire *out of the money* in September, and you can keep the $1 premium per option sold.\n\nIt is strongly advised to cover your calls when you're selling - which means you already own the requisite amount of underlying stock to \"sell\" if someone exercises the call. \n\nBy selling calls, it's akin to earning rental on your stocks. By buying puts, it's akin to buying insurance on your stock's value.\n\n\nPuts are everything I said, but the COMPLETE OPPOSITE. Buying a put gives you the right to sell the stock at a certain strike price - you buy them when bearish about the underlying stock.\n\nOptions give you a great amount of flexibility and well, *options*.
