{"title": "Why I think GoPro could be the next Apple of our generation.", "selftext": "Okay, so maybe not the next Apple! But definitely a bullish company that will make investors extremely happy within the next 10 years. Here are my reasons:\n\nBack when Apple came out with iPods, I remember everyone wanting one because they were essentially the BEST music MP3 player you could get at the time. It was also very slick and stylish. That was pretty much one of the top 3 hottest holiday items to purchase around that time.\n\nI see the same for GoPro cameras. While there are competitors out there with similar cameras (even at cheaper prices), GoPro definitely makes the best quality camera with the biggest brand name out there. They have that Apple'ish prestige to them within their industry.\n\nGoPro just made a new smaller camera. Again, essentially the same product, just smaller. They are taking a page out of Apple's playbook. \"Here is the new iPod, but smaller....new colors...accessories...etc.\" GoPro makes accessories, etc.\n\nRemember when Apple released their iPhone. How revolutionary it was. Could we see something from GoPro with drones in the future to come? I think so. There are drones that will follow you via GPS (for snowboarders, surfers, dirtbike riders, etc). I think they will make an awesome GoPro camera + Drone combo (similar to the iPhone and all it's other products syncing together).\n\nNow GoPro claims they are content company. Could we see them creating their own digital platform in the future where people will share their videos? Social Media for videos? I have something in mind but it's really hard to explain. When you go to YouTube you see a bunch of GoPro videos. Perhaps they eliminate YouTube and create an app like vimeo/snapchat where you can see all the GoPro videos you can simply upload?\n\nThey are getting into Virtual Reality. VR headsets are supposedly one of the hottest items this holiday season. So they are getting into drones and VR?\n\nI can totally see myself buying someones video of them skydiving somewhere for my VR headset for $1 of an iTunes'ish GoPro store?\n\nAnyone else share these same thoughts or concerns?

They can make a lot of one product right now and sell the shit out of it.  Not sure how many drones they could be selling of one type to make it worth it to them.\n\nPeople keep saying VR is going to be huge this season.  I want it to be.  I am not sold on it being a huge hit right out of the gate with lack of content and people still getting sick.  Oh it will be huge long term but immediately I am not sold.  Still possible.\n\n\nI don't think you can compare the two comapnies right now.  One is a software/hardware company that had a history of product development which they used to take over a huge market of music players and phones.
