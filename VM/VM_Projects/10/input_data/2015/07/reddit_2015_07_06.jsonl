Intel's market segmentation is based largely on the assumption that every need (I/O, caches, memory bandwidth, memory capacity) is proportional to processing power.\n\n\n\n>The ARM based challengers have the potential to serve those \"odd\" but relatively large markets better.

The X-Gene 2 \"ShadowCat\" is already up and running, so we have high hopes.\n\n\n\n>Broadcom seems to have a similar approach.
