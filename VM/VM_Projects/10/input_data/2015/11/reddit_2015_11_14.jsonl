{"title": "Highway Funding Bill", "selftext": "In one of my classes we had the CEO of a major shipping company talk to us. He talked about this new highway funding bill which had a few concerns regarding the shipping industry. If the bill remains unchanged it will require all shipping companies to audit their drivers. 60% of all US shipping is by small companies, as small as simply a guy in a pickup truck to a small business with 100 trucks. \n\nThis will really hurt that 60%. Now what does this mean? Large shipping companies will have dramatic power to raise prices as they have the capital to pay for this audit no problem. \n\nThe last bill to affect shipping was one where they require drivers to only be able to drive at night 5 days a week vs 6 or 7 they were before. They estimated the loss in shipping productivity to be 1-2%. It ended up being 5%. \n\nThe government estimates this new bill to influence shipping by 5%. The CEO said it will more likely be up to 15%. \n\nLarge shipping companies are going to start dominating. I'm going long UPS and Fedex. \n\nTLDR: new highway funding bill will crush 60% of shipping if it remains unchanged. Large companies will profit immensely.
