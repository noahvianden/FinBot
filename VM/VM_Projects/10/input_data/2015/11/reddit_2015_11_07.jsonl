{"title": "$NVDA DD: The future of GPU", "selftext": "Ticker: NASDAQ: NVDA\n\nIntroduction:\t\nLong term investment \nStock price as of 11/6/2015: $31.55\nPE Ratio: 33.55\nMarket Cap 14.94B\nDividend Yield: 0.39 (1.24%)\n\nAbout the company:\n\n\tNVIDIA is a tech company known for inventing the GPU (graphics processing unit) which NVIDIA explains is the “soul” of the PC. The GPU is dedicated to the graphics of the computer while the CPU (central processing unit) is dedicated to more of everyday computing. NVIDIA targets 4 very large markets which include gaming, graphics, datacenters, and even automobiles. The company focuses on the visual computing for these markets and seems to be pretty good at it.\n\n\nNotable products:\n\n-The GeForce is NVIDIA’s gaming processor which is the backbone of the PC gaming market. This product helps video games run optimally on each PC the GeForce supports.\n-NVIDIA GameWorks is a gaming program that helps video games look more realistic.\n-NVIDIA SHIELD competes with products such as Apple TV and Fire TV which is a very competitive field. The SHIELD however seems to have a lot better performance than any TV entertainment device of its kind.\n-NVIDIA GRID is a cloud gaming software run in the SHIELD and other devices. The software basically holds all of your games in the cloud. This can be compared to Steam which also holds games.\n-Tesla GPUs are used in combination with CPUs to process larger amounts of data for scientific research.\n-NVIDIA DRIVE PX is the processor for all of the graphics and data you find in cars.\n\nRecent news:\n\nNovember 5th, 2016\nNVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Third Quarter Fiscal 2016\n•\tRecord revenue of $1.305 billion, up 7 percent from a year ago, up 13 percent sequentially\n•\tGAAP operating income of $245 million, up 15 percent from a year ago\n•\tQuarterly cash dividend raised 18 percent to $0.115 per share. Company to return $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017\n\n\nSeptember 29th, 2016\nNVIDIA GPUs to Accelerate Microsoft Azure\nMicrosoft will offer NVIDIA® GPU-enabled professional graphics applications and accelerated computing capabilities to customers worldwide through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.\nSeptember 30th, 2016\nNVDA reaches Highest since 2011 on Microsoft deal \n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\nNot very much news lately\n\nFinancials:\n\nWorth 14.94 billion\nEPS .94\nAnnual Gross Profits\n(In thousands)\n2013- $2,226,343\n2014- $2,267,763\n2015- $2,599,477\n\nAnnual Net Income (Takes out operating expenses, interest, taxes, etc.)\n\n(In thousands)\n2013- $562,536\n2014- $439,990\n2015- $630,587\n\nNVDA hasn’t been growing exponentially in income. But, the profits have been on the rise year after year. The only knowledgeable conclusion I can come to is NVIDIA is spending a lot more on operating expenses and expanding research in new products and technology. More spending is better than less spending when it comes to growth.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nI would recommend purchasing NVDA as soon as possible. NVIDIA is a long term and small risk investment due an increase in spending and recently landing a major deal with Microsoft. Profits are on the rise and the company has no debts. The gaming industry will always be in the entertainment market and NVIDIA powers the PC and cloud gaming markets. NVIDIA is the leading company in the automobile industry in terms of GPUs for cars. Adding the NVIDIA DRIVE PX programs to the next generation of cars could lead to a major revenue increase as well in the near future. The company also increased its dividend by 18% which shows huge growth and confidence for the company in the future to come. \n", "id": "3ruukr", "created_utc": 1446872501.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "GFY -- AMD for life.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Lord give us our Radeons until the hour of Zen.
