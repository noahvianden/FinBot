{"title": "GOOG is History's Most Complicated Tulip Bubble.", "selftext": "There are two ways for a share to derive end user utility.  Through dividends and through being owned in a large enough quantity to actually affect ownership of the company.  Well what about non-voting GOOG Class - C shares?  You could own all the Class - C shares you want, and you'd still never own the company.  So that leaves dividends.  But GOOG doesn't pay a dividend.  But in the future it might.\n\nBut, for argument's sake, let's say that GOOG will never pay a dividend.  Or if that is too far fetched, then let's say Google releases a new Class - D share.  A, B, and C will pay a dividend, but D's are absolutely, 100%, set in stone, never going to pay a dividend.\n\nAre Class - D shares worth anything?\n\nWell of course.  But how?  They don't have any end user utility.  \n\nWelcome to modern finance.  Either does a dollar bill.  There's a great scene in the Walking Dead where Daryl comes across a large bundle of money in a country club.  He takes the money and burns it.  Not only did the scene serve as a great character moment where we learn how resentful Daryl is for growing up in poverty, but it's also a wonderful social commentary.  With society collapsed, the only purpose money serves is to be burned.  Which is ironic.  Because money always burned.  It didn't have to be harvested, and inked, and printed out, and distributed thru a monetary policy by a central bank, to be traded back and forth for decades in various economic systems.  It could have just as easily been burnt as wood or crop.  Ash to ash.  Dust to dust.  But I digress.\n\nMoney's only value is fiduciary.  It's worth something because you can trade it for something else, and that something else will provide you with end utility.  Like a blow job or whatever.\n\nSo what does this have to do with stocks?  Well, stocks are essentially private currencies.  Just like money is backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, stocks are backed by the full faith of the corporation.  And just like the US government, corporations can inflate or deflate the supply.  And a currency's purchasing power is determined by the strength of it's underlying economy.  In case of a business, the underlying economics of the business. \n \nBut the analogy does have limits.  A dollar can buy part of the economy by which it is backed.  But the Class - C can never do that.  Not that people seem to care.  There's a $2 difference between Class - A and Class - C shares.  Which is fitting, because they all essentially have zero voting rights because the founders own the Class - B shares. \n\nThe Class - C's only value is that some day, Google may offer a dividend.  (And Class - A has the additional value that some day, the founders will give up their 56% voting stake, and Class - A's one vote will matter again.)\n\nBut I doubt anyone is actually valuing Class - A and Class - C shares based on future dividend and ownership possibilities.  They're being traded on the greater fool theory.  That they can sell it for more than they paid for it.  And I doubt that Class - D shares would trail Class - C shares by any meaningful amount.\n\nSo it's kind of funny.  Centuries after the tulip bubble, we're up to the same old tricks.  Except this time we're not even trading something as tangible as a tulip.  We're trading numbers that exist in electricity and magnetism.  Mankind's evolution is astounding.\n \n", "id": "2x2uaw", "created_utc": 1424839341.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "This rant gets class A for effort", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you're buying Google Class C shares, you're buying a contract to potential profits.

But you'd have to trust the Board of Directors to go through with buying back shares. That's one of the reasons why BRK.A was so absurdly huge in price.
