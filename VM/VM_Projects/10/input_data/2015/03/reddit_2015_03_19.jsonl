{"title": "Buying strangles before earnings volatility?", "selftext": "**IGNORE EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE EDIT**\n\nI'm curious as to whether this is a viable strategy or not.\n\nSay I purchase $105 calls and $95 puts with an underlying of $100 with a volatility of 30 two weeks to expiry and one week before earnings. The options should be worth $.73 and $.58, respectively. Now, let's assume the underlying has consistent IV increases approximately a week before earnings (think BBBY, NFLX, AMZN, INTC, etc). Let's also assume that the volatility for the underlying increases from 30 to 60 the day before earnings (8 days to expiry), which leaves the options' values at $1.72 for the call and $1.51 for the put. At this point I would sell to avoid the IV crush the following day and enjoy my profit of 147%.\n\nThe purpose of the strangle in this case would be to hedge in case of price movements in the underlying before the earnings announcement. For example, if the aforementioned underlying increased to $103 with the same conditions, the calls would be worth $2.84 while the puts would be worth $.86, which would increase my profit to 182%.\n\nAre there any factors, other than commissions, that I should consider? Will the theta eat into the options prices significantly? (this is something I tried to reduce by setting the expiry to at least a week after earnings) Should I buy closer to the money or go crazy and buy way OTM? (within liquidity's reason) I'm trying to find any flaws in the strategy that way I can modify accordingly. \n\n**EDIT**: I found faults in the strategy. It turns out the site I was using for IV data has extremely inflated data which really messed up my research (looking at data on two different trading platforms corroborated that IV is indeed much lower at most times). Good thing is most, but not all, stocks experience a deflation in IV shortly after earnings, so I'll just take up some short-term credit spreads or iron condors and let the options I sell expire worthless. In the case of the latter, I don't have to wait for a week or more at a time to test out strategies.\n\n", "id": "2zmpd4", "created_utc": 1426800744.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": ">I'm trying to find any flaws in the strategy that way I can modify accordingly.\n\nIV probably won't double in a week.

While it does not take in to account all possible factors, I have found it to be pretty entertaining to test out ideas\nFor example, I have done something very similar to what you have described (bought slightly ITM, slightly OTM, one ITM and one OTM etc). \nWhat I have found is that the only way to generate profits in doing this type of strategy is for the underlying to have a huge swing (i.e. Amazon and Priceline the past few months). Most of the time, what happens (in my case at least) the stock does not move enough and my profit at most (if any) is on the order of 25% and more likely I am taking small loses as any profit in one order is cancelled out by profits on the other.\n\nLooking at your example, two things that strike me are\n1) for the companies you indicate, the options prices I have seen tend to be considerably more (2-4x or more at a minimum) Priceline was $30. Unless you plan on going way out of the money, which you may end up shooting yourself in the foot\n2) I don't believe you are going to find the situation such that both of your orders are going to turn a profit at the same time. I've not come across this (though, admittedly, new to this game as well). If there is a swing, what I have found happen is that one side of the straddle will profitable (up to 4x profit or more) and the other will get crushed basically be worthless. \n\nI do think that this strategy could be profitable if you have a good system or knack for selecting big moving stocks and have a large enough starting capital to get in the game big enough to profit (at least 3 - 5 contracts). For example, I have been doing something similar (like I said above) since about mid Feb (whenever Amazon did their earnings). With the 200K starting capital in the paper trading account I was able to turn that around in to 320K with various trades (though in the past three weeks I have whittled it down to 290K).\n\nSomethings I have noticed are:\n1) The big swings mostly seem to happen after-hours and when you are able to put in actionable orders your profits and losses are pretty much set (wins and losses).\n2) I've had the best luck when picking stocks based on name recognition in the information technology sector (IT/Computers/Software is more my forte).\n3) I've had the best luck letting the orders ride until the earnings are announced (not setting stop loss orders) and once the orders are announced putting in my stoploss orders with a wide enough give to leave a profit if the bottom falls out, but also account for variability and to ride the wave up. I've toyed with the idea of \"keep profit\" order, a high end target that once it gets it I am happy to exit the order\n4) I've had the most profitability buying slightly in the money contracts. OTM contracts, while cheaper, seem to take bigger swings to turn a profit", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
