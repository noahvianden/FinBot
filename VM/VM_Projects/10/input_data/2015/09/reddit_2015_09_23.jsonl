You should be doing something with about 35% of your income. 20% into investing and 15% into savings until you have enough savings for 6 months to cover all of your expenses if you lost your job. Once you've saved enough, you can start investing the full 35%.\n\nPeople here will tell you to invest in index funds/mutual funds/ETF's. All of which are simple and for the simple minded. These people, will be average forever. If you are fine with just average returns, go ahead and use them.\n\nIf you want great returns, don't be afraid. You don't need to read hundreds of books. You don't need to consider going to university. All you need to do, is find what makes good stocks good and continue looking for it in other companies and hold them and let them do the work for you.\n\nYou already hold DIS/UA, which are good companies. Look them up on Finviz and see the companies financials. Compare them to a horrible company such as AMD. You can see why companies such as DIS/UA trend upwards and why AMD runs flat for 7 years. You can see more good companies on my website, or send me a pm here anytime and I'll help.

Bogle -\n\nBogle is the founder of Vanguard and his book will try to convince you to become an index investor.  Which is what I recommend too, unless you're willing to treat investing like a part-time job.\n\n\nThe Only Investment Book You'll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias - \n\nThis is more of a personal finance book than a book about the stock market, but it's a wonderful place to start. It should put you on proper footing before beginning to invest.\n\nThe Little Book That Builds Wealth by Pat Dorsey - \n\nPat Dorsey was the Director of Equity Research at Morningstar before running his own equity research firm. He specializes in analyzing firms' competitive advantages. Which is to say, the qualities of a business that make it successful over the long term.  \n\nLittle Book of Behavioral Investing by James Montier - \n\nTemperament is more important than intelligence in the investment field. Understanding common behavioral traps and how to avoid them is paramount to being a great investor.\n\nWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements by Marry Buffett - \n\nA wonderful crash course on how to think of each line on the financial statement. Careful not to rigidly cling to the formulas and benchmarks that Marry espouses in her book.\n\nYou'll notice that 3 of the 5 books are from the Little Books series. That's no accident. The Little Book series is a wonderful place to start. They offer a crash course in a wide array of investment philosophies and are written by some of the biggest names in the business.\n\nAndrew Tobias's book came to me as a recommendation from Mark Cuban. http://www.favobooks.com/enterpreneurs/48-mark-cuban.html\n\nThe book by Marry Buffett is probably where I'll get some flack, but I liked her book series.
