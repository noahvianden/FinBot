{"title": "Professional advice needed regarding Mobileye (MBLY)", "selftext": "Long story short: My broker account opened about a week and a half ago, and I was eager to buy some stocks right away. The two stocks I bought were PSEC and MBLY. PSEC is doing fine but MBLY is down 15% since I bought it.\n\n\nAnyway, my reasoning behind buying MBLY was that I thought it was similar to TSLA in many ways. I knew that it was overvalued (as is TSLA), but I thought that this was a stock that could skyrocket once self-driving cars become the norm. Literally almost every \"research\" article I read about it online said that this stock has huge upside and recommends to buy it. So I thought, \"eh, why not?\" \n\n\nToday however, a research firm called Citron shred MBLY to pieces in this article: http://www.citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MBLY-final-Sept-9.pdf\n\n\nToday alone, MBLY fell 8%+ after this article was released. It mentioned that \"self-driving hype\" was the only thing keeping the stock afloat. I understand now that this is 100% true. However, \"hype\" is also what is currently keeping TSLA afloat. Anyway, this article goes on to show that MBLY BARELY spends any money at all on its research, doesn't own any unique patents, and that its founders/original investors before IPO have been dumping the stock at a ridiculously alarming rate. It finishes off by saying that MBLY will end up just like DDD after the 3D printing hype ended. \n\n\nAre there any experienced investors here that can read that Citron article and tell me whether or not Citron is \"fear-mongering\" or if it's telling the truth and that all those articles I read about MBLY earlier are bullshit? I need help determining if the charts in the Citron article are as alarming as they make it seem. Earlier articles I read said that MBLY could go up 100%+ in a year, and that it has no competition and is the \"clear leader in the self-driving car revolution\". This article by Citron seems more logical to me however, although I need some help telling me what these numbers mean for the stock.\n\n\nHere are some of the numerical highlights from the article in case you don't want to read the whole thing: http://imgur.com/a/YiuxI\n\n\nShould I continue holding on to this stock? Or should I dump it tomorrow immediately and accept my 15% loss before it turns into a 50%+ loss?
