{"title": "RKT to 🚀", "selftext": "Buying the RKT Dip is an Absolute No-Brainer\n\nAll you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow & Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to >9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this?

You cannot expect the stock market to always have an 8% overall dividend income. Lots of companies often put out 1% or 2% dividend annual returns. Even if you went for the S&P ETF that still pays out 1.7%\n\nYou’d have to add up all the dividend percentage and average them out annually to see what overall percentage you’re working from. But you can’t do this predictively because you do not know 7 years from now if a company will slash its rates, increase its rates, or leave it the same year after year. Plus market prices affect the overall payout and yield amounts\n\nYou are right btw that you will have put in $23,800 of your own money over 7 years. Here’s the kicker though. You could end up with a higher sum more, a lower sum less, or still be at $23,800. The question really is how are you doing the investing that will determine if after 7 years you’ve gained or loss funds. If you randomly invest in random companies you’re no better off than spending $200 a month at a casino. Sometimes you’ll win paydirt other times you’ll lose most of what you put in. Frequently in casinos the house wins so you’ll likely walk away 7 years from now losing more than you put in\n\nThe better option is to look not just at dividend yields but also the quality of the companies you’re considering. Let’s take u/RadBadMadDad suggestions (so I don’t have to say this same thing twice too). Rad noted looking at the risk factor of the companies. So yes it’s entirely possible to find companies paying out ridiculously high yields but the quality of the companies are just terrible and likely will fold by the end of the 7 years. JC Penny’s is a great example of this. If you look up it’s yield history in 1999 they paid out 9% in dividend yield yet here we are 11 years later and they’re bankrupt\n\nWhat Rad did not say is not every company will pay out a positive dividend increase every year. There are companies that try to put themselves on things like a dividend aristocrat list by increasing yield little by little but that could take companies years to reach that to avoid spending so much of their capital and income on dividend payments and Apple is a great example of that. They’re starting their dividend off extremely small giving themselves tons of space to slowly raise the rates over time. If you stick with Apple long enough they’ll be on every dividend list at some point and likely hitting 1.5%\n\nSo you’re looking for quality companies with solid balance sheets, low debts, decent products people want and will still want 7+ years from now and offer dividends with payouts that increase over time so 7 years later you’ve gone from 1% to 3% for example but also looking for yields that make sense for the stock it’s in\n\nDividend yields are actually the fraction of a dividend and the price of the stock so price changes in the stock can affect the overall yield. It’s very easy sometimes to get stuck in the ooo this company’s dividend just shot up to 8% lets buy buy buy when in reality the stock price just tanked horribly and the company is doing terrible. An example of this might be something like CVR Refinery. I have never seen them before today but they’re a refinery likely for oil. Given the state of things today you can see why they’re on the brink of closing their doors. The question becomes can they survive the pandemic and thrive long term like Shell or Chevron? Or would they go bankrupt? Get bought out?  Since I’ve never seen their stock before I can’t answer how this played out but I can say the company got bought out by another company who owns the rights to 100% of the same company today but I was looking for one that had the wild yield fluctuations. Their yield has bounced around from 8% to 18% between 2014 and 2018 and as of 2018 the stock price was around $10. And at “34% yield” it was only paying out literally $3 a year because of the really low stock price but at one point the stock price was at $40. That’s because again the yield percentage is reflective of the stock price so you might think ooo I can gain a ton but in reality you’ll gain only $3 for your trouble \n\nHope this all helps answer a few things for you.

On top of that, high dividend stocks may not increase their dividend payouts yearly.\n\nThere are only a small handful of stocks that offer an 8%+ dividend yield and they’re risky.

{"title": "A Brief Education on Stock Splits", "selftext": "**Stock Splits**\n\nOf all the things to worry about regarding one's investment, stock splits are not one of them. Stock splits are entirely harmless to one's ownership in stock and have no impact on your position from a fundamental standpoint. However, it is still valuable to understand what a stock split is and why businesses undertake these activities. \n\nStock splits are an increasingly less common occurrence in financial markets. However, stock splits still occur and may be confusing as new investors see changes to the number of shares they own and the price of a stock that announces a split. Stock splits are done for several reasons that involve psychology and exchange requirements. \n\n**What New Investors Get Wrong About Stock Splits**\n\nThe most important aspect to understand regarding stock splits is that they cause no economic change to the company. Stock splits are purely to lower a company's stock price to allow more individuals to purchase stock. A stock split is when a company increases the number of shares outstanding and, as a result, decreases the share price. Stock splits are usually announced in ratio terms such as \"3-for-1,\" signifying how many shares an investor will receive for each of their already owned shares. For example, Apple announced a \"4-for-1\" stock split in July of 2020 when the stock was trading at approximately $400 per share. If you owned one share of Apple stock, you would have received four shares in exchange for the one share you already owned, and the price of each share would change to approximately $100 (4 x less) per share. The value of your investment in this example does not change, as the total value was $400 before the split and remains at $400. \n\n**Why Do Companies Split Stocks?**\n\nCompanies usually announce stock splits to make their shares more accessible to retail investors interested in investing by lowering the cost of each share. By reducing the cost of shares, retail investors can gain access to shares they may not have been able to afford. In theory, you may be thinking that this would drive a company's stock up and maybe a good sign for a company. However, the minuscule amount of capital provided by these retail investors interested in a company does not really impact the stock price at all. In the modern age of computer trading, most brokerages offer fractional shares of stock, which means that a person could buy 0.5 shares of a stock trading at $100 per share for $50. This fractional trading has made stock splits much less common than they were in the 1980s and 90s. However, large companies, such as Apple, may choose to do this merely as a psychological marketing tactic to appeal to those who want to own entire shares but can't do so. \n\nAlso, stock splits can sometimes be seen as a sign of confidence in a particular stock. It could be argued that a company that is willing to split its stock from $100 per share to $20 per-share is confident about the future growth of its stock price. While stock splits have no direct connection to the financial health or future performance of a company, some believe that they signify future strength to come for business. As a result, stocks can often rise after a stock split is announced, as Apple did because it is believed that company executives are confident in the future of the business. \n\n**Different Types of Splits**\n\nAnother type of stock split is known as a reverse stock split. A reverse stock split is the exact opposite of a regular stock split. While a regular stock split seeks to reduce the price of shares by issuing more shares, a reverse stock split aims to raise the price of individual shares by merging existing shares. A reverse stock split essentially lowers the number of shares outstanding, which results in a higher stock price. Reverse stock splits are also announced in ratio terms such as \"1-for-3\". In a \"1-for-3,\" reverse stock split example, an individual who owns three shares of stock X trading at $1 per-share would receive one share that costs $3 per share. The value of your investment in this example does not change just as with regular stock splits, as the total amount was $3 before the split and remains at $3. \n\nReverse stock splits are typically a terrible sign compared to the generally positively received regular stock splits. Companies perform reverse stock splits when the stock price has usually reached record lows. Companies will perform reverse stock splits to raise the share price to above the minimum level required by some exchanges. Both the NASDAQ and NYSE require that stock prices remain above $1 per-share to stay listed on the exchanges. If a company's stock has fallen close to $1, they may consider a reverse stock split to raise its share price to remain listed on the exchange. The NYSE requires that at least 1.1M shares be traded for a company, and the NASDAQ requires that at least 1.25M shares be listed. This means that a company cannot reverse stock split forever to maintain its stock price; eventually, the stock will be delisted from the exchange and become a \"penny stock\" that trades on the OTC. Reverse stock splits are not a good sign. Don't be fooled by the rising stock price, as reverse stock splits do not alter the value of your investment and signal company struggles. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNext time you see a sudden change in the number of shares you own in stock due to a stock split, don't be alarmed. These corporate actions do not alter the value of your investment but could potentially signal confidence around the future of the stock price. If a reverse stock split is announced, don't get excited that the share price has risen because it has no impact on your investment value as the number of shares you owned was proportionally decreased. If a reverse stock split was announced, consider looking for new investments as the company may be indirectly signaling tougher times ahead. ", "id": "i8mv8y", "created_utc": 1597268346.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Such a good point re: the executive confidence", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "For sure!

{"title": "Selling ATM put credit spreads every day on SPY?", "selftext": "I'm trying to develop a low maintenance strategy to profit from theta without having to stress about timing the market perfectly and watching charts all day like I usually do.\n\nWhy not just sell 0-1 DTE (Or even weekly) ATM put credit spreads on the SPY every day? Help me figure out if this is a bad idea or not.\n\nIf the market goes down, you collect more premium for less capital each day, meaning if you are trying to make $200 per day you have less capital to put up for the position after each loss. Also we know J Powell will intervene if there is a market crash by cranking up the money printer.\n\nPlus we know that because the market crashes faster than it climbs, there will be more green days than red days in the long term even if we experience another downtrend at some point. So using identical credit spreads each day should limit losses from any large crashes since there is limited risk each day.\n\nAlso if there is another crash, premiums become so large that increasing the daily profit target using some sort of limited Martingale strategy (Such as doubling the number of contracts sold just one time after 3-4 consecutive red days) should be a very safe and low risk way to make consistent returns with a low risk of blowing up the account.\n\nIs there a flaw in this idea? I'm sure I'm missing something. The idea though is that we can profit from any hypothesis in the options market, right? So if we make the hypothesis that the market won't experience more than x number of red days in a row and that there will be more green days than red, shouldn't it be possible to develop a profitable strategy based on that assumption?\n\nAny thoughts or better ideas maybe?", "id": "i86qen", "created_utc": 1597204299.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "I lost 38K in 2 minutes doing this.", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Paper trade it for awhile and post the results", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Contemplated this my self and backtested a little bit on thinkorswim.
