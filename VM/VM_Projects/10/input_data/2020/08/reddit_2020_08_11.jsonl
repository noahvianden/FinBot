{"title": "MAXR - Stonks Only Go Up", "selftext": "I will skip the part of the DD where OP calls you a bunch of names and tells you to listen up.\n\n**TLDR: $MAXR**\n\n$MAXR is a relatively recent product of some space related M&A activity. MDA (they made Canadarm for the Space Shuttle) bought DigitalGlobe (they take pictures of the earth and sell them to government, google, newspapers, etc) and it's subsidiaries and then rebranded itself as 'MAXAR Technologies'. Ironically, they just sold MDA to private equity for ~$750 mil and paid down some debt with it. They fully acquired a company they helped start in a joint venture with SAAB that creates a ton of useful information about the planet.\n\nTheir main business model is they make satellites and sell information produced from data that those satellites collect to all sorts of entities.\n\nThey just had a great earnings and are executing their plan to reduce debt. There is a S 3 E K I N G  4 L P H A article from '19 titled \".. connecting the dots...\" that is a decent read on MAXAR.\n\nYou'll notice stock price went to shit in '18 and '19. They had a lot of debt and they had their newest big bet satellite fail and it was thought that they would go brankrupt. They've righted the ship, pivoted to building LEO constellations and the next catalyst for share price will be any updates on WorldView Legion constellation.\n\nWhy you should jump in (not in any order):\n\n1) Space is now meme status. Space is the future. $MAXR is 100% space exposed. They aren't a diversified manufacturer of stuff like Boeing, NG or Raytheon.  \n2) \"Information is the new currency\" and these guys have and can get a ton of information about anywhere on the surface of the earth very quickly. They will be improving their information collection abilities in 2021 when they launch their new satellite constellation.   \n3) They have competitors but their competitors offerings aren't as great as theirs.  \n4) Float is 1.5% held by insiders. 94% held by institutions. That leaves just a few shares for us retail Robinhood traders to play with. It is a wild ride as institutions acquire and dump shares. 15% of the float is short (that was pre earnings).  \n5) Investor's concerns about debt are easing.  \n6) A very significant amount of their revenue comes from government / military. I believe that military spending will never decrease save for a radical change in government. China is escalating its military operations and non-China governments will all want information about what they are doing. This is just one example of more and more demand for precise almost real time information that MAXAR can deliver. US Gov't focused on GIS (new NGA facility) and that'll only increase demand for their products.  \n7) Any time something happens in the world, people will want satellite imagery of it whether that is for news articles or research or whatever. Most recently:\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/mauritius-oil-spill-disaster-satellite-images/\nhttps://blog.maxar.com/open-data-program/2020/open-data-response-to-the-beirut-lebanon-explosion\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-bushfires/australia-begins-damage-assessment-amid-temporary-respite-from-bushfires-idUSKBN1Z30O1\n8) Stonks only go up.\n\nYes this post is kind of pumpy and dumpy.\n\nPositions: 800 shares (I am tired of losing money on options). 1/15/21 $25Cs are a decent play.
