{"title": "Hi, I'm an investor-wannabe - how wrong and destined-for-failure is my \"investment plan\" really?", "selftext": "As my name says, I have a somewhat successful gaming YT channel that provides me with a few hundred $ of extra cash every month, at least for now. It's volatile, but it's been on an upward trend ever since the pandemic broke out and people watch YT way more than before.\n\nCurrent global situation dictates that the worst option is to just keep this extra cash laying around depreciating due to inflation. I also don't want to just put it in a bank account, interest rates are of no use either. And, even if I lose all my savings in the stock market, at least I'll come out of it knowing what NOT to do the next time I dump money into it.Of course, the ideal outcome would be to prevent such a case, so that's why I'm writing this wall of text, asking for guidance from, hopefully, more experienced members of this community.\n\nNow, I've been getting gradually obsessed with the stock market since August 14th. I bought 2 Hasbro (HAS) stocks right away, because that company owns a game my YT channel is about, so I naturally just dumped some cash into it. Now, 10 days later, I went on quite a bit of a shopping spree and own these stocks:  \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1\\_U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1_U/edit?usp=sharing)  \n(stocks below the gray row are just there to keep track of them, I don't have that much money to burn in a month :) )  \n\n\nAfter obsessive research, I'm perfectly aware this is a HIGHLY speculative and not at all safe/balanced way to park excess cash. Also, there's nothing long-term about it. I'm not worried about short term losses, I'm in this for the long run, at least 5, maybe even 10 years. However, I'm worried, for example, that NVDA is gonna finally crash tomorrow because it's clearly overvalued (I was clueless about that issue when I bought it), I'm worried that TDOC is just gonna ween off and never grow back up to $200+ levels even after the LVGO merger and, well, I'm worried that this will ultimately end up being another one of my failures. I'm OK with losing the money, but again, if it could be prevented, why waste it?\n\nHowever, I'm not just going to sell and cut my loses and give up. I've dealt with problems and issues all my life, so, after a fair few days of trying to grasp the crux of the issue, I'm somewhat familiar with most of the stock market/investing terms and I believe I have a basic, but hopefully sufficient understanding of the stock market as a whole.\n\nNow, among many others, I watched this video  \n[https://youtu.be/xexqXNxQ5fU](https://youtu.be/xexqXNxQ5fU)  \nTL:DW he basically has 50-70% of the entire portfolio in just 3 stocks -  1 growth (TSLA), 1 value (FB), 1 dividend (SKWS). The way I see this, all 3  are just basically growth stocks of different kinds, especially SKWS with its low dividend yield and cyclical growth. But, it can't be denied he got dem gains and a solid track record.  He says the entire portfolio shouldn't have more than 15 stocks for most  people.\n\nSo, some plan of action is better than no plan of action and I feel like a strategy like this one may just be what could work for me.\n\nObviously, I can't just copy what he did. TSLA is way overvalued right now and it's just a matter of time before it crashes or, ahem, market \"correction\" happens. SKWS I'm not interested in, I feel like it doesn't have much more room for growth and its dividend yield is abysmal.\n\nI don't want to just endlessly sit around and wait for a miracle to happen, but I don't want to rush this either, so I came up with rough draft of a course of action that seems plausibly viable to me. I don't expect this to 2x or even 1.5x my investment over the next few years, but if I could squeeze 25-30% overall gains over a period of 4-5 years, that would be an awesome starting point for me.\n\n**LONG-TERM GROWTH STOCKS**  \n\\-FB for its diversified social network portfolio, at least until 2023.

But for somebody who doesn't know stocks and doesn't want to lose money your best bet is probably trying to emulate some big ones with your portfolio. If you are cool with losing some extra money (or making out good if your lucky) my stance on things is I buy two kinds of companies. Ones I believe in to the point where If they were losing me money for a bit I would still sleep easy. And companies that I invest very little in that I use as a \"incase they get famous\" bet if I have some reason to believe they could shoot up in value. Those make up an incredibly small percentage though. \n\nThe first mistake I made when I started was buying and selling too much and overthinking everything.

I kinda feel like he should be coming to me with a fluid plan to maximize my investment. But instead it's more like I have to bother him when I have an idea. So far it's been a \"set it and forget it\" strategy. I came to him three years ago bc he knew my father and works with my sister.

I spoke to him briefly in early March right before the crash, asking him if I should pull some money out, but was advised against it.

I'm able to save and invest about 10 to 15K every year.\n\nAm I being unfair? Is it my responsibility to call this guy periodically?

{"title": "OPINION (not DD!): Reducing AAPL position this week", "selftext": "Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì **Apple Inc (**[**AAPL**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/)**)** has performed admirably. They‚Äôre probably one of the best run companies in the world, evidenced by being the first US company to eclipse $2 trillion in market capitalization. With that said, I‚Äôve decided that barring anything unforeseen, this week will be the week that I exit Apple, and began selling at $507.87\n\nWhy? The simplest answer is I believe it‚Äôs run up too far, too fast. Even a zero interest rate environment doesn‚Äôt merit mature companies trading at 40 times earnings, which is where Apple appears to now be headed.\n\nWe have to remember that different companies come into and fall out of favor, and this last decade has been the ‚ÄúApple Decade‚Äù. I believe with that so much of Apple‚Äôs future sales are already priced into the stock, there really isn‚Äôt much room for further growth. Even if it doesn‚Äôt fall (I‚Äôm not predicting a fall, but that could happen), the risk is a slowdown in the growth of its stock price as earnings slowly catch up.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin regarding my decision to sell is the crazy run-up its had since declaring its upcoming stock split.

For the contacting layer, a line width between 15 Œºm and 30 Œºm is used. In a second print step, using a wider opening, these contacting layers are augmented by a non-contacting paste layer to form a line of sufficient conductivity. Reduced shading and a smaller contact area lead to increased JSC and VOC. Still, an excessive reduction of the contact area causes an increase of contact resistivity compensating the gain. For an optimum configuration, an efficiency gain of up to 0.2%abs and a reduction of paste consumption by 10 mg are demonstrated on precursors from industrial production.\n\n\"paste consumption\" would be the silver usage they're talking about.\n\nIn my head I think of making solar panels like making computer processors, only using couple year old nodes with lower quality and cheaper wafers. The wafer is cut into PV cells instead of processors and it's like 99.9% silicon and a couple parts per million doping material like Boron or Phosphorus. You then need silver as a good conductor to connect the PV cells (for CPUs they use gold contacts), some aluminium frame to hold everything together, plastic coating to optimize the type of light going in and reflectivity.\n\nPeak wavelength of sun light is 635 nm (red light), that's a photon with 1.95 electronvolt (eV). Normal semiconductors have a band gap of 1 - 1.5 eV.\n\nIf you need a refresher on what band gap is, it's the smallest possible energy it takes to knock an electron up to the valence band of an atom. In a crystal structure, once an electron is in the valence band it can move freely in the structure and is electrical current. A panel exposed to sunlight would be using photons to provide that energy boost.\n\nThe problem with solar panels has really been just bringing that band gap up to 1.3 - 2.5 eV so it can capture most types of sun light, blue light is like 2.5 eV.\n\nHere is a list of all semiconducting materials,  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_semiconductor\\_materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_materials)\n\nYou can make a solar panel with any of them really. Things like Gallium arsenide has a band gap 1.43 eV, which was considered good for solar panels.\n\nNowadays you just use the fact that normal 99.999% crystal silicon (used in computers) have a 1.12 eV band gap while if you break up the structure and make the structure a bit chaotic the band gap increases to 1.7-1.8 in amorphous silicon (don't ask me why), that lets you capture a good mix of energy photons. We've been working on silicon semiconductors for a really long time as well...so people have figured out to make it like really cheap.\n\nAny article you read about \"toxic solar panels\" is 100% talking about like old Gallium arsenide panels.

On August 31, 2020, Tesla will perform a **5-for-1** forward split. Here‚Äôs what that means for you:  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢¬†At the start of the day on August 31, you will hold 5 times the number of shares of TSLA that you held prior to the split. **If you currently own fractional shares of TSLA, after the split you will hold 5 times that fractional amount.** *(emphasis mine)*   \n>  \n>‚Ä¢¬†The price per share will decrease to about 1/5th of the closing price from the previous day. This accounts for the increase in the overall number of shares. For example: if you currently own 1 share of TSLA worth $500, after the split you will own 5 shares of TSLA worth $100 per share, with your overall value remaining at $500.  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢¬†**The overall dollar value of your investment will not change.** Say you own 4 shares of TSLA. If you imagine your total TSLA investment as a pizza cut into 4 big slices, think of this stock split as just slicing that pizza into 20 smaller slices.  \n>  \n>Please know that all Tesla shareholders will be affected by this corporate action, and that this was not Robinhood‚Äôs decision.
