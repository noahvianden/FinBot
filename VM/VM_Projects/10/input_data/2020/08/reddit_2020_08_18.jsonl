The split takes effect on August 31 for each shareholder of record on Aug. 21. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.*\n\n*If you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.*\n\n*If you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.*\n\n*If you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $1,500 per share, you will pay $150,000.

{"title": "ETFs that stand to gain no matter who wins the election in November (An article from Barron's)", "selftext": "**Trump or Biden? These ETFs Should Climb Either Way**\n\nThe 2020 presidential election is only three months away, and the policy leanings of both candidates have started to come clear. A victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden or the re-election of President Donald Trump could have implications for a variety of sectors and stocks. Investors should start positioning themselves for either outcome -- or even better, both.\n\nClimate change and energy policy is one of Biden's priority issues. He has announced plans to invest heavily in research and innovation, and aims for a 100% clean energy U.S. economy by 2050. If the Democrats win the White House and Congress, Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek expects aggressive environmental legislation to pass, including strong emissions standards across several industries, new fuel-economy standards, mandated future levels of clean-energy production, and a \"cap and trade\" program.\n\nThat's great for clean-energy stocks, but the group should be positioned to deliver strong returns even without a Biden win. \"Clean-energy stock prices used to ebb and flow with political winds based on whether they'll be subsidized and supported or not. That has pretty much evaporated\" as the industry has matured, says Jason Bloom, director of global exchange-traded fund strategy and research at Invesco.\n\nMany companies have finally turned profitable over the past two to three years, Bloom says, and their stock performance is now more about fundamentals than the macro backdrop. Public support for sustainable investing has also picked up, pushing much of the private sector to roll out decarbonization plans even absent government regulation. Friendly policies, of course, would offer additional tailwinds, but won't be as determinative on the clean-energy industry as they were 10 years ago.\n\nThe $344 million First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF (QCLN), and the $484 million Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) offer diversified exposure to stocks in areas like renewable energy, electric cars, battery technology, and biofuels. Both funds have track records of more than 10 years, have returned an annualized 18% over the past five years, and gained 50% and 48%, respectively, in 2020 alone. They are quite concentrated, owning just about 40 stocks. The Invesco WilderHill ETF is equal weighted, and hence tilts more toward smaller, cheaper stocks. The First Trust ETF, on the other hand, assigns heavier weights to larger stocks like Tesla (TSLA) and NIO (NIO), which have soared 544% and 352%, respectively, over the past year.\n\nInvestors who want a more targeted focus can also look into the $975 million Invesco Solar (TAN), the $144 million First Trust Global Wind Energy (FAN), and the $694 million Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT). All three own international stocks and investors should be aware of currency risks.\n\nAnother relatively safe bet, regardless of who wins the White House, is infrastructure companies. The Biden campaign has promised to revitalize U.S. infrastructure, spending $1.3 trillion over a 10-year period on highways, bridges, and airports. Trump is reportedly considering proposing $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.\n\nWhile there are a dozen ETFs in infrastructure-related stocks, only two are solely dedicated to U.S. companies -- the $213 million Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) and the $16 million iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). The Global X fund is purely focused on industrial and materials stocks, while the iShares ETF also owns a slew of utility companies.\n\nStill, while infrastructure appears to be something that both candidates want, Senyek warns that it has been talked about for several years without result. \"In our view, neither party wants to allow the other to receive credit for finally passing a package that majorities in both parties favor,\" he says. Senate Republicans, particularly, have been reluctant to get on board, concerned about the mounting federal debt amid coronavirus stimuli. A Democratic sweep would make a large-scale infrastructure bill more likely to pass.\n\nBiden wants to build the American health-care system on the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. This could benefit the established managed-care giants as more Americans obtain health insurance. There's one catch, though: Biden also wants to create a public option on the ACA exchange, a move that would bring some headwinds for the private sector.\n\nAdditionally, both candidates are pushing to cut prescription-drug prices and promote the development of generic drugs. That would be bad news for Big Pharma and biotech, but could reduce expenses for hospitals and health insurers. Investors can own these stocks through the $989 million iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers (IHF) and $95 million SPDR S&P Health Care Services (XHS).\n\nTrump has championed the idea of bringing offshore businesses back to the U.S. from countries like China. A Biden presidency might be more moderate on Beijing, but the decoupling of the countries' economies seems unavoidable. The Biden campaign has promised a future that is \"made in all of America\" by all-U.S. workers, and that would bring back the supply chains across a range of critical products \"on which the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers.\" The trend could lift some domestic firms that have been losing business to outsourcing, says Invesco senior equity strategist Nick Kalivas. The $39 million Invesco S&P SmallCap Industrials (PSCI) -- which owns nearly 100 small industrial companies -- could be a good play on the theme.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "id": "ic194x", "created_utc": 1597758269.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I think in general any significant gains or losses predicated on the winner of an election are temporary.

The stock's going to crash like you've never seen a stock crash before. These are outside factors even the likes of Elon Musks can't control. It's up to you as an investor to decide, if you are willing to take those risks. Most/All professionals for this precise reason limit a single investment to only being a part of their portfolio.

There's no doubt about that.

He said in an interview recently, if I recall correctly, that he already thinks about how orginizing is succession for when he will not be around anymore. That gives me confidence. True, he is the face and spirit of the companies. True, the stock would tank badly if anything had to happen to him. True, a massive IT problem could happen, you get the idea. But If they do their job properly, the IT should not be an issue as they probably have multiple backups in different places. If FSD fails and causes crashes or gets hacked, that would probably severely damage Tesla's reputation. But given the size of the company, I'm confident they would overcome that in the long term.

However this fall we are going to space!", "selftext": "The delays of Virgin Galactic and hope for the future\n\nThe delays of Virgin Galactic and hope for the future discussion\n\nVirgin Galactic started in 2004 and since as early as 2008/2009 Richard Branson started the infamous “we will be flying next year” statements.  \n\nLooking back here are some of the obvious reasons for the delays.  \n\nRichard being Richard.\n\nRichard getting too excited and not knowing enough about the technology or engineering.  This could happen to the best of us.  Since the company went public he has never gave a timeframe.  With the exception of saying “hopeful of 2020”\n\n2014 crash.  \n\nThis unfortunately set the company back years.  There one and only spaceship at the time crashed and killed a pilot and if not had happened likely Virgin Galactic would of been in space.  \n\nRunning low on cash.\n\nStarting in 2017, 2018 they started to rub low on cash.  By 2018 they have already flown to space already in a test flight and Richard was there in the audience.  However they didn’t have enough cash to continue operations.\n\nThis is where Chamath comes in.  Now Richard was in talks with numerous people and firms at the time, even Saudi Arabia.  But ended up going with Chamath for a merger that added 500 million in cash so Virgin Galactic can finish testing, move operations to Spaceport America, fly Richard and lastly fly the remaining 600 clients to space. \n\nMove to Spaceport America.\n\nSpaceport America would be Virgin Galactics new home.  This was announced in 2019 and even today is not fully ready - however very close.\n\nCOVID19.\n\nBack in February of 2020 it appeared that Richard would be able to fly on his 70th birthday on July 18, 2020.  However due to COVID19 that seems to gotten delayed by 6 months.  \n\nInstalling the cabin so SpaceshipTwo can be ready for the last two FAA certification is the biggest victim of COVID19 as you can only have so many employees working on it at one time. \n\nAlso having spaceport America ready to take tourist for the 5 day experience there is not ready ... yet.\n\nThoughts..\n\nI think this makes a great discussion as I constantly hear or read people saying “they always delay” or the running joke is “next year we go”.  The fact is going to space is hard.  But it seems more likely now then ever that’s it is happening in the next 6 months.  This time they put it on a official Quarterly earnings report the time frame.  Could it get delayed..  yes.  But I am certainly not going to be too tough on this company as COVID19 is not their fault.\n\nAm I confident that they will have the two test flights this fall ... yes.  Am I confident they will fly Richard in Q1... yes.  Could something happen to cause a delay yet again ... yes.
