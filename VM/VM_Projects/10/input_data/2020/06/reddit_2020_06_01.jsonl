{"title": "Help Understanding Calendar Spreads", "selftext": "To anyone out there who truly understands calendar spreads, I would love a detailed explanation of what exactly is there purpose and what I did wrong. I know what they are, and after reading 3 different previous reddit posts and the investopedia page I thought I understood them well, but evidently after attempting my first calendar on DIS I am actually clueless. So last week DIS was trading at a little over $120 and a general summary of my strategy was \"DIS isn't ready to head back up beyond $120 yet, this is going down but it will probably stay here for a little while\". So normally at this point I would either buy a long put for a couple months out, or purchase a call credit spread expiring within the next week or two. But this time I decided to try my hand at a new fangled calendar spread which was as follows: -1 $120p 5/29, +1 $120p 9/18, total debit $764. \n\nMy assessment for DIS was correct, it did go back down to \\~$116.5 but I was incorrect in how quickly it would do so. As a result by Thursday afternoon it was very obvious I was going to be assigned on Friday and so I rolled my 5/29 contract to 6/05 for $90 credit. This morning, DIS was up a little bit again so I bought back my 6/05 contract for what I thought was going to be a profit, as it was at \\~50% of its value from Friday. I was however gravely mistaken, and realized quickly that now my overall cost basis for the long put on 9/18 is even greater than before, and my breakeven price for it is \\~$1 lower than if I had just bought the long put on its own and not bothered with a calendar. In fact, had I not bought the calendar spread I would have made \\~$325 (37%) profit in 3 days instead of now having to hold this put for potentially weeks just to break even. \n\nso I guess, TL;DR - What is the benefit of using a calendar spread because in my experience, unless you absolutely know that a stock will move bilaterally, and you can accurately predict when it will change directions, a calendar spread is just a long put/call with added risk.", "id": "guoa4v", "created_utc": 1591030815.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "In a Calendar Spread you are introducing the concept of having 2 expirations that move independently from each other (see: IV term structure).

Just look at the market collapse earlier this year, front month volatility went to the moon and longer-termed IV did go up but not nearly as much as front Volatility. \n\nSince IV drives your Vegas and you don't have the same inputs you need to normalize your Front and Back month Vegas so they are measuring kind of the same thing, otherwise YOUR BACK VEGAS ARE OVERSTATED so you are not nearly as Vega positive as you think you are.\n\nI can elaborate more if you need me to but it gets heavy on math from this point on... the concepts are basically what I just posted.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No, the math is what I would prefer most, actually.

So if your back expiration is 32 days and the front expiration is 8 and you have 4 Vegas in the back expiration you would need to divide them by the square root of (32/8), so it would be the square root of 4 = 2. In that case, your 4 Vegas in the back month are actually really only 2 when you normalize them to the same IV (which would be the front month)\n\nThis is assuming that IV moves in a square root of time kind of way which is not always 100% the case. Nassim Taleb suggests bucketing your IVs and looking at the past to get more accurate ratios but that is because he is talking about managing 8 figure portfolios and higher.

I have a 25k account and everyday I've been picking companies I like that seem like they're in an uptrend and where OTM probability is above ~70%.\n\nI'm realizing that with a 25k account, I can't exactly sell CSPs with stocks like MSFT (or anything above $100) without it binding up a large % of my capital. So I've been mainly seeking companies with stocks priced around the $10-30 range. \n\nI was curious though, if I felt strongly about getting into a position with a company with a stock priced much higher, if credit spreads made sense with this strategy. I know it's a bit of a deviation but it's kind of along the same idea. Just want to see if there are glaring issues with long put credit spread in lieu of a CSP. Is this what others who implement the Wheel do when do they have necessary capital for a particular underlying?\n\nAlso, I've been selling one CSP a day with different stocks (to diversify) but wondering if others implementing this strategy often continue to sell the same underlying over and over just at different strikes/dates?\n\nLastly, how much of your capital do you keep tied up?

If you buy a long term call (600 DTE) and then sell a shorter term (30 DTE) against that and at 30 days, short call expires in the money.. how are you going deliver 100 shares of apple? Can you just deliver your long call position you own?  \n\n2. if at the end of 30 days, the short call expires out of the money.. I assume you just rinse and repeat the cycle - just like you would with one turn of wheel? \n\n3. Given you are paying $$$ upfront for purchasing the call that expires far into the future, you have to reasonably confident that the underlying will go up or stay about the same for you to sell it back to recover the $$$ you paid upfront while lowering the cost basis over time by selling 'covered' calls against your long position, right ? \n\n4. I looked into long expiring options and noticed large bid/ask spread on the option (sometimes as large as $4-$5). Why is that? If your short call was called away in the first month and if you were to sell your long call to cover it, you'll end up paying the spread?\n\nAm I correct in assuming the spread will narrow with time?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "First, I’m glad you found the blog post helpful.\n\n1.  You have a lot of control over whether it expires ITM or not.  Easiest thing is don’t let that happen.  You can accomplish this by rolling out or, if you’re happy with what you have made just close the whole spread for a profit.  But if you did let it expire ITM and you didn’t have the cash to buy the shares, your broker will either close your short call sometime on expiration day or force you to exercise your long to cover it.  They won’t care about the price you get so don’t let that happen.  The vast majority of the time this is in your control.  Be careful doing this on stocks with big dividends as that is the #1 reason for early exercise.  But if you are paying attention you can avoid this simply by trading around the ex div’s.  It’s ok to just leave your long on for a couple of days and sell the new short after the ex div.\n\n2. Right, if it expires out of the money, you keep the premium and can sell something else against it and collect more premium.  You don’t have to wait all the way until expiration.  It’s your choice.  You could just roll it out earlier.  That is up to you with respect to risk/reward.\n\n3. Sure, but how is that different from buying 100 shares of the stock?  If you own 100 shares of an expensive stock, you’d really want it to go up too, right?  As you saw in the blog post I like around an .80 delta as a nice mix between looking just like a CC and paying less premium.  You can decide how deep you want to do.  The deeper ITM you go the more it will match the risk profile of the CC but the more expensive the long will be.  You should be putting up less money with the long than the 100 shares.\n\n4. This is simply supply and demand.  There is not as much interest in really long dated options so the market is thinner and the bid/ask spread is higher.  This is the downside of going 600 days out.  If that concerns you, consider a year out.  You can always exit the position after 6 or 9 months  and re-enter later if you like with your long a year out. And it’ll be cheaper since it has less extrinsic value.  Your choice of course but those are the trade offs.\n\nHope this helps.

It all started with a hunch on Tesla, got around 12 shares with 5.5k I had in my savings. Then I started browsing the sub and didn’t want to say anything especially since I had shares. Those share skyrocketed and I was able to start doing options just a few no more than $100. My whole family saw my returns and wanted to get in. I felt like Jordan Belfort. As my total got over the 15k mark my cocky ness got worse a lot. I said fuck it and started spending 1-5k on SPY options. I bought SPY puts mid week beginning of March and thurs and Friday following really fucked me in the ass big green dildo. I said fuck this let me “inverse myself” so I sold the SPY puts at a loss and bought SPY calls. I was full blown gambling big shot at this moment, all emotion no strategy. The next day, the big drop occurred and my account eventually deteriorated back down to 10k, started selling my Tesla shares to get money to double down on my SPY calls. Eventually it got down to $500 in a matter of 2-3 weeks. My parents could tell something was up, I was shook and it felt really bad but I kept coming here and reading about stories of people losing big and learning a lot and turning it around. I know 24k may not seem like a lot, but to me a 25 year old that grew up with nothing it’s a lot. I didn’t give up, and once my stimulus check came in I deposited that 1200 faster than I cum in you girlfriends mouths. My whole approach changed and I had nothing to lose but I really learned a lot from losing a lot. Slowly got myself up to around 7.4k and am taking it slow and using a notebook for strategy and moves daily. My portfolio consists of some safe plays right now but I have never been more confident in the positions or myself. DKNG 35c 1/15/21s, GOLD 26c 9/18/20, BA 160c 2022s, HIG 45c 2022s. There have been ups and downs but my point is that I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. You have to lose in order to succeed.

Do your own homework and take it slow, make a plan ahead of time and stick to it, no emotions, and always take profits.

Even with the assassination of both MLK and RFK (JFK's senator brother), H3N2 killing 100k Americans (dang), and the Tet Offensive, the S&P rallied to finish the year *up* 7.6%. \n\nMy two cents, with only a cursory mention of the profound effects of QE. Even though the dynamic of bulls vs bears, or, more generally, optimists vs pessimists is what drives the world and all sorts of pricing, the market is inherently trading on the future. Deep down, most humans have a difficult time imagining things getting worse than the worst (like in the seminal *Schindler's List*), and we see any positive development as the possibility of a turnaround. Furthermore, shorts are generally short term trades while longs can be eternal. Compounded by the inherent inflation of valuation, the market improves over time. What will be most interesting to see if/when real inflation catches up with market inflation, since all of this QE is mostly shifting liquidity into the equities market. \n\nIn my opinion, disconnect like this presents a great opportunity for us to reap as investors/traders/autists/motherfuckers. My $1 in the market is inflating faster than my $1 in the real world. Imagine the economy as a loaf of bread, and the market as a separate loaf of bread. A loaf of economy bread costs $1 today, $1.01 tomorrow, $1.02 the day after. Meanwhile, a loaf of  market bread costs $1 today, 1.015 tomorrow, and 1.03 the day after. I take my money and buy a loaf of market bread. I sell it after a while since it's virtual bread and I can't eat that shit. Now I take that money and buy some economy bread that I can eat, but magically, I'm getting more bread.\n\nObviously this is just some nonsense rambling because I want some sourdough.", "id": "guoswg", "created_utc": 1591032428.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "How come SPY was at $338 and wasn’t “forward looking” to Covid? lmAo.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I think it's because there are more optimists than pessimists.

{"title": "A good example of how WSB can get in over its head", "selftext": "I wanted to share this experience with a number of folks.   It's a good story to share with others when they lose perspective on the value of WSB.\n\nSince the riots, there has been a large number of \"short insurance\" threads.      \n\n\n [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=insurance&restrict\\_sr=1](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=insurance&restrict_sr=1)   \n\n\nPeruse those threads, think about the analysis, and then read this article.  \n\n\n PCS from verisk/maplecroft, which is the best service for covering insurance issues has a good article here -  [https://www.reinsurancene.ws/pcs-designates-mn-riots-a-catastrophe-warns-of-loss-potential/](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/pcs-designates-mn-riots-a-catastrophe-warns-of-loss-potential/)   \n\n\nThan look at the top re-insurance tickers, here -  [https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/here-are-the-top-10-reinsurance-companies-in-the-world-189207.aspx](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/here-are-the-top-10-reinsurance-companies-in-the-world-189207.aspx)   \n\n\nThen look at how they traded today.\n\nSo for those folks who called out \"reinsurance\", I'd advise that you follow them on reddit.   They are among the more clueful around here.  \n\n\nBut by and large, most people on WSB simply posted very ignorant advice on a deeply complex topic.  Many of them claimed to \"be in insurance\" as well and recommended against the trade.   Look how well their advice played out.  \n\n\nReality is, there are very specialized traders who likely track this type of news and have sophisticated models which allow them to make reasoned trades.   They understand the exposure and offsetting of liabilities.  They probably knew who insured Target and Apple and other  stores that got hit and who their re-insurers are and how much of their profit/revenue would suffer from this.  \n\n\nThat level of sophistication is beyond the capability of anyone on WSB.   So, in this case, everyone was likely well over their head.   What's more, a lot of these tickers will trade on european markets as the re-insurers, other than berk, are not in the US.   Also, pre-market trading is likely where all the action is because it happened over the weekend.    \n\n\nNow, that's not to say we couldn't have made the reinsurance trade.  I think we could have on friday EOD when it became clear to folks here who had a good feel for the vibe on the street.   We're dialed into that around here.   The trick is to connect that intuition with some real analysis.     \n\n\n If you're into that sort of combined intuition and analysis and want someone to discuss it with, tag me in a thread and I'll  be happy to jump in if there is time.  \n\n(For the record, I recommended reinsurance here - [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gu16n8/shorts\\_leaps\\_on\\_insurers/fsg94hb?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gu16n8/shorts_leaps_on_insurers/fsg94hb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))", "id": "guph2h", "created_utc": 1591034558.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Jesus Christ...strike and date please, good sir.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "calls on [https://new.reddit.com/user/GWtech/](https://new.reddit.com/user/GWtech/)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is much better than 99% of the posts on this subject.
