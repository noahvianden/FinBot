Read up on these companies and if you try to listen to other people’s advice, fact check them and only listen to what agrees with your own common sense. There are people who try to manipulate the market because they are trying to “short” the stocks by betting on the market to fail. \n\nIf you do your research and think this is worth holding on to for now what is very important to realize is that instead of selling for a loss you can average down.

If you think it will be a Bullish week, calls on JBIL (the name practically has the word \"bull\" right in it). Heading into a Kangaroo week, calls on KR (it is staring you right in the face, ya that's right, KR stands for Kangaroo). If we are heading into a Bearish week, calls on SWBI. Smith and Wesson provides the firepower to take down Ursidae of all type. KR and SWBI earnings on Thursday before open, JBIL earnings on Friday before open.\n\nTL;DR: Bullish - calls on JBIL, Bearish - calls on SWBI, and Kangarooish - calls on KR.\n\nedit: fixed some shitty grammar ", "id": "h942w9", "created_utc": 1592176616.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "KR GANG", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "Someone hold my H&R Block Calls", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hope we're in the beariest of the bear weeks so my SWBI calls print.
