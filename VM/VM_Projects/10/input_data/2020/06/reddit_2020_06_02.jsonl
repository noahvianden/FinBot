{"title": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Breakdown", "selftext": "Wanted to change these posts a little in order to incorporate a greater amount of information without it being too overloaded. The post might be a little longer than previous, but gives a better overview of the company imo.\n\n**Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)**\n\nJohnson & Johnson is a multinational healthcare conglomerate that is known for producing pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and healthcare products such as baby care, the skin care product line Neutrogena, and over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol. Although they've recently been making [headlines](https://www.cancerhealth.com/article/johnson-johnson-ends-north-american-sales-talcbased-baby-powder) for the wrong reasons due to their talc-based baby powder, their massive reach into all major areas of healthcare make them a flagship of the sector and a smart choice for any investor's portfolio.\n\nThe company is divided into 3 main segments:\n\n- Consumer Healthcare - baby care, skin & hair care, wound care & topicals, OTC medicines\n- Medical Devices - diabetes care & insulin delivery, various surgery related devices, orthopedics\n- Pharmaceuticals - drugs for immunology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and oncology \n\n**JNJ Financials Breakdown**\n\n- Consumer Healthcare - $13.9B = 17% of total sales (+0.3% vs 2018)\n- Medical Devices - $26B = 32% of total sales (-3.8% vs 2018)\n- Pharmaceuticals - $42.2B = 51% of total sales (+3.6% vs 2018)\n\nNet Sales: $82.1B; $42B U.S. sales, $40B International sales\n\nResearch & Development Expenses: $11.3B total, a 5.4% increase over 2018; Consumer Healthcare: $493M, Medical Devices: $2B, Pharmaceuticals: $8.8B\n\nNet Earnings: $15.1B in 2019; $15.3B in 2018\n\nNet Assets: $157.7B with $17.3B in cash & cash equivalents\n\nLiabilities: $98.3B in total liabilities with $26.5B in long term debt\n\n[Data from 2019 10-K](https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/ffd0ad42-ac56-4fd4-8fc2-b033c4ed62c6)\n\n**Other Information**\n\nJNJ is one of only 2 companies rated by S&P as having AAA credit. (Microsoft is the other) [More information on S&P credit ratings can be found here](https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352)\n\nJNJ is a dividend king (50+ consecutive years of increasing dividends) with a current streak of 57 years. It is one of only 28 companies to be included on this prestigious list. The stock's current yield is 2.79%. [A good resource on Dividend Kings from one of my favorite sites can be found here](https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-kings/)\n\nJNJ operates in more than 60 countries with 134,000 employees and more than 250 subsidiary companies.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nJohnson & Johnson is one of the largest companies in the world with an impressive portfolio of healthcare products. $40B in international sales and operations in over 60 countries gives them an enormous economic moat and access to markets all over the world. Their sales numbers are solid, and have increased in each of the last 5 years. Earnings dropped slightly compared to 2018 but their R&D expenses increased, indicating they are dedicated to innovation and developing additional new healthcare products. The current pandemic and economic turmoil shouldn't significantly affect their short term financials, and long term they are well positioned for continued success.\n\nDespite their controversies over the years, I think JNJ is a great choice for any investor looking for a long term buy-and-hold healthcare stock. Even after sales in baby care products declined by 10% in 2019, their Consumer Healthcare segment still finished the year with a net increase in sales of 0.3%. While this is due to the massive array of other products they sell, it also highlights how one area of business under-performing doesn't drag the entire company down. The stock isn't a fast mover, but being up 44% over the last 5 years is still respectable growth. With a dividend yield of 2.79% and solid cash flow they have plenty of room to grow their dividend over time as well.", "id": "guwv7u", "created_utc": 1591058175.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Great write up, keep 'em coming.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don't forget the immortalised shout-out in kick in the door by the notorious B.I.G", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Great write up.

This is extremely important because current Tesla batteries last between 300-500 thousand miles. The average person in the US drives 13,476 miles per year. So if we divide 1,000,000 by 13,476 than we can realize that the 1 million mile battery will last 74.217 years for thee average US driver. Essentially an entire lifetime worth of driving on one battery. This is also super important for the Tesla-Semi which will need longer battery life since they will drive significantly more miles per year than the average person.\n\n**Tesla Battery Range**\n\nThis is just a guess, but I could see a small announcement related to increasing battery range in a multiple models of Vehicles. Although this announcement may not be large enough for Tesla battery day, or at least not the main focus of it, I do believe they will continue to make updates and increase the battery range to hit the 620 mile range mark that Elon has state before about the 2020 Tesla Roadster.\n\n**Vehicle-To-Grid**\n\nTesla's will act as storage units for energy, would allow for Tesla owners to be paid to store energy. Would allow for energy arbitrage (Purchasing energy and storing it at down times, than selling it back to the grid at peak times). Another revenue stream for Tesla owners (on top of ride sharing). Would go along well with autonomous driving. I suggest watching Gali's video on Hyperchange for more detail on this subject.\n\n**The Potential Value of Tesla's**\n\n* Rideshare market: $61.3 Billion (2018) projected to grow to $218 Billion (2025)\n* V2G (peaker plant market): $800 Billion Potential ($10-$12 in the US)\n* Our Electric grid needs innovation and needs more storage so this is perfect timing for Tesla to enter the electric utilities market\n\n*Tesla’s will increase in value, not depreciate, as they become autonomous and are able to create income for owners. They also may become cheaper to buy as Tesla will profit off V2G and Ridesharing, which will make up for a cheaper initial car price*\n\n* With Tesla solar panels, battery technology, charging stations, etc. I believe Tesla is  trying to take over/disrupt the electric utility companies\n\n**Charging Stations**\n\nThis is not as likely to be mentioned at this event, but I would love an update to the total number of superchargers in the grid. Especially in China where Tesla is just now starting to ramp up substantially.\n\n**Other/Possible Topics**\n\n* Auto bidder software update\n* Tesla's virtual power plant\n* New battery deployments around the world\n* Potential for Tesla’s energy growth\n* Solar roof update\n* Future/Current growth update of Tesla business\n* Ramp of energy storage products\n* Terrafactories/Current Gigafactories updates\n\nI also thought this quote from the popular mechanics magazine summarizes Tesla's goal in relation to batteries/energy:\n\n\"Elon Musk has announced ambitious plans to make Tesla batteries that can live second and even third lives as they survive for one million miles.
