{"title": "SLV Options A Vehicle To Economic Prosperity And Insanity", "selftext": "As we go into another week of unpredictable markets I want you to think about the reasons you should **buy call options on the SLV ETF** **for 36 USD on 1/21**.\n\nSilver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver’s USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.\n\nSilver’s primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.\n\nHistorically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been “consumed” and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.\n\nStepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.\n\nWhile the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn’t know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.\n\nThis last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.\n\nSo today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.\n\nNow why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven’t talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.\n\nThe way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.\n\nYou see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.\n\nChina, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.\n\nSo do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.\n\nIf you look at both instances of silver’s historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November.

{"title": "Silver ETFs A Vehicle To Economic Prosperity", "selftext": "As we go into another week of unpredictable markets I want you to think about the reasons you should **buy the PSLV ETF or call options on the SLV ETF** **for 36 USD on 1/21**.\n\nSilver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver’s USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.\n\nSilver’s primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.\n\nHistorically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been “consumed” and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.\n\nStepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.\n\nWhile the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn’t know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.\n\nThis last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.\n\nSo today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.\n\nNow why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven’t talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.\n\nThe way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.\n\nYou see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.\n\nChina, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.\n\nSo do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.\n\nIf you look at both instances of silver’s historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November.

Industry does use the stuff, but it's not exactly \"rare\".  AFAICT, the world has more than what it needs, both above ground and being mined, and there is no shortage on the horizon.

AFAICT, all signs point to the world being able to ramp up silver mining \"as needed\".\n\nImportantly, AFAICT there is no huge \"need boom\".  \"The industrial space\" isn't changing AFAICT in a way to where it needs much higher amounts of silver in order to keep going as compared to current.

With nobody flocking to \"the safety of silver\", there is even less reason for a price spike.\n\nGold is a metal which has properties that make it basically shitty for every purpose, even jewelry.

Shares of the Canadian technology company rose in early trading.\n\nThe world’s largest retailer aims to add 1,200 Shopify sellers this year, Walmart executive Jeff Clementz said in an interview. The company’s marketplace site, which already offers more than 75 million products, grew at a faster pace than Walmart’s overall web business in the first quarter, and third-party sales are typically more profitable as the sellers pay a fee to list items and often shoulder the delivery costs.\n\nThe collaboration is Walmart’s latest attempt to expand the scale and profitability of its $21.5 billion U.S. e-commerce business, which is gaining ground on market leader Amazon.com Inc. but continues to lose money. In recent years, Walmart has rolled out a fulfillment service for third-party sellers, allowed customers to return marketplace items in its physical stores and jettisoned millions of third-party items that didn’t meet quality standards.\n\n“There are many Shopify sellers who were already on Walmart.com, but we have not penetrated their base to the extent possible,” said Clementz, who is vice president of Walmart Marketplace. “There’s a tremendous opportunity.”\n\nFor Shopify, the deal -- expected to be announced as early as Monday -- provides its network of millions of merchants access to Walmart’s customers, and follows a May linkup with Facebook Inc. that allowed retailers to import Shopify product catalogs to the social-media giant’s new Shops service.\n\n“Few companies in the world match the sheer size and scale of Walmart,” said Satish Kanwar, Shopify’s vice president of product. The deal opens the door for small and medium-sized businesses “to access the 120 million customers who visit Walmart.com every month.”\n\nThe deal is “a win-win for both companies,” said Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce researcher. Still, the partnership diverges from Shopify’s typical strategy of acting as a platform for brands competing with large retailers, he said.\n\nShopify’s U.S. shares rose as much as five per cent before regular trading Monday in New York, even as the Canadian and U.S. markets were poised to decline. Walmart was little changed.\n\nFounded in 2006, Shopify has become the platform of choice for businesses large and small that are looking to get online cheaply and quickly. Monthly fees start at just US$29, which buys a virtual shop and everything that’s needed to run it, including tools to manage payments, inventory and shipping.\n\nThe Ottawa-based company claimed the second-largest share of online retail sales in the U.S. last year, and its meteoric growth has made a billionaire out of German-born founder and Chief Executive Officer Tobi Lutke.\n\n \n\n**Slow Start**\n\nWalmart introduced its marketplace site in August 2009, but progress was glacial at first as the retailer was focused more on its massive brick-and-mortar business and slow to recognize Amazon’s growing clout. That started to change when Doug McMillon became CEO in 2014, and accelerated when he put Marc Lore in charge of the retailer’s U.S. e-commerce division after acquiring his online startup, Jet.com, in 2016.\n\nLore quickly added millions of new third-party items from small vendors who were happy to have an alternative to Amazon’s dominant site. Later, he took a page out of Amazon’s playbook by offering shipping services for third-party vendors through Walmart’s massive logistics network.\n\n“We need to start playing offense,” Lore said at a February investor conference.\n\nMcMillon wants to get even more out of the business, especially after shuttering Jet last month. “We don’t think that we’ve done everything we must do, and should do, to support marketplace sellers in terms of the tools and services that we have available,” he said at the conference, just weeks before virus-related stockpiling sent traffic to Walmart’s website soaring. First-quarter U.S online sales rose 74 per cent, more than twice the growth rate that Walmart had previously forecast for the entire year. Walmart has since withdrawn its financial guidance due to the pandemic.\n\nTo bring more direction to the marketplace business, Walmart named Jeff Shotts to run it last summer as part of a broader restructuring that sought to better integrate the online business with its physical stores, which often act as e-commerce distribution hubs.\n\n**On and Off**\n\nClementz said the two companies had been in talks on and off for years, but discussions heated up over the past six months. A recent pilot test with several Shopify sellers went well, and he foresees eventually having thousands of sellers on Walmart’s marketplace.\n\nThere are risks to opening the doors to more and more sellers. Walmart’s marketplace, along with Amazon’s, has faced criticism over the years for carrying offensive items like Confederate flags. In recent years, Walmart has pulled about 20 million items off the site that didn’t meet its quality standards. Though Amazon’s marketplace is open to virtually anyone who goes through an online registration process, Walmart’s is invite-only so it can vet sellers. It also uses machine learning and keyword recognition technology to spot suspect sellers.", "id": "h9gh44", "created_utc": 1592228141.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Bravo SHOP", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Shopify is 15% of my portfolio 😉😂👍", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "27% in mine!

{"title": "A primer on valuing publicly traded growth-stage companies.", "selftext": "Seeing a lot of misinformation around ZOOM technologies ($ZM). WSB consensus is that this is overvalued, a bubble based on astronomical P/E. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but this look at P/E or P/S is very misguided and misses the relevant drivers of valuation entirely. In fact it's a criminally bad fundamentals analysis. The error comes in the form of investments being put in the 'wrong' place on the financial statements, on the income statement hurting earnings, when in your DCF they should really be capitalized on the cash flow statement. \n\nDefinition:\n\nGrowth-stage company: A company which is reinvesting all or a significant majority of its earnings in order to generate more growth through capital investments, R&D, or SG&A. Within growth stage, we have companies whose investment takes the form of infrastructure and capital investment (early Walmart), and companies whose reinvestment takes the form of hiring engineers, salespeople, and product managers (early Facebook).\n\nA mature company: A company which is partially or totally focused on increasing earnings, and achieves this through some smart reinvestment of earnings alongside significant cost-cutting measures. Examples include pretty much any CPG company.\n \nCompanies which are capital intensive are required to generate earnings on the income statement so that they have actual money to reinvest in land, buildings, and equipment. If early Walmart had not generated cash flow, they could not have built more stores and they could not have grown. A very high P/E ratio would have signaled that the earnings potential was incompatible with the expectations baked into the stock price.\n\nOn the other hand, if investment takes the form of personnel, there is no need to actually generate earnings on the income statement in order to grow. Just enough cash + earnings to buy minimal equipment (can be very close to zero in the age of AWS), and the rest is spent on income statement expenses, and there does not need to be anything left over. Add in stock-based comp and this earnings can go negative while the cash position remains healthy. So if you take a P/E on this kind of company you get a nonsensical result. If I were a CEO at this kind of company I would try to sandbag earnings as long as possible so my stock-based comp can over time expand significantly resulting for large rewards for myself and my employees while suckers missed out on the opportunity. (Bill Gates has actually admitted to doing this).\n\nLooking at Zoom specifically, best metric to use is a DCF on gross profit less steady-state operating costs. Looking at purely a gross profit multiple we have around 100x, which will fall to around 30x-40x in just 12 months based on a growth rate of 150% and then further. We can say right away it's not a grossly overvalued company. Looking at where it traded pre-covid, it's potentially overvalued by a factor of ~2, and it could in fact be undervalued.\n\nThe drivers of valuation here are solely around the competitive landscape (Microsoft Teams being the biggest, also Zoom's current advantages/disadvantages factor in here), and the long term TAM of video-conferencing, as well as the 'stickiness' of the product -- this last one is especially important. Essentially these factors and the interplay between them will tell you whether this stock is overvalued or not. Zoom's GM is very strong which indicates a very strong business, and can't go up significantly from here. But fundamentally it's a very profitable business assuming that the aforementioned factors above can remain in its favor. \n\nI wouldn't be a buyer here given that the FAANG companies are gunning for it and I expect them to succeed eventually(stickiness determines tail value in the DCF/acquisition value and my belief is that it won't be great, but this is a model sensitivity), my advice is that it's not a short based on either fundamentals or momentum.
