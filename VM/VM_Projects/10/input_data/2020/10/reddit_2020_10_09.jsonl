{"title": "Do more expensive stocks have higher options premiums?", "selftext": "I've recently been selling weekly covered calls on my existing positions as well as selling cash-secured puts on stocks I want to own. I was wondering if higher priced stocks have higher premiums because there simply aren't as many sellers? For example, let's take Amazon at $3,200 a share. If you want to sell a covered call you need 100 shares = $320,000 which is quite a lot of money for people. On the demand side, perhaps since the stock is so expensive you have people who can't even afford one share and instead buy options as a way to gain exposure to the stock. This theoretically also drives up the option premium. Now of course people don't always cover their asses, maybe they sell uncovered calls and non-cash secured puts but you'd still need a good amount of money to be able to stomach those kinds of potential swings.", "id": "j7p2on", "created_utc": 1602203463.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "You’re overthinking it.\n\nExtrinsic value of an option is based on the expected move of the underlying during the life of the option and how far it’s away from the current underlying price.

I don’t know if these are true, but that’s not the point. \n\nNow your question would be: given the above two assumptions, is it safe to assume that the higher priced underlyings will have higher IV (relatively more expensive options?). \n\nMy response to that is high relative to what? To other products? No, it depends on which underlying tends to be more volatile. \n\nThe only baseline we can use is realized volatility.

Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap  - Friday, October 9, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today as market participant’s closely monitor developments in a new virus-relief package amid mixed signals from top officials as to the size and scope of a proposal they might support.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) led the day, finishing the day 1.53% up. The S&P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.\n\nTraders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trump’s recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. \n\nAccording to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, let’s hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!”\n\nAdding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President “wants to do a deal.” This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trump’s recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.\n\nYesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the President’s interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, “A compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Wall Street Journal reported that  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in advanced talks to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion. Shares of AMD were down more than 4% because of the dilutive effect the deal will have on the stock. XLNX was up 14.7% throughout the day.\n* The personal-computer shipments rebound that's benefited from a surge in remote work and study during the pandemic carried into the latest quarter with a 12.7% increase from the year earlier, the highest growth in a decade, according to research firm Canalys.     \n* Weed stocks have been on a tear recently, after VP Kamala Harris said the Biden Administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. \n   * Aphria (APHA) up 28% this week.\n   * Canopy Growth (CGC) up 27.5% this week. \n   * Aurora Cannabis (ACB) 8.2% up this week.\n* Wedbush tech analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his conservative neutral rating on Gamestop (GME) and kept an $8 price target despite the recent partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). \n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it will make posts harder to go viral ahead of the US election, including placing limits on how users can retweet to try and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n* Sky Solar Holdings (SKYS) announced it completed its merger with Square (SQ). As a result, SKYS is now a subsidiary of SQ and will no longer be publicly traded.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it will permit some staff to permanently work remotely.\n* Rocket Companies (RKT) was upgraded by JPMorgan from NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT with a price target of $28.50, price is currently around $23.\n* New Street Research  analyst Pierre Ferragu issued a SELL rating on $NVDA with a price target of  $400 , a loss of about 25%. Most analysts rate as BUY or better.\n* JPMorgan analyst Richard Shane upgraded Rocket Companies from Neutral to Overweight and cut his price target from $31 to $28.50.\n* VFC had target raised by Telsey Advisory Group $72 to $90 at OUTPERFORM, and also by Robert W. Baird from $65 to $85 at OUTPERFORM.

Most will have to watch a tutorial but if you go to wash your car in my country most require you to do that + if you get towed you need to put it in neutral. \n\nA/C controls in Tesla are also done on the tablet just things older generations won’t/don’t want to learn or it will be difficult. \n\nTesla clearly is the leader and Elon is a cool guy who wants to do many things I support but it’s a slow change. Older People can’t just get used to a Tesla that fast the boomers and some young people who can afford will get a Tesla but the rest will look for alternatives. \n\nMy personal perspective:\n\nNio will grow 100% in the next 1-2 years anything beyond that is speculations whether or not they can keep up with other EVs.\n\nTesla is the future it’s like Amazon too big to fail. It’s the future due to the fact global warming/climate change. We need the EVs and Tesla is able to mass produce them + 25k for a new Tesla in the near future is a joke for Europe and America it’s very cheap if it can run 1 million miles with as low maintenance as current ones.\nAnd it’s America’s little son America won’t let it fail. I have never seen a company like Tesla it’s loved by most. it’s innovative and does NOT STOP IMPROVING they aren’t apple make a similar product each year without actual improvements. They want to make cars affordable and also safe resources along the way.\n\nI have zero doubt about Tesla’s future but their stock imo seems so high that I simply can’t get myself to buy and hold. But that might be because I said the same when they were 300 pre split and then at 500 pre split I said well can’t get any higher at 1000 I said I’m a student and can’t afford that at 1.5k I said ouh well too late 2k I won’t look at that shit ever again 2.5k okay time to just cry.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Fri, Oct 9, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap  - Friday, October 9, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today as market participant’s closely monitor developments in a new virus-relief package amid mixed signals from top officials as to the size and scope of a proposal they might support.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) led the day, finishing the day 1.53% up. The S&P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.\n\nTraders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trump’s recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. \n\nAccording to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, let’s hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!”\n\nAdding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President “wants to do a deal.” This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trump’s recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.\n\nYesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the President’s interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, “A compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Wall Street Journal reported that  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in advanced talks to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion. Shares of AMD were down more than 4% because of the dilutive effect the deal will have on the stock. XLNX was up 14.7% throughout the day.\n* The personal-computer shipments rebound that's benefited from a surge in remote work and study during the pandemic carried into the latest quarter with a 12.7% increase from the year earlier, the highest growth in a decade, according to research firm Canalys.     \n* Weed stocks have been on a tear recently, after VP Kamala Harris said the Biden Administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. \n   * Aphria (APHA) up 28% this week.\n   * Canopy Growth (CGC) up 27.5% this week. \n   * Aurora Cannabis (ACB) 8.2% up this week.\n* Wedbush tech analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his conservative neutral rating on Gamestop (GME) and kept an $8 price target despite the recent partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). \n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it will make posts harder to go viral ahead of the US election, including placing limits on how users can retweet to try and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n* Sky Solar Holdings (SKYS) announced it completed its merger with Square (SQ). As a result, SKYS is now a subsidiary of SQ and will no longer be publicly traded.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it will permit some staff to permanently work remotely.\n* Rocket Companies (RKT) was upgraded by JPMorgan from NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT with a price target of $28.50, price is currently around $23. Edit; before it said Realty income (O), that was a mistake.\n* New Street Research  analyst Pierre Ferragu issued a SELL rating on $NVDA with a price target of  $400 , a loss of about 25%. Most analysts rate as BUY or better.\n* JPMorgan analyst Richard Shane upgraded Rocket Companies from Neutral to Overweight and cut his price target from $31 to $28.50.\n* VFC had target raised by Telsey Advisory Group $72 to $90 at OUTPERFORM, and also by Robert W. Baird from $65 to $85 at OUTPERFORM.

Pretty bullish action.\n* Mcdonald (MCD) had target raised by BMO Capital, Jefferies Financial, Truist, and BTIG Research to $235, $265, $246, and $245.

We have played this stock since March, it is an absolute beast!\n* Marvell Technology (MRVL) with a myriad of price target raises from Needham, Benchmark, Cowen, Oppenheimer, Deutsche Bank on average around $50. \n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) once again with a barrage of price target raises from Loop Capital, Cowen, Barclays, Raymond James, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Needham, Piper Sandler and Jefferies Financial. On average they have $160 target, and the stock is at $140, most of them are OVERWEIGHT except for Citigroup which is NEUTRAL.\n* On Semiconductor (ON) had target raised by Jefferies Financial and Deutsche Bank to $31 and $30 respectively, they both rate at BUY. This is a nice call, as Deutsche bank is well respected, and semiconductor stocks have been hot hot hot... Keep an eye out!\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raised by Barclays  from $107 to $126 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Amazon (AMZN) got the price target raised by Mizuho to $4,000 at BUY. really bullish call! \n* Silver and Gold great performers today\n\n\"The best revenge is massive success\" Frank Sinatra", "id": "j869pj", "created_utc": 1602274015.0, "score": 312, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Really enjoying these posts - thanks for putting it together /u/psychotrader00", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Of course!
