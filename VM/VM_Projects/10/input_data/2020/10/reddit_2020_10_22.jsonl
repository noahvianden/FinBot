Sure.\n\nBut the remaining times you would be better off selling your shares right away.\n\nLet's take an example. Imagine you own 100 shares of IBM. You can sell the shares now for $115.76 each.\n\nOr, you can sell an ITM call (let's say you sell the $110 call expiring on 11/20 for $6.75). Here are the possible scenarios with the call:\n\n1. **IBM is at or above $110 on 11/20:** you sell your shares for $110, and you keep $6.75 of premium. Which means you effectively sold your shares at $116.75 ($0.99 more than just selling your shares right away).\n2. **IBM closes between $110 and $109.01 on 11/20:** You keep your shares (which you can sell them right then at $109.01-$110) And you keep your $6.75 premium, which means you can make $0.00-$0.99 more per share than just selling the shares out right today.\n3. **IBM closes below $109:** You keep the shares and the premium. But now when you sell the shares at $109 or below, you lost money. For example, if IBM closes at $105, then you sell your shares at $105 and you kept the $6.75 premium which means you effectively sold your shares at $111.75 (instead of selling them at $115.75 today).\n\nYou can see that in case 3 the shares can drop dramatically. The question is what are the chances of each of these cases? Here are what the Black-Scholes model gives:\n\n1. Probability of IBM closing above $110 is 78%.\n2. Probability that IBM closes between $109 and $110 is around 3%.\n3. Probability that IBM closes below $109 is around 19%.\n\nThere is a 9% probability that IBM closes at $105 or below. This is a large enough probability to make you doubt taking that risk and locking up $11576 for 30 days just to make an extra $99 of potential extra gain. Like I said, there is no guaranteed profit. Options are priced pretty fairly such that every profit comes with a comparable risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS, the reason I chose IBM is they're a large enough company that already had their earnings out, so the options prices would reflect regular pricing and not include any earnings inflated IV.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Wow thanks very helpful info.\n\nI guess no one ever got rich selling CCs", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "OP, a simple google search would have answered your question.

I have usually told people on here that you don't have to worry a lot about diversification until your portfolio begins to accumulate $20,000 or more.  If you try to diversify too much before then, you end up with one or two shares of \"this\" and one or two shares of \"that.\" \n\nThe best way for beginners to actually make make money, learn the market and diversify all at the same time is to invest in ETFs.  ETFs are \"Exchange Traded Funds\" that take your money and then invest in a large number of stocks for you. \n\nSo, for example, you could invest a little every month into a fund called \"VOO.\" This fund uses the S&P 500 Index as its benchmark. So your money will be invested in 500 different companies in the same proportions as the index:  6.6% in Apple, 5.7% in Microsoft, 4.8% in Amazon, 2.2% in Facebook and so on. \n\nETFs trade exactly like stocks, so if you learn how to trade an ETF or two, you also learn how to trade stocks.\n\nOne of the big reasons I like ETFs for beginners in the market is that broad market ETFs like VOO will move with the overall market. You are less likely to lose money by picking the wrong stock. If one company within the fund has a bad day but the overall market is good, your portfolio will be unaffected.  If the overall market goes down, your portfolio will go down with it, but that's likely going to be the case if you pick individual stocks, too, because many individual stocks tend to move with the market. \n\nOnce you've built up a little bit of a portfolio with an ETF, then start expanding your portfolio into more individual stocks once you have researched them and learn a bit about the market.\n\nAs to your question about dividends:  Whenever a company pays dividends, that payout will be used to buy additional shares of whatever stock you own, assuming you've set it to \"reinvest\" the dividends.  Otherwise, it will just pay you in cash.  It has no effect on the stock price that you purchase new shares for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*This isn't financial advice. I'm not a professional.

Other models due in 2022 and later will be available for under $100,000.\nThe Hummer EV is meant to compete with Tesla’s pickup, the Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production late next year.

The stock finally had its golden cross this year. Other than that it has been pretty mediocre with no amazing news. This puts it in a position where there is plenty of upside. I think the slow upward trend will change with their next earnings call. People are overly hyped on electric.

I keep seeing the same questions asked in the daily thread, and am nostalgic for the days when occasionally one of you Schwabbjockies who knows a thing or two would come along to ELI5 options strategies. \n\nSo here is some “FrEe OpTiOnS” advice to give you a fighting chance at tightening up the next YOLO before 2020 is up. \n\n*Q: “when should I buy weeklies vs leaps bruh?”\n.\nA: “when you can literally afford to burn $1,000 x 253 market open days per year.

Yes it feels incredible when it hits, but can’t time this market. \n\n-Weeklies kinda used to be possible, like Dance Dance Revolution on Expert Mode. Now it’s like playing Dragonforce on Guitar Hero while simultaneously playing DDR against an army of methed out Korean children. \n\n#So then...how do us basic bitches even “use Robinhood” correctly?\n\n-Debit Spreads. Not credit spreads. You can graduate to credit spreads when you learn how to do basic fucking math. Allows you to buy more heavily ITM options. Max risk. Pussy capped gains. But it allows you to trade without buying shitty ass fractional shares. \n\n-Buying more heavily ITM Options : if you have to play weeklies, you’ll have a fighting chance. Additionally, would be more likely to sell viable options premium closer to strike in the event you need to ghetto spread out of there. \n\n\n-Time: it’s your friend. YOLO a small lotto play on Way OTM calls that expire in 2022. Forget about them, come back, find surprise tendies. That’s called “not burning money to the ground”. \n\n-There’s plenty else.

My bullish sentiment towards AMD is due to two main factors: \n\n1. An arguably better product line thanks to their zen architectures.  \n2. A much better improved company culture which is reflected in their business decisions as well as their RD .  \n\n\nProduct-wise Ryzen has been a blessing, and is the reason for the increase market and mind share in the consumer CPU space. What a lot of people ignore is that consumer CPU really doesn't matter for the bottom line. Neither Intel nor any other non-mobile CPU manufacturer make a lot of money from desktop CPUs. The real money is in server CPUs (whiach have huge margins) and here is where I think AMD is going to show SPECTACULAR results this quarter. Their EPYC brand of server CPUs is amazing, I won't bother with technicalities because the message here is that AMD now is a serious and arguably better option for servers, which power everything that needs computing. We have observed how AMD has increasingly gained market share in the server space which in turn has increased their revenue which in turn has helped them increase RD and further improve their products.\n\nOf course, this doesn't imply that Intel is dead, it is still a huge company with larger revenue and profits. The problem for Intel (and this is my opinion) is that designing and making their own chips has became too complex with the current state of the manufacturing process. Quickly, modern CPUs used advanced photolitography (lasers and shit) techniques that are hugely expensive. This expense cuts into profits if you are the manufacturer of your chips. This is why we are seeing the continuous success of companies like Amd, Nvidia, and Apple. They only have to worry about designing great CPUs and leave the complexities of actually making them to others who are into that business AKA TSMC.   \n\n\nSo to conclude, AMD has for the past 5 years getting into a more advantageous position in the ever changing CPU industry. Making it a no brainier as an investment.
