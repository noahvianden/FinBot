I anticipate alot of AMD fans to answer this question with the growth factor being a huge plus for them.  INTC is definitely more of a value play, which may not be best for Options strategies, since all Options traders are looking for the underlying to move dramatically.\n\nThe more nuanced question is if INTC is a good buy right?  Since INTC holds a vastly larger portion of the CPU market than AMD, is it more likely to hold that position over the coming years?\n\nConversely, how much more room does AMD have to grow and how large of a player will they be in the future CPU and GPU market?  I know no one knows for sure, but anyone that has more insight into this market coulf be helpful here.  I recently researched how to put together my own PC, and this opened my eyes to a market that I was only peripherally aware of prior to this.\n\nThanks again for the input, if you wouldn't mind elaborating on why you think AMD is a better Optionsplay right now, I'd appreciate it.

This would be for a 2 year LEAPS, which is the farthest out I can get.  I'd also be buying deep ITM, as this allows for the safer sellingof PMCCs.

You're right in that they are competing in boththe GPU and CPU space, and that gives them points for diversity.  They also have a lot of growth potential.  I only am indecisive due to trying to determine if they are overvalued right now, which is where I have to do my own DD and take a closer look at their balance sheets for the last couple years.\n\nThanks for taking the time!

AMD doesn't necesaarily have to report the massive earnings INTC does to get the same kind of earnings runup in my estimation (though I could definitely be wrong about this and I invite any constructive conkecture to the contrary).\n\nThat said,  if INTC were to announce a new product that had groundbreaking potential in a field outside of the CPU field, that would obviously be a game changer and I'd be kicking myself in that case if I had gone instead with AMD.\n\nAnother factor to consider is TSM, and its role in both companies, not to mention the complicated geopolitical relations between China, Taiwan, and the US, which could have a dramatic effect on the stock price of all three companies.\n\nI know that while AAPL has decided to not use INTC chips in the future, my bigger concern is when INTC will stop utilizing TSM as a manufacturing source, and also if AMD will consider the same in preparation for a possible future trade war with China.  Whether we see a Biden or Trump presidency, it's important to think about this possibility, and how these tech companies will prepare and/or react to a possible supply shortage.\n\nAnywho, I don't plan on getting into this LEAPS call until at least after the election, if not until some time early next year, but I'm gathering info now and carefully observing this market as both companies are likely to grow over the next 2 years, and both offer somewhat safe bets with similar risks involved..but yes, this comes down to a somewhat classical value vs growth play over the next 2 years with a lot of elements affecting if and how much this strategy will be successful.\n\nIn short I will take everyone's 2 cents on this subject.

Although INTC is a much better value play for very long term investing, Options plays thrive off of increasing volatility, as long as purchased during low volatility, a good short term negative catalyst, and of course moves in the desired direction.\n\nBut I will continue to do more DD on this as I want to wait for lower volatility, a better entry point, and to make more capital at my job to make this investment..I just can't wait too too long, I'd hate for AMD or even INTC to break away and go too far out of my price range like NVDA..or TSLA (just kidding, I somehow doubt AMD could break that far away as quickly as TSLA did this year).\n\nThanks for the input.

The biggest chunk of spending came as federal spending jumped 47% due to increased unemployment compensation needs.

Sales jumped 1.9% which is more than double of the consensus estimate. “Americans raced to the stores in September,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Sal Guatieri, in a note to investors, adding that they were “buying just about everything in sight, especially clothing.”\n\nIn Europe things have been shaky as the U.K. faces resurgence in COVID cases, and a bumpy BREXIT negotiation. Partial quarantine measures have been put back in place, and negotiations between the U.K. and European Union will continue next week. Boris Johnson has told Bloomberg that he believes a deal is unlikely.\n\nHighlights\n\n* A new plan was unveiled today to get COVID shots to nursing homes, even though such a vaccine does not yet exist.

A translation of one of the German language articles referenced in the discussions says: *“The strausberg-Erkner water association (WSE) has turned off the water at the construction site for the Tesla factory near Berlin. As a result, it is currently not possible to continue building. The U.S. company did not pay its water bill, a spokeswoman said.”* Some of the discussion noted that people at the site reported that construction was continuing.\n\nIn fairness, it seem appropriate to also reference the October 15 Teslarati article [Tesla Giga Berlin operating normally despite water outage reports]( https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-berlin-water-shutoff/). The article says that construction was continuing on October 15, and cites a tweet by GF4Tesla: *“I was at the GIGABERLIN at 17:00 pm and could see that the cement mixing plant was still working and cement transporters were cleaned, WITH WATER. it looks like the water is running.!!!!”*\n\nAside from the Teslarati article, Tobias Lindh also posted a YouTube video, [Giga Berlin | 2020-10-15 | Evening Timelapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD2lhm8VQGA), with the comment *” Despite some misleading news today, the construction continued normal at Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin construction site in Grünheide.”*\n\nThe Teslarati article notes that Tesla was switching from a preliminary pipeline to a new, higher capacity pipeline, quoting Twitter user TeslaModel32, *” As I wrote before: yesterday a new contract was signed between Tesla and the water utility, probably today they switched from the preliminary pipeline to the new and bigger pipeline.”*\n\nThat doesn’t mean that the statement by the water company was necessarily false, or that Tesla flat-out ignored or refused to pay their water bill. The fact that two pipelines were involved considerably increases the chance for miscommunication. For example, the new larger pipeline could have been billed to a separate account, and Tesla could have believed (or even been informed by the water company, if there were miscommunications within the water company) that the new account included billing for the smaller pipeline, and thus that the failure to pay notices were in error. \n\nIn any event, the evidence from several sources including the Teslarati article and at least two drone operators appears to show that the water is still being delivered to the Giga Berlin construction site and that work there is continuing.

This isn’t a political statement, personally I’m thinking Sleepy Joe will win, and maybe drag the market into nap time.  \n\nPolitical nonsense aside - \n\nTarget is raising online orders at an insane rate relative to its competitors.

Their real estate team is pretty top notch, IMO.  \n\nOnto fulfillment - THEY ARE KILLING IT.  The company that competes with AMZN, will gain value in this space.  Today’s market cap of $83B feels like a joke compared to WMT and AMZN.  Leaving a lot of space for $TGT to grow past $120B.  \n\nPartnerships - we all know TGT owns Shipt.  Overstock (yes still alive) is planning to leverage Shipt for a substantial part of their sales, only growing the momentum of an already scary $TGT.  \n\nHolidays -  you’re kidding yourself if you think they won’t have a substantial piece of the upcoming Halloween/Christmas mega buys of candy and gifts.  YOY, I’m guessing this value will be +12%, and that’s a big increase in a big space.  \n\nFinancials -  Nothing scary here, very well run, no substantial debt issues, and better margins than their peers.  What’s not to like in an environment where volume only goes up?  \n\nEarnings Targets -  I feel like they’ll smash the upcoming quarter, easily.
