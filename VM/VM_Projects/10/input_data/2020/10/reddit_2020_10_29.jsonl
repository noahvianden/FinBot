{"title": "I build a tool which calculates optimal option strategies and now need some feedback", "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI've been (mostly) lurking on here for the past year. During that time, I saw a many people lose money where they shouldn't have lost money. This was especially frustrating when people were spot on with their prediction where a stock is going and still lost money because they didn't use options correctly. Or even more frequently, one could have made a lot more money with a different strategy which still would have been reasonable or by using different strike prices.\n\nThis lead me to the creation of a tool over the past few months which does the following:\n\n1. You tell it where you think a stock is going, for example TSLA being at $450 in three weeks or SPY $300 next week.\n2. The tool then takes a look at a lot of different strategies, including all kind of call / put credit / debit spreads, iron condors, even FDs and finds the most profitable one under your prediction.\n3. This optimal strategy is then neatly presented to you along with a PNL graph, some metrics etc.\n\nThis tool is now available at [velistos.com](https://velistos.com), the first ten people can use the code \"optimalautism\" to access the optimizer.

This makes it possible to rate a strategy by calculating the expected return (basically profit at price x times probability of price x) of that strategy. And that can be optimized in the sense of \"there is no other strategy which has a higher expected return\".  \nAs far as holding time is concerned, the tool currently assumes that a position is opened at the current price and closed at the given date.

It's weird seeing numbers so small for AAPL post split, is the 10 wide condor too tight? $5 moves don't seem very big but it is a different stock now at 114, the risk-reward is decent for something so binary and getting it as close to 1 to 1 is ideal (if possible).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gh9g4pxo22w51.gif\n\nI think directionally Apple (or any of these really) have set-ups for really decent debit spreads, not for tomorrow, but looking out to Nov 20th.

Feels good making a positive difference in someone else life!***\n\nBut I think it important to disclose my situation and why I'm so careful with my DD picks. For most in sub-reddit this is nothing more than a long text wall waste of time, but for you guys that use my research to assist in your gains I think it reassuring you knew somewhat who your taking advice from.\n\nI been paper trading for months while trying to scrap some savings when I was unemployed from Jan to May.\n\nAfter getting a job finally & saving up enough to payoff the past debt I racked up from the lock-down I started real trading in late August from my initial 2k made it to 8k until September slapped reality into me and ass fucked me back to $132 (welcome to REAL trading) and been carefully trading since and looking for what I did wrong. (Utilizing all my cash with no hedge for overnight holdings). Look at my post history when I started.\n\nAlso trading hard when you have a job and can't focus on the markets, you know how many opportunities I missed since mid-September since I couldn't execute a trade.\n\nPoint is I don't have a large account, hundreds of percent wins for you is literally hundreds of tendies for me. I getting there but I like to think just cause I have small dick doesn't mean I don't have a big brain or experience.\n\nAnyway if you missed what I been posting before look up my post history also the answer to the common questions:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI like to remind everyone that got specific inquiries about a specific ticker or needs live updates to go to [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/pvX9WtVuuM)\n\n1. **I simply cannot respond in a timely manner through Reddit, some you witness that today 😉**\n2. **I want to assure you my DDs will still be posted in both WSB and the discord going forward.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How are you so good and keenly accurate on your picks?**\n\n\\-Because I been looking up charts and scanning for similar patterns within a trend, reversal, and squeeze-to-breakout with the TA tools I use over and over again until muscle memory kicked in.\n\n\\-Also paper traded literally for months when I had nothing else to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What do you use for research?**\n\n* The higher the time-frame the more you notice a more powerful move.\n\n1. Anything up to 5 min. is good for scalping  think 2% moves kind of level\n2. From there 10 min to 30 min is excellent for day trading, think along the lines of noticing when a stock moves 3 - 6%\n3. Then we got the hourly's for Swing Trading from 1H (8-11%) to 2H (12-15%) & finally 4H (16+%) moves\n\n* Oscillators are good at the determining rate of movements for units, whether they are overbought or oversold while in a range with decreasing momentum or IV or increasingly  \"sustained levels of velocity\" aka does it continuously hover at or above 80 overbought or  below 20 oversold  for example.\n* All consolidation shows you is that the bears/bulls are becoming exhausted and cannot force the other to move. One about to get knocked out and other will be the winner. BB assist in this to show when implied volatility in the stock is decreasing and when someone going night-night. When there no resistance you get a breakout (volume profile too if you want to see session to session support & resistance aka when the fighters are the strongest. But that far more depth that will confuse a lot of people so I do not show it on the charts)\n* Band Squeeze does not show directional movement though, RSI/STOCH & their variations do. Anytime the indicators hover near 30 or 70 show their directional bias period, anytime it hits 20 or 80 multiple times shows a \"trend\" , finally if it passes and \"sustain\" below/above the prior numbers shows increasing momentum, this can be backed up with the MACD histogram.\n* MACD histogram- A sharp cross with the lines with a 90 degree angle shows a strong velocity move just occurred, the more spaced out the lines are in the same direction show the momentum increasing.\n* Same with the histogram: The bigger the bars in succession the more velocity the move is and for me the best indication of potential transition to a strong momentum is when the lines are in tandem hugging the 0 line whether above or below is irrelevant. This is backed by the Bollinger bands again.\n* Bollinger Bands- Just show IV, bigger they are the bigger the potential the movement both directions, when used with volume profile or a oscillator it very good at telling you if a movement is in a range (bouncing from top band to low band & vice versa). Trending (opening and closing near the band successive directional movement aka hugging) or breaking out (crosses or outright open outside the band while quickly accelerating away from the band so much so that the band simply goes vertical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this combined leads to high prob. of a breakout or breakdown in whatever time-frame chosen, well at least for me anyway.\n\n*You can always learn more at* [*https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start*](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start) *It free and plenty of explanation’s that go deeper than I ever could and plenty of examples. No need for paid courses or chat rooms. For more specific resources take a look below:*\n\n*1. TradingView for the best charts*\n\n*2. Stock fetcher for the best TA screener*\n\n*3. Stock rover for the best fundamentals and qualitative screener.*\n\n*4. Use your mainstream brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Etrade for Analysts & Fundamental Research or just subscribe to TipRanks*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What the format of your risk management? What keeps you in the game?**\n\nI position size on what I can afford to lose, meaning if I buy $500 in options it because that all willing to lose on that trade, this prevents me from having to worry about stop losses or need to hedge. There nothing wrong with these strategies but I see some flaws.\n\n1. *Stops only work in current sessions where stock will move in a flow. Next day sessions risk GAP UP/DOWN that can cause the order to trigger at far worse point if it a market order or not at at all if it completely passes if it stop limit.*\n2. *Next is hedging, the easiest way is spreads, or more specifically legging into a position to create a spread. That a far more detailed explanation that can be found in the resources below. Finally for whatever reason you cannot use spreads (cash accounts) you can always buy the opposite directional option in contrast to your position at no more than 1/3 the value of your original position. This will protect you from unexpected gaps or \"shock news\" by offsetting your losses til you can adjust your portfolio.*\n\n*This is the only time in my opinion where it perfectly acceptable to use weeklies & FDs, to cheaply hedge & potentially recuperate your losses. I don't hate weeklies, just don't have time to trade them actively nor do most people utilize them correctly,* ***THEY ARE FOR SCALPING. NOT DAY TRADING.***\n\n**\\*I don't trade more than the principal balance @ start of week to prevent out-sized losses\\***\n\n<But you retards will do what you always do, I leave it at that>\n\n**Do you hold through earnings?**\n\nUsually not, I do Lotto plays though (no extrinsic value practically, but  very cheap OTM option that likely to become in the money, so I hope)\n\nIf it successful you get a couple hundred percent, if you let it ride throughout the day usually several thousand\n\n**Do you hold through the weekends?**\n\nAlmost never, unless they're LEAPS and I'm confident in the long term trend.\n\nPlus, it forces you to take profit at END OF WEEK and restart your principal balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can you look at… When do you think it time to sell…. Will this keep going up?**\n\nI'm picking up the when I'm comfortable with risk/reward ratio and STRONGLY suggest you use your position sizing and risk management rules aka do your own due diligence\n\nThe only reason I do these post is to give people a timely heads up when something big going to happen, THAT IT\n\nI'm not going to go step by step explaining when I enter or exit.

They're also working on Hypersonic turbines and engines. This is a VERY important market for the military.\n\n\\-KTOS' financials are fantastic right now. Revenues are higher than projected.\n\n\\-Covid has played havoc with testing, particularly international stuff, and range operations domestically.\n\n\\-They're working with Northrop Grumman on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program (minuteman III follow on) and it's going to be their biggest program for many years. It'll be their bread and butter, revenue wise. It's likely to be one of the biggest defense programs in the next few years as well so it's fantastic that they're involved.\n\n\\-Their microwave tech division has a ton of contracts involving radar development, including refitting legacy fighters with ktos derived harware.\n\n\\-International target drone sales are big, and they announced that what was supposed to be a one time target drone sale is now a RECURRING international target sale. That's excellent.\n\n\\-They have 4 PUBLIC tactical drones, Valkyrie, GREMLINS, Grey Wolf, and Mako. They have other classified ones they can't talk about.\n\n\\-GREMLINS will be FRP and in service next year. That's extremely quick development. Very cool.\n\n\\-Their satellite division is doing all sorts of things, and their software division is working with Microsoft on their Azure stuff. Big projected growth from their space business. HIGH margins.\n\n\\-They have their own Skunk Works! They call it the \"Ghost Works\"\n\n\\-KTOS is NOT likely to enter the \"exotic\" drone market. THIS IS A GOOD THING. Deep black programs tend to be a money pit with very low production numbers and require a ton of R&D for not a lot of revenue generated.\n\n\\-Hiring 200 more people while other aerospace companies are downsizing.\n\n\\-Rocket Systems business will have over 20 launches in the next 30ish months. Huge future business.\n\n\\-Ownership structure is fantastic [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ownership-structure-kratos-defense-security-142719304.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ownership-structure-kratos-defense-security-142719304.html)\n\n\\-report [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kratos-reports-third-quarter-2020-200000953.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kratos-reports-third-quarter-2020-200000953.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy play? 11/20 $20 Call, 12/18 $25 Call,  1/15/21 $30 Call, But I might be hopelessly optimistic.
