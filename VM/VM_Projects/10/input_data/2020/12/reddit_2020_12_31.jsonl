If IV is high = credit spreads.  Most of my trading consists of credit spreads or credit strategies.\n\n Buying naked options in TSLA is not where I would want to be.  Look at put debit spreads in the feb 19 expiration or a diagonal by selling feb 19 670 put and buying the March 19 680 put.  \n\nI think TSLA is going to roll over but may have more room to move up before it does.  I am expecting a major down move by the end of Jan.  I have had trouble trading TSLA this year because of the IV movements.

The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 0.61% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.25%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.52% up.\n\nThe new $900 billion stimulus package - which includes the $600 stimulus payments, replenished funding for loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, enhanced unemployment benefits, and funds for vaccine distribution, among other measures ‚Äì was signed into law late Sunday. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced that the $600 stimulus checks have started going out this week. \n\nWhile the latest stimulus package will offer some support to businesses and families impacted by the pandemic, many view the $600 as insufficient and have called for further relief. Early in the week, the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives voted to pass a bill increasing the amount in the stimulus checks from $600 to $2000, the same amount President Trump demanded last week when he threatened to not sign the new $900 billion stimulus package. However, when the bill was due to reach the Senate floor, Mitch McConnell blocked considerations for the bill\n\nHeading into 2021, the pace of the vaccine rollout is expected to greatly increase, with President-Elect Biden promising 100 million inoculations in his first 100 days of office and the $900 billion stimulus package will be unleashed into the economy, offering at least some support to families and businesses. Overall, despite the economic strain induced by the coronavirus pandemic, stocks are set to close the year with very strong returns. \n\nHowever, the broader economy has not recovered as quickly. US economic output remains far below pre-pandemic levels and 9.8 million people remain unemployed in America. Moving into next year, it is crucial for governments across the world to implement effective and efficient plans to widely distribute the coronavirus vaccine. As Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors said, ‚ÄúMoving into next year, it‚Äôs going to be how these things play out. Will the vaccine be distributed efficiently, effectively? Will consumer confidence rise to the point where we could get some of this deferred consumption in 2021, which is what the market wants to see? And will consumers be healthy enough, will these stimulus checks keep them above water long enough to have some kind of return to normalcy? The market seems to be priced for these things to work out relatively well.‚Äù\n\nHey Psychos, on a personal note we want to sincerely thank you all for following us this year!

{"title": "My thoughts and Due Diligence on ABCL", "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** This is my opinion and not financial advice ‚Äì I would appreciate any feedback or comments so I can improve my due diligence in the future.\n\n**TLDR**: I want to buy ABCL, but in my opinion ABCL is currently overvalued. I had 3 red flags.\n\n1. A competitor (CERT) has about 10x the revenue of ABCL but only half of the market cap\n2. ABCL has a high valuation with a small amount of revenue\n3. ABCL have less customers than Palantir and C3.ai (competitors) and make less money on average per partner\n\nABCL has a lot of future potential. I wouldn‚Äôt buy position until May 2021 when the lock-up periods expire unless the price goes below $30 / share (which would put it at about an $8B valuation) before then to at least get some skin in the game.\n\nWhile the company‚Äôs financial performance is good, it‚Äôs current market cap given it‚Äôs revenue when compared to it‚Äôs competitors does not justify the current retail share price.\n\nBearish short-term, bullish long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 1 -** **Company Description**\n\n*‚ÄúAbCellera Biologics Inc. \\[ABCL\\] develops antibody discovery platform.* ***Its full-stack, AI-powered drug discovery platform*** *searches and analyzes the database of natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed as drugs.‚Äù*\n\nAccording to ABCL in their S-1 form, *‚ÄúOver the last eight years, we have developed and assembled technologies that unlock the database of natural antibodies.* ***We are democratizing the industry by providing our partners of all sizes with access to our centralized operating system***\\*.‚Äù\\* So essentially, they have this huge antibody database and an analytics platform to help get from point A to point B for their partners.\n\nABCL makes money through partnership agreements with industry leaders who they help solve problems. Partnership agreements can result in revenue in 3 ways:\n\n1. payments for technology access and performance of research\n2. downstream payments in the form of clinical and commercial milestones and\n3. royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics\n\nArguably the biggest biotech / pharmaceutical partnership that has been disclosed is that with Eli Lilly and Company to co-develop their COVID-19 vacine. ABCL has partnerships with a handful of companies in the biotech / pharma industry (some of which are left undisclosed on the S-1).\n\nABCL also receives grants and non-profit funding. Some of these organizations are the Government of Canada ($175.6M over multiple years) , DARPA ($30.6M over 4 years) the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ($4.8M over 2 years).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2 - Company Performance**\n\nLiquidity is **improving.**\n\n* Working capital is about $93.9M as of Sept. 30, 2020 according to the filed S-1 form. This is substantially better than the $4.8M reported on Dec. 31, 2019.\n* Current ratio is 5.7 per September 30, 2020 data in S-1 form\n* Receivable Turnovers improved over 2019 levels (even when 2020 grant money and milestone payments are removed from revenue to be conservative), but it is important to note that it is still at about it‚Äôs 2018 level.\n\nSolvency is **improving.**\n\n* Free cashflow has improved significantly\n* Debt to total asset ratio was deteriorating between 2019 and the September 30th, 2020 reporting period. Accounts payable and deferred revenue grew but current portion of long-term debt was significantly reduced. I would expect this to improve with the cash raised from the IPO.\n* Times interest earned ratio  has improved over the 2019 reporting period but is still below 2018 levels . The improvement is largely seen from the reduction in interest expense that were carried from 2018 to 2019 and the increase in revenue for 2020.\n\nProfitability is **improving**\n\n* Revenue has grown this year. ABCL‚Äôs profit margin is improving. ABCL is currently growth oriented so I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath on them becoming profitable soon.\n* Basic EPS from S-1 form shows improvement for this year (so far) over 2019 and 2018.\n\nSo the company is performing well and has a great product, but why has the stock been dropping since IPO day?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3 - Market Position**\n\nThis is where things get interesting. It‚Äôs hard to find a strictly apples-to-apples comparison for ABCL. They are in the biotech field but are more of a data science company (keeping in mind they sell their services and access to their AI-powered drug discovery platform).\n\n**Predictive versus Prescriptive Analytics**\n\nOne company that performs a similar service to ABCL is Certara (CERT). CERT provides customers with simulation of virtual drug trials with virtual patients to predict how drugs behave in different people. Reading the 2 company descriptions, we can see a slight difference with their platforms. CERT appears to use a predictive analytics approach where ABCL uses a prescriptive analytics approach.\n\nCERT also rely on a larger customer bases where as ABCL has a small and arguably more focused client base. While both are providing a similar service, CERT has about 10x the revenue of ABCL but only half of the market cap (**red flag #1**).\n\nHaving said all of the above, to dive deeper we need to compare ABCL against other prescriptive analytic companies. I‚Äôve picked 2: Palantir (PLTR) and C3.ai (ticker is AI, but I‚Äôll continue referring to them as C3.ai to avoid confusion).\n\n**ABCL, PLTR and C3.AI Revenue Per Customer**\n\nAt the time of writing this, here are some of the relevant metrics for ABCL, PLTR and C3.ai:\n\n**Prices: (USD/share)**\n\n|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|34.97|34.97|25.30|145.32|\n\n**Market Cap (Billion USD)**\n\n|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10.243|5.349|47.502|13.928|\n\n**TTM Revenue (Thousands USD)**\n\n|ABCL|CERT|PLTR|C3.ai|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|29,449|232,746|999,940|164,725|\n\nHow does ABCL have such a high valuation with such a small amount of revenue (**red flag #2**)?  It seems strange that ABCL could be valued at about 20% of PLTR (or roughly the same value as C3.ai) when it only makes a fraction of the revenue.\n\n**Maybe it‚Äôs related to the number of partners they have (or at least have publicly disclosed)?**\n\nWhile we can‚Äôt know exactly how many customers each company has, we can try to guess at the revenue per partnership (or at least by looking at the largest ones they‚Äôve disclosed) ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very rough estimate but we‚Äôre just trying to figure out orders of magnitude here.\n\nPLTR in their S-1 form disclosed that their platform is used by 125 customers. For their TTM revenue, that works out to about $8M per partner.\n\nUsing the same idea for C3.ai who has publicly advertised 26 partnerships, their revenue is about $6.3M per partner.\n\nABCL has 26 customers, but with such low revenue, they only make about $1.1M per partner. So, **ABCL have less customers than PLTR and C3.ai, and make less money on average per partner (red flag #3).** Again, this is just to approximate about how much they‚Äôre making per partnership. It‚Äôs not an exact number but it gives us an idea if the price is out to lunch or not (which I think it is).\n\n**So why is the share price so high then?**\n\nI think this is a case of supply and demand. The IPO was hyped up and there‚Äôs still less than 30% float. Lock-up period per S-1 form is 180 days, so don‚Äôt expect any big insiders to sell anytime soon.\n\nThe $17.50 price tag wasn‚Äôt for us, just Peter Thiel and the bunch.\n\n**Peter Thiel you say?**\n\nYes, Peter Thiel. The same one at PLTR. Peter Thiel had a position of about 8.5M shares before the IPO and picked up another 3M on IPO day. He also sits on the Board of Directors for ABCL (since October 2020).\n\nIn the S-1 form, ABCL outlined their desire for growth. They have new facilities under development and are scheduled to take occupancy in 2021. **From September 2019 to September 2020, ABCL has grew their workforce by 82%, moving from 98 to 174 full time employees**. Since September 30, 2020 there have been 50 different job postings advertised on ABCL‚Äôs website. They are looking at some serious growth.\n\nWhat really gets my excited about Peter Thiel on the Board of Directors is that there are a lot of similarities to how ABCL forms it‚Äôs partnerships for access to it‚Äôs platform to PLTR. Who do you call when you have a problem that you can‚Äôt solve but have lots of data? There really is not a better person to have on the Board of Directors for ABCL, especially after having such a big influx of cash to get to the next level as a company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 4 - Final Thoughts**\n\nI think there's a lot to be exited about with ABCL. It's a young and innovative company. With it's low revenue levels and high stock price, it's hard to justify picking up stock at it's current valuation.", "id": "knee80", "created_utc": 1609373558.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Buy the PLTR dip.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with you", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way. üöÄ", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Great DD, thanks for your effort!

They are based in 11 Countries (Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ivory coast, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda, Morocco and Kenya).   They operate similar to Amazon.   Just a few thoughts.   These countries have been literally going sideways for years.   I think with advance of Tech, social media and American tech platforms able to infiltrate these economies,  we are going to see an incredible breakout to the upside.  Lots of these countries are ripe for a boost in economy.\n\nI think the political climate was main thing holding these countries back but with advance of social media,  THE PEOPLE have more power in their hands and the rulers are relaxing things a bit due to pressure (Arab spring etc).   Lots of these countries are also investing heavily in Clean energy.  Lots of solar plants etc.   China is also investing heavily.   So in short,  you are going to see exponential growth in next few years.   Jumia has hit the ground running and they are currently leading.

However, even if it did go bankrupt in 3-4 months then I‚Äôd have recovered over half of my entry cost so losses would be mitigated. I‚Äôm assuming I can make at least 0.3 per contract each month selling the weeklies with an initial cost of $1.6 per each leap at the $.05 strike.\n\nIf they go bankrupt within the next couple months I would lose bigger. \n\nThe main idea isn‚Äôt necessarily to profit from selling the weeklies, it‚Äôs more to lower the cost of buying the leaps to zero or less. Once that happens it should be more clear whether AMC is going to have a comeback. If it looks like they will make it then I can just hold the leaps and sell for profit close to expiry.
