{"title": "Whats the downside using margin to sell covered calls?", "selftext": "I live outside US so the only available broker for me is IBKR for options. I use the Pro version and the best thing is that they offer very low interest rates. It's only 1.59%. That means if I loan $100k I just pay $1.59k/year. Now my plan is to use that money to sell covered calls.   \n\n\nLet's say I buy 100 shares of AAPL. It currently is at $131.99 so that would cost me $13199. If I sell a covered call at $137 strike expiring 31th December it would earn me $550 premium. Now I imagine the only downside is if AAPL goes down. My breakeven would be (13199 - 550) / 100 = $126,49. But this could be mitigated by buying a Put option.   \n\n\nIf AAPL goes up to $137 and my call gets executed then I would still earn 5.01 \\* 100 + 550 = $1051. Then with that money I could sell cash covered puts (wheeling).   \n\n\nAlso a question to my fellow IBKR users, can I sell naked calls and only when it gets executed do I have to loan the money. So I don't pay interest if my call doesn't get executed.  \n\n\nAm I missing something? I appreciate any insight and strategy recommendations as I am very new to this.

Like .3 delta from current price. \n\nI put limit buybacks on my sold calls for 50% profit every day unless there was like a gap down or something.  I generally let puts go to expiration unless I'm worried about a pullback I will put 75% profit limit orders in them though if there is a surge. I prefer selling weeklies but sometimes ill sell monthlies too. I kind of stagger everything. I never sell two of the same calls at the same time.

{"title": "Ocugen analysis", "selftext": "#OCUGEN\n\nHello everyone, since it is the Christmas season, I have done up an analysis on a company called Ocugen which recently partnered with Bharat Biotech to co-develop COVAXIN. Before I begin, please do your own DD before purchasing of stocks and do not fully rely on my analysis.\n\n##What is Ocugen?\nOcugen is a leading biopharmaceutical company which focuses on discovering, developing and transformative therapies to treat diseases such as blindness. Their breakthrough technology was the modification of gene therapy which has the potential to treat multiple retinal diseases with just one drug.\n\nOn the 22nd of December, Ocugen partnered with Bharat Biotech to co-develop the India-based company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the US Market. Under the partnership terms, Ocugen would have the US rights to the vaccine candidate and will be responsible for clinical development, registration and commercialization in the US market.\n\n## Update as of today \nhttps://www.livemint.com/science/health/indian-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-has-drawn-global-attention-icmr/amp-11608855811924.html\n\nBased on the article above, the Indian vaccine is getting attention from the media and I believe that reporters are starting to be aware of what they are doing.\n\n1) Data generated from phase I and II showed that the vaccine itself is impressively safe, and it has spark Lancet's interest in publishing them. The phase III trial in India is currently ongoing at 22 sites.\n\n2) The last date of enrolment of Phase III would be on 31st December, and we will determine the results by then. If it is successful, then investors like you and I will watch the vaccine being rolled out worldwide.\n\nhttps://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/bhopal-after-giving-1700-volunteers-first-covaxin-dose-second-to-be-given-from-dec-26 \n\nBased on the article above, Bharat Biotech is currently at the Phase 3 of its clinical trials and the first dose has been administered to over 1700 volunteers and it will start giving its second on 26th December. \n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/bharat-bio-seeks-marketing-nod-again-for-its-vaccine/amp_articleshow/79946393.cms\n\nBased on the article above, Bharat Biotech has recruited over 13,000 volunteers which is half-way mark of recruitment of 26,000 participants for phase III clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/24/2150312/0/en/Ocugen-Establishes-Vaccine-Scientific-Advisory-Board.html\n\nBased on the article above, the Scientific advisory board consists of established and experienced management levels. It consist of Big players who works in Pfizer\n\nBased on Shanker’s linkedin, he worked for Pfizer for 14 years as their senior director and then became CEO of Nuron which is a vacinne maker. Based on such management level, doesn't it help to build a strong foundation for the company? A simple fundamental to start investing in a company is to have good management team and this checks the box.\n\n## Key efficacy of Bharat Biotech Vaccine\n1) Vaccine - Inactivated Virus\n2) Percentage of people who developed antibodies - 98.3%\n3) Antibody levels - Comparable (1x)\n4) Prevalence of serious side effects - None reported\n5) Current stage of development - In phase III trial\n\nAt the outset, it shows that the vaccine may be comparable or even slightly better than its peers on some parameters. When volunteers are given COVAXIN, 98.4% of them developed antibodies compared at day 56 to 100% at day 28 after the two-dose regimen in the Coronavac trial, based on phase 2 trial data.\n\n## Conclusion\nTo conclude, I hope that this fundamental analysis will allow the people who FOMO-ed into the stock to have a peace of mind.\n\nFor those that have rip, congratulation and hope that you will rip more profit from it.\n\nI'll keep this post updated for any news that are coming in!
