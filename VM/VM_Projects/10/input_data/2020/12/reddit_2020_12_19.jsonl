I gave it some consideration and also realized that such videos could possibly be faked by dissidents.  \n\nMy one year view was that Wall Street would do anything in their power to pump the stock markets right up to Election Day.  However I also was hoping for a correction along the way.  So I started selling to raise cash and was prepared to go all in on any correction. \n\nIn January, people I followed (including the unknown-at-the-time Tony Fauci) were talking  about the low but real risk of a disease situation.  \n\nStock markets were pumping, though, as I was selling to raise cash.  \n\nThen came Super Bowl.  Jim Cramer, an NFL addict, season ticket holder, and someone who never misses a Super Bowl actually skipped out of the game and rushed back home to issue a sell warning.  He'd talked to a handful of people including Tepper and Fauci, who clearly had the same intelligence sources as Trump, and they said the virus in China was real, and terrible.  \n\nHe issued his warnings and was mocked here and by all his TV colleagues, as stocks were continuing to surge in January and February.  I started selling more aggressively.  Was I making a mistake, now going well above 50% cash in an election year that I knew was going to be stock-market fuelled?\n\nThen came March.  People were still in denial.  \"It can't happen here\" was the prevailing sentiment.  Until it did.  Sports and entertainment shutting down overnight.  Schools closed. Market circuit breakers every day.  One thousand point drops, two thousand, three thousand.\n\nEven with the selling I'd already done, I was losing massive amounts of money just like everyone else.  \n\nLate March would have been the time to buy back in.  But you really couldn't if you were a sane person.  Nobody knew the fatality rate, or if you'd need your cash just to buy food or medicine.  Thoughts were of family, of volunteering, of how many perishables to buy, of making sure your will is written.  It's one thing to see human life disregarded by China, but now we were seeing democracies like Italy with dead bodies stacking up like cord wood.\n\nI was slow to get back in.  Some companies I had huge faith in, like Square, I'd refused to sell earlier.  They were now demolished.  I had to guess which ones could or would survive a historic recession or depression. With Square being primarily used by face-to-face businesses, and face-to-face looking like a death wish, I cashed out on a \"modest\" 60% gain, thinking I could always buy rebuy it in 2021 if the world is still there.  Travel, leisure, discretionary, luxury, had to go. Online services, digital, e-commerce... keep.  Startups, dump.  Big box monoliths, keep.\n\nI didn't trust the stock market recovery soon enough, so it took a while to scale back in.  Frankly, I still don't trust it.  Record shattering stock markets while tens of millions of people have no jobs and no prospects is illogical and inhumane to me.  \n\nThat disconnect between common sense and market mania have made me skittish.  I'll take a short, sharp, profit now, even if it triggers taxes.  I don't know when the boot of Main Street reality will kick in the doors of Wall Street.
