Now most ETF's track July and August but June is pretty important for two reasons. The crash in oil prices to below 0 was due to the contracts not been able to be sold like they normally are on Monday and Tuesday. This caused prices to turn negative as they could not be delievered. \n\nMay contract is over but another beast awaits the horizon. The brent June contract which expires on the 30th. Now because brent is slightly different it is unlikely to hit negative. However, as the time looms due to no demand for june expect a massive drop to prices. I am predicting at least 10. Maybe 5. \n\nThis would drive the price of WTI for june july and august down too. As they are correlated. \n\nAs this is happening on the 30th expect a slow decline Today or tomorrow.

I'm sorry for that. I'm not going to get to technical but I'll give you a quick breakdown of the fund and what I would recommend.\n\nFirst off, as you probably now, USO is an ETF based off of WTI futures. What happened earlier this week with May futures did not impact USO directly as the fund had no May futures contracts.  USO owns futures contracts 2 and 3 months out. About two weeks prior to expiration they roll over, so they rolled over their May contracts in early April to June contracts.\n\nWhen people talk about \"contango\" they're referring to to the future price change. To simplify this, contango occurs when USO owns June futures for $30, but when they roll over they're now only worth $20. This is an oversimplification but I think it gets the point across.\n\nNow to answer your question, will USO recover. Well, technically it's possible. But this week it's no longer trading based on the underlying asset. The fund also announced a reverse 1:8 split, so your option contracts will stay the same but the strike price will be 8x the current price. Reverse splits are never good for investors.\n\nPersonally, if I had a $200 position I'd just let it ride. A $200 loss is insignificant to me, however, if you have a really small account I would sell your contracts at market price and chalk this up to an important lesson to not buy/sell options in ETFs you don't fully understand.\n\nHope this oversimplification helped!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That did help, and 200$ is not a big deal at all.

For a variety of reasons supply will not drop as fast as demand.  If supply stays constant, demand drops, ergo price falls, which is why the price for gas and oil today is low.  That is just basic supply and demand.\n\nPeople who transact in oil think the demand is temporary problem.  \"V\" shaped recovery and whatnot.  Demand will be higher in July, August, September, etc., than it is today, therefore price will be higher.  So the price for delivery of a barrel of oil in August is higher than delivery of a barrel of oil now.  This is the contago -- the future price is higher than the current price. \n\nNow this specific incident has become a \"super contago\" or whatever because all these oil folks, guessing there will be higher oil prices in August, are (were) in a mad rush to find places to store their current oil and have it sit idle until demand and price rushes back up.\n\nWhen there is a contago in the market, people have to pay a premium to roll their futures contracts forward.  Oh, you have a May or June expiration contract, but you don't want to actually take delivery of oil?  When you \"roll\" that May delivery  into a July or August delivery, you pay a premium since future oil is more expensive than current oil, since no one actually wants more oil on their hands right now.  This all comes to head because USO is an ETF that does not actually take delivery of oil -- it doesn't have a bunch of storage containers.  It has to pay a premium to roll its contracts forward.  As a result, the price of oil could stay absolutely unchanged, or even go up by a bit, and USO would still lose money as it pays that premium to roll each month.   What makes this episode extra funny is that there are record retail traders pouring money into USO, meaning USO has to go buy more futures contracts at the exact moment when the market is weakest, storage is most expensive, and contago premiums are highest.  People think it might go entirely under because USO is apparently one of the few long positions left in the futures market (no one but retail wants to go long oil using this trade) so it is particularly f'ed when it has to roll all these contracts (since no one else really wants this position).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I misspoke, thanks for no proof again", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Relax, engineer.

Second to SLB.\n\n**22B TTM revenue is about 60M revenue every single day. This company is HUGE and has been around since 1919. They are not going anywhere.**\n\nFor Q1 2020, Halliburton reduced total debt by 500M and extended debt maturities out to 2030. By issuing 1B at 2.92% due March 2030 and redeeming 1.5B of notes ranging from 3.5-3.8% they also reduced their interest expenses. **This resulted in LT debt declining from 10.3 to 9.6B.** The early debt redemption resulted in a 168M loss on extinguishment. Further, they have a revolving credit facility with a capacity of 3.5B, which expires March 2024.\n\nDuring the quarter, they spent 158M of cash for dividends. Surprisingly, they did not mention Q2 dividend guidance. The loss was a non-cash impairment and also included the 168M loss on extinguishment. **Adjusted net income excluding impairments and other charges was 270M or 31c/share**. Given all the craziness in Q1, they actually made money.\n\nSecond, they spent 100M for stock repurchases. The stock repurchase plan should be cut to 0 for Q2. Because of these actions, they were able to deleverage some debt but their cash on hand declined from 2.2B to 1.4B. Not a big deal since they have a **current Ratio of 2.0. THIS IS HUGE. They have massive LIQUIDITY for the next year to survive this environment.**\n\n**Of their 9.6B debt, only 11M is due this year, and 697M is due next year. 8B is due after 2024.** In 2019, they paid out ~630M of dividends to shareholders and purchased 100M of stock. These 2 are discretionary items. Maybe they cut their dividend and stop buybacks for a quarter?\n\n**53% of there revenue comes from North American companies like Exxon, Chevron, Devon, Hess, Occidental, Chesapeake and Pioneer.

Guarantee some loans? A director also bought $3M worth of shares at 8.68 yesterday.\n\nSLB did 33B TTM revenue but has a market cap of 23B. HAL did 22B TTM revenue but only has a market cap of 7.8B.

If u really want to buy am OTM option, make sure you have time value in it, maybe a few months, for example. Always, check the Delta of that option.
