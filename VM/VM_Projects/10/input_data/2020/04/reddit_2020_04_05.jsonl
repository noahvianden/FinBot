{"title": "Someone on Quora made a really good point on why it’s a good idea to go all-in on Tesla.", "selftext": "I was 50-50 on QQQ and VTI. However after reading this post I am gonna switch to all-in on Tesla. I think they’re gonna grow as big as Ford, GM and so forth one day. Below is the full post. \n\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-does-Tesla-continue-running-and-making-cars-if-they-lose-money-every-year-From-where-do-they-get-the-money-to-continue/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=10&share=3dd4d100&srid=uumtx\n\n\n“You are falling for a common line put up by Tesla-haters and short-sellers.\n\nTesla does sell cars for more than the cost of making them. Some estimates say 30% more.\n\nFor people like you and me - we’d call that a “Profit” and by the standards of the car industry, it’s a very good one…but it’s not strictly profit if you go and spend it all.\n\nRemember: For all the noise that’s made about them, Tesla are a TINY company. Ford and GM each make between 5 and 7 million cars every year. Tesla makes about 300,000 cars per year (2019). They are a tiny fly-speck of a company compared to VW and Toyota - both of which dwarf Ford and GM.\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE EXCESS MONEY YOU MAKE?\n\nSo what should Tesla do with that “profit”? Put it in the bank? Use it as a stock dividend to pay back their investors? Pay back their loans ahead of schedule?\n\nNO!!!\n\nThat would be completely, INSANELY, STUPID!!\n\nTesla, have Model Y owners who ordered a car and will have to wait a year to get it. As of February 2020, they had 550,000 pre-orders (and climbing) for the CyberTruck and they haven’t even chosen the site for the factory they’ll have to build to make it in!!\n\nWhen you have a HUGE backlog of orders, the only sane way to proceed is to grow the company - and to keep growing it until you can meet the demand for your product.\n\nTherefore, they should take every spare penny they make and every penny they can borrow and use the money to build more factories!!\n\nMore factories means more cars can be manufactured - which means MORE money to build MORE factories. Tesla built the world’s biggest factory out in Nevada - and then beat it by building an even bigger factory in China - and now another just like it in Germany. They announced another in the USA heartland - and plan to triple the size of the factories in Nevada and China.\n\nThis is absolutely the right thing to do - right up to the point where they become like Ford and GM who can’t grow any more because they’ve run out of new customers who want to buy their cars.\n\nTesla’s stated business plan is to DOUBLE in size every 18 months…and you know what? That’s PRECISELY what they’ve been doing since the day the company was founded.\n\nThey went from one small factory - to one small one and one Gigafactory in Nevada…doubling in size.\nThey added a second Gigafactory in China - doubling to two Gigafactories in 18 months.\nThey’re building one more in Germany and another in the USA - so they’ll soon go from two Gigafactories to FOUR.\nEach Gigafactory can be doubled or even tripled in size…they’re designed to make that possible…\nAs a small(ish) business, growth is everything. When eventually you DO hit that limit and stop growing - then your shareholders will be sitting on stock that’s worth a hell of a lot more than they paid from it - and the fact that you stopped growing means that that 30% you make on every car you sell can be used to pay back all of those investors.\n\nIt would be UTTER MADNESS to post actual profits at this point in the company growth cycle.\n\nSO WHY ALL OF THE PEOPLE WORRYING ABOUT TESLA PROFITS?\n\nIt’s possible that some of them are idiot share-holders who bought shares in the hope of big premium payments. If they did, then they deserve all they got.\n\nIt’s very certain that most of the complainers are the “Short Sellers” of Tesla stock who assumed (incorrectly) that they’d fail and lost billions of dollars due to Tesla’s meteoric stock rise. In order to try to stomp on the stock price growth, they’d go on (crap) TV investment shows and badmouth the heck out of Tesla. “THEY AREN’T MAKING A PROFIT!!!” (which sounds bad to people who don’t understand business).\n\nThere are various other groups of people who are terrified about the rise of electric cars. The Big-5 auto makers, the oil companies, the car dealerships, the car mechanics and service people. People who love their loud monster-trucks and muscle cars.\n\nAll of those people will grab any stick that comes to hand to beat Tesla with.\n\nThe idea that “They never had a profitable year!!!!” sounds plausible as a major problem - but that just shows either a profound ignorance about businesses - or a desire to spout FUD (“Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt”) to anyone who will listen.\n\nDon’t be that person!\n\nWHAT OWNING STOCK MEANS AND WHY YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT PROFITS.\n\nSIMPLISTICALLY:\n\nWhen you buy a share of stock in a company (which, say, puts out a million shares) - now you literally own one millionth of the company.\n\nWhen it grows, “your” company buys more stuff - more factories, more robots, more subsidiary companies, more car designs, more technical innovation - or whatever it is.\n\nNow, because this is a “share” - you also own one millionth of that ‘stuff’. You own one millionth of a bigger company. Your shares are now worth more - so if you want, you can sell them and earn an actual profit…hooray!!\n\nIf the company uses it’s profits to hand out stock premiums instead - then you got given one millionth of their profits for that year - but your stocks probably don’t rise in value too much.\n\nBut either way, you got more money. So logically, if you buy your stock when it’s priced appropriately, then it doesn’t matter to you whether they spend their profits on growth or on handing out stock premiums…either way, you make money.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIf Tesla were turning a consistent year to year profit - it would be a sign that they’ve either hit the limits on car sales - or just stopped trying hard enough…and THAT would be the time to worry about their future.\n\nSmall companies who want to get big don’t try to make a profit - they invest in growth.\n\nDo you remember that tiny, obscure, website - the online book seller? What was their name? Oh, yes “Amazon”. All they did was sell books. They made huge losses on things like free delivery, fast delivery, etc…and they grew.\n\nIt took FOURTEEN YEARS for Amazon to turn a profit…they are now one of the biggest and strongest companies on the planet!\n\nSo YES - Tesla don’t make much of a profit (although they have had a couple of profitable quarters). But they have BY FAR the greatest technology, BY FAR the most enthusiastic customers…they need to grow…and FAST.\n\nThey would be absolutely INSANE not to re-invest every penny in growth…that’s how they’ll get bigger than Ford, then GM, then VW, then (maybe) they beat Toyota.”", "id": "fvj7or", "created_utc": 1586113390.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I’m really good at buying and holding.
