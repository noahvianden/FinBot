{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 24, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 24, 2020**\n\nStocks rallied today with market participants optimistic that an effective coronavirus vaccine can be deployed in the near term. The Dow Jones hit 30,000 points for the first time ever, extending a crazy rally of more than 10% in November. In spite the good news, the surge in coronavirus cases continues in the US.\n\nThe Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 1.53% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.41% up and the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.61%. Overall a great day for the market.\n\nExpectations for relatively quick distribution of the vaccine has analysts upgrading their growth prospects for 2021. A fully inoculated public would bring back beaten-down industries, like travel and cruise lines, that were devastated by social distancing guidelines. As a result, market participants have rotated out of stay-at-home stocks like Zoom (ZM) and Peleton and into reopening and cyclical stocks. \n\nThe political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden‚Äôs win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden‚Äôs team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, ‚ÄúWe believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,\n\nMarkets were also encouraged by Biden‚Äôs appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.\n\nFinally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Big banks were on fire today, performed very nicely today. Especially Wells Fargo (WFC). \n* Tesla (TSLA) reports that its new battery sells could give semitrucks more than 600 miles of range.\n* General Electric (GE) warned employees that more job cuts are coming to the conglomerate's jet-engine business because of the pandemic's impact on commercial air travel even with the promise of a vaccine on the horizon.  \n* Yunji (YJ), a membership-based, e-commerce platform, announced it had signed a cooperative framework agreement with Douyin, a live streaming platform owned by Bytedance.\n* Despite posting better-than-expected earnings, iClick (ICLK) fell 10% after opening 6% up in the day. This is one we like, keep it on your radar.\n* Elon Musk has surpassed Bill Gates to become the second richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos.\n* Urban Outfitters (URBN) with target raise by Barclays from $26 to $37. Stock currently around $31.\n* Extended Stay America (STAY) target raised by Barclays to $17 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $13.\n* Moderna (MRNA) target set by SVB Leerik at $60 at UNDERPERFORM. Huge downside given stock is around $100.\n* Honeywell (HON) target raised by Robert W Baird from $167 to $221.

It has tumbled from \\~700GBX ($9.10 USD aprox.) to \\~120GBX as of now. The stock was hilariously oversold s boomers jumped ship, while its stock lost over 80% of its value its actual revenue dropped 23% (H1 2020).\n\nIt's not just a widebody jet engine manufacturer, it granted is still about 45% of overall revenue. It's defence arm actually grew their profit 19% YoY (H1 2020). Another key point is that most of its engines are already out in the wild and aftermarket sales and service is a significant generator of revenue over the service life of all their products. Therefore, it's not their new engines that are likely to be taken out of service if the airline industry struggles or even fails to fully recover.\n\nAs a further point to that rolls Royce is one of the few countries in the world with the skills and experience to design and build small scale nuclear reactors.

Funding secured. He later admitted he picked the $420 share price as a joke to amuse Grimes, according to the SEC.\n\nAt this point, the short shorts were drooling and the barbarians were at the gate.  \n\nWith the Grimes' creative direction, Musk recorded RIP Harambe on his new Emo G soundcloud account.\nhttps://m.soundcloud.com/user-209448905/rip-harambe1\n\nFinally as short interest was at an all time high, Elons master squeeze was ready.

Now these huge indexes are probably counting on people to paper hands their shares at 450, 500, 550, etc. and buy them up slowly, causing the price to steadily rise. If all us autists who have shares and calls STOP FUCKING SELLING from now on, the indexes will have no choice but to buy at current prices, causing the price to skyrocket. Again, during my extreme analysis with charts and graphs which I cannot post here for confidential reasons, indexes will probably look at the last week before inclusion to buy heavily if they see us not selling.\n\nHonestly, TSLA will probably hit 600 this week and run up to 750 by 12/18. GET IN NOW AND DIAMOND HANDS THIS SHIT.\n\nEverything I said here comes from my ass so do that as you will.\n\nPositions: 2x 12/24 550c bought after announcement.", "id": "k0fodg", "created_utc": 1606258101.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Bro 750 by Dec. 21st, 1000 by end of March 2021", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "The S&P inclusion for Tesla got changed to Dec. 1st BTW.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the heads up, was unaware", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I looked on Google, couldn't find any info there on the date change.

{"title": "WSB Calls the Top", "selftext": "I think we can all agree the market right now is retarded. Stupid high valuations, SPAC pump and dumps, China-mania, all while the real economy collapses and the country is about to go back into lockdown. Most concerning of all, there have been nothing but gain posts for the last few days, and that screams bear flag. Not even mama Yellen can save this steaming pile of bull-shit. \n\nObviously we shouldn't start sucking cock and buying SPY puts while we're still making money. Ride the wave, etc, etc. But unfortunately for the retards, stonks do sometimes go down, and if that happens we are all fucked.\n\nI just read that \"fundamentals\" DD about how 90+% of the market runs through passive loser funds that follow the retail geniuses here at WSB. It seems simple to me that if we are capable of causing the current bull runs on tech, EV, SPACs, whatever, we can also start a bear run. So we just gotta figure out a way to coordinate, if a critical mass of retail sells off and flip bear: the algos follow us, the market collapses, and we all get filthy rich and gay like we always wanted to be. If we don't start the inevitable bear market, then eventually some Wall St Christian Bale fuck will.\n\nFor once, the institutions will hold our bags. Even if it fails, at least we'll show them we're gay before our account goes to 0.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr:\n\ngme 20c 1/15", "id": "k0gr8a", "created_utc": 1606261847.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Shoo!
