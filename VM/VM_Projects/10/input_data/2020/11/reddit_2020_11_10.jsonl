{"title": "My stock picks that have outperformed the market these past few weeks.", "selftext": "I made a few DD posts about a number of stocks a few weeks ago. All of which have destroyed the market. I started to doubt myself for awhile as these plays didn't pan out but one by one the market caught on. These are all very interesting stocks that you should all put on your watchlists. I will list the plays chronologically in the order I did my dd, give updates on how I played these stocks and provide some additional dd.\n\n\n1.) Twitter\n\n\nThe play then: I saw that Twitter was approaching all time highs on dumb hype. Also with investigations underway and the overly optimistic earnings expectations being priced in, I figured this stock was due for a correction. \n\n\nWhat happened: They put out a bad earnings report and crashed hard.\n\n\nThe play now: It's down from the high of $52.50 to around $42.50 currently. At this price, a neutral play such as iron condors is your best bet. Mid-long term, you should start thinking about buying puts if it goes up around $45. \n\n\nWhere I'm at now: Unfortunately I didn't stick to my DD. I sold my puts before earnings. I saw SNAP went up 40% in one day after they smashed earnings, which carried over and caused twitter to go up +10% 2 days before TWTR's earnings. This scared me a bit so I sold and lost about 50%. I redeployed this money into another play on this list however. (Side note:  Ignore these sections if you don't feel like reading. I added it for extra transparency and to avoid explaining myself in the comments) \n\n\n2.) Rite-Aid \n\n\nThe play then: Looking for the next GME I went back to the 2019 playbook and started looking at RAD. It was trading for about $10 a share, and was looking pretty undervalued as it had been selling off for a few months. They announced an acquisition of a smaller pharmacy chain which caused them to dip even further to around $9. I figured that if they got a good catalyst they could recover a lot of their losses over the past month and potentially trigger a short squeeze.\n\n\nWhat happened: This one actually just started to pan out after the election as the rest of the market recovered a bit. But today it really started to take off as the company announced it would be rebranding ([Also check out their new store design. Looks like Tim Apple designed it or something lmao ](https://chainstoreage.com/rite-aid-unveils-new-branding-testing-store-future-design) ) Up over 25% on the week.\n\n\nThe play now: Short interest is still really high for this stock. The squeeze I have been chasing has yet to happen, but it is looking pretty grim for the short sellers at this point. It has hit $18+ a few times this year and the recent recovery merely brings it back to it's non covid low for the year. 12/18 calls are your best option as they have earnings on the 12/17. \n\n\nWhere I'm at now: Today my RAD $13 11/20 calls finally got back to what I paid for them. I doubled down today actually and since then I'm up 50% overall. \n\n\n3.) Party City\n\n\nThe play then: I'm not gonna lie this DD was based off a half baked thought I had, that I reinforced by reading what the idiots on stocktwits had to say. I took it with a grain of salt but they were actually right. I saw this stock was at around $2.50 about a month ago. This was a squeeze chasing play to find \"the next GME\" as well. The market was far too pessimistic about the company's summer sales due to covid, and I figured they would be better than expected. Sure gatherings are banned and what not, but a lot of people have a lot of time on their hands, and there hasn't been much to do lately with the restrictions.\n\n\nWhat happened: Stores were packed for last minute Halloween shopping. I observed this myself by shopping at one of their locations. There was a line around the store, and a full parking lot I had to park at a nearby McDonalds. They kept going up 5%+ a day then smashed earnings yesterday and shot up another 35%. Currently they are trading at $3.12.\n\n\nThe play now: It looks like it's holding above $3. There's no reason this stock couldn't go up to $5+. Calls are the play as long as you choose a date and strike with good enough liquidity. Personally based on my experience trading this ticker, I'd go with both calls and shares 50/50, same with RAD as well actually. Psychologically this helps because it's frustrating waiting for option prices to update when the liquidity is low especially on Robinhood. Also you almost always get shitty fills with cheap stock options. I still would recommend calls though because like I said theres the chance this thing could be the next GME. \n\n\nWhere I'm at now: This stock took a beating for awhile but I've finally clawed my way back to what I paid for my calls. Like I said, I went with calls and shares. I used shares to buy the dip, and I'm up 50% on those. So on the overall position I'm up about 25%.\n\n\n4.) Kohl's\n\n\nThe play then: Kohl's was clearly positioned better than it's competitors and the retail sector as a whole was looking due for a rebound. (I made a number of posts about this).\n\n\nWhat happened: Kohl's, Macy's, and Nordstrom all shot up this week. Kohl's has outperformed Macy's but underperformed Nordstrom on the week, but Kohl's is up about 23.5%. \n\n\nThe play now: Like I said in previous posts, I believe Kohl's is positioned much better than rivals. They actually managed to turn a profit last quarter and they had analysts raising price targets prior to last week. They're also doing Amazon returns in their stores I've heard, which seems like a smart move. Their earnings report coming out a week from today (11/17 pre-market) should be absolute🔥. Also just to inform, Macy's and Nordstrom both release earnings 2 days after Kohl's (11/19). If Kohl's earnings are really good both stocks will go go up likely. But I expect Macy's earnings will be subpar in comparison, which could lead to even more of a boost for the stock later in the week. Overall I expect investors to start dumping Macy's and picking up Kohl's, and I'm surprised it hasn't happened already. The whole department store model is much more durable than the Macy's model which is too dependent on malls and lower income customers. Overall I still think this stock has a lot of potential. You can check out my previous posts on this if you'd like because I could go on and on with this dd. \n\n\nWhere I'm at now: I'm kind of Salty about this stock though ngl. I bought a bunch of 11/20 calls and then doubled down after exiting my TWTR position. I more than doubled my money in a few days but after a red day I sold for 30% gains a few weeks ago. I'm thinking of opening a new position to play next weeks earnings but I can't help thinking that I'd be living large right now if I didn't sell. Oh well I guess.\n\n\nAnyway, enjoy your hookers and cocaine my dudes. Good luck.\n\n\nEdit: I'm gonna continue adapting this strategy of squeeze chasing. It is essentially random intuition that I back up with research and analysis to make predictions. It's hard to describe my process but if you look at the charts of these four stocks you will see one major similarity. I need to get better at technical analysis but the one thing I will say is that fundamental analysis (ie financial statements) is mostly trash this day in age. What you have to look for is signs of potential future optimism/pessimism. If you understand the stocks you buy, this will be easy. I have a Rite aid in my town, I shop at Party City, I use social media apps, and my mom shops at Kohl's. So I should be able to know just by walking in a few of these places the vibe of the company. \n\nSo if I get an optimistic vibe from one of these companies I go look at the charts. Up 35% YTD? \"Damn well I guess everyone else already caught on.\" Down 35% YTD? \"Let me do some research as to why this is.\" If it amounts to \"Because it's Gamestop. Everyone knows they suck! lol\" then that's my cue to buy.\n\nAnyway stay tuned I plan on making more DD posts in the future once I see some good opportunities.", "id": "jrt9it", "created_utc": 1605041326.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Sold my RAD at 11 thinking it would go back down to 9.75.

They've made a number of strategic investments these past few weeks. The acquisition of Bartel Drugs is the only reason they dipped below $10, because that's what typically happens when companies make acquisitions. The deal was pretty favorable to RAD though from what I read. They also had their credit rating raised not too long ago and they hired a marketing company recently as well which probably has to do with this rebranding. I'm sure there will be a sense of optimism following the earnings report regardless of what the numbers say. Personally I would hold. It seems like worst case scenario is that you lose your gains and sell for slightly less than what you bought for. But theres a serious possibility it could go up to $15-$20. Your deltas gotta be getting up close to 1 at this point so think you'll be making $100 per contract each time this thing goes up $1. \n\nKeep in mind this stock is only priced $3 higher than what it was when they were on the brink of bankruptcy and had to do a reverse stock split.

Go look at the 5yr chart on Yahoo finance where they factored in the split. I'm actually going to try to contact robinhood and get that corrected because it has been bugging the shit out of me.

All of the out of favor stocks that desperately needed some investor support received injections of capital today*  \n\n• *Industrials as a sector*  \n• *Infrastructure as a sector*  \n• *Consumer stocks (not just pantry goods and delivery foods)*  \n• *Health care stocks (not just research biomedical & vaccines)*  \n• *Financial stocks (and not just investment banks)*  \n• *Small cap, mid cap and large cap, all gained value*  \n• *Value stocks, as an equities class, finally saw investor support*  \n• *Base materials & industrial metals (needed for industrial activity)*  \n• *Energy (old energy, renewable energy)(needed for industrial activity)*  \n\n_______________\n\nCompare [the heat map from last week's early voter results rally (showing Biden in the lead)](https://imgur.com/73jvrvF) with yesterday's heat map. It should be clear that [the same selling of COVID bubble stocks and the same buying of real economy stocks is taking place in yesterday's heat map.](https://imgur.com/d9ke1pn). This same rally pattern that comes at the expense of COVID bubble stocks and injects investment capital into the real economy stocks has been happening with all Biden bumps and rallies.\n\n> Sidebar: [Here's the heatmap for this morning, 11/10/2020](https://imgur.com/SYSAdXI), and it shows there's a pause in the rally while a small collection of stocks continue to get cash while some other stocks continue to sell off. So the rotation is slowing/pausing this morning.\n\nThis Monday, it's become obvious that a rotation from the coronavirus bubble stocks and into the real economy stocks is fully underway. It's also obvious that [a significant amount of money for the stock buying is being taken out of COVID bubble stocks](https://imgur.com/d9ke1pn), deflating the bubble as investors take money out to fund purchases of other stocks. This is reflecting in the NASDAQ sinking while the Dow rises.\n\n**Misinformation in financial news headlines about the rallies of the past 2 weeks**\n\nHowever, last week and this week, we have a lot of writers in the media and broad conservative bias across financial news reporting that is explaining away each Biden rally as something else. First we heard, \"[Rally on relief that there wasn't a Blue Wave and that there would be a Divided Government](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-rally-presidential-election-endorsement-divided-government-evercore-schlosstein-2020-11-1029767176)\" which people seemed to believe, although it was obvious that divided government relief doesn't make sense when there was an unmet need for stimulus from the GOP senate. Now we're hearing \"[Pfizer vaccine rally!](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/09/business/us-economy-coronavirus)\" even though the rally started Sunday night in a massive overseas rally and US stock futures were raging up before Pfizer's announcement. Note that just as in politics, where there is the low-information voter, there is a low-information investor, who is constantly fooled by headlines from financial news outlets. Don't believe these narratives and spins, they're distracting from what's really happening: a Biden rally that is just starting and will continue.\n\n**Don't believe conclusions that you read in financial news headlines**\n\nArticles published in financial news about what is causing a rally or pullback are almost always made up, and daily investors know this and read past the conclusion for whatever information bits are in the articles. The conclusions about causes of rallies or pullbacks are there to distract low-information investors (let's call them retail investors and low-level pros) from keeping up with industry insiders who make money off having first mover advantage and make money off slower movers. Misinformation in financial news headlines is one way that institutional investors gain advantage over retail investors and rip them off. \n\n**Rally is a rotation into real economy stocks unleashed by Biden's win**\n\nThis is a Biden rally, one of a few so far and there are more to come. We're seeing a massive shift into real economy stocks as listed above, because we have a stable president with rational economic and fiscal behaviors who is more likely to get constructive bipartisan engagement with the House and Senate than most other politicians, and he obviously plans to put that into managing the pandemic and problems at hand to get us back on our feet. As I have been trying to inform people in the past couple of weeks, a lot of the money going into these real economy stocks will come from COVID bubble stocks. \n\n**When will the bleeding in (at least some) coronavirus bubble stocks stop?**\n\nThe real question, for those who plan to hold onto COVID bubble stocks and not sell their positions, is when will the bleeding in COVID bubble stocks stop? We have seen mini-waves of rotations so far, like the one that prompted my thread last week, that I linked above. This wave of rotations that we're in right now is going to be big because of fear of missing out. But some bubble stocks will do better than others.\n\nThe stocks that will do better than some others are those that have a strong after-Coronavirus pandemic value. Those are the best ones to hold onto, including tech stocks that have a strong workplace penetration, multiple product lines and strong growth stories. There are some bargains due to the selloff, which include Chinese stocks (their valuations were supported by real growth as China exceeds past levels of GDP for significant growth), EV and renewable energy stocks that are hitting intraday lows before recovering or taking small losses (these are the long term growers for the next few years at least), and some real estate, home and residential building stocks as there are permanent shifts away from expensive to maintain office workplaces into home working. \n\nAs far as how long this selloff will go on, I don't know, but I do know that not many professional investors feel emotionally attached enough to hold onto stocks for 4 years to get back in the green again because they bought at panic-level highs. Most would at least study the situation and take losses by trimming positions that are less likely to significantly rebound after the current selloff eases up.\n\n**Consider rebalancing your portfolios for real world (\"meat world\") traditional stocks**\n\nAlthough many in this subreddit refuse to consider real economy stocks, like transportation, infrastructure, old energy and industrials, including old tech science/engineering/research firms, I would strongly urge people to consider rebalancing their own portfolios because investing in America's real economy and infrastructure is needed if the next generation is going to live in a country that is not a crumbling, second-world nation. Investments in the future shouldn't only consist of gaming, media, cool cars and gadget companies. Industrials, infrastructure, energy and old tech stocks lift high quality employment for the nation's middle class. If ESG investing included social and environmental ideals, there should be some room for a ESI (engineering, science and industrial) investing that means investing for a strong structure and substance for a good meat world economy of the future. \n\nI would strongly encourage retail investors here to think about rebalancing their portfolios and not simply riding the bubble stocks all the way back down. \n\n**Don't get dejected or let a drop in your portfolio stop you**\n\nAnd FFS don't be upset, sad or depressed if you hold a lot of COVID bubble stocks. What's happening is a great thing. It's the US economy's capital investment coming back to life and there's a massive field of investment opportunity out there in our country's companies starved for capital that they need to survive the rest of the pandemic. You can invest in them and they will reward you if you do. There is a lot of opportunity that you might miss if you don't engage.\n\n**Don't randomly sell off stronger tech bubble stocks only to see them bounce back afterward**\n\nBeware of selling stronger stocks at the bottom of a correction and then seeing them bounce back strongly right after you sell them! Think carefully about your exits as well as your new buys, if you rebalance.\n\n**Good luck**\n\nAnd don't believe the financial press when they tell you what's causing a rally or drop in markets. They make things up that are plausible to dupe lower tier and low-information investors while industry insiders gain first-mover advantage from your disadvantage.\n\nAnd it would be great if people stopped downvoting posts that don't promote stocks that are in their portfolio.

I Personally would recommend AAPL due to its low beta as well as price and it has good option pricing.  I hope this helps and if u have any questions please let me know because they will benefit both of us :)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That makes sense! I assumed that a higher beta would mean that it moves in the same direction as the overall market, but with higher volatility - as it theoretically should, I think?\nBut I understand that a beta closer to 1 would give more consistent results over a longer period of time. \nThanks for clarifying!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ya I made the same assumption thinking it moved in the direction of the market but beta has to do with the volatility not the direction of the stock relative to the market.

I looked it up to be sure, and I think you're wrong.\n\n> Beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market. A security's beta is calculated by dividing the product of the [covariance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covariance.asp) of the security's returns and the market's returns by the [variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) of the market's returns over a specified period.   \n>  \n> The beta calculation is used to help investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. It also provides insights about how volatile–or how risky–a stock is relative to the rest of the market. \n\nSource: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)\n\nI think what you experienced with BBY would be a relatively rare scenario, and it should move in the same direction as the overall market in the long run.\n\nAgain, I might be missing something as I'm still pretty new to this, but this is how I understand it.

Essentially a high Beta in the long term expresses how the stock moves up and down relative to the markets direction.

This means that in the short term a high beta means that stocks may drop or rise in price in much larger increments than the market which I believe would explain why BBY sunk while the market rose. \n\nBasically what I’m tryin to say is that while in the long term High betas will still move in some correlation to the market but in the short term will experience volatility that doesn’t directly line up with the market. \n\nThank you for doing research tho you’ve helped me improve my strategy please if u have anymore questions reply to this because they’ve been very helpful in learning", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That makes perfect sense to me!

All the polls were saying something like 70% chances of this happening.  Democrats won 2 out of the 3.  The polls were off pretty big so senate didn’t happen.  \n\nIt’s doubtful that a republican led senate is going to want to enact green energy jobs as they deny that climate change is a real problem because they receive so much money from coal, oil, and gas companies to hold that position. The republicans leaders also bashed the green new deal to death by saying democrats want to ban meat and planes.  Which was a joke someone put out but it was a good way to distort the plan and demonize the other political party so republicans jumped on it and now that’s what their voters believe whether it’s true or not.  \n\nWhile Biden put forth a climate change plan I’m unsure how much that a democratic President can do through executive orders without a democrat controlled senate to pass laws and make money available for these plans.  There is a small chance that the two parties can negotiate something between them but it’s doubtful as republican media operation has demonized working with the democrats as being weak for years.  There is a even smaller chance that democrats take control of the senate in January if they win both the 2 senate seats up for election in Georgia but historically democrat voters don’t vote in elections other then presidential election so that would be a low probability chance in my opinion.  \n\nThe Solar energy industry has become more cost effective over the years due to [reduction in cost](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a34372005/solar-cheapest-energy-ever/) to make solar so it can make it on its own without law changes in a climate energy platform the issue is that it requires a big upfront investment to install it and the benefits take years to see on the backend.  They have financing available to do it where you pay it back in payments like your power bill or a mortgage but it’s more economical in places that get more sun and or having batteries installed to store power for use later which is still in it’s infancy.  Several US CEO’s and democratic controlled cities and states have come out and said they are moving companies and areas into greener technologies but it’s moving in small steps without a national plan. \n\nMost of the rest of the developed world on the other hand doesn’t have the anti science/ climate change philosophy of the United States so other developed countries are enacting climate change plans leading to significant growth overseas.\n\n\nTLDR - the run-up in green energy was due to assumptions that democrats would control the government.  It didn’t happen so it maybe in for a pullback or maybe solar can keep going without law changes due to democratic led presidency or the rest of the world picking up the US slack.
