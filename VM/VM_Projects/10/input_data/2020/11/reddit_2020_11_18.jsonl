{"title": "PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 18, 2020", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 18, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones finishing modestly red, despite more positive vaccine news from Pfizer (PFE).\n\nThis week, there has been great news on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, fueling optimism that the pandemic may be over in the coming months. Today, Pfizer announced it had concluded its Phase 3 trial and found its vaccine candidate to be 95% effective against COVID-19, up from the 90% effectiveness reported last week and roughly the same rate as the vaccine candidate Moderna (MRNA) is developing. According to the company, “Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics; observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%”. Pfizer said it now has the safety data required to submit for emergency use authorization with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “within days” and plans to produce 50 million doses by the end of the year and 1 billion by the end of next year. However, it is important to remember that implementing a global distribution network for the vaccine will still take some time, even after approval is granted.\n\nRecently, the market has experienced a rotation out of the previously high-flying tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks that were hit hard by the pandemic. The Russell 2000 index outperformed the market and jumped to a record-high. Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist for ProShares, expects market participants to continue to buy cyclical and reopening stocks that are cheap compared to before the pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, despite positive news on the vaccine front, coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket. In the United States, sadly the country recorded 1,707 coronavirus-related deaths, a new record since the pandemic began, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. New daily cases and hospitalization are also at record-highs, with an average of 150,000 new cases per day and more than 73,000 people hospitalized nationwide. In response to the surge, governors from both sides of the political aisle have begun reintroducing restrictions to slow the spread. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as \"feel-good\" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. \"If Iowans don't buy into this, we'll lose,\" she said. \"Businesses will close once again, more schools will be forced to go online, and our health care system will fail.\" \n\nHighlights\n\n* Pfizer says final data analysis shows Covid vaccine is 95% effective – plans to submit to FDA in 'days'\n* Boeing $BA upgraded from Neutral to Outperform by Robert W.

{"title": "By air or sea? (Airlines or Cruise)", "selftext": "I'm going in big on either UAL or NCL for the recovery. Pfizer will be approved within 1-2 weeks, and I want in before then.  \n\nI'm new to investing, but I have a lot of background on airlines. I don't know anything about cruise ships, other than I've been on one and they're the worst. BUT, there's obviously great opportunities here either way. I don't mind holding for 2-3 years. The question is, where do you park the money. \n\nUAL-Number one airline in the states. Most stable airline in the industry, has been on the incline for years (many others were heading down) and once international travel opens up, they will rocket. Granted, business travel won't be back for years if ever (and they rely on it heavily), but of all airlines they stand the most to gain down 55ishpts on the year (their peak season).  At least the first year after vaccine, it won't matter. Nobody's been out of the house for a year, and tack on a long winter and EVERYONE will be flying as soon as they can. Family, friends, vacations, the year will be crazy and I don't think they'll miss too much from business.  \n\nNCL-After that offering yesterday I feel like they're on discount for 5-7pts. They are now trading down 60pts on the year.. They have also been on the incline in recent years. \n\nThe times coming will not be normal for a while, I realize that. But in 2019:  \n\n\nUAL in 2019- Highs: trading between **$80-90** (holiday season)  Low for the whole year was **$77**, which then shot back up to **80s**. Currently trading at **$41-42.** \n\nNCL in 2019-They stayed in the **$40-50** range and peaked right around **$60** before covid hit. Currently trading at $20-21ish. Once cruises start again, up they go. Granted, they still have to prove they're not just covid outbreak boats, which could take a while. Let's say they get to $50 within two years. That's well over 100 percent return, and they still have room to grow, assuming everything's ship shape (sorry..I'm a dad). On the flipside, I can see United being in the 60s by june, 70s by christmas 2021. I have no idea what the cruise industry will do..but I believe they'll get back to 40 in the near-ish future (a year or two(..which is 100 percent.

Even if they're surprised with another hit somehow, the government won't let it happen (and united would be the last airline to go anyway). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long-winded here, and I realize there are sooo many factors involved.   \n\n\nBut if you're throwing what you have at one, which would you choose and why?  \n\nSuper grateful for your feedback.", "id": "jwnta3", "created_utc": 1605731671.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Also look into:\nJETS (airline ETF)\nAAL (American Airlines)\nDAL (Delta Airlines)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!!

And if you wanna know, I have ~$100K in this stock (https://i.imgur.com/rShgsiO.png).\n\nThe stock is MDXG and its just been relisted on the Nasdaq after time spent on OTC due to poor accounting practices years ago (channel stuffing or some baby shit that has been cleared up as far as MiMedx is concerned, it doesn't matter much now after overhauling management, their financials being audited, getting some earnings under their belt, and getting relisted on Nasdaq - putting past issues mostly in the rearview). That shits been cleaned up, theres new Management, a new PRO level board of directors, recovering sales, and a golden goose Therapeutic Biologics pipeline in late Phase studies and its going up from here.\n\nSo whats the deal? The stock is trading cheap still ($6.66) compared to prior to delisting ($17) and Analysts have yet to get on board again. In my opinion the company is still known as an Advanced Wound Care company and the current price doesnt even reflect the value for just the known AWC business, let alone reflect the golden goose that is the emerging Therapeutic Biologics business including the BIG Knee Osteoarthritis injectable that just completed Phase 2B enrollment, nor the conclusion of enrollment for a Phase 3 study of their Plantar Fasciitis (Estimated Study Completion Date April 2021) and Achille Tendonitis injectable (Estimated Primary Completion Date May 2021).  \n  \nSince delisting:   \n1. MiMedx just announced the largest U.S. Commercial payor will now provide coverage for EpiFix (One of their Advanced Wound Care products), which means its first in line to be chosen by doctors.   \n2. MiMedx has since developed their Knee Osteoartritis injectable treatment and just currently concluded Phase 2B enrollment and everything is on track to be best in class.   And it has its Achilles and Plantar Fasciitis injectables in Phase 3.  \n3. MiMedx has an Analyst presentation at the Canaccord Genuity Virtual MedTech & Diagnostics Forum this Thursday as part of their roadshow thats gearing up.   \n4. There's a Shareholder call Friday where we are likely to hear more about whats to come here in regards to the Knee Osteoarthritis treatment and other products in the pipeline.   \n5. All new Management Team and Board of Directors   \n6. Plenty of cash  \n7. Tons of new rockstar hires added to the management roster, not some scrubs.\n\nOnce analysts and more people pick this shit up and realize what the potential is, its GOING. TO. MOON.  \n\nWhy do I have such high hopes in this stock in regards to Knee Osteoarthritis? Look at UBX which was developing a Knee Osteoarthritis product that failed and it dropped their price target from $35 to $4, wiping $1.8B off their Market Cap. MDXG has likely the best product in this area and should have that factored into the price, but it doesnt YET. MDXG is still only valued at $700M which is lower than when they were just doing Wound Care prior to delisting!  \n\nWhat else?

{"title": "Buffet and Papa Musk anime crossover?", "selftext": "~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)\n\nBased on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. \n\nThis is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.\n@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.\n\nAccording to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.\n\nThe BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.\n\nIndeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:\n\nQ2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B\nQ1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B\nQ4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B\n\nSo the current $16.5B difference is not normal.\nThe BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.\n\nAssuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?\n\nAnother important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be >$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm\n\nFurthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:\n\n1) $AAPL\n2) $AMZN\n3) $BRK\n4) $V\n5) $JNJ\n6) $JPM\n7) $PG\n8) $MA\n9) $BAC\n10) $KO\n\nThere are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ\n\nNone of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.\n\nIf it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...\n25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:\n\nhttps://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html\n\nSo did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible.

Its PE is 6.7 compare to Etsy's ~71, while they basically having similar bussiness model, make the stock really undervalued.\n   In addition, the next month gonna be the best month of Ebay as the world go back into lockdown. Online sale will soar back, especially electronic sale. This is where everything Ebay favor due to the new Xbox, PS5, Nvidia new card, AMD cards and chips. They are all in shortage due to scalpers making big money reselling them on ebay. This shortage will last long and each of them sold will get ebay the juicy 10%.\n\n\n\n\nPosition: 55c or 60c(yolo+ dirt cheap) exp 01/15/2021 or \n02/2021.

{"title": "Second Wave Stocks", "selftext": "So we are already experiencing the second wave of covid and it is only going to get worse from here. States starting putting curfews and closing down some restaurants indoor eating and New York just temporarily closed their public schools. I imagine Thanksgiving and the day before, the most traveled days of the year, will lead to an even GREATER surge of covid. This will exaggerate the demand for shutting down the economy and with Biden's inauguration and political influence, I imagine the economy is even more likely to be shutdown.\n\nAdditionally, Trump just called for troops coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq which he did a few weeks before the economy shut down in March/April. I don't know if it is a signal, but it could be significant. Now the timeline may be farther out for all of this happening so I am going to be looking at longer-dated puts on companies very susceptible to the economy shutting down like airlines and casinos. Both BA and MGM have recovered quicker than many other stocks in their industries so I think they have some of the most meat on the bone if the market is to crash again.\n\nAlso, PLTR gang; that shit will keep going up. Nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I would like to add that there is no way this crash is as significant as the initial one if it is to happen.
