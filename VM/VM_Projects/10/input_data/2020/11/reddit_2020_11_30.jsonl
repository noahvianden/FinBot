{"title": "For the night owls out there with no plays in mind for the upcoming week", "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nDNauta here again with another helpful r/options post! Below are some plays that I've identified over the weekend and will be looking to keep an eye on or enter this upcoming week. I will also include a link to the chart images and a live stream video I did earlier where I breakdown these plays at the very bottom of this post!\n\nI hope this is of some benefit to you and you're able to take advantage of some of these! Keep in mind, I said \"some of these\" and not \"all of these\". I'd advise against getting in on all of them. Overtrading is a real thing! Pick the ones you like, do your own DD on them, and if you still feel like it's a viable play, then go for it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***$DIS:***  I honestly can't judge the direction on this confidently. At least for now. Daily shows run up past previous resistance level from last year December and it's holding above it on last Friday's candle, but it's still far from the upward support on the fib fan. Will need to watch the daily candles after this coming Monday-Tuesday for confirmation of whether or not it's going to hold this support. If it holds, price target is $153 with calls. If it fails, price target will be $145-140 for puts.\n\n***$AMD:***  Thinking the direction to play is upwards. Also doing two different swings with two different price targets. First swing being $92 strike for Dec 11 2020 exp, currently at $1.39. Second one being $100 strike for Feb 19, 2021, currently at $4.25. If they're too expensive for you, you can do a [debit spread](https://youtu.be/a2HJzvPi6lA) by selling the strikes I listed and buying the ones below them. For the second swing, you can also do the same strike but pick an exp around mid-late Jan. A little bit riskier and you don't get to take advantage of the earnings run up, but they're cheaper. Earnings is scheduled for Jan 26 premarket.\n\n***$FIT:***  Very long swing, not for the impatient. Looking to go with a $10 strike call with a Jan 21, 2022 exp. Currently at $0.10 for each contract. If EU approves the Google merger, these will pay nicely. BIG IF! These are somewhat lotto's. IF it gets approved and the merger can proceed, these will be good to go. I'm only going to drop $50-100 on them (money I can afford to lose).\n\n***$PFE:*** Trading above 50 EMA, 200 EMA, and hitting resistance level. If it breaks I'm shooting for 39-40 price target. Vaccine rumors say a vaccine should be ready and out around mid-December and Donald Trump says it'll be here \"soon\". So all of these together, plus the technicals set this up really well in my opinion.\n\n***$HYLN:***  Forming head and shoulders chart pattern which is a bearish signal, buy in right before the support break and profit from the drop off. Not much profit as far as my target goes because I see it struggling to break down past the 200 EMA line, but if it does I see it hitting 20-18. That'll be my target to start taking profit.\n\n***$SPGI:***  If it holds above 50 EMA, target is $350 within the week (conservative/safe target). Longer, riskier target with best case scenario is $368-369 within two weeks. $350 strikes for Dec 4 are $0.85 each. $370 strikes for Dec 18 are $0.38.\n\n***$INFO:*** Shooting for $94-95 within a week, but the earliest expiration is Dec 18. $95 strike is currently at $0.78 and $100 strike is $0.10. Shooting for the same target, but adding an extra two weeks on expected time frame is even better!\n\n[Link to charts with my notes on them here](https://imgur.com/a/xVcDPAd) // [Link to live stream video breakdown here](https://youtu.be/PVb7CxaSukQ)\n\nIf you want to learn more about trading options, trading in general, or just want to join a group of people that enjoy talking about trading and helping each other learn/earn, then check out my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/DzpjbrcR2K)!

{"title": "PMCC - AMD getting uncomfortably close to my strike", "selftext": "Need some advice on this. So I bought an AMD $80 3/19/21 a few weeks back. At the time of writing, amd is running up and I'm up 90% on the call (which is good), however the call I sold is an $94 12/11. Sold the call for $105 and the current price is at like $284. At the time it seemed like a good strike and I didn't think AMD would run up this fast. For reference, I paid about $920 for the call and the value is around $1740. \n\nWhat are my options? If it goes above $94 and gets exercised, does the $80c just get sold for whatever the current price is? I think it's very possible that AMD will hit $94 before dec 11. Do I just sit and pray that it doesn't, AND hope that if it does, it doesn't get exercised? Should I just buy the call back and eat my losses before AMD runs up even further? Or should I just wait and buy the call back if it gets above $93.50 or so? Since the $80 call has appreciated in value anyway and still has a lot of potential to go up in the coming months. My gut says that AMD won't keep running up too much more but hard to say. \n\nThe ideal situation would be to wait a couple days, let AMD cool down, and hopefully the call goes down to a reasonable price, like $100-150 and just buy it back and go with much higher strikes in the future. The other ideal situation would be if AMD keeps rising but doesn't end up touching $94 at all and expires worthless.

It should be making money as long as AMD goes up, or time passes while AMD is stagnant, or if IV rises.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What are my options? If it goes above $94 and gets exercised, does the $80c just get sold for whatever the current price is?\n\nYour short call is probably not getting assigned before expiration, unless AMD rises to well above $100 such that the extrinsic value on it is very small.\n\nIf AMD keeps rising up, your absolute worst case is having to exercise your call to cover for the $94 call assignment. This means you're buying shares at $80 and selling them at $94, netting $1400 from the shares transaction. You paid $920 - $105 = $815 to enter, **hence your absolute worst case is a $585 profit if AMD keeps rising.** So you should wish they do keep rising so you get that profit earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to a more realistic scenarios:\n\n1. On 12/11, if AMD is trading lower than $94, you can either close your whole spread for whatever profit, or roll the $94 call a week getting more premium.\n2. On 12/11, if AMD is trading higher than $94, you will be able to close your spread for **more than $14.00 netting you more than $585 profit.** because of the remaining extrinsic value on your long call.\n3. If you get assigned before 12/11, you can buy shares from the market to cover the assignment, and then sell your long call. Your total profit from this will be **$585+ extrinsic value on the long call.**\n\n* Or you can cover the assignment through exercising your long call and give up on the extrinsic value on your long call. Netting you the profit of $585 explained above.\n\n**If you can close your PMCC for $14.00 now, you can just do that booking a $585 profit.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The ideal situation would be to wait a couple days, let AMD cool down, and hopefully the call goes down to a reasonable price, like $100-150 and just buy it back and go with much higher strikes in the future.

The biggest reason is when the your are near an ex-div date and the dividend is close or less than the extrinsic value of the option.  In that case, RH would force exercise your long to cover your short.\n\nBut understand there is little to gain in going all the way to expiration, especially in a debit spread like a long diagonal.   The risk is rarely worth the reward.  So stay on top of your trades and don’t let that happen.

Why take that risk for a few dollars more of reward?  Especially when you can take some profits and re-enter later in a better position for the stock price.

If all goes well I’ll deploy more of that capital later this week, again with more time.

{"title": "(DD)Bullish case for PG&E", "selftext": "Look guys, there is sweet tendies to be had on these meme stocks and dont think for a damn second I am not feasting on them. But for the sake of diversification it doesnt hurt to look and see where there are more tendies to be had.\nPG&E Has had a rough ride but it is through the fire at this point. Pun intended. So Im gonna lay out some key reasonings as to why Im bullish on PCG and you should be too.\n\n1. They are a monopoly on power distribution in the most expensive places to live in the world.\n\n2. Before covid they were on the rise, because of the fires they have been left behind as every other stock is back to pre covid levels. This alone should be a massive bullish case\n\n3. Looking at the 52 week chart, **exactly one year ago PCG went on an absolutely insane bull run FROM $7 TO $18.** At some point this shit is gonna happen again.\n\n4. Hedge funds have been loading up on it.\nFire season is over and they handled it perfectly, beyond that in they have an agreement with the state now where they will not be solely responsible for any fires.\n\n5. The inevitability of dividend reinstatement and the free reign they have to bring it back. In the bankruptcy agreement they agreed to not reinstate a dividend until 6 billion in non-GAAP earnings. What the fuck is non-GAAP? That means non generally accepted accounting principles. So they could literally make up any reason at any time, as to how they earned 6 billion dollars. “Hey guys, every dollar we earned and got a loan for is earnings even though we didnt account for ITDA.” Nerds;”Hey PGE thats not generally accepted” PGE; “Exactly you retards, why would you let us do this”. They are on track to reinstate them based off of their average annual non-GAAP earnings in 2021 but you never know.\n\nThe last point should be the most bullish case for PCG. Dividend reinstatement is inevitable and when it happens every single boomer retirement and pension fund is going to race into this shit. Before the first fire case it had a share price of $70. Once the dividend is back this shit will have a tesla level bull run.\n\nSo dont be a 🌈🐻 and fucking pump this shit up because if we can get some meme-mentum behind this it will be insane.\n\nBuy mostly LEAPS, yolo some shit on weeklys if you’re really a gambler?

{"title": "Sell Moderna (MRNA) after first vaccines are delivered", "selftext": "Moderna and Pfizer/BNTX have both filed for EUA and are the leading candidates to deliver a vaccine first.\n\nModerna has said they'd delivery 20m units in 2020 (skeptical, given there's only one month left for EUA and then delivery). If they do, they're able to sell 20m x $15.55/unit = $311m in revenue in 2020.\n\nIf Pfizer delivers their 50m units in 2020 (also skeptical) they sell 50m x $19.50/unit = $975m revenue. \n\nIn 2021, let's estimate that the addressable market for US vaccines is about 250m or 76% of the total population. (this is only for vaccines received via the US Government contracts, excluding private insurance, etc.) If MRNA can deliver 40m a month and PFE can do 45m a month, then we'd reach 76% vaccination by May 2021 from US vaccines alone.\n\nMRNA will likely deliver total \\~220m doses to US for \\~$3.5billion revenue (100m doses @ $15.55, 150m doses @ $16.50). PFE will deliver total \\~ 280m doses to US for \\~$5.5 billion revenue (280m @ $19.50).\n\nThe real money-maker for MRNA's COVID vaccine deal comes from private/international deals. MRNA has said that they're able to sell their doses at up to $37 a dose. Let's just say MRNA is somehow able to get off 100m doses to private/international deals $37 a dose. MRNA's revenue would be \\~$3.7 billion, bringing total 2021 revenue to be \\~$7.6 billion. \n\nHowever, all of this is assuming that Moderna and Pfizer have a serious head-start over all vaccine makers out there. It appears that the mRNA methods of vaccination are the most costly. AstraZeneca has said that their vaccine would be available at $4 a dose (compare this to $20-40 for a mRNA course). Neither Moderna nor Pfizer has released details on cost to manufacture, but I can't imagine that either would still be profitable if the vaccine market price fell to $4/dose. \n\nThus the maximum revenue for Moderna from all COVID is probably $7.6 billion total. This is factoring in that MRNA and PFE have a very, very generous lead over other vaccines and are able to essentially vaccinate the entire US before anyone else does. Moderna's market cap seems quite over-valued at \\~$60billion, given that they are likely to generate max $7.6 billion in revenue (who knows what their profit margins are). \n\nShort term, I believe Moderna's likely to continue rising until it gets EUA and makes its first shipments. I would sell after. \n\n**TL:DR**: Sell Moderna (MRNA) after EUA is granted and first shipments are made.", "id": "k445mc", "created_utc": 1606767328.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Same here, im selling 2 days After the EUA at the Peak.... hopefully 🚀", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don’t tell me what to do", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, this is where my head is at.

I bought the leaps as the main bet and the spread as sort of a binary yolo. Either AMD gets to 75 by Jan or it doesn't. Intel accelerated the share gains, so in retrospect it would have been better to widen the spread but the ROI doesn't actually change that much because you get many less contracts for the principle. \n\nHow I pick spreads is I pretty much just look at the max gain vs cost and if I think the ROI is good enough vs the chance of hitting I go for it. It probably isn't the ideal way of doing it but I like using them as ways to guess the share price. If I'm right it's 5x-8x usually if you are buying pretty far otm spreads. \n\nDownside is if you are right early, you only get a small fraction of the gain vs naked and you really do need to wait it out for the money to come in. In that time things can turn against you where as with a naked or ATM spread you could have realized more profit up front.\n\nMost people buy at the money spreads with the short leg out of the money to get better some leverage and much better odds of profit vs naked but with the capped upside.  I don't think there is a right choice, just different risk vs reward. \n\nThose 70/75s cost me 38k, would be worth 0 if below 70 and 250k at expiration if above 75.  Not many bets get that kind of leverage.
