I doubt concern about off-the-shelf components will take precedent over whatever Elon Musk considers good design.\n\nAs to batteries improving (maybe in 10-20 years to be so light, unlikely in 5 years), combine that with a better designed truck and you will beat the competition.

Ridged form factor for this chemistry also has a max charge rate that puts it at a mile per day use at least 1-2 hours less a day than the equivalent diesel. The good news is heavy industrial BEVs can use regen and route optimization via regenerative braking on inclined routes, but this doesn't help as much outside hilly/mountainous areas. BEV short haul has an advantage with regulation and ideally using curtailed renewable energy to lower fuel costs. To sum up, tabless saves tesla manufacturing costs and slightly improves variety of chemical battery ingredients on the same platform, which is great for passenger/short haul 12 hour logistics (possibly ultra light long haul), but rigid form factor is going to limit them for trucking/shipping due to what modern road per axel weight can take and EU roads will be more restrictive than the US in terms of Levelized cost per mile ownership/daily operational capacity.
