{"title": "Here is a Market REcap for today Tuesday, Nov 17, 2020.", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 17, 2020**\n\nStocks fell modestly today after yesterday’s rally on the back of Moderna’s (MRNA) positive vaccines news. Despite the decline, the indexes are still having a great week. \n\nAfter Moderna released preliminary data Monday morning showing its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing new coronavirus infections, the indexes spiked before losing momentum the next day, very similar to last week after Pfizer’s (PFE) announcement. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the week plays out, given the similarities to last week. After Pfizer announced its positive vaccine data last Monday, the market spiked Monday before cooling off throughout the week, after it became clear that distribution is still months away. So far it’s playing out exactly the same.\n\nGoing forward, notable analysts expect near-term volatility in the market but are overall bullish going into next year. Seema Shah, investing chief strategist at Principal Global is bullish going into next year. She said, “Not only do we have a potential vaccine in play, but we also have all the central banks providing endless liquidity. We have fiscal stimulus on the cards and of course we have an economic recovery which either is going to be ongoing. So I think as investors look at this, there are a lot of reasons to have a pro-cyclical trade on. It’s just a question of maybe maintaining some caution as you move into that.” Mike Wilson, strategist at Morgan Stanley said, “expects the S&P 500 will be range-bound between 3,150 and 3,550 as the market grapples with rising new COVID-19 cases and restrictions, before jumping to 3,900 by year-end next year. \n\nIn other news, with cases surging across the United States, many states, both Democrat and Republican, are reintroducing restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. Larger counties were moved back into the most restrictive reopening tier by the governor, meaning that indoor dining and some other businesses would have to shut down again. He said the state was also studying curfew options.  In Iowa, Republican governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as \"feel-good\" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. \"If Iowans don't buy into this, we'll lose,\" she said. \"Businesses will close once again, more schools will be forced to go online, and our health care system will fail.\" The US recently passed 11 million cases, with the country currently experiencing record highs in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday it was announced that Tesla (TSLA) would join the S&P 500 on Dec. 21 after long speculation. Tesla would be one of the 10 most valuable companies in the index. Stock rocketed up 13% during after-hours yesterday before paring some gains today.\n* Today, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Warren Buffet’s firm, disclosed it recently added AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK), and Bristol-Meyer Squibb (BMY), all companies in the healthcare sector. Also announced it exited its entire position in Costco (COST) in the third quarter.\n* According to a report by Barrons, Apple (AAPL) has cut roughly $5 billion from its heavy spending on infrastructure over the past two years, boosting its cash flow by 10% and expanding its margins.\n* The company on Monday named Peiter Zatko, widely known by his hacker handle Mudge, to the new position of head of security, giving him a broad mandate to recommend changes in structure and practices.\n* At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter (TWTR)  Jack Dorsey touted improvements their companies made in blocking or reducing misleading information in the 2020 election. That led to less interference, the CEOs said. By contrast, it was widely reported that the 2016 election was marred by meddling from Russia.\n* According to Bloomberg, Robinhood has asked banks to pitch for roles in an initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Potential Robinhood IPO coming\n* Preliminary findings from research conducted at Cardiff University found that mouthwashes with 0.07% of the ingredient cetylpyridinium chloride showed \"promising signs\" of reducing COVID-19 in saliva.\n* Loop Capital analyst Daniel Adam initiates coverage on DraftKingswith (DKNG) a Buy rating and $100 price target.

So what you're saying is you make money if you're right. But what if you're wrong? The two DTE difference will make your long options decay almost inline with the short options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I often up a smattering of these at various strikes (overall about 10-15 to 20 strikes wide), for $1,500 total, and have seen returns of 30% easily \n\nAre you opening calendars at many strikes? or two calendars at strikes 10-15 dollars apart? if it's the latter and you're opening 2/4DTE double calendars with $15 strike difference then you will probably have your saddle below zero. Which means your profit at expiration if SPY doesn't move will be negative. You have E\\*trade, look at the risk profile. For calendars it's pretty far off reality, but gives you an idea how low your saddle it.\n\nThe problem with opening such OTM calendars is the time decay of OTM options slows down close to expiration. Which means at some point, your short options will decay **slower** than your long options. Even if IV hasn't changed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>Anything you could suggest on getting better at playing Vega on diagonals and calendars would be greatly appreciated. I really like these strategies.\n\n**I suggest three things if you're trading calendars:**\n\n1. Really monitor IV rank/percentile and only open calendars when they're pretty low or you think aren't going lower. This is key since an IV contraction will destroy your calendars.\n2. Increasing your DTE difference to be at least two weeks. \n3. Set a lower profit target (25% of max risk is a reasonable target).\n\n**For double calendars**, go closer to the ATM. 25-30 delta is as far as I would go. Lower than that, you start to see your saddle drop and it becomes harder to make money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Double calendars and double diagonals** are excellent as a strangle/IC replacement in low IV environments. Just stick with higher delta (25-40 is a nice range to be in). I love double diagonals around earnings. When you place your **shorts expiration before** earnings and **your longs expiration after earnings**, you take advantage of the slower theta decay on your longs because of the large implied earnings move.\n\nI like to set both my shorts and longs around 30 delta (so my longs will be outside my shorts) And take profits at around 15-20% of max risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here is an example of a double diagonal earnings trade:**\n\nLulu earnings are around 12/09. So I can place a double diagonal trade setting the short legs to expire on 11/27, and the long legs to expire on 12/11. There is 14 DTE difference between the front and back expirations which is fine. Also, the back expiration is behind the earnings which should make theta decay just a little bit slower than usual.\n\n**Choosing strikes:**\n\nFor the shorts, I can pick $325P/$350C (11/27 expiration) these are around 25 delta.\n\nFor the longs I can choose $320P/$355C (12/22 expiration). (or $315/$360 but it will require more buying power so I'll stick with the tighter strikes).\n\n**Profit target:**\n\nThis double diagonal is going for around $14.35 debit. Which puts max loss at $1935 (initial debit plus difference between the longs and shorts which is $5.00).\n\nSo I set my profit target at around 15% of that so around $300.

What did you learn from the process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?\n\nCohen: For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those “no”s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.\n\nMost investors couldn’t get past two hurdles: competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble. But I was convinced being focused on the pet category along with high-touch customer service gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. Pets.com was a good idea but a decade too soon and without sufficient scale to cover their costs. These two hurdles didn’t scare me. I never considered changing my business plan. One highly respected venture capitalist told me he would be more interested if we were selling live pets over the internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he believed running into Amazon’s teeth was suicidal.\n\nI understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.\n\n[Source](https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/amp/)", "id": "jvvgux", "created_utc": 1605628738.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "I wish I could give you more upvotes.
