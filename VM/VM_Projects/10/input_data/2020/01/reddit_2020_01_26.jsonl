{"title": "$TSM", "selftext": "You have to be literally autistic not to go all-in on these guys. Main supplier of AMD/AAPL/NVDA. Pretty much the main supplier for everyone aside from INTC or some shit, and who gives a shit about those clowns who can't even break 10nm. It's rumored they'll be manufacturing with TSMC too.\n\n5nm/3nm? Only 2 boys going hard on this, globalfoundries and TSMC. What the fuck is even a goldenfoundry, imagine actually paying Singaporean wages when you can pay Taiwanese wages.  Also Samsung apparently has some foundry or some shit but who cares about those gooks. \n\nEDA big boys - CDNS and SNPS - pretty much decide the market and no one even knows about them. They pretty much engineer the entire back end flow of IC manufacturing. What is their #1 foundry partnership? You guessed it. They don't even use technology libs from other foundries. If their customers go with alternative foundries they will spend millions resolving quality issues related to incompatibility between tools.\n\nWhen market goes into 5nm/3nm, 2-3 years from now, I bet these niggas at TSMC will completely dominate the market. Oh and coronavirus doesn't affect it, Taiwan is a literal island, but people will be scared of it because it's China, so I'm betting FEB/MAR will be the best months to buy, then it's moon only.", "id": "eu61ml", "created_utc": 1580041304.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Late dickhead", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I have calls for 60 lets go", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oof", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Fxi puts are working for me", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I'm in 4/17 but it physically hurts to see my contracts drop from 70 to 33 in like half a week.

{"title": "The missing factor", "selftext": "You've heard of technical analysis, that TA only works because of other investors are utilizing it, most investors, even experienced fundamental traders understand basic support and resistance levels. \n\nI base some of my investment decisions based off of basic support and resistance levels, however we all know it's no real guarantee, just a good way to see \"okay people buy the stock around this price, and people sell the stock around this price.\" Good information to have, but no guarantee. \n\nNext we have Fundimental Analysis, we look into earnings, and other basics of the company, how much the stocks current price is based to it's value etc. (Price to earnings ; P/E ratio) \n\nThis is valuable information because we can see if the company is profitable or not, it's good information to have, a profitable company might conduct a buy back, or offer dividends, these are great to attract investors, but again no guarantee.\n\nSo what do we do now? Typical investors will factor in these two, and make an educated guess on the market.\n\nWell the real answer is stocks go up because people are buying it, and stocks go down because people are selling it.\n\nThats it, that's all that really matters. It doesn't matter about P/E ratio, TA, Moving Averages or anything else. \n\nNo one is factoring in the actual investors.\n\nAre other investors buying the stock, buy it, because that's the only way the stock will continue to go up, it's profitability and past technical indicators mean nothing.\n\nShake Shack, Beyond Meat, Nvidia, TSLA, and now SPCE\n\nThese are all Meme stocks, now would I recommend buying SPCE, no there's not enough hype yet. Give it a little bit to confirm that it's the new \"in\" stock.\n\nThe bottom line is, no one is factoring in the thing that actually matters: \"Are a majority people buying the stock?\" Everything else is nonsense.\n\n(Intentionally flagged this as a shitpost.)", "id": "eu8lcv", "created_utc": 1580055058.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Good highschool speech if you can stretch out to 5 minutes.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "In other words: frontrun live market data.
