My only concern with this trade is vega. Using the data from last close, this position would have about 330 theta and 65 vega, with low delta.

Delta is perfect and theta is huge, so if volatility stays at this level, I can make around $500 a day. If it stays within the short strikes for two days I can make around $1000 which is a 55% gain.\n\nEDIT: Actually, with the Coronavirus situation, volatility might even increase as TSLA has a beta of 1.37 so it has slightly higher volatility than SPY.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've been dabbling with double calendar spreads myself.

That way I'm going to make money from theta, which is huge at $532 at the moment.

I don't know exactly how likely an assigment with 3-4 DTE is, but I don't want to be in that position for sure.

So far, there's just over 900 MWh installed, far short of the original 2GWh guidance.
