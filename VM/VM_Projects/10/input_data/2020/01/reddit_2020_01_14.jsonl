Let's take time out of the equation (which is related to theta). Say you bought a $550 TSLA call when TSLA was trading at $560 (obviously these number are not reality but it's easier to understand this side if we use in the money options). Without any time value, that call option should be worth $10 ($560 is the cost of the stock and you can buy it for $550, so the intrinsic value is $10). \n\nNow let's say TSLA moves 5% up from $560...so now trading at $588. Well you can still use your call to buy TSLA at $550, which puts the intrinsic value of the call option at $38 ($588 minus $550). \n\nSo the intrinsic value of your call went from $10 to $38, a 280% gain. Even though the stock only moved 5%. \n\nNow this gets way more complicated when you factor in volatility, time, etc. But that should at least give you a baseline on why options move differently than the underlying. \n\nHope that helped some!", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "How can u buy a call option at 550 when it already is 560?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You can buy options ITM (in the money) or OTM (out of the money)...logistically, you buy them the same way.\n\nOptions are just that...and option to buy.

I'd say to read up on the greeks for options.\n\nDelta is between 0-1 and tells you how much an option will move for each $1 the underlying stock moves. So if you have a call option with a delta of 0.50, when the stock goes up $1, the option price should go up $0.50. Now it's not that simple because time also effects price (theta), and delta changes constantly too (change in delta is called gamma). \n\nBut when you talk return, you have to factor in cost. So the options with deltas that are 1.00, and will move the most with the stock if you are correct, also cost more so the return might not be as much. \n\nSo it really depends on your risk appetite. Deep out of the money options can have big returns but you also need big moves. Options at the money can also offer big returns but they cost more up front. \n\nSome advice: Seems like you are really interested in options, and I don't blame you, they are fascinating. But they are extremely risky as well. Try 'paper trading' some options to see what happens. Let's say you like AMZN to go up, so you want to buy calls. Jot down prices of different strikes that are deep out of the money, slightly OTM, at the money, slightly ITM, and deep in the money. And see how they react. I think the best way to learn is to see it in action. \n\nPS: AMZN, TSLA, BYND, and some other are absolutely crazy some days. Watch some of those.
