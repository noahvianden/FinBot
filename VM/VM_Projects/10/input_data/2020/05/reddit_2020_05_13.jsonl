This edit is 9:50 PM market time on May 13.\n\nI want to understand what I should know about the greeks and fundamentals to help me correctly analyze this situation. This is fictional and the setup I describe won't occur in reality. The point is to distill the question. If you don't want to deal in theoreticals, but prefer a concrete position to comment on, then this question won't be to your liking. \n\nSo suppose I have two stock symbols, ABC and DEF. The companies are identical in every way. The share price and stock characteristics are the same. Until one day...a big event occurs that causes the two companies to diverge, such that the change in ABC is the inverse of DEF. ABC rises 50c, DEF falls 50c. This relationship will hold for at least a month. This event occurs at 10am on a Monday. People have known about this event for at least a week, but nobody knows the outcome. There is no insider knowledge. Both symbols offer options with healthy volume expiring that Friday.\n\n1. What is your play?\n\n2. In a scenario such as this, if you additionally know the difference will be VAST, one could simply just buy a straddle on one stock. What is the theoretical difference between simply straddling ABC and buying naked calls on ABC and DEF? I think the absolute value of the delta on the ABC put would differ from that on the DEF call, for example.\n\n3. If you don't know the difference will be vast, but merely precisely mirrored, what then? Does this guarantee a spike in IV?\n\nThanks for playing. Feel free to fix or loosen assumptions if it makes the scenario more interesting to you.\n\nEnd edit.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nSay you have two competing companies, like ROKU and NFLX, or LYFT and UBER.

Under other conditions, I may expect a winner and a loser, such as in market share, a government contract, etc. If I am uncertain which will be the winner, what is the best way to play this?\n\nIn other words, for a single stock, I can straddle if I don't know which way it will go but I expect a big move. If the moves of the two companies are nearly zero-sum, is there some way to take advantage?\n\nI thought about selling puts on both.

The entire 'business and productivity suite' only accounts for about 1/3 of total revenue, and that includes the big boys like office and linkedin. Teams is only a subsection of that. The other 2/3rds are cloud (1/3) and PCs (1/3). \n\nAnd while it might be easy to think that given the current WFH situations, these sectors will all grow, that's not really guaranteed. While it's true, there are more people working from home, a lot of the comapnies who are working from home would have already had office and teams/skype and things like that. Or at least some method of internal comms that will be usable from home. The amount of companies that will need to add this capability isn't as big as it might seem. Then there's the counter to that, which is a lot of companies are laying off staff. Think off all the back-office staff for airlines, hospitality etc. A lot of these will be let go, so the companies will no longer need subscriptions to these services.\n\nThen there's the other segments like cloud and PCs. Again, it might seem obvious that these will also increase, given more internet usage, and more people using their pcs/xboxes, but it's not necessarily true. If Coviid triggers a massive and long recession, then both industry and consumer confidence and thus spending will decrease. Companies will switch from upgrading their laptops every 2 years to every 3 years. Workforces will decrease, meaning less windows licences needed. People will stop buying new computers at home. People will buy less xbox games etc.\n\nThat's not to say that all/any of this will happen, just to point out that there is actually a reasonable amount of uncertainty about what will happen to the economy, and this will have a knock on effect to investor confidence.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I bought 15 shares at 183 yesterday, had a limit order and it popped.

I have no way of figuring out DLC sales, so I’d assume that these games also have additional sales based on that. There’s also GTA online, NBA 2k online, and Red Dead online, all of which are fairly popular. TakeTwo has other games as well, but these are the most popular. Clearly, GTA V is their bread and butter, but NBA and RDR2 are doing fairly well. GTA V is also #7 on twitch’s most popular games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome google trends:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GTA V - current search popularity higher than holiday season](https://preview.redd.it/6dpnnt44bfy41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a39ebc737219e6170aba5fd92f1dfaffe7a2a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Civ 6](https://preview.redd.it/ejogx53bbfy41.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=30bea8679ac8c6075ce0762963033b96221a3776)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NBA 2k20 - Only surpassed by release date](https://preview.redd.it/74xk57xdbfy41.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=c209fe188f0a018f7c68186529937852442646a2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other competitors:**\n\nTaketwo has beaten earnings estimates for the last 3 quarters in a row. Their projected Q1 EPS is 0.56. EA and Activision both also beat earnings this quarter and we’re all aware of why: everyone is at home and bored out of their mind. Gaming is one of the few things that there is to do. Microsoft’s CEO stated recently that Xbox live use was almost at an all-time high. Furthermore, Ttwo isn’t as reliant as EA or Activision for yearly releases. I touched on this before, but GTA online, Red Dead online, and NBA 2k online generate tons of revenue for Taketwo in the form of microtransactions. NBA 2k online will be livestreamed on ESPN2, for example and it has 50 million users in China alone. GTA online has shown increasing revenue growth. 2019 Q4 has an increase of 54% in revenue from recurrent purchasers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financials:**\n\nNo long-term debt. Assets, revenues, and net income have been going up. They’ve continued to repurchase their stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However...** they're already at their ATH and they haven't had any big blockbuster release this quarter. Activation had COD drop meanwhile EA had nothing major. The big difference may just be revenue from microtransaction but I'm too stupid to figure out how to calculate that.

TTWO is a perfect example of great stock that gets zero media attention (relatively speaking). a lot of users here and new investors are betting on companies like tesla to change the world, and grow to a market cap of 1 trillion. At the time of this post, TTWO’s market cap is 15 billion. EA is valued almost 3 times that, and so is activision. with the way investors value companies now a days, i would not be surprised if wall street values TTWO at a high P/E (maybe around 60-70) considering the stock is destined to reach a market cap like EA or activision. TTWO can easily double in the next 12 months. \n\nits also a perfect stock to own (or play with options). picture the following two scenarios:\n\n\nscenario 1: the second wave of covid comes, and all states scratch their reopening proposals, and go back to square one, and extended quarantine for another 3-6 months minimum. NASDAQ and SP500 stocks dip 10-15 percent (i dont think a crash is happening, sorry but you really cant fight the fed). the next headline you would see from CNBC would be something like “investors turn to video game, and quarantine stocks amid 2nd wave of covid lockdown”\n\ncongrats: you’re rich. your TTWO just went up 10-20 percent (being conservative)\n\nscenario 2: covid vaccine is found and skips FDA approval! NASDAQ,SP500 rally!\n\ncongrats: you made some decent money (along with everyone else) you did not hit the jackpot, but thats okay (unless you YOLO everything then this scenario sucks)\n\n\n\n\n\nTTWO will no doubt 3 fold its current market cap. video games is the fasting growing category in the entertainment industry. i don’t see any scenario where this stocks falls even 5 percent in the next year. video game stocks do great in recessions. they are not selling any expensive products. GTA is already in the hands of many people, this can only lead to higher micro transactions. the NBA is not broadcasting games. fans need to get their sporting entertainment through another medium which will be nba 2k, and again, most people already have this game this is really just going to boost micro transactions. \n\nmy prediction: stock will be at $150 next week, and finish the year around $170.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well said.

{"title": "The Fall of the CRE REITs", "selftext": "Technical sell signals triggered on these 3 that I have been watching.  Of the 3 CUZ is the weakest in terms of its portfolio and cash flow.  CRE Reits have been sold off hard after an initial April rally after disappointing results in their earnings.  Additionally, another factor in their sale has been dumping by institutions doing rebalancing of their funds into other things like chasing momentum plays in tech, biotech, and even utilities to be considered a safe haven.  These are not usually plays owned by the trend crowd - instead they are owned by pension funds and mutual funds who buy for municipal retirement plans and beloved by boomers for yielding consistent dividends.  Well, those dividends are not looking so consistent anymore.   These are commercial real estate landlords in big cities like NYC, Chicago, Boston, etc.\n\nWith unclear forward guidance (because these 3 all declined to give any) the fund managers reacted by selling hard.   Also notable is that on up days last week the CRE Reits continued to sell off.  Also they have broke yearly lows today in trading on the daily chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Another reason why funds have been selling stuff like dividend plays and preferred stocks is b/c of fears of inflation from all the govt printing.  So where is that money headed?  Precious metals and their miners to some extent and TIPS in fixed income or dollar denominated debt for emerging market sovereigns.

Just not as good a day as yesterday - but I'll take an up day over a down day any day of the week. I did well in the first hour, but my losses halved my gains from that time - and then ran out of free cash.\n\nToday was another hold my breath at open and see where we go - I managed to stay patient and find good entry points. I was tracking OKTA, TWLO, WIX, CODX, and DDOG this morning - and managed to get into good entry points on CODX, TWLO, and DDOG. Unfortunately CODX went the wrong direction and got stopped out quickly in the morning - If I had the cash I was looking at reentering at around 1PM when the MACD crossed - but missed out on those +200% tendies - would've been around $350 additional.\n\nAfter TWLO and DDOG worked out, I got impatient looking for some new plays, and dropped into NVDA, ZM, and got pretty quickly stopped out of those as well, with those losses halving my gains for the day. Glad that I got stopped out of them - but wish I had respected the MACD for NVDA and not gotten in when I did- it was overbought and crossing in the wrong direction. ZM was also overbought but hadn't crossed yet. SPY then fell out and that was the day.\n\n* Lesson for the day is patience - wait for the good plays, they will come. For example as I'm writing this CRM, WIX, and VTIQ are solidly heading in the direction I like and I was tracking them.\n* Another lesson is watching my trailing stops a bit closer - they were a bit too tight on DDOG, the small drop below consolidation at 10:15 caught it out.\n* Final lesson is that sectors tend to move together - I could've caught OKTA along with TWLO but I moved a bit too slow on it and missed the entry - that should come with experience though\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1.

{"title": "Contango trade on VXX puts", "selftext": "Contango is the phenomenon where short-term futures contracts are cheaper than long-term ones. Contango for VIX futures has been negative since the beginning of this market episode. However, the short term VIX futures curve has been slowly returning to its normal shape and contango is flirting back with positive territory (see F1-F2 contango on chart).\n\nNegative contango (backwardation) of the past months has boosted VIX tracking ETF/ETNs price in the past weeks, since they could make money by gradually rolling their position of 1 month contracts (sell high) to 2 month contracts (buy low). Since contango is mean-reverting, it's slowly returning back to positive. When it's > 0 again, long VIX ETFs can expect a return to normal and see their price shrink in the long term.\n\nPositive contango creates value for put option holders, because the price of VIX tracking ETFs will slowly drift toward zero in the long run as manager roll positions to expensive 2-months futures. Negative contango does the opposite, it boosts an ETF's expected growth and puts lose value.\n\nWhen contango will be back in positive territory, what looks to be happening now, the expected growth of those ETF will become negative again and puts will increase in value.\n\nMy bet is **buy long dated VXX/VIXY/. puts.**\n\nFor those interested, Marco Avellaneda (top researcher in quant finance), gives and example on how put options can be used to profit from positive contango using long-dated VIX put options. Standard option pricing models usually underprice these options. \n\n[https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/ICBI\\_VIX\\_TALK\\_LAST.pdf](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/ICBI_VIX_TALK_LAST.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgtzzrguely41.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a400a4d4d2f17b1720b34150c26bf21a6c9f4b", "id": "gj7pwc", "created_utc": 1589403774.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "True that VVIX has spiked in recent days, but i've entered this trade before that when it was flattening. \n\nEdit: Also, we had many short episodes of intense volatility in the last weeks, but contango has kept drifting up.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You are better off selling bear call spreads on vxx (or uvxy) or just buying $SVXY.
