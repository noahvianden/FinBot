The battery world is seeing the potential of the anode improvements as well as their success with the cathode technology. The accumulation of patents, as well as active customer request, to test and inspect their work is exciting for those of us who have followed the company.

Within two years those batteries will be made with BSRC technology.\n\nThis stock is not like Tesla.  They don't make and sell.  They invent, and sell the tech in a licencing agreement with the customer. Getting in now with a $1k at .005 will give you 200K in stock. When it hits .10ct you'll have $20k.  I predict the customer finalizes the agreement to purchase the license before fourth quarter production is scheduled for the power tool industry.  We'll be at .10ct before Christmas.\n\n  \n We currently have a customer that has been testing a batch of proto-types. They are expected to communicate their findings soon.

They are consistently coming out with new features, and upgrading old features. It would be stupid of them to keep FSD price at 5k and never change it until the day before robotaxies are released. Conversely it would be stupid to price it at 20k+ now. It makes a ton more sense (IMO) to raise the price as each new feature is released. I’d argue stop light control is THE single biggest feature in the FSD package. If they release ~15 more features over the next 2 years and raise the price 1k each time (possibly even 2-3k per major upgrade) that’ll get them to the final price (which IIRC is ~20k)\n\nI welcome any discussion as to how else they should price FSD without continuously raising the price. \n\nI was smart/lucky enough to buy it for my model 3 during the fire sale for 2k since I understood it would only get more expensive, but if I didn’t have it now, I’d definitely jump on it ASAP.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with everything.

But you didn't say anything about whether the price itself is fair.  I'm making a point about current pricing.\n\nDoes it make sense to raise the price as you roll out more value-add features? Yes, if the price you're moving from did not take that into account, and if the price you're raising it reflects the value add.\n\nDoes the $5k starting point make sense, and how much they're raising it make sense? That's debatable. I personally don't see the $8K price it's going to as being a great price for what you get, today (again, saying nothing about where it will go, because I do believe it will get better with time).\n\nIt really depends on what Tesla is trying to maximize. There's a ton of benefits to shifting to a subscription model where 1) the economics are more aligned with personal usage, encouraging more people to try it out (you only have to shell out, say $150 for a one month subscription to try it out vs. $8K for the entire thing), 2) you gain a broader customer set, thereby also raising the training data you have access to. This is exactly why so many SaaS companies have benefited significantly by shifting to the cloud with a subscription model vs. the old model of a large up-front payment for a CD. By charging high prices up front for a product that most consumers will have never tried yet, you're asking a lot from people. You're essentially asking people to make an investment in this product in the future. That's fair, but your take rates are going to be low, and then you miss out on several other benefits.\n\nTesla will get there with a subscription plan eventually, so I don't consider this to be a big deal.

I haven’t sat down and done the math but I’m guessing in the neighborhood of $200. I also don’t think this a big deal but it’ll definitely go up in price over time as well.

{"title": "Effect of printing on asset inflation", "selftext": "Hello retards,  \n\n\nI have prepared two plots for you. First, I have downloaded S&P500 monthly close prices and also historical monthly monetary base from St. Louis Fed's website. Before 2008, monetary base was growing slowly and steadily, since gov didn't mind printing money to save markets and markets healed from themselves (I have data anterior to 2000 that shows the same steady and slow growth in monetary base, no major spikes like after 2008). Monetary expansion has saved everything in 2008, as you can see. However, it has also fuelled the bull market following the Great Recession up to 2015. Trouble started when the Fed has started to decrease this monetary base. Now, the jump in monetary base due to COVID is more than 30% over a couple of months. This is going to continue and it's going to create inflation in assets, to a greater extent than to the Consumer Price Index. To compare, I have also plotted the effect of monetary policy on CPI, while the Fed was able to keep the inflation growing steadily by injecting money into the system, it has had the effect of a sugar rush on the market over the last decade.\n\nTL;DR Printing has a more direct effect on the market than it has on the CPI, and it inflates stock prices by a lot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4y4hidp9yz41.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c61f71f56ad1b125b9a847bf9b56c187668600b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aolgarrubyz41.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c16720cd6fd648cdf9ad0f4dc66892967e532e", "id": "gnfdrz", "created_utc": 1589994702.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "New paradigm.

{"title": "Why this rally is not crazy and why it can easily keep going", "selftext": "Hi fuckwads. Here is my read on what's going down, take it as you wish.\n\nDon't fight the fed. Rates are at 0 and J Pow has reiterated time and again that they can and will literally print unlimited money. There is no alternative for investors to get any sort of yield outside of stonks and money printer going brrrr continues to depress bond yields.\n\nAll the big bois who actually make the markets move, fled equities for bonds and cash back in March and are still sitting on hoards of cash, dripping it back into equities cautiously and continuing to push them higher, and will continue to do so as the market remains relatively stable over longer periods of time. The trend is your friend. This is also partially why the economic data doesn't matter as much as you think it does in regards to jobs and growth leading me to my next point.\n\nYou are flipping burgers at McDickles and lose your job because nobody is showing up, causing them to temporarily close shop. That doesn't get reported until later, and all economic data is backwards looking. Additionally, you not being able to buy stonks because you temporarily lost your minimum wage job is not holding the markets back from looking to the future. People are looking at something that already happened crying about why it's not affecting the markets need to realize this, the markets look to the future not the past.\n\nFrom a technical perspective we just broke above the 200 day moving average on decent volume. I don't care that everyone is posting about it being on low volume, because they are fucking wrong. There has actually been a decent amount of volume if you compare it to historical volume figures. Just take a look at SPY, VOO, IVV, QQQ, or any of the big name blue dick stocks. It's at the very least average, and if not above. If you compare it to March it will obviously be less since volume dramatically picks up in times of volatility.\n\nVIX is still relatively high compared to it's average, and over the long run volatility is mean reverting. Not only are you paying a lot for puts on the SPX, but you're also on the wrong side of the coin long term. The only effective way to hedge in this environment is tail hedging buy getting some deeeeeep OTM SPX puts or VIX calls with a small ass percentage of your account. Look at VXTH on the CBOE website if you want a proxy on how to do this shit the right way.\n\nWhat about a second wave you might ask? The world could barely shut down for 2 months without going fucking bananas and everyone protesting house arrest. Yes it's possible, and it could be the only source of future volatility that I legitimately see coming. I can see us possibly retesting 2600-2700 if this is worse than people are thinking it will be. The most likely scenario at this point is for the markets to continue to slowly drip up as people get more confidence and realize the world will come back to normal. Now that the big bois have already taken their positions, everyone else is going to FOMO us back into the normal cycle. \n\nI am a bisexual investor, I fuck hard when I need to, but I also know when it's time to suck dick. I made money along with the rest of you fools with a combo of TLT calls and SPY puts back in February and March. I also have some nice unrealized losses on the table from my leftover dick sucking days of 2 months ago. Fortunately most of my shit was long, and I took the opportunity to throw more into my equities with the realized profits in March, which outweigh my shit that will expire worthless. I just threw my cock into some LEAPs this week, and might do it again. That being said, I'm still holding a bit in cash, ready for another dip if it happens and tail hedging with VIX calls.\n\nTLDR; bears are fuck, but tail hedge with penny puts/calls", "id": "gnkkhz", "created_utc": 1590013119.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "God I fucking hate these dumbass posts about shit thats already happened.
