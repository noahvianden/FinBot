[As noted in a fund's report from April on boat/engine maker Brunswick](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insights-white-brook-capital-2020-174805036.html), any savings that would have been allocated to vacations involving flying, cruise ships, theme parks, etc. are probably being spent on other big-ticket purchases instead.\n\nWhich big-ticket items?  Well, ORVs/watercraft are one category:\n**Search interest for off-road vehicles- things like ATVs, UTVs/side-by-sides- all of which are seeing spikes of ~2X-4X YoY search activity and ~2X ATHs.  Personal watercraft, i.e. jet skis, are seeing similar spikes.  Small watercraft related search terms are also at ATHs or seeing above-average or on-trend activity levels.**\n\nKey players in this space are Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP, $DOOO), maker of Can-Am ORVs, Sea-Doo PWCs, Evinrude outboard motors, Alumacraft small boats, etc; Polaris ($PII), make of Polaris ORVs as well as several small watercraft brands; and Brunswick Corporation, which makes Mercury outboard motors and a range of watercraft, including Boston Whaler, Lowe Boats, and the more upscale Sea Ray.\n\nI had been eyeing this play, particularly for Polaris, and in fact I [identified this play a month ago but paper-handed my calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafwlq/outdoor_recreational_vehicle_stocks_are_actually/).  More recently I was waiting for a bit of a pullback since PII is already pretty close to ATH.  Unfortunately Polaris jumped up even more last week against the market trend, to $83, about 11% off its February high of $93 (it has been as high as $101 last December).  In researching this play this weekend I found out why $PII bounced up on May 20: an article, (some paras pasted below) that went out in an industry publication on that date.\n\n>[**OEM’s April dirt bike sales double with half of its dealers open**](https://powersportsbusiness.com/top-stories/2020/05/20/oems-april-dirt-bike-sales-double-with-half-of-its-dealers-open/)\n\n>“It started off rocky at first but then business took off.

Its Burnsville Mall location is currently appointment-only. “We’re over double from what we’ve sold during a normal month last year; May is looking pretty good too.”\n\n>“Most of our customers are still at work,” said John Churchman, owner of Shore Cycles in Salisbury, Maryland, offering pre-owned ATVs and motorcycles as well as youth bikes and ATVs. **“We are in a rural area relatively speaking and most people still have jobs, which is a big piece of the puzzle;** they’re working hard and buying what they’ve earned — giving their kids or themselves something to do while they have any downtime, and the kids are at home. School has been out since mid-March, generally speaking, and they’re home the rest of the school year. They have the opportunity to give their kid a gift that lasts many years, and gets them out of the house.”\n\n>We don’t sell many youth products after Christmas until the next fall; there are a few here and there, but that’s not what the focus is. This year it has been a complete 180, and they have been the primary volume of our new vehicle sales,” said Churchman. “People are at home and they’re shifting their focus on what they’re spending money on. **A lot of customers who have bought stuff have bought it because they’re not taking a summer vacation this year — their spending has shifted into a different product. People are looking for alternative ways to entertain their families.”**\n\n>**“Sales have been strong. We have a lot of dealers in rural areas, and it didn’t seem like sales slowed at all,”** Cruz told Powersports Business. “Ballard Golf and Power in Hayden, Idaho, told us that their sales have been incredible. We also spoke to another dealer in Missouri that said sales have been triple what they’ve expected.”\n\n>**“Last year April was our biggest invoicing month, and this year our sales were double what they were in April of last year,”** said Mel Harris, vice president of operations with SSR, which produces motorcycles, pit bikes, dirt bikes, scooters, side-by-sides, ATVs, mopeds and more. **“And that’s with less than 50 percent of our dealers operating.”**\n\n>**“This year we’re already ahead of the last full calendar year, and it’s only April,” Fay said. “Sales have been doubling, if not tripling month-to-month.** People are trying to get the kids out of the house because they’re glued to their screens. As soon as those [stimulus] checks went out, sales spiked like crazy.”\n\n>“The only slowdown we’re seeing is regional,” said Harris. “In places it gets too hot, people will head out on the water instead of in the dirt. But we don’t expect to see a drop-off in the fall. In fact, we’ll have new product coming out.”\n\n\nSo, how to play this?  $DOOO (BRP) has earnings on Thursday 5/28 before market open. Unfortunately, there are no options available for $DOOO, but its stock is still 42% down from its February high, so owning shares may not be a bad way to approach this.\n\nHowever, buying June calls for $PII might be a way to play $DOOO options by proxy.  Polaris reported earnings in April, and they were summarizing more of the initial COVID downturn.  You can also see more of a dip for many Polaris searches which isn't there for BRP.  So if $DOOO reports a month of big sales toward the end of the period, Wall St may have heard enough to send Polaris right back up to February highs by June.  (If this crazy pump doesn't do it first that is.)\n\nOne issue here is volume.  Don't buy FDs and expect to be able to offload them due to a spike in IV.  The bid-ask spread may be larger than you'd want, but it's not a showstopper.\n\nPositions: \n\n$PII 6/19 85c\n\n$DOOO shares\n\n$BC 6/19 50c\n\nCharts as of Friday:\n\n[BC Corp 1YR chart](https://i.imgur.com/yILVMSb.png)\n\n[BRP Corp 1YR chart](https://i.imgur.com/dOMdzrs.png)\n\n[Polaris 1YR chart](https://i.imgur.com/Nq8gz3N.png)\n\nGoogle search trend data below.\n\n---\n\n[Conditional formatting of powersports Google trends scores](https://i.imgur.com/h0VsXrP.png).

I think this is interesting, because the ORVs/PWCs tend to be more family and group-focused, and also have utility in hunting (meat shortage...).  So this again reinforces this is one place families have redirected vacation-type spending, as motorcycling is often more of a solitary or competitive activity if it's not being done for commuting.

With demand rapidly accelerating, bringing our global plant network back online – including the recent resumption of production at our Monterrey facility – provides an important sign of normalcy for our business. While we are pleased by current developments, we continue to act prudently to drive business success and remain watchful for a more difficult economic environment.

So it really go me thinking. How the fuck will gold's price go up if we have deflation?\n\nAfter a while, I came to the conclusion that gold is the original currency. It is the only currency without a central bank. The Fed has a simple charter. Basically, keep unemployment low and a reasonable level of inflation. We are in a long term deflationary environment. Technology and aging population are deflationary. We have a massive debt pyramid which cannot survive this pandemic. The Fed can fix liquidity problems, but not solvency problems.\n\nSo, we have massive unemployment and we are going to have massive deflation, both short term and long term. We're becoming Japanese while the global economy is replacing obsolete meat robots with software. The tools the Fed has is control of interest rates and money printing.\n\nThe key take away is that the Fed will stimulate. They will flood the system with money until they see mild inflation. They won't see inflation for a long time because we are probably stuck in a deflationary period. They can't print their way out of a solvency crisis, but they sure can try.\n\nDeflationary periods are great to hold currency. Gold is the original currency. The amount of gold will remain fixed through this crisis. However, the supply of dollars will increase dramatically. Therefore, the exchange rate, the price of gold, must go up. It's the money printing. Gold will go up in a deflationary spiral because the Fed will do it's job. Period. It is the job of the Fed to try to get slight inflation and reduce unemployment. They won't succeed. We will still be in deflation, but the exchange rate for gold will keep going up.\n\nGold is down today.  It would be a good time to pick up a bunch of $65 Jan 2022 GDXJ calls.
