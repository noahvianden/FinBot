{"title": "Aggressive autist activation strategy", "selftext": "***Thesis:***\n\nSo I've been poking around a certain sub with the acronym WSB. I'm frightened and inspired by that sub at the same time. It's attracting a lot of attention inside and outside of the sub. My theory is that this will cause a lot of FOMOing and YOLOing into certain stocks.\n\nMy guess is that this will cause a lot of frustrated, greedy, and jealous traders to throw their hands up in the air and pile into the craziest stocks in the coming months. I'm going to take advantage of this by modifying the wheel of fortune strategy and apply some of the tasty trade mechanics.\n\n***Strategy:***\n\nThis is not for the faint of heart. I will either retire earlier or find some nice rope when all is said and done.\n\nHalf of my portfolio is going to into a \"safer\" stock and half is going into a \"meme\" stock. I'll use MSFT and SPCE as examples. Prices are as of after hours Feb 20 2020 and are just estimates based on expected mid price fills.\n\nI'm going to start with a hypothetical $100,000 portfolio. $50K for MSFT, $50K for SPCE.\n\nIt starts with selling cash secured puts in MSFT and SPCE. Depending on aggression level you could sell as many contracts as you can with $50K in each stock.\n\nOR\n\nYou can sell as many contracts as you can with $25K in each stock in the closest expiration using ATM strikes. \n\nTHEN\n\nYou can buy as many furthest OTM LEAP call contracts as you can with $25K in each stock. \n\nScenario 1:\n\nStocks move up and you keep your put premiums. I would personally close out the trade at 50% premium received or after roughly 20ish days until expiration and keep redeploying capital. Your OTM calls may start showing some gains. \n\nScenario 2:\n\nStocks move down and you get assigned . My next step would be sell covered calls until it gets called away and maybe collect a dividend along the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Profit taking/stop losses:***\n\nAt some point you might collect enough premiums to buy \"free\" OTM call LEAPS. I'm going to buy as many as I can. My profit taking strategy depends on how far up the market goes. I would start with 50% profit taking stop in the LEAPS and periodically move stops up in my favor and never down.\n\nI'm going with a portfolio wide 50% stop.\n\n***Potential Payoffs:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Payoff potential](https://preview.redd.it/p34f4mhib6i41.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3406d2210000e555f460a66d422d7a5d175789)\n\nAs I said this is risky but this might be the last bull market I'll see in my life. I'm going to milk it for what it's worth. Be careful if you follow along. If you want to sit it out that's fine too.
