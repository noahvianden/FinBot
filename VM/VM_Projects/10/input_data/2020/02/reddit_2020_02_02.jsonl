Profits are calculated as Sale minus Purchase.\n\nThe trade you describe results in a guaranteed loss. More on this next. \n\nYou're gonna have to buy stock for 315.94. The short 285 call means you're gonna sell stock for 285 (if assigned). You get 29.10 premium for hitting the bid, so you could consider that your sale price is increased by that amount to 314.10 - however, I'd recommend you keep that separate in your calculations, it's easier. \n\nSo you'd calculate your profits as: `314.10 - 315.94 = -1.84`. A loss. \n\nHere's how I'd calculate it, which will lead to the same result, but I prefer it more explicitly. Think of cash flows. You disburse 315.94 to acquire shares and receive 29.10 to sell the calls. Under the assumption that the Stock stays above the 285 strike price, you'll then receive 285 when you sell the stock as a result of assignment. Cash flows into your account increase your cash balance, and out of your account decrease it: so money you receive is positive, money you pay is negative. \n\nWith all the cash flows explicit, you'd calculate your profits as: `-315.94 + 29.10 + 285 = -1.84`. Same value (as expected), just a tad more explicit. \n\n*So your trade generates a* ***guaranteed loss of 1.84 per share,*** *in the best case scenario.* It's worse if MA goes below 285.\n\nWhy's that? \n\nBecause hitting the bid is a really, really bad idea.\n\nMarket orders (or marketable limit orders, ie, the ones that cross the bid-ask spread for an immediate fill) are in general a really bad idea in options, because bid-ask spreads can be extremely wide. This is especially the case for deep ITM options - and 10% ITM for MA (around 23%-ish IV) at 1 week to expiration is super deep ITM. \n\nIn the very least, you should sell that Call for 31.07. \n\n(this is based on the 315.94 MA price you mentioned, and on the bid-ask prices on the options chain for MA that I'm looking at right now, which are stale since this is the weekend; but let's go with it for a moment, for the sake of the explanation). \n\nHere's how I got that number: if MA is at 315.94, a 285 call has 30.94 premium just in intrinsic value. It must have some extrinsic value, too, since there's time until expiration.\n\nLooking at the 285 put, same expiration, I see a 0.13 x 0.27 market. Selling a covered call at strike 285 is the same as just selling a put at that same strike: this means you have at least 0.13 in extrinsic value. Add that to the intrinsic value, you get 31.07 premium that I mentioned. I also said \"in the very least\" because this was calculated based on the bid. But like I mentioned before, you it's a bad idea to trade options crossing the bid-ask spread, so you should look for more than that. \n\nThis idea of looking at the price of the put is due to what's known as Put-Call Parity. Essentially, it's the fact that `Stock = Call - Put (same strikes and expiration)`. Technically, for American options this may not hold due to potential early assignment, but in general you just assume it holds since early exercise is rarely optimal. \n\nFinally, notice that, once again due to Put-Call parity, selling the 285 covered call is exactly the same as selling the 285 put. In other words, you can achieve the very same risk profile by either having +100x MA -1x C285, or by having just -1x P285 (both on the Feb 7 expiration). \n\nSo if you don't have stock yet, and are looking to establish that position, you can instead simply sell the 285 put - better on commissions, better on less bid-ask spreads to deal with.\n\nHowever, if you already have the stock and want that position, you just sell the call (after finding out what price you should get!).\n\nAs a final note, I'm not exactly sure what your reasons for such a trade are, and while they may be valid, it's something that I'd definitely not do. If MA was part of any long term holdings, selling the 285 call is an almost guaranteed way to end up without MA in the portfolio, and there's super low reward in that (between 0.13 to 0.27). If I didn't have MA and was looking for a short term play (in which case I'd definitely do it by selling the 285 put, rather than buying stock AND selling a call), this would be one of those plays in which the reward is so meaningless, and the potential losses - even if unlikely - can be so insanely devastating comparatively, that it's definitely not worth it for me.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "That was so comprehensive and full-some.

Eg, I see a 0.85 x 0.90 market on those puts (from Friday). I'd try to sell that put for maybe 0.88 first, and then lower my price penny by penny til I get my fill. I also would lower it all the way to the bid, as I would consider I'm being completely ripped off of I have to go all the way there (unless I had a very strong need to do it, like to close a position to prevent massive losses; but not to open a new one).\n\n\n>And the way to protect myself from a loss would be to close the position early before Im down \n$850 and use my premium to prevent loss ?\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure is clear - and, again, because of Put-Call parity, it applies to both a short put and a covered call trades - is that this premium you receive is not really \"a cushion\", not really a way to protect you from losses.\n\nLooking at the short put trade may actually help to see this thing I'm gonna talk about more clearly, but remember the exact same thing applies to CC, just maybe a bit harder to see as things are a bit less explicit.\n\nOnce you sell that put, you don't \"make 850 USD\". You are making a transaction in which 850 USD are exchanged for something worth 850 USD. You have 0 profits of losses initially. So there isn't really an 850 USD cushion.\n\nYou're effectively getting 850 USD now to assume a liability valued by the market at 850 USD now. \n\nIf AAPL goes down, or if IV increases, the premium of that put is going to increase, meaning that you'll be at a loss: you'll have 850 USD cash, and a liability of more than 850 USD market value. \n\nSay AAPL moves in such a way that the put is now worth 1.00. You're at a loss of 0.15 per share, or 150 USD. You can close everything and take that 150 USD loss. More explicitly, you initially received 850 USD to assume a liability, and then you paid 1000 USD to rid yourself from that liability: a 150 USD loss. Notice that the 150 USD loss doesn't even require you to close your trade: you're at a loss simply because you have 850 USD cash and a liability worth 1000 USD cash. It's an \"unrealized loss\", which doesn't mean \"unreal loss\", it's very real! \n\nIf the position is going against you, you can close it at any time, and take (or realize) the loss. A common threshold people use in short put trades is to not let the loss become bigger than the max profit you were looking at. So in this case, this rule of thumb would lead people to close the short put by buying it back for 1.70, if it starts going that way. People usually talk about this by saying stuff like \"close for a loss at 2x the premium received\". \n\nSo this way of \"protection\" is really just getting out of the position - at a loss! - in order to prevent the losses from possibly getting bigger, much bigger. Sometimes people resist it thinking that they may want to hold longer \"to see if it comes back\": problem is, it may also go further! \n\nThere are many other ways to protect yourself, too.\n\nFor example, you could buy a put at a lower strike. It reduces your profitability, since you'll be spending part of the premium you got to acquire this protection. But it effectively limits the max you can lose. Eg if you buy the 270 put, you'll be paying around 0.62 (mid of 0.60 x 0.64 that I see here), but if AAPL tanks to, say, 250, you'll be forced to buy it for 277.5 (your short put) but you have the right to sell it for 270 (yourong put). The trade off is that now, on 10 contracts, the max profit you're looking at is 230 USD (850 USD from selling the 277.5 usd, 620 USD from buying the 270 put). **This is exactly a vertical spread.**\n\nAlternatively, you could short a bit of stock: this reduces the effect of the put increasing in value (this increasing your losses) as the stock price goes down: the profit on the short balances put some of the losses on the short put. People usually think about doing this kind of stuff when the delta of their short put gets too big and scary. Disadvantage is that if the stock moves up, you lose on the short stock position, and this loss can eventually even get bigger than the profits from shorting the put... so it has to be managed actively. **This is usually referred to as managing or hedging delta (and can be done in other ways, too, like reducing the size of the short put position, or selling OTM calls basically transforming it into a strangle, etc).**\n\nSo many possibilities...\n\nIf you want to explore more about this, check whether your trading platform has some good support for risk analysis for options. You didn't mention what it is, so I'm gonna comment on a few popular ones around here. \n\nToS has an OK tool in the Analyze tab: it works well for simple positions, it's pretty easy to use, but it simply cannot handle a more complex position with many legs without slowing down to the point where it becomes unresponsive for 10s of seconds.\n\nIB has absolutely amazing support for analyzing options portfolios in the Risk Navigator tool: it can handle whatever book of option you throw at it with fantastic performance, and IMO it has an incredibly superior model to ToS's, both in terms of its default settings as well as in terms of offering incredibly powerful ways to tweak it if you want (you probably don't, at least not initially).\n\nRobinhood has nothing. Well, it calculates your \"break even\" for single legs... But frankly, I wouldn't trust even that number without verifying it myself every time as RH is just... well, it's RH. \n\nTastyworks is something I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think this aspect would've changed much, since all I see is they trying to push a \"novel\" risk analysis approach: it sucks in this area. (it emphasizes too much this notion of \"probability of profit\", which is really absurd IMO as it isn't anywhere close to reflecting risk, especially in non-trivial positions). \n\nI'll share a couple of screenshot from IB later when I get to my competition so you can get a sense of what it looks like, and how you can explore ways to possibly protect yourself from big losses.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Great answers!\n\nAbout IB: I have been using it for a month, so I don't know it too well.
