{"title": "Covered strangle with SPY M/W/F weeklies", "selftext": "6-year of stock trading/investing but fairly new to options, so thank you all in advance for your help.\n\nFor the past few weeks i've tried learning the fundamentals on options and exploring strategies for generating consistent income in a conservative way. The strategy I wanted to ask about here was  weekly covered strangles on the SPY 3x per week (M, W, F), or in other words, a covered call with a cash secured put, to capitalize on the current premiums albeit still small given the 1 day expirations.\n\nGiven the historic crash we've experienced and may continue to, I intend on scaling into a longer-term SPY position with capital to deploy further. I purchased some SPY last Friday as part of my first entry. What I thought about doing now was selling M, W, and F calls and puts every week, with the calls at +5% OTM, and the puts around -15% OTM. Both the calls and puts show a 95+% probability of expiring worthless on a consistent basis, and If I get trapped into a -15%+ (unlikely given circuit breakers, historical moves, etc) to the downside, I'm happy with bagholding another 100 shares of SPY at a time potentially a handful of times into further downside. At this point we're down almost 40% in a month and as catastrophic as people are making these circumstances out to be, it seems like a decent scaling entry point for the longer term. The weekly covered strangles + dividends would also help cost basis. My goal is to begin with 100 shares and accumulate up to 500 this year.\n\nQuick math shows that this could generate 2-3% ROC per week (credit of about $300 selling 1 call, 1 put), and I realize I could be dead wrong and be missing something, so please advise if I am.

Most of the guys who are up on this sub made their gains from a few big wins and have also most likely suffered pretty steep losses previously or afterwards(including me). If you look at professional traders who trade for a living, they’re not trying to score one or two big wins but instead opt for consistent gains which are individually smaller. In the long run, our way of trading will not yield as good of returns as those of a professional trader’s because although we can make a lot of money very quickly, we are also taking on a huge amount of risk in comparison. From what I’ve seen, most professional traders utilize different spreads and buy LEAPS so as to completely avoid time decay. Most of the people on this sub probably only know the basics of buying puts and calls and have little knowledge/experience with different combinations of options.

Its just that a lot of people can get frustrated with the amount of practice they need for a consistent trading strategy and feel like the gains that they are making at the beginning just aren’t worth it so they decide that they want to make a lot of money instantly and throw it into one or two plays. What people sometimes fail to realize is that if you are actually serious about becoming a legitimate trader and want to trade for a living, you need to put in the work to develop those strategies and spend the time grinding them out. Short term satisfaction is always tempting but to have the patience to create and perfect a consistent strategy is a true testament to your skill and dedication as a trader.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Been looking into spreads, are there any pragmatic spreads you’d recommend for loss mitigation?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It kind of depends on what kind of play you’re going for and the underlying of the options you’re messing around with. When I was actively trading credit spreads I would keep the difference between the strike price of the short and long option to 0.5 that way your max possible risk per spread is $50 minus the amount of net premium you get from the spread(credit-debit). \n\nOne thing that I was fond of doing but later realized was a mistake was the fact that I chose credit spreads with short expirations. This stems from what I was talking about earlier with wanting immediate gains. I was doing fine and collecting a decent amount of premium at the end of each week but then the underlying stock had a rapid increase in volatility and made a sharp move through my credit spread making my short option ITM. \n\nIf I had chosen a longer expiration this wouldn’t have been as much of an issue as I would have had plenty of time for the price to return to where it was and for my trade to correct itself but since I was trading weeklies I was left with effectively no time for the price to move back in my favor and I would end up losing the max possible amount. \n\nThis is all because of the Gamma, which is one of the key Greeks that govern the prices of options. Longer expiration spreads have a lower Gamma so that even with a sharp move in the stock price, you would lose less than a spread with shorter expiration(and higher Gamma). This is useful information to know because if the price moves against you pretty fast and you end up deciding that it will continue moving against you, you can cut losses with less money lost than if you had a shorter expiration spread. When I would get to the point of realizing that my trade wasn’t gonna work out, it was too late to cut losses and my trade was already doomed.\n\nFinally, I would say to be careful around Iron Condors, which is a combination of a put and a credit spread. With an IC you’re vulnerable to price moving against you in both ways so you’re hoping that it stays in a certain range. Ideally you would want to set up an IC when you expect volatility to decrease(this holds true for regular credit spreads as well but especially so with ICs). This is because a volatility decrease means that the price isn’t moving around as much and is more likely to stay within your target range. Furthermore, since options get some of their value from volatility(Vega), a decrease in it would mean a decrease in the price of the options that are a part of your IC which means that you receive more gains early on and at that point you could even decide to close out of the trade.\n\nThere are lots of other spreads out there too but I am not that familiar with them and have never actually traded them.

However, I think that this will only work if I do it right now, and I wanted to get your opinions on it before doing it. I'll just jump right into it:\n\nVIX is known as the fear index, or volatility index. It goes up when large amounts of volatility is present in the market. At a time like now, with the coronavirus effects crashing the markets, there is unprecedented volatility - the only time VIX was this high in the past 20 years was during the 2008 crash.\n\nClick here to see an image of the past 20 years of VIX -  [https://imgur.com/a/LHpJci3](https://imgur.com/a/LHpJci3)\n\nObserving the behavior of VIX over the past 20 years, we can see that it does not perform at all like a stock - it doesn't go up or down over time, but rather tends to fluctuate around a \"baseline\" price of $10 - $30 throughout the entire past 20 years, occasionally seeing huge spikes up every now and then during big market crashes like this one. \n\nCurrently, VIX is at $66. It has already gone up a tremendous amount in the past month, so it is too late to take advantage of it's INCLINE. However, I believe that it is the PERFECT time to take advantage of it's inevitable DECLINE. If you look at VIX over the past 20 years, you can see that it always returned back to it's \"baseline\" of around $10 - $30, even after the 2008 crash.\n\nI plan to short VIX right now, at this moment in time, using an inverse VIX instrument - some of the most commonly used ones are SVXY, ZIV and EXIV. By doing so, I should be nearly-guaranteed to make a profit (unless I'm missing something) because every time that VIX spiked over the last 20 years, it ALWAYS returned to baseline.\n\nWhat do you guys think of this strategy?

A year later, everyone gets hit with the Corona virus.\n\nThis is my view of the current situation for Boeing:  Most people would say Boeing get a double hit with both the 737Max and the Corona virus.  IMHO, that’s true but that's short term lost.  In the long term, I think Boeing is in better position because of the Corona virus.\n\nWhy?  W/O the Corona virus, Boeing would have given up market share to Airbus.  The terms in Boeing contracts allow buyers to cancel orders w/o penalties if the delivery is a year late.  Before the Corona virus, that one year is around the corner for most buyers.  Mass cancellations would come in and orders would be replaced with Airbus airplanes and Boeing would give up a lot of market share.\n\nWith the Corona virus, even more cancellations are coming in but the entire market is on pause.  FAA and Boeing engineers are still working to return the 737MAX to the sky.  This is “free” time for Boeing as it can fix the issue it has at hand w/o losing market share in the meantime.  As the results, its stock can recover quicker when the Corona pandemic is over and the market recovers.  Note market doesn’t need to increase for Boeing stock to gain significant value, just recover is enough.\n\nIn the airline business, staying with one brand is significant saving for the airliner for various reasons I am not going to go into because that’s not the point of this post.  You can see some US and international carriers are Boeing airplanes only.  That’s why losing money due to losing market share is more critical losing money because of the shrinking market.  \n\nYour sport team has a bunch of players out due to injuries.

A significant of that 17+ billion came from the fact that Boeing can’t deliver the aircraft but continue to make them for a while.  That’s unrealized lost.\n\nBoeing stocks get hit hard with the grounding of the Max vs. A380 (mostly because the market was expanding during that A380 shutting down period).  If it wasn’t for the Corona, Boeing stock would still be in the $300 range right now.\n\nAt $300 range, no one would say Boeing is going under.   A significant of the recent Boeing total drop is not because of the 737Max but because of the Corona virus.\n\nEveryone is jumping on stock buyback practice as it’s something evil.  Buy back stock is better than hoarding cash (inflation) especially when the company thinks the stock is undervalued.  That’s just being responsible with shareholders.  It’s easy to look back and give out blames.  \n\nWhat we are facing now is unprecedented.  W/O the bailout, Boeing would cut very deep.  During the 747 development, Boeing borrowed so much money to work out its 747 issues that when the market turned south, Boeing had to lay off 60% of its workforce. \n \nSeattle unemployment was almost 14% because of that fall out.   We all know what happened after the market started to turn around and the 747 took first flight.  Boeing work force went back up to 100,000 within 5 years of market recovery.\n\nThe key of Boeing resiliency is that a significant number of its work force are high paying engineers working on future projects.  Its bread and butter products can almost run entirely on much lesser paid workers.  To stop a short term bleed, Boeing can mass layoff engineers and still wouldn’t affect its production in the short term.\n\nAt least one person on the board of director thinks Boeing doesn't need the bailout.
