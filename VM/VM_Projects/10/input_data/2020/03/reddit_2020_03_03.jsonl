It seems very Silicon Valley to do it yourself.\n\nVlad Tenev: This is the only clearing system that’s been built from scratch on modern technology in the past decade. It’s basically unprecedented. Clearing is the foundational layer for all brokers, and it will allow us to clear and settle all transactions, as well as custody access for all our customers without depending on any third parties.\n\nIt was a huge investment in the future of Robinhood, and it will have a massive impact on our business and the customer experience.\n\nWe’ve reached massive scale—we’ve reached six million accounts, and we’re the fastest growing brokerage of all time. [That scale] was pretty clear to us early on. Before we launched, we had a million people on the waitlist. We knew we would quickly reach significant scale.\n\nWe started thinking about clearing, and we had to decide whether to build something ourselves, rent a system, or buy a system. When we looked at the clearing space, there hasn’t been a ton of innovation for many decades. Most clearing systems run on mainframes, and don’t have UIs, but terminal interfaces that are many decades old.\n\nDespite that, most brokers don’t build clearing systems themselves. It takes a lot of capital, it requires specialized knowledge and requires interfacing with a lot of regulators, which makes it challenging. The last time a major broker went self-clearing was Vanguard [in 2008], and even they didn’t build their own system from scratch. They rented an off-the-shelf system.\n\nWe pride ourselves on being a technology company first, so we decided to build our own system from scratch. In many ways, I’d compare it to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) building their own chips for their model devices, or Amazon investing in its own warehouses and fulfillment centers. It’s a huge investment in the infrastructure that is the foundation of our business, and vertically integrates Robinhood’s core business.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Idk but I'm glad I switched to leaps late last week.

Those are moving the market.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Christine Hall: The main benefits that we see in going self-clearing is taking clearing, settlement and custody in-house. There will be three major impacts that our customers see.\n\nThe first is in fees. Although we’re already zero-commission, we are removing or lowering fees even more. There were about seven fees passed on from our old clearing broker-dealer. Even though those fees only affected a minority of the customers on our platform, they were painful when users did experience them.\n\nAn example—if you had a recurring ACH setup and put a few dollars into your Robinhood account every week, and one week your bank account is short, and you overdraft and have to go through an ACH reversal process, we previously charged $30 for that. It’s an industry standard, but when we integrated directly with a bank and started doing the ACH processing ourselves, we read the fine print and the bank was only billing us nine dollars for ACH reversals, which is significantly lower than what users get charged. So we cut the fee to nine dollars.\n\nThe second is that now that we have more direct insight into customers’ accounts from the street side, we can offer more support and troubleshooting with a unified picture of the customer’s account.\n\nThe last way that this impacts customers is that it’ll over a better overall experience. Previously, things like proxy voting notices weren’t written in plain language and were delivered at suboptimal times. They didn’t look like they were coming from Robinhood. These critical customer notices have been brought in-house and are written well in advance of events like tax day.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "A lot of Robinhood users are younger, and have had the gift of a long bull run.

As a startup that’s growing rapidly, we don’t really think about headcount costs, but instead opportunity costs. This is an investment in the long term of the business. This was a large effort and we had to allocate a lot of resources to do this over the last couple of years, but the goal is to build a long-term business that’s very large.
