I am one of the many people who prefers to buy digital games as well, but something as little as exclusive pre-order bonuses when you buy digital strictly from GameStop could change everything. Then there is the fact that GameStop hasn't really tapped into the merchandising potential fully, such as clothes and collectibles.

It'd be good for collectors. I'm aware that many people are lazy and just don't care and would rather buy a digital game straight from their console and start playing minutes later, though.

Merely a day after Reggie sent a Tweet out announcing he was joining them, their stock went up 15%, and still \\*currently\\* slowly climbing. My point with him is he was the President of Nintendo of America and actually knows what he's doing. All I'm saying about him is that it's going to be interesting to see what he brings to the table.  \n\n\nAs for shopping online, it is much easier for a lot of people arguably, but retail stores still do exist and are still very successful. Why? Because people, believe it or not, still like interaction. The issue with GameStop is that their interaction with their consumers is always \"Hey we have this thing you should buy. Buy this thing right now. Pre-order. Buy it. You want that new game? Well we have that same game pre-owned so you should buy that instead for $2 less than what it is new.\" If you've never experienced this yourself when going into GameStop, congratulations. You have found yourself one of the rare one's that is actually reasonable to go in to. They have made it less about the games, and more about their policies. One could say it's always been that way, and it's likely true, but it's more annoying now than ever BECAUSE of online shopping. Why go into a store and get pestered to buy something constantly when you could just sit at home quietly on your phone and order something instead? This is where GameStop needs to change, in addition to bringing in unique merchandise that you can't buy anywhere else.  \n\n\nI'd also like to mention quickly on the side here, I wasn't suggesting a long term investment into GameStop either. The question here is, since their shares are $4 now, and history has shown that with new console releases that their shares have gone up significantly, is it worth buying now while they are still low?

{"title": "An Ode to WallSteetBets", "selftext": "Bears, Bulls, and fellow autists I write to you tonight to share the tale of a true lurker gone native. I was a lurker for months. I remember vividly laughing at you fools when you were hyping TSLA to $420 as I sat in my dividend rich portfolio sucking off the slow drip. But as I watched and laughed $420 came and past and I shook my head in disbelief. Ever the entertainers you autists no sooner celebrated than you went for the obvious next choice of $690 and I regained my pleasant demeanor. For truly there was no way daddy elon was going to going to deliver. This time however my laughter was short lived as $690 came and went in a flash comparatively speaking, much like my first time.  \n\n\nNow, you autists had my attention and I couldn't look away. Days turned to weeks and weeks to months and months into hours. I had truly lost all sense of reality as I saw the glory of lumber tendies reaching all the way to space. True there was the occasional loss porn to keep me grounded and tethered to sanity. But the tendy piles kept coming on. I saw those piles rise out of the depths of nothingness to great heights. How could this be? I had saved for decades and you autists had cracked the code. It was right there in front of me the whole time. I had spent years pondering the solution searching for the complex answer that surely must bring sense to the world. But alas it was right there all along in the glory of its simplicity YOLO.  \n\n\nBut alas even though I had seen the light I doubted its integrity, its veracity, its overwhelming purity and so I wallowed lost in the darkness. But slowly I succumbed. Just a few options here and few here. After all I could afford it. I'll just use my dividends I thought, its house money right? Little bit of AMD here, a little bit of MSFT there and a touch of SPY for balance. I was in control of this until it reached out of the depths and unleashed the bat.   \n\n\nThe world seemed to turn on its head and the things that were once true seemed to wash away into the sand. My portfolio didn't look so good, \"global demand\" had weakened and I had lost my rock. My black gold dividend stocks were failing me. My portfolio began to look sickly as it turned and dropped all the while you autists were printing money with puts. Something deep inside me snapped as my personal risk tolerance grew beyond its limits in that moment. I liquidated everything in what can only be described as a pure panic sale and I turned to the light.  \n\n\nAnd that brings us to last week. I purchased TSLA puts on Feb 28th because it was the way. (It wasn't the way). Our fearless leader one pump trump deemed it not be and blew his load at the first sign of shrinkage. I watched in horror as the losses deepened but then came last friday and I was even. I was free of my crime of doubting daddy elon. All was to be well because I saw that one stock alone was green on that fateful day and I resolved myself to do what every bears knows he must. I purchased puts in AMD $50 2020-05-15. Surely, that stock would follow the red of the others I just didn't know when so I bought myself time.  \n\n\nThen the weekend hit and I was alive, sleepless and restless. My brothers here had saved me. You had flamed me into panic selling saving me from the mother of all drilling that would have shaken even the the great bears of  yesteryear.  But it wasn't enough I couldn't sleep, the weekend wouldn't relent until monday arrived.  \n\n\nBlack Monday was upon us and I saw the glorious red ticker of my dreams. Everything was down. It was as if my hopes and dreams were laid upon me. But I had read about the dreaded diamond hands feature and I was determined not to let that fate fall upon me. So I focused my attention at grasping my tendies at first light. But alas things were slow. I could see my tendies but I could not realize them. The order page would not load and there was nothing I could do. I began to panic, the market ticked upward. My glorious bear tendies that were promised were slipping through my sticky hands. Only later would I realize that we bears had tripped the great circuit breaker. But alas one didn't have time to read the news when tendies were at hand. F5 F5 F5 It was no matter until it worked. My tendies were there glorious and rising at 40% returns for 1-day of trading. I could wait no more I gleefully reviewed my order preview, submitted my market order and cheered as I had done it, I had earned my turn in the weekly bear barrel.   \n\n\nAnd then it I noticed something. My account wasn't where it was supposed to be. In fact it was 10k light. Strange I thought maybe all the options hadn't sold yet. A quick glance indicated that they had leaving me wondering what had happened. It took me a few minutes to realize and once I had I realized that I had done the impossible. In my haste to secure my tendies I had sold puts under a market order mere moments after the circuit breakers had reset. And whats worse I had done this under a security with low volume months out in advance. Do you see? Do you see?   \n\n\nAfter the biggest market crash in over a decade I sold my day-old puts for a loss.  \n\n\nAnd for those that want to see it. If you look very closely at this graph you can see the moment where I the autistic bear got fucked.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jg3tckwi7rl41.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6f5c2c254d3066a931eb4d751fac929e46880a\n\nWhat else could be said I know not.
