The Republican proposal took 8 days to fail. Will the Republicans be okay with a Dem proposal? Probably not. \n\nPlus, if you note the vote today was 47-47. That's 96. Where's the missing 4?

As I noted, Dems want to rewrite the bill. \n\nThe main disagreements? \n\n1. $500 BILLION(!!!) dollars for Mnunchin to dole out to companies as he sees fit. Any company. And, the companies receiving these selective handouts would not be disclosed for 6 months to a year.\n2. No precautions to prevent companies from taking bailout money and then firing workers and downsizing anyways, or conducting stock buybacks (I think -- not certain on stock buybacks tbh, but the firing workers point is legitimate -- source WSJ) The democrats are focused on protecting Main Street rather than Wall Street here.\n3. Not enough Main Street help. Dems see $1,200 for every American as not nearly enough (which by the way, the way it is written would exempt many college students, which I think is dumb. Although I'm a college student, so there's an obvious bias there lol).\n\nThese are some major disagreements. We know that the Republicans are friends of big business, so I think they'll work hard to keep point 1, even if the amount the Mnunchin gets to give is lower. It is a bit absurd that almost a third (500 billion out of a 1600 billion dollar relief) would be doled out as per one single person's discretion, with little transparency.\n\nIn terms of point 2, I think the dems are going to absolutely take a hard stance on this. Trump has even stated he wants to disallow stock buybacks, so we'll see how that shakes out.\n\nHowever, the Dems actually have Trumps's support on point 3. His base is being hit hard by this recession, and he wants to be able to have something that he said \"Remember when I did that?\" come election season. $1,200 to every American to potentially buy an election? Not bad! \n\n\nI predict Wednesday or Thursday passage. I'd be stunned if it happens earlier. However, like the market, politics in a time like this can be hard to read. If we see a double breaker tomorrow, and the Senate gets wind of that, the Dems may bite the bullet and just vote for it.\n\nAs for my opinion, I personally hope the Dems stand their ground. They have an advantage right now -- they Dems are 47 and the Republicans are 48 (missing senators, as I noted, due to the virus). A better bill will be just that -- better. For everyone, including investors, and most importantly for the common man. I really feel that delaying the bill 3-4 days in order to create a more robust bill that will help the economy as a whole (rather than just corporate entities) is the smartest thing to do. \n\nBut I'll get off my soapbox now. \n\nOh, and a correction: The bill will not be returning to the House. The House Dems are planning on drafting their own bill, but the current $1.6 trillion dollar proposal remains in the Senate. Today's vote was procedural, and there will be another vote tomorrow.

Dow futures hit their 5% “limit down” overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n> * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China’s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy’s 5,476 deaths. Italy is second in total cases at over 59,100.

Piotroski works as an Associate Professor of Accounting at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nIn 2000, he wrote the paper, Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Information to Separate Winners from Losers. It was this paper that outlined 9 fundamental ranking criteria for picking winning stocks.\n\nUsing his stock-picking criteria, he was able to theoretically average 23% annual gains between the years 1976 and 1996. In 2020, the annual return is down to **15%**.

That's the important part. You now know better, and can therefore do better.\n\nSo, u/IronRT, let's talk grinding stocks for income! Or, as my buddies in r/thetagang like to call them, options!\n\nFor this post I'll assume you're a new trader, with a small portfolio working through a reputable broker like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, etc. You can do this with Robinhood, but I prefer the quality of the big boys.\n\nStep 1: Open an account. Fund the account with whatever you can, though you really need a few grand to make this work. However, if you have $500 that's enough to start.\n\nStep 2: Apply to trade options, how you do this varies per platform, but you'll most likely be approved for level 1 options. That is, the ability to sell a covered call. Or, as I like to put it, making money on stocks you already own!\n\nStep 3: Pick a stock. This stock should meet the following parameters- You should be able to purchase 100 shares.- The stock should pay a dividend (Free money!)- The stock should be reasonably liquid (i.e. have a high volume)  [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks)\n\n$F, $GE, and $NOK and great options here.\n\nStep 4: Buy 100 shares of the chosen stock.\n\nStep 5: Sell a call. Shoot for something with high open interest, that pays a decent premium. Let's use Ford ($F) as an example.\n\nCurrent price: $4.33 ($433 for 100 shares)\n\nOptions Chain:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options/)The $5 call for 3/27 will pay you $0.11/share ($11 for a contract, which is 100 shares) you've now made $11 on $433 or 2.5%. If $F closes above $5 by 5:30EST on the 27th you'll be forced to sell your 100 shares for $5/share. For a total sale + premium of $511. If $F closes below $5 your option expires worthless, you take your $11 and sell a call for the next week. Rinse, and repeat.\n\nThat's the basic plan for selling calls, and making money. Now, how do I get to $500/week? Same process, different stock.\n\nAMD Call: $41 3/27 $264 ($39.61/share 6.7% return/contract)MSFT Call: $140 3/27 $805 ($137.35/share 5.8% return/contract)\n\nWhat makes it even more ridiculous, is that if you don't want to sell your shares, and your call is ITM (in the money, that is the closing price > strike price) you can just buy the call back, and as long as the current sale price < the original sale price you still make money! It's laughably simple.

I'm still working through how best to teach this and having the feedback is hugely helpful.  \n**Why isn't everyone doing it?**\n\nI'll have to guess, as I'm not everyone, but I'd wager that it's a combination of the fact that most people aren't in the stock market, followed by those that are are not often very literate in terms of how the stock market works, followed by the time cost. If you're in a 30-year index fund you make payments, and in 30 years get your money back. No energy needed in the interim.\n\n**Call, Put, and Covered Call:**\n\nYou are correct, you buy a call when you expect the stock to rise, and buy a put when you expect the stock to fall. You do the opposite when selling. I only mention selling calls as most brokerages only let new options traders sell calls, not puts.\n\nA covered call, is a call that you have 100 shares of stock behind. Versus a naked call, where you don't have the stock. A naked call is much riskier, and most brokerages require a significant account balance to allow it. A covered/secured put is when you have the cash to buy 100 shares, v. a naked when you do not.\n\n **3/26p spy .25** \n\nI'm not 100% sure, as your example is missing a few pieces. Let's use the following:  \nMSFT $140 3/27c - (Stock Symbol) (Strike Price) (Expiration Date) (c:call, p:put) So in this case we'd be referring to a call contract for MSFT expiring this Friday, with a strike price of $140\n\n**Interest, Premium:**\n\nHigh open interest, of volume, is the number of options contracts being traded at a strike price, for a given symbol. With high volume/interest the chance of you selling your contract for a good price goes up.\n\nPremium is the per-share credit/debit you pay for the contract. For example, a call contract might have a premium of $0.50 which means you'll make $50 selling the contract, or have to spend $50 buying the contract.\n\n**Stock Losses:**\n\nYes, the value of the stock will go down, even as you sell calls. But remember, you don't lose anything until you sell the underlying stock. Plus, as you sell options against a stock your cost basis (that is how much you paid per share) goes down, making losses in the stock price hurt less.\n\n**Option Expiration:**\n\nAn option expires at 5:30pm EST on the expiration day. (Assuming US Stock market) Most stocks allow Friday expirations only. Some have fewer, some ($SPY) have more.  \n\n\nActive Stocks: [https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks)\n\nBook List: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8qfs14/options\\_book\\_list\\_review\\_of\\_all\\_books\\_that\\_helped/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8qfs14/options_book_list_review_of_all_books_that_helped/)\n\nr/options FAQ: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq)\n\nr/thetagang\n\n [https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/option-credit-spreads-option-debit-spreads-17838](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/option-credit-spreads-option-debit-spreads-17838) : Credit Spreads\n\nThe Greeks: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp)\n\nThe Wheel, with Tips: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the\\_wheel\\_aka\\_triple\\_income\\_strategy\\_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}

{"title": "The week ahead", "selftext": "As we wake up this Monday morning, the markets are down a couple of points, which in this environment is considered good news.\nAsian markets got hit more than usual, with the Chinese composites down 3 and 4%, South Korea down over 5%, while Japan is the single market in the World in the green today, up 2%.\nEuropean markets opened down around 5%, but in the first couple of hours of trading they have regained around 2% of their losses. At 7 30AM ET, when this article is being written, the German DAX is down 3% and the British FTSE is down 3.5%. All other European markets are down from 2 to 4%.\nThe US futures opened sharply lower last night at 6PM and after 3 minutes of trading hit their 5% limit low. With the European markets opening and starting to recover some of their losses, we sow the same movements in the US futures. At this time the Nasdaq futures are down 2%, while the S&P and Dow futures are down around 2.6%.\nThere will be three major factors that will influence the market trajectory this week:\n\nCoronavirus numbers. As the outbreak continues to grow, the new cases and total deaths are raising dramatically every day now. During the weekend, we got more than 60000 new cases and 3000 deaths (20% of the total death toll). These numbers will continue to increase, especially in the USA and their increase will certainly have a negative effect on the outlook and the markets. Also very important will be Spain and Italy’s numbers and their fight against the spread. These two countries are the most affected of the virus and their death rate is far bigger. At the same time it looks like China has put the spread under control, but there are multiple scientists talking about a second wave. If they are correct, that could be catastrophic first for humanity and secondly for the stock markets as well.\n\nEconomic data impact. This week we will get the first real economic data showing the first effects of the economic slowdown. Tomorrow German and European PMI data is expected to plunge under 40, while US PMI’s are expected slightly over 40. On Wednesday, price index data and durable goods numbers, while on Thursday there will be major news from the UK and their Monetary policy, German consumer confidence and the Initial jobless claims in the US expected to report 750 000 (281000 last week). None of this data will be good, and it could bring the markets down even more.\n\nGovernment stimulus. On the positive side the US Government is expected to pass legislation for the biggest stimulus plan in history, reportedly worth over 2 trillion dollars. There are still disruptions in Washington, with the parties not reaching an agreement yesterday, they had a procedural vote that needed 60 yes votes, but split 47-47, with democrats not agreeing to the Republican bill. This is politics and it will get resolved. I don’t doubt for a second that Congress will not pass the stimulus package. The only issue concerning the stock market would be the previsions on how long the companies cannot buy back stocks and worst case scenario if the Government will ask for a stake in the company in order to give this financial aid. The second part is highly unlikely with a Republican controlled Senate.\n\nAll of this being said, there are countless companies that have been pummeled, down 70, 80, 90% of their highs and are a bargain at this price. If you don’t mind wild swings you could start entering the market. If you are more conservative I would wait until this crises settles down and markets stabilize.\nAfter this weekend one thing is clear, this crises is not going to end in two weeks and the economic impact will be much higher than any previous expectations.\nGood luck!", "id": "fnj1y9", "created_utc": 1584966137.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "The question is .

Dow futures hit their 5% “limit down” overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead of Monday’s session, the Dow was off more than 35% from last month’s record highs. The New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor will be close starting Monday.

The 10-year Treasury yield, which popped back above 1% last week, was below that level early Monday.\n\n*****\n\n> * Top-level White House and congressional negotiators burned the midnight oil over the now-nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package. Democrats blocked the bill in Sunday’s vote, saying it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. Several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Mitt Romney, were in quarantine as a precaution. The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout. Boeing stock has dropped 80% from recent highs on the dual crises of the outbreak and the grounding of its 737 Max.\n\n*****\n\n> * The United States has the third most coronavirus cases in the world, with over 35,000 and 471 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than half the U.S. cases are in New York, where the death toll increased to 153. Washington state has the second-most cases, with nearly 2,000 confirmed and 95 deaths. New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n> * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China’s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy’s 5,476 deaths. Italy is second in total cases at over 59,100. The U.S., Spain and Germany round out the top five countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine over the weekend after contact with a doctor who tested positive for the virus.

The title matches and the article is well written with facts.\n\nUnfortunately the Motley Fool article is full of falsehoods, to such an extent that would make Lora Kolodny blush.\n\nHere's a quick rundown:\n\n> \"Tesla has been ordered to shut down the Freemont factory, \"\n\nFirstly, the name is \"Fremont\", and secondly, while Tesla has been ordered by county officials to stop certain operations, Tesla's vehicle manufacturing has been declared ***both*** by California state and by the federal government as \"critical infrastructure\" that can continue to operate even during the lockdown, which preempts the county order both on the state law and federal law level.\n\nTesla's decision to do a partial shutdown was *voluntary* - they could have lawfully ignored the county 'orders'.\n\n> \"As an example, let's assume that Tesla's manufacturing is shut down for two months, revenue drops to zero, and the company has to pay all of its current operating costs and can only reduce its cost of sales by 80%. Based on its Q4 2019 run-rate, the company would burn $344 million per month in operating costs and $399.5 million per month in cost of sales. The cash burn rate would be $743.5 million per month, or $1.49 billion over two months.\"\n\nThat's a ridiculous calculation that artificially inflates the \"cash burn rate\" in support of their flawed thesis. \"Cost of sales\", if they mean cost of goods, goes to almost zero when sales go to zero - that's the whole *point* of cost of goods accounting.\n\nThe mostly 'fixed' part that is more difficult to reduce is opex - but they already counted this...\n\n**So the Motley Fools are basically double counting opex**, to mislead about the Tesla 'cash burn rate' - which isn't really 'burning' cash, for example a good chunk of their opex is R&D investments which will continue to generate value for Tesla.\n\n> \"In total, a two-month shutdown and 12 months of reduced deliveries would result in a $4.1 billion cash burn, leaving a huge hole in Tesla's current $8.8 billion cash balance.\"\n\nIgnoring the fact that it's probably half that large, should Tesla be forced to, they can obviously also reduce opex.\n\nFurthermore, the article ignores the $3b of available credit lines Tesla has open for working capital liquidity purposes. While this was disclosed in their quarterly reports before, Tesla has disclosed this in their recent 8-K as well.

(And then there's the Model Y factory being built in China right now, with 250k/year capacity as well.)\n- Not a single mention of the Tesla Energy business and the fact that new PowerWall orders have now been pushed out to 2021 due to very high demand in California and the rest of the U.S.\n\nGF3 alone could exceed Fremont's end of 2019 output by the end of 2020, and at significantly higher estimated margins.\n\nI have no idea how such a poorly researched anti-Tesla hit piece which is dripping of poorly disguised concern trolling, and which meets the very definition of a 'short and distort' criminal scheme, was allowed to be presented on the Nasdaq website as 'news', giving it a false air legitimacy.\n\nThe Shortseller-Enrichment-Commission is asleep at the wheel, as usual. 🤠", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Your post has a lot of issues with it, but this one is particularly worrying:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That's a ridiculous calculation that artificially inflates the \"cash burn rate\" in support of their flawed thesis. \"Cost of sales\", if they mean cost of goods, goes to almost zero when sales go to zero - that's the whole point of cost of goods accounting.\n\nCost of goods is an item on the income statement - it is not a reflection of what is happening to the company's cash.

The main limitation in the loan is for it to be spent for purposes within China, which is fair enough, but otherwise the loan is broadly defined.\n\nBut more importantly, even to the extent the credit lines have specific purposes, they can be used for that purpose which frees up cash for ***other*** purposes.\n\nThe OP makes an intentionally exaggerated argument that Tesla will run out of cash, using bloated estimates of the cash run-rate, while using artificially low estimates for available sources of cash. \n\n> The fact that you are ignoring readily available information makes your whole post appear very biased.\n\nThe fact that you have arrived at a premature conclusion based on an incorrect understanding of my arguments makes your whole response appear very ill informed. 😉", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": ">But the biggest mistake the OP made is to add 20% of CoGs to opex and equate this to the 'cash burn rate' - that's sloppy, baseless and inexcusable.\n\nThat seems like a fairly conservative estimate of how much the company can reduce cash burn to me.
