I'm not doing complicated trades or hedges, so hedging the second order Greeks usually isn't necessary for what I'm doing.  That's usually a hedge big funds or market makers do for risk management rather than profit.  Gamma Scalping is an example of this.  \n\nWhich ones you focus on depends on what your directional bias and strategy is.  If you're focusing on delta you're hoping for a strong move in your direction.  If you're delta neutral (e.g. straddles and strangles) you'll be focusing on IV/Vega and Theta.  So it all depends.  \n\nI like to start with a top down approach, and then use the greeks to guide me on which strategy from my playbook I want to use.  These are just guidelines and not hard rules:  \n\n1.  Analyze the global and domestic market, and identify environmental factors that may effect the price.  Covid-19, oil price war, upcoming news like earnings or FDA drug approvals, etc. \n2.  Form a directional bias based on your analysis for the appropriate time-frame.  Are you bullish, bearish, neutral, or unknown?\n3.  Based on that bias, choose an appropriate strategy from your playbook and start using the greeks to tweak it.  I usually go in this order:\n  * **Vega**: Where is IV, and where do I think it's going?  If it's high and I expect it to drop I'm probably going to use a credit strategy, and vice versa\n  * **Delta**: Do I want a directional bias in my legs or not?  Where do I want my strikes?\n  * **Theta**: What expiration do I want?  If I'm long I want to avoid theta by going further out.  If I'm short I want theta on my side with expirations under 30-45 days.     \n\n4. Choose your profit targets, the max loss you want before exiting, and what [adjustments](https://tradeoptionswithme.com/options-adjustment-strategies) you'll be making if you need to modify a losing position.\n\n5.  Execute the trade and monitor it.\n\n\nThat's a generalized example of the flowchart I follow when doing trades, but as you get more experienced you'll be doing most of that mentally. None of those greeks operate in a vacuum though so remember to keep the bigger picture in mind.  For example, If I'm selling a credit spread I might be looking at the IV across multiple expirations to find the date that has the highest IV inside my time frame.  It's not purely determined by my outlook on theta alone.   \n\nHow you decide to use the greeks will ultimately be up to you and your trading style.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great sum-up, thanks.\n\nI'm going for daytrades with 0DTE SPY options and try to play the intraday-swings in the near future.\n\nStill sitting on $8.3k SPY $150p 5/15 which are down 60% rn and almost only depend on Vega, which ofc I didn't notice back then frankly because I had no clue üòÇ \nTrying to sell these for profit asap and then switch to good plays with healthy Gamma/Delta.\n\nI noticed that slight OTM 0DTE Options have incredibly high Volume, Delta and Gamma.

One thing I‚Äôve found on contracts like that is it can be very difficult to get filled. Yes they have a couple contracts traded in volume, but if you look around them, all of the other ones have 0. That means something. Plus depending on your broker they have assignment fees (assuming you want to collect max profit) which will in the end make your profit negative. A lot of this depends on your broker, but I had the same logic as you, ‚Äúin the money debit spreads are easy money‚Äù until I did more research and found there wasn‚Äôt a way for me, personally, to make money on them. \n\nFor example, in order to ensure you get max profit on a debit spread, given you can‚Äôt sell it back to someone, is to let it expire in the money. With my broker this will trigger an exercise on both legs, long and short, and give you the max profit. However, not only do you have the debit of the spread you had to pay, but you also (in my case) have exercise and assignment fees of around 5$ per leg regardless of how many legs. If I were to take the trade you mentioned, I would lose money on it. I would recommend looking into your brokers terms and fees and seeing if they have something similar (chances are they do), but this way there are no surprises and you won‚Äôt have any false hope. I don‚Äôt mean to sound harsh, just know I‚Äôve been in the same boat as you.

Their top drAw just removed himself from Mania because of health factors. Other wrestlers (Mike Mizanin and Dana Brooke) were sent home because they were ill. All Vince McMahon needs is one of his employees to really fall ill and weekly tv may come to halt.
