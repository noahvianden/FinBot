I'm not doing complicated trades or hedges, so hedging the second order Greeks usually isn't necessary for what I'm doing.  That's usually a hedge big funds or market makers do for risk management rather than profit.  Gamma Scalping is an example of this.  \n\nWhich ones you focus on depends on what your directional bias and strategy is.  If you're focusing on delta you're hoping for a strong move in your direction.  If you're delta neutral (e.g. straddles and strangles) you'll be focusing on IV/Vega and Theta.  So it all depends.  \n\nI like to start with a top down approach, and then use the greeks to guide me on which strategy from my playbook I want to use.  These are just guidelines and not hard rules:  \n\n1.  Analyze the global and domestic market, and identify environmental factors that may effect the price.  Covid-19, oil price war, upcoming news like earnings or FDA drug approvals, etc. \n2.  Form a directional bias based on your analysis for the appropriate time-frame.  Are you bullish, bearish, neutral, or unknown?\n3.  Based on that bias, choose an appropriate strategy from your playbook and start using the greeks to tweak it.  I usually go in this order:\n  * **Vega**: Where is IV, and where do I think it's going?  If it's high and I expect it to drop I'm probably going to use a credit strategy, and vice versa\n  * **Delta**: Do I want a directional bias in my legs or not?  Where do I want my strikes?\n  * **Theta**: What expiration do I want?  If I'm long I want to avoid theta by going further out.  If I'm short I want theta on my side with expirations under 30-45 days.     \n\n4. Choose your profit targets, the max loss you want before exiting, and what [adjustments](https://tradeoptionswithme.com/options-adjustment-strategies) you'll be making if you need to modify a losing position.\n\n5.  Execute the trade and monitor it.\n\n\nThat's a generalized example of the flowchart I follow when doing trades, but as you get more experienced you'll be doing most of that mentally. None of those greeks operate in a vacuum though so remember to keep the bigger picture in mind.  For example, If I'm selling a credit spread I might be looking at the IV across multiple expirations to find the date that has the highest IV inside my time frame.

The cost is 2.40, but after commission you only stand to make ~7.50. If my math is correct that’s about a 3% gain IF you get filled. One thing I’ve found on contracts like that is it can be very difficult to get filled. Yes they have a couple contracts traded in volume, but if you look around them, all of the other ones have 0. That means something. Plus depending on your broker they have assignment fees (assuming you want to collect max profit) which will in the end make your profit negative. A lot of this depends on your broker, but I had the same logic as you, “in the money debit spreads are easy money” until I did more research and found there wasn’t a way for me, personally, to make money on them. \n\nFor example, in order to ensure you get max profit on a debit spread, given you can’t sell it back to someone, is to let it expire in the money. With my broker this will trigger an exercise on both legs, long and short, and give you the max profit. However, not only do you have the debit of the spread you had to pay, but you also (in my case) have exercise and assignment fees of around 5$ per leg regardless of how many legs.

{"title": "I had a dream!", "selftext": "Had an incredibly vivid dream and I intend on acting on it. \n\n1. WWE drops to $26\nI know this is a decent drop from the current position. WWE has the Network which is a constant monthly revenue stream. Although, they aren’t running house shows or other arena shows (are Wrestlemania) and this is a big chunk of their projected revenue. Their top drAw just removed himself from Mania because of health factors. Other wrestlers (Mike Mizanin and Dana Brooke) were sent home because they were ill. All Vince McMahon needs is one of his employees to really fall ill and weekly tv may come to halt. Also Vince just sold a ton of stock to help cover costs while WWE is essentially closed to the public. I rode WWE down from the $40 range to $30 then took tendies. \nChances of this coming to fruition: 79%\n\n2. Apple drops nearly 50% in stock price. \nI’m currently holding 1/2021 $250c and maybe I was just paranoid about the potential double circuit breaker tomorrow, who knows. Maybe I’ll look into AAPL $150p over the next few months. Most of Apple’s products (if not all, do the DD yourself. This is a shitpost) are made in China. There could be a big hit coming along with the rest of the market? I’d imagine AAPL next earnings call won’t be overly positive.
