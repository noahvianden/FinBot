This occurs because the delta change with each strike has a different rate than extrinsic value change with each strike. Both are nonlinear rates. Higher IV at lower strikes may also play a role, where delta doesn’t change as much.\n\nThe sweet spot for delta value that you’re chasing will change. Constantly. This happy combination will change when TSLA trades at a different price. It will change as time goes on. It will change when IV changes.\n\nAs a learning exercise, this is great.

You’re also buying vega and gamma [edit: the gamma is technically paid for with theta rent]. It’s an all-in-one package, and you technically can’t say that you spent this many dollars on delta. You didn’t buy delta. You bought the package, and you’re in for the ride. It’s kind of like when people tell you to get married to get sex for free. The options contract is the marriage. Delta is the sex.\n\n> So far everyone told me deep OTM would have the best value-delta, but that seems not to be true according to that data...\n\nYou may be dealing with volatility surfaces here. You’re looking at 5 DTE options. Nearing expiration, IV is the least stable across strikes, and delta approaches zero more closer to ATM. To top it off, you’re looking at TSLA, one of the most volatile tech stocks at the moment.\n\n> Is there a proper way to do this? How can I know the money every dollar will give me according to every dollar I invested and 1 dollar underlying movement for every expire and strike?\n\nI don’t know. When I want pure delta exposure, I either trade the underlying, or trade its ITM options. If we continue with the sex analogy, then buying a deeper ITM option for delta exposure is like hiring a courtesan.

You’re collecting a $100 ($250-150) premium (net credit) from the transaction (less broker fees). The spread here (albeit tight) is the difference between the two strikes ($2). Your max profit is realized when CCL closes above the higher strike ($17) and both contracts expire worthless (keeping the entire $100). Your max loss is the difference between strikes ($200) minus your net credit ($100). It’s important to understand that profit is capped and losses are limited. Now let’s assume you hold the spread to expiry: \n\nScenario 1) CCL closes below your lower strike, which can be any price below $15, you will exercise your $15put and profit from that transaction, but at the same time the buyer of your $17put has exercised the option and you’re assigned 100 shares at $17, losing from that transaction. In this scenario, you sold 100 shares at $15 and bought 100 at $17 (-$200), but because you collected +$100 from opening the spread, your net loss is only $100. \n\nScenario 2) CCL closes at your spread break even point, $16, your lower strike $15put expires worthless, but the $17put is ITM and gets you assigned shares at $17. In this scenario, you spend $1700 for the 100 shares, minus your net credit of $100, making your overall cost $1600. Because CCL closed at $16, the market value of your 100 shares is $1600, therefore making you even (only loss would be brokers fees). \n\nScenario 3) CCL closes above lower strike price but below the break even point, say $15.50, the options exercise in the same manner as scenario 2.

I'm looking forward to the most exciting day in Tesla's history!\"*\n\nIt's comments like this that make me worry about the over-hyping happening around Tesla at times.\n\nUnless you have inside information, how can you say with a straight face that Battery Day (of which we currently know nearly 0 facts) will categorically be a bigger deal than:\n\n- Launch of the Model 3\n- Launch of Tesla Semi\n- Reveal if the Roadster 2.0\n- Launch of the Cybertruck\n?\n\nI'm all for being excited about Tesla events - they are usually a lot of fun - but I think sometimes people project their own hopes and dreams upon these events. Maybe it's better to set lower expectations while still being excited, and then you have the option to be very pleasantly surprised. The opposite though, leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  \n\nJust a couple weeks ago, I was listening to people discussing what Neuralink were about to reveal. Some of the outlandish theories just made me wonder how hard people were willing to fall when their expectations weren't met.

They currently have very high IVs .   Airlines:  UAL, DAL, AAL, LUV.   Cruise Lines:  NCLH, CCL, RCL.  Hotels:  MAR.    Gaming:  WYNN, MGM,  LVS.  Aircraft: BA.    Ride Sharing, UBER, LYFT\n2. \"Work and shop from Home\":  Stocks that have high IV and have clearly benefited from the work from home trend, and should continue to do so over time:  AMZN, PDD, ZM, SHOP, MELI, BABA, PYPL, SQ\n3. Oil.  The usual factors driving oil.  Mostly global economic growth expectations, but also the behavior of OPEC and to some extent, the resumption of air travel.   OXY, MPC, PBR, CLR, SLB, IMO\n4. Meme stocks.  I don't touch them, but worth mentioning here:  TSLA, KODK, many others but I don't pay much attention.\n5. COVID Vaccine:  MRNA, AZC, PFE, ALXN\n6. Internet:  General non-mega cap internet names that have high volatility but OK fundamentals: TWTR SNAP, SPOT\n7. Financials: Mostly sensitive to Fed Policy, but usually appear in a list of high IVs:  ALLY, FITB, COF\n8. Semiconductors.
