It was the S&P 500‚Ä≤s longest losing streak since October. Tech was broadly lower, with Amazon and Facebook both down 5% for the week. Information technology shares lost 1% but communications which includes Facebook and Google fell 2.3% for the week.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think every time you‚Äôve had a significant pullback in the familiar names, that tends to draw in more money,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had a little rotation toward value. That‚Äôs a healthy sign for the market. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an unhealthy market even though stocks look pricey. Given how low interest rates are, stocks look like the only game in town.‚Äù\n*****\n> There are also a number of Fed speeches, but the most important will be the appearances by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before three Congressional committees. At two of those, Tuesday and Thursday, Powell appears with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to discuss coronavirus aid.\n*****\n> Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said he does not expect much from Powell after his comments following the Fed‚Äôs meeting this week, though the central bank chairman is likely to once more tell Congress fiscal stimulus is needed to help the economy recover.\n*****\n> Keon said it would be positive if there could be another stimulus deal but the market no longer expects it. ‚ÄúIf we do get a deal, that would be really positive. I think at this point, there‚Äôs a little bit of a slowdown in news. We still have a ways to go before we get into earnings warnings season. We‚Äôre going to worry more about the presidential election and its aftermath,‚Äù said Keon.\n*****\n> Keon said investors are increasingly focused on the election and the potential for an uncertain outcome, as states deal with large amounts of mailed ballots for the first time. He said the concern is it could take weeks or months to determine the outcome if the race is close.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still six weeks to the election. We haven‚Äôt had the debates yet. That six weeks is a lifetime. Biden seems to be the favorite at this point, but I don‚Äôt think the market is betting on anything but higher volatility,‚Äù Keon said. President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden hold their first debate Sept. 29.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think volatility is the norm, not the exception, until we get through the election,‚Äù said Hogan.\n*****\n> Investors have been hedging against extended volatility after the election. Patrick Kernan, who trades S&P options with Cardinal Capital, said the flow into S&P 500 options for January has been steady over the past several days. ‚ÄúThe options markets are implying a contested election that could last until January,‚Äù he said. He said the market is not positioning around one candidate or other, just uncertainty.\n*****\n> Goldman Sachs strategists noted Friday that investors have pushed out some hedging further into November, though some investors appear to be betting on an outcome by Dec. 8, the date states with contested elections have to report.\n*****\n> There are also a few important reports on the economic calendar, including housing data on existing home sales Tuesday and new home sales Thursday. ‚ÄúThe housing market has been solid and hopefully, we‚Äôll get confirmation of that because people were upset by the decline in housing starts,‚Äù said Hogan.\n*****\n> Manufacturing PMI is released Wednesday and durable goods are reported Friday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NxJH3xO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pqCJiWe.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/85tdlJ8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/asJwOaC.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fXDr9bd.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F4ZSk2C.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7LIfrR3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b7IUJO1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/It9kGgQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nkTU6Yr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 2\n\n> As we noted last week, the demand for election charts is off the charts (pun intended), so we are sharing some of our favorite election charts.\n\n> Without further ado, here are some more election charts you need to know as November 3 inches closer.\n\n> How stocks perform three months before the election has a stellar track record of predicting who will win in November. If stocks are higher, the incumbent party tends to win, while if stocks are lower, the incumbent party tends to lose. This indicator accurately predicted the winner 87% of the time (20 of 23) since the late 1920s.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Building on this, if President Donald Trump is going to win, right about now is when the S&P 500 Index should start to outperform. Of course, if it weakens, it could mean we will be looking at a President Joe Biden soon.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Speaking of presidents up for re-election, here‚Äôs what the S&P 500 historically has done during re-election years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, here are two final charts that may help forecast the outcome.\n\n> If real per capita disposable income is higher, the incumbent president usually wins. Conversely, if wages are weak, that bodes well for someone new in the White House. Given real per capita disposable income is up more than 7% this year, it would suggest President Trump should take more than 70% of the votes. Of course, this is greatly skewed due to the CARES Act, so we‚Äôd put a major asterisk next to this one.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> To sum up, Gallup poll approval ratings have done a nice job of predicting how many votes a president up for re-election might get. With a 42% Gallup approval rating currently, this comes out to 49% of the total votes for President Trump, which points to a close race.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 3\n\n> One of the top requests we‚Äôve received the past few weeks is for more charts on the US elections. We shared some of our favorite in Election Charts You Need to See: Part 1 and Part 2, and today‚Äôs the third blog in our series on this important event.\n\n> S&P 500 Index earnings are expected to jump close to 23% in 2021 according to FactSet, as the global economy recovers. Presidential nominee Joe Biden has made it very clear he will likely hike taxes, which could potentially cut 10 percentage points off earnings growth next year if implemented. If Biden wins, we would expect Chinese tariffs to be removed as well, which would offset some of that impact and according to our friends at Strategas Research Partners would suggest earnings growth of nearly 17%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As shown in our LPL Chart of the Day, how the US dollar does ahead of the election has been a great indicator of which party might win in November. If the dollar is weak three months before the election, this bodes well for the incumbent party, while the incumbent party tends to lose if the dollar is strong. This signal has been right 7 of the past 8 elections.\n\n> As we saw back in March, when trouble hits, the US dollar tends to do well, as investors flock to the safety of the world‚Äôs reserve currency. When things are calm, the dollar tends to weaken, which favors riskier assets. So far, the dollar is slightly lower, which would suggest a potential win for President Donald Trump.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Also, the size of the tax increase proposed by Joe Biden as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would be one of the largest ever and rival President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs (LBJ) tax increases in the late 1960s. Let‚Äôs remember though, if there‚Äôs a split Congress, the chances of the full tax plan being implemented is quite slim. Additionally, a weaker economy would also reduce the chances of a large tax hike.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Seasonal Volatility Just Getting Started\n\n> The market's day-to-day volatility has picked up in September after experiencing more stable trading action during the summer months. This is not out of the ordinary. Historically, the most volatile time of the year for stocks has been between September and early November. You can see this in the chart below that shows the average absolute daily percentage change for each trading day of the year beginning on the first trading day of January through the last trading day of December. As shown, daily volatility is very consistent around the +/-0.70% level over the first eight months of the year, but then it starts to pick up beginning in September until it reaches a peak during the first week or two of November. From there, the holiday season takes over and daily volatility plummets right through the end of the year. As shown in the chart, unfortunately we've still got a ways to go to get to the top of the volatility mountain, so make sure you've got your climbing gear ready for the next six to eight weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/avgvol.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Keeping Tabs On High Frequency Growth\n\n> The week ended September 11th showed a sharp decline in our index of weekly GDP versus the year before. As shown, our index can be quite volatile, but it does do a decent job tracking the general trajectory of GDP. Since peaking at an implied growth rate of +0.9% YoY on July 10th, our index has slid to -2% YoY, the lowest reading since mid-June.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091820-Weekly.png))**\n\n> Taking a look at another tracker of short-term economic growth, below we show Weekly Economic Index data updated by the New York Fed each week. After decelerating sequentially YoY for the week ended September 4th, the WEI reported sequential YoY growth slower once again in the week ended September 11th. We also show what each high frequency tracker implies about quarterly growth. As shown, our tracker has consistently implied a higher quarterly growth rate than the Weekly Economic Index, and official data for the last two quarters. That said, Q3 is tracking at least 20%, with upside to the high-20s as the US continues to rebound from COVID. This post was originally published in our post-market macro report -- The Closer -- last night.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091820-WEI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sell(ing) Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur\n\n> As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, ‚ÄúSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.‚Äù It gets tossed around every autumn when the ‚Äúhigh holidays‚Äù are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.\n\n> The basis for this, ‚ÄúSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,‚Äù pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away ‚Äì and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.\n\n> Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 100 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It‚Äôs no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/08c1da4f106eb00e65a4532c55dd8ea0/ad7e0851da5530c5-bd/s1280x1920/744427ad7335745d917da73a6033df7c6d4fe9eb.jpg))**\n\n> Perhaps it‚Äôs Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 6.7%.\n\n> This year the high holidays commence on Friday eve, September 18, and end Monday September 28 with Yom Kippur just before Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, quite possibly setting up the market for further declines.\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 down 24 of 30 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%\n\n> The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 30 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.\n\n> Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA ‚Äì1.01%, S&P 500 ‚Äì0.95%, NASDAQ ‚Äì0.95% and a sizable ‚Äì1.42% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/22b6293d7be32f7d061f3954195fbd77/96e081bfd002ca33-4d/s540x810/dbec24da50db919ec2882bb2c0051a40ed608543.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/It9kGgQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HB39ZrE.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 9.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.22.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/quiFQMw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BOgJ0wf.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dbDH93f.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/g7tSsGT.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vIb8HLi.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ke0CbCj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.25.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Costco Wholesale Corp. $335.96\n**Costco Wholesale Corp.

So if you need to improve from where we are now wit current LiIon tech, which one would be the direction that would make sense?  At this point in time, with Tesla already competing with ICE cars on any other metric, battery cost would be the deal breaker. None of the other parameter really would shift mass markets but cost. \n\nWe can go through details if you like, and please add comments to the following:\n\n1) Range: Not critical at this point. 300 mls range covers the vast majority of the ICE use cases with home  charging and the improving in the SC infrastructure taking the non covered use case down to  negligible in the next 5 -10 years. No need of a breakthrough here\n\n2) Charging Rate. Mostly applies to urban environments where home charging is  not an option. Users in these environments also tend not to drive a lot on a regular basis but it is a substantial set of the driving population. Now, affording a car, ICE or BEV, in a urban environment is already challenging per se, and an expensive car parked on the street is even more challenging.  In other words, these users will be the latest to migrate to BEV unless cost drops significantly. Long Haul drivers seems not to mind the current SC infrastructure timing. So charging rate is a low impact element.\n\n3) Longevity. The jury verdict is still out on this, not enough data at the moment, but it seems that the 70% bottom line capacity was way too conservative, with few of the Tesla cars reaching the multiple hundreds of miles mark still holding more then the advertised 70% charge. Again, a million miles battery  would not change the market dynamics.\n\n4) Energy density and Weight. Tesla already is competitive for road transportation on these two performance metrics. Energy density would allow for compact lighter cars but the majority of people that buys more compact lighter cars do not want to spend 50k$ right? So again, if cost goes down a lot, the market share dramatically increases.\n\nNow, I do not want to say that the above points are right for everybody, but I do not see any of these to really being key - in the present conditions of battery technology - to accelerate the transition to BEV.\n\nThis is it...

{"title": "Wanted: Share Buybacks", "selftext": "A few days late and several dollars lighter, I had to think about why the market has gone to shit. Value the new Growth? SPAC attack? IPO FOMO? Biden lead to widen? Corporate tax hike? Capital gains growing pains? Oh I know, it‚Äôs because fund ownership/certain portfolios can‚Äôt exceed a certain threshold of risky assets. Yes to all but NOOOOOOO. \n\nPart One: Treasury Stock\n\nHere is your answer to the Great September Decline: \nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sp-500-buybacks-decline-55-4-to-88-7-billion-significant-reductions-expected-to-continue-in-q3-2020--301131361.html\n\nAnd here: https://www.ft.com/content/c60ea33a-9bea-49ff-b967-86149203412a\n\n(For a publication with credibility)\n\n\nThe answer is the lack of share buybacks, ‚ÄúProvisional figures show the total spent on buybacks by companies in the S&P 500 was about $89.7bn, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, down 46 per cent from the same quarter last year.‚Äù Get your stupid head around that number. Read it again. That compares Q2‚Äô19 and Q2‚Äô20. Imagine your pay just took a 46% cut. Sad but true, many of us will take a 100% pay cut soon enough. \n\nApple, the king of the buyback, has ceased or dramatically halted, its program. And what Apple does, the world does. \n\nWhere did the cash go that companies were using to buy their stock? profits/retained earnings were reinvested in the business right? WRONG. Dividends skyrocketed. Does that help your average trader or 401k portfolio? No. It helps the big boys and girls with tens and hundreds of millions/billions in a company. Oh it also drops the price per share. Double fucked. \n\nPart III: Why Stop the Buybacks? \n\nOptics. FeAr Of SlEePy JoE and Senator Elizabeth Warren. She knows her shit, even if VP Biden slurs his speech, with all due respect. She is going to criticize the hell out of corporate America and its addiction to buybacks. No organic growth or job creation, just share inflation. She‚Äôll want to legislate equitable rules that limit the ability of share buybacks for publicly traded companies, and especially those who take JPow money to pay creditors.\n\nCompanies also know it may be in poor taste to buy back shares when there are, what, 20 million people unemployed in America? Trouble imagining that stat? Imagine you‚Äôre one foot tall. Now imagine I‚Äôm 20 million feet tall. \n\n400,000 people applied for jobs at amazon...in one week. That‚Äôs bad. Walmart is raising its wages by 11%. These are not charitable businesses. But, when even Walmart says, ‚ÄúThis is bad, we have to give more,‚Äù you should know, this is fucking bad. Why? Because there is a chance Joe Biden wins. That all eyes will be on them and their accepting of billions of dollars from stimulus checks. It has nothing to do with taxes. \n\nIt has to do with the possibility of additional press, shame, and testifying before Congress, that is almost certain to follow if buybacks continued during a pandemic where companies were asking for trillions. Who the fuck wants to join the apology tour? Most CEO‚Äôs do their best to stay private and out of the public light because they know they are overpaid. Certainly, the members of the board are rarely seen in the public eye. Martha Stewart is still pissed at you, you know who you are. \n\nAlso, Q2 corporate buybacks let Congress breath a sigh of relief. They think we don‚Äôt need more PPP. More stimi. They are happy to feed you to the wolves so long as they can get re-elected. I hope they read this, which is what I think my man Jim Cramer wants to say:\n\n Red, blue, fuck all of you. America is in the desert and needs water. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs half a glass or a whole glass. Without any water, economic death to small business and most of your taxpayers is imminent. I am tired of the cries against more stimulus:‚ÄùWealth gap increase will result?‚Äù Sure. ‚ÄúMoral hazard for lending to zombie companies?‚Äù Sure. But what‚Äôs the alternative? ‚ÄúYou get what you deserve?‚Äù Nobody deserves to lose everything, with a few exceptions. What‚Äôs the point of paying taxes when your country won‚Äôt act when you need it most. And to be clear, this is a national problem. No state has sufficient resources to stop all interstate travel and implement all safety measures. But Congress and money can fix all of those things. Politicians are just the worst. They can‚Äôt agree to help each other. This isn‚Äôt 1800‚Äôs where we are talking about the 13th amendment  and going to war. You‚Äôre not supposed to hate each other. We are talking about some money. It‚Äôs not even your own money. \n\nPart IV: When Can We Get the Illin‚Äô to Stop? What Do I Buy?\n\nSo, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to know when buybacks/the market will pick back up‚Äîafter the election. ‚ÄúBanks think maybe Q4 2020, or maybe Q1 2021 buybacks will resume.‚Äù\n\nIf you want advice on what to buy, I can tell you four things: \n\n1) I mentioned amazon and Walmart earlier, they are in big meech mode and will dominate all sales of tangible property. \n\n2) Eat a shit sandwich and hold Apple. Did you miss the part where that stupid watch doesn‚Äôt require you to own an iPhone? How about when they took a shit on peloton and ate their lunch, or how about the part where the 5G phone shits on every currently-existing iPhone? Speed kills, an iPhone  with 5G will be mandatory in all of corporate America. The timing is TBD. Do you really want to miss it? I‚Äôm down 10%, it‚Äôll get to 100 next week. Fuck-ing-Buy. Cramer said anything below 110 is a buy. He‚Äôs right. He‚Äôs always right. It‚Äôs painful. \n\n3) UPS, Fedex, and every fucking company is about to distribute this vaccine. They gobbled up an hour this morning on CNBC. But they need to keep it ice cold, in transit. They need dry ice. I don‚Äôt know who makes that, but I read CC/chemours Corp/CancerCorp/Don‚Äôt drink the water, makes all of that P Phas shit and other chemicals used to coat cooling cables in refrigerators. I really hate them. Watch The Devil We Know on Netflix. They are the worst, but maybe they can do something right for once and be a part of a process that saves lives. Maybe Johnson Controls or Eastman Chemical can get it done. \n\n4) You‚Äôre probably going to get laid off soon or are in over your head. Buy a little (maybe 10%) of UVXY, look for it low @ 19 or 18, then sell ASAP. She always breaks my heart.
