{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.\n\n# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday’s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.\n*****\n> Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.\n*****\n> Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.\n*****\n> “We’re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we’re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,” said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.\n*****\n> “I think that tends to turn things around,” he said.\n*****\n> Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.\n*****\n> # Election watch\nMichael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. “Most people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it’s a big event,” he said.\n*****\n> Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.\n*****\n> “We think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,” he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.\n*****\n> “If Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump’s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,” he said.\n*****\n> The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.\n*****\n> Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what’s worrying it.\n*****\n> “What we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,” said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.\n*****\n> “But the stimulus and election, people can say that’s going to directly relate to earnings,” he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.\n*****\n> Among S&P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. “If third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,” he said.\n*****\n> Many strategists expect the S&P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it’s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.\n*****\n> “I don’t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn’t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,” Townswick said.\n*****\n> The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.\n*****\n> But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.\n*****\n> Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday’s jobs report.\n*****\n> Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February\n*****\n> Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.\n*****\n> “The permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that’s going on in the economy,” he said. “The permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wb4gd2A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N9GB7pr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/F7N4lcy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/9XvRbwLZ/econcal4.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vxohRfN.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uFKJWI5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Og1iuMy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9A4Jc0z.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/zBTB51gf/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/h4rD0s8N/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/zXGJ2h0v/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/sxw3DfD3/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # September Bears Strike Again\n\n> The September weakness continued with the S&P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&P 500—and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks—this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.\n\n> Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “To see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn’t be too surprising,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories\n\n> An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&P’s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cbcf92c83edf8fa419f858f97753f5b3/fc62a1e0362941f1-92/s400x600/14f363a1beca3d2f879a2228394f91ff339b2a37.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # \"Low Energy\" Energy\n\n> US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!\n\n> The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/092520-Energy.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n> October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n> But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n> Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery\n\n> We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n> The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “Even as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it’s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Progress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it’s likely to be a bumpy ride.”\n\n> Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It’s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it’s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 25th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En3kIRj6ED4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.27.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUIfnO9Vpwk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$MU** \n> * **$PEP** \n> * **$MKC** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$BBBY** \n> * **$CAG** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$STZ** \n> * **$NTWK** \n> * **$UNFI** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$PRGS** \n> * **$INFO** \n> * **$SNX** \n> * **$PTN** \n> * **$CALM** \n> * **$ANGO** \n> * **$EPAC** \n> * **$NG** \n> * **$CMTL** \n> * **$SGH** \n> * **$QK** \n> * **$RLGT** \n> * **$GNFT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/9QGXxg0h/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hryCCMm.pngg))\n\n> # ***Monday 9.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ymR5Z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.29.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ER6w385.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2YCpFn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b7i1AYQ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1N7dKUo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XL4b2EY.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.2.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Micron Technology, Inc. $49.14\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

I know there are apps  that are “free” but I’m a little sceptical, especially due to having zero experience with investing. Is this €5 monthly fee standard, or would I be better using something else, eg. An American broker as that may remove the connectivity fee? \n\nA little more information about how I plan to invest is put my £2000 and leave it for maybe 10 years, and when I have excess disposable income buy another share here and there, maybe 3 a year. I’m based in the UK. I’ve been wanting to do this for a while now but my lack of knowledge has put me off, any help and advice whatsoever would be greatly appreciated.
