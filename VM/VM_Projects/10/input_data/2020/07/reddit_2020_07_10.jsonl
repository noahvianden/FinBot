{"title": "Is apparel brick and mortar retailers going to recover?", "selftext": "Stock prices reflect many believe the (inevitable) decline of apparel brick and mortar retailers has been fast forwarded several years as a result of the pandemic. Year to date, AMZN is up 70 %, ASC is only down a few percent and JWN is down 60 %. Since the beginning of the pandemic, markets have been extremely volatile which indicates the possibility that investors have consistently overreacted; alternately they‚Äôve been overly pessimistic and overly optimistic. Yet, there‚Äôs been a dominating trend when it comes to apparel b&m and here we are- JWN and similar b&m retailers way down. Not all, however -  ROSS hasn‚Äôt been hit as hard as JWN, MCY, KSS etc.\n\nSo, do you think as we enter 2021 the gap between online stores like ASOS and department stores like Nordstrom will increase or decrease? Here‚Äôs a few thoughts I have about why the gap may get smaller: \n\n- Historically, if survived, apparel retailers - be it brands or department stores - like H&M, Nordstrom, Ralph Lauren, Gap, have dramatically recovered after times of economic crisis. Take a look at 2008 Q3 - 2010. \n\n- b&m based stores are expected to readjust to the changing retail landscape. It‚Äôs not breaking news that b&m is facing a downward trend. Well managed companies have known this for years and they‚Äôve prepared readjustment. Nordstrom, Ralph Lauren and H&M have increased digital sales dramatically and for every store they close, they have more liquidity to put into digital expansion. \n\n- Right now everything is looking dire for b&m. In time, we will approach a new normal and I can‚Äôt imagine anyone will want to see ghost towns everywhere. Many stores will close but everyone - government and consumers - will prefer busy malls and shopping streets rather than ruins. \n\n- it‚Äôs possible that we will experience a boom in b&m shopping. People have been caved up for six months going, and to many people shopping is a passion that they don‚Äôt want to go give up. Sure, many prefer to be without it and order on Amazon, but there‚Äôs always going to be a ton of people that simply enjoy going shopping or they prefer the convenience of being able to try on clothing at the store and to feel the products rather than watch them on a screen. It‚Äôs always going to be an issue to get the size right and not have to return it. \n\n- online stores are going to face challenges as well. It‚Äôs not all glory days for them. Investors are probably slightly ignoring that perspective as they expect Amazon to only be successful from now on. \n\n- just like investors likely are too pessimistic when it comes to b&m, they are perhaps too optimistic about online retailers. There‚Äôs a boom going on right now and it‚Äôs possible the bubble will blast. Companies like ASOS have a long way down if they start downtrending. Nordstrom and others may have already reached rock bottom. \n\nLet me hear your thoughts.", "id": "hon6n2", "created_utc": 1594380118.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "mid tier stores will all die. luxury brand stores will be around for rich people. amazon, walmart, and dollar stores will be for poor people. 80% of all retail will be done online, the remaining for people who still want to shop by hand (rich people) or cant afford a computer (really poor people)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that mid tier stores will likely suffer the most.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "deflation and a constantly squeezed middle class will do that", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The only one I like right now is Kohl's.

Not every stock, of course, but stocks from every major company and every major sector world-wide. These types of funds are not really growth funds. They are designed to protect your money against drops in one particular regional economy and against drops in any given sector. They tend to be \"low volatility\" fund. They are best for people who are past the age of 50 or people who are very, very risk averse. \n\n**VFIAX**: This is an S&P 500 index fund, designed to keep pace and match performance with the S&P 500 Index. It appears the fund is poorly managed, however, because it hasn't been keeping pace with the S&P 500.  (Possibly due to management fees?)  **VOO** would have been a better choice for an S&P 500 Index fund, but **VOOG** would have been a better choice for growth within the S&P 500. \n\n**VTSAX**: This is also a \"total market\" type of fund, similar to **VTIAX**, only for US stocks only. Again, I'm not fond of total market funds for growth. They are designed to decrease volatility, not maximize growth. \n\n**VIG**: This is a dividend appreciation fund. The goal here is to provide income from dividends. If dividends are re-invested you can expect modest growth from **VIG**. The stock value of **VIG** has underperformed the S&P 500, with with dividend reinvestment, it may have slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years. Again, this is not really a growth fund. A fund like this is best suited for retired investors or those near retirement.\n\n**VXF**: The Vanguard extended markets index fund is similar in goals to **VTIAX** and **VFIAX**.\n\n**VWO**: Emerging markets index fund. In theory, this fund should be a growth fund. However, most foreign markets have been pretty flat over the past 10 years, and you have gotten zero growth out of this fund. This fund has underperformed the S&P 500 by a significant amount. \n\n**MGK**: This is the only real growth fund that has performed well over the past 10 years in your portfolio. It hasn't done as well as a lot of other funds, but it has outperformed the S&P 500 by about 50%. \n\nIf someone advised you to pick these particular funds, you should fire them. They did you no favors.\n\nAssuming you are still at least 20 years away from retirement, you want to invest in more aggressive growth funds.  Consider Keeping what you have in **MGK**. Consider moving money from the other funds to funds like **VOOG**, **QQQ**, **ARKW**, **ARKG**, **XLY** and **IWF**. These are aggressive growth funds and should outperform all of your other funds by a significant amount. Each of these funds has a history of outperforming the S&P 500 much of the time (although the ARK funds don't have a long history). \n\nIf you are over the age of 50, consider keeping some of the money you have in these funds where they are, and consider moving about 50% to 75% to the funds I suggested.\n\nAs always, do your own Due Diligence.

Reminds me of that feeling of waking up to circuit breakers holding puts. But I left a lot on the table. 30% realized vs 850% if I sold at EOD today. Obviously the better play here would have been to hold, but i was a paperhand noob watching it swing dumb fast when I entered. \n\nSo my question is: let's say the stock de jour is mooning straight from opening til EOD and you could get in whenever you wanted, would it be better to (a) hold that 0te all day, one way ticket to paradise; or (b) jump out at any mirco dips and reentering with bigger positions from compounding your massive gains?\n\nOh one other thing, if you are strictly day trading, seems like 0tes are always a better reward to risk (assuming you're able to correctly predict the direction and iv) right? I recognize the risks of it moving against me, but still. I've been day trading with expirys 2-4 weeks out. This seems foolish now. \n\nLet me know gang.\n\nPosition: 5x SPYc $317 7/13 and cash for more TSLA FDs on Mon.", "id": "hoxx8n", "created_utc": 1594417586.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "0dte should only be used when you have a strong conviction about a movement, or for quick, 10-20 min max swing trades. anything else is pure gambling (wsb investing). regardless, the answer to your first question is probably A. you're gonna loose more trying to time temporary top and bottoms then you're gonna make. I sorta already answered question two I guess, but yeah you're sorta right, it really depends on timeframe.
