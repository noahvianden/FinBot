So many of these tech companies are changing the way we live for the better that I think they are sustainable long term.  Back in 1999 you can slap .com on a box of turds and make a billion dollars.  Anyways, here is a copy/paste of a comment i just posted in another thread;\n\nThis was a big issue in 1999, not so much in 2007, and is a major issue now.\n\nThe late 1990's was the first time the oublic could conveniently access the stock market witbout using a broker.  Anyone with an Internet connection could buy stocks from an online discount broker.  Technology stocks were on fire and small, inexperienced individual investors were piling in.  It ended in tears.\n\nAnother parallel to the late 1990's is the liquidity provided by the Fed.  We were staring down the Y2K glitch and there was concern that some large % of computer systems world wide would crash on 1/1/2000.  The Fed pumped alot of $ during late 1999 which provided the fuel for final tech rally into March 2000.\n\nWhat we are seeing now is several orders of magnitude higher than what we saw in 1999.  Both more small, inexperienced traders and way more liquidity pumped by the fed.  \n\nDon't take any of this post as a prediction.  How the hell would I know what is going to happen in the future?  If you want to do a thought experiment on your portfolio, ask questions like this:\n\nIs my XYZ likely to be the next Amazon or the next AOL?  The next QCOM or the next Nortel/Lucent.  I could type dozens of symbols that were household names in 1999 that no longer exist.\n\nIf you want to know how the dot com bubble ended, it was about 3 months after the Fed tapped the brakes and on almost the exact day that AOL bought Timewarner, which I believe was the largest merger in history at the time.  Something will happen towards the end of this bull market that we'll look back on as the end of the move.  Something odd like TSLA buying Caterpillar or something crazy like that.  Oh, tech companies were also spending millions of dollars buying the naming rights of stadiums.  You ever heard of PSINET?  They bought the rights to the Baltimore Ravens stadium.\n\nDon't make decisions based on the info in this post.  I typed it from memory and a bull market can last a very long time.  I do think that one day we'll look back and see that the app Robinhood was instrumental in robbing the poor and giving rhe money to the rich, which will be ironic.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Great write up.

And, every new Harvard/Stanford MBA was trying to take anything they could public. \n\nI worry the stupid money is getting suckered back in right now. Wall Street has always been a vehicle to extract wealth from Main Street and I see no evidence of that changing. \n\nWhen the 00 bubble burst Main Street disappeared from the market and a multi year malaise begun.
