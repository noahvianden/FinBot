The run has been fueled in part by optimism about the car maker’s earnings report due out late Wednesday. Some analysts forecast a surprise profit that would make the company eligible for inclusion in the benchmark stock-market gauge.\nTo be considered for the index, companies must report an accumulated profit over four consecutive quarters, including the most recent. Tesla has yet to accomplish the feat. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by FactSet is for a modest loss. Some analysts are more optimistic because of the company’s recent history of earnings beats and Chief Executive Elon Musk’s aggressive push to restart his Fremont, Calif., factory even as the coronavirus put a halt to production.\nThe prospect of joining the index highlights Tesla’s unconventional trajectory. The company is among the most hotly debated in the investment community. Bears question its accounting and contend the stock’s surge amounts to a bubble that is bound to pop. Bulls frequently tout the promise of Tesla’s technology and argue that inclusion in the S&P 500 will spur the next leg of the stock’s rally.\n“It’s unusual to see a stock get to the market cap that Tesla has without being in the benchmark,” said John Porter, head of equities at Mellon Investments Corp., overseeing about $35 billion in stock, including a position in Tesla. “Normally, you wouldn’t get to an outsize market cap before you’re already generating a profit.”", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Hopes of inclusion have led some traders to position through Tesla’s shares and options for an even bigger rally. That’s because of the flurry of potential buying activity that inclusion can drive, with more than $11 trillion in investments tracking the index, according to S&P.\nTesla didn’t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for S&P declined to comment on Tesla.\nMoney managers that track the S&P 500 but choose to opt out of buying Tesla shares risk lagging behind the broader gauge if the company’s shares continue to soar, analysts said.\n“I may not like the story or I may not understand the story,” Mr. Porter said. But, he added, “do I want to have an implicit bet against it by not owning the stock? That’s something a lot of people are contemplating.”\nReporting a profit wouldn’t automatically lead to inclusion in the index, but Tesla would be eligible for consideration by the eight-person committee determining the makeup of the S&P 500. A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said adding a stock to the index can happen at any point once a company is eligible for consideration. The index rebalances four times a year, but the committee can add or delete companies at other times.\nThis committee has reshuffled the gauge—adding one stock while nixing another—10 times this year, bringing in stocks like Domino’s Pizza Inc. and software company Paycom Software Inc. while dropping Harley-Davidson Inc., Nordstrom Inc. and Macy’s Inc. No other switch has enthralled traders as much as Tesla’s potential swap has.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla would be the biggest company by market value to ever join the S&P 500 and would make up about 1% of the gauge, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The company was on track to become one of the top 10 U.S. companies by market capitalization for the first time last week before the shares pared their gains. Tesla recently surpassed such heavyweights as Home Depot Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Intel Corp.\nShares of companies entering the S&P 500 usually get a boost around the time they join, but those gains can be short-lived. Of the 10 companies joining the index this year, half have lagged behind the S&P 500 since inclusion, while the others have outperformed.\n“This price effect is largely temporary and reverses gradually after the inclusion,” said Maria Kasch, a visiting professor at Humboldt University of Berlin who studied stocks added to the index between 1989 and 2012 and co-wrote an academic paper on the topic.\nIn July alone, Tesla’s share price has soared 45%, compared with the S&P 500’s 5.1% gain.\n\nAdding to enthusiasm for Tesla shares is the prospect of a Biden victory in the November presidential election. Former Vice President Joe Biden recently unveiled a $2 trillion proposal to fight climate change, which includes investing in 500,000 charging stations for electric cars and ramping up research on batteries used in the vehicles. An RBC Capital Markets survey in July showed that investors view Tesla, rival Nikola Corp. and auto-parts company Aptiv PLC as some of the biggest beneficiaries of a Democratic victory.\nTesla’s candidacy for the S&P 500 also reflects the changing stock market, which is more reliant on its biggest companies than it was in the past. The five largest stocks in the index— Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. —recently made up about 23% of the index, the highest proportion in at least 30 years, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nGoldman estimates that about 35% of the S&P 500’s constituents change over a decade, as companies with more-promising growth prospects are added. Since 2017, 21 of the 78 additions to the index have gone to the information technology group, more than any other sector, according to S&P data.\n“It’s going to be a changing index,” said Andy McOrmond, managing director at brokerage WallachBeth Capital. “Our pandemic, [Covid-19] experience is going to speed that up.”", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "God bless you, sir.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You’re welcome.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "The real MVP", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com)\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^[delete](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fu%2FLinkifyBot&subject=delete%20fyvvo80&message=Click%20the%20send%20button%20to%20delete%20the%20false%20positive.) ^| ^[information](https://np.reddit.com/u/LinkifyBot/comments/gkkf7p) ^| ^<3", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "https://youtu.be/QX6f7p5zfjQ", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"I don't know how to smoke anything\" - Elon Musk", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Except the SEC and shorters 😂", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Knock knock knock knockin' on heavens door", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I want that as my steering wheel", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

{"title": "Tesla should start a Car Sharing network (rather than ride-hailing) right now", "selftext": "The topic of a Tesla ride hailing network similar to Uber and Lyft has been brought up this week thanks to the question on Say.com. I'm writing this before the Q2 call, let's see if this makes any sense after hearing what Elon has to say.\n\nIn my opinion, the ride-haling idea can very quickly be dismissed. Just think of the regulatory nightmare that Uber/Lyft have been through, as if regulating autonomous driving wasn't already hard enough! On top of that, the possibility of hiring human test drivers is absurd, and a step backwards considering the ultimate goal and flagship feature of Tesla is full autonomy. Hired humans screwing up once in a while is the most perfect FUD generator we could ever provide.\n\nInstead, a **carsharing** service can be implemented today even without autonomy. It allows for a smooth transition to autonomy, while collecting usage data and contributing to the neural network training. Autonomy can be gradually introduced in different cities as approved or according to strength/quality of of the neural network performance in that particular region. It is feasible starting with any size fleet and requires no hiring of drivers/monitors. All it needs right now is a bit of software, insurance and perhaps more chargers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Intro: Carsharing (**[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsharing)**)**\n\n>Carsharing or car sharing or car clubs is a model of car rental  where people rent cars for short periods of time, often by the hour. \n\nIn other words, think of Lime scooters, but with cars (and obeying basic traffic safety and civism  rules). I will use Daimler's [Car2go/ShareNow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Now) service as example since  this is the one I often use. Essentially, you have an app in your phone, you look for a car near you, walk to it, get in using a code, **you drive,** you park it anywhere you want in the city (within some boundary) and you leave. It's paid by the minute, and all you need to join is a valid driving license, a proof of address, and a credit card. Besides the app and minute based tariff, it is exactly the same as any other car rental: The driver is fully responsible any fines, parking or speeding ticket, as well as  for any damages to the car (the next user can very easily report them). This is not the future, this exists for a few years. It's also relatively cheap (0.30 € per minute). A short ride with 2 passengers is often comparable to pair of bus tickets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Plan and why it is a good stepping stone towards robotaxi that we can start today:**\n\nThe Tesla network can be implemented in 3 steps, as autonomy improves or is regulated:\n\n***Step  0***:  A Tesla owner can submit his car to the Tesla network pool, meaning that any person  with a driver's license can find it using the app, walk to it, enter the  car **and drive it**. The car must be left within some city boundary. The  problem with this is that the owner may have to go pick up the car  somewhere in the city at the end of the day, if he wants to use it as well. In the meantime the owner can monitor car while at work using the app. This is today's Carsharing, except you own the car.  If Tesla owns the car, this is literally the exact same thing as Car2Go.\n\n***Step  1***: the car could reposition itself autonomously when not being used, like a smart summon across the city. This is either to come back to its  owner at the end of the day or to avoid concentration of cars in the  city centre/periphery according to the time of the day (the biggest problem of today's carsharing, see below). This can be done at very  slow speeds, with no occupants on board. This should ease regulators, especially if some key areas of the city can be avoided, initially. To drive with living passengers, on all roads and at normal speeds, a driver must be present, either driving manually like step 0, or ensuring that the (level 3-4) autonomous system is doing its job correctly. Data is collected, stepping stone / proof of concept / build safety record for regulatory approval. \n\n***Step 2:*** Level 5 full autonomy, no driver is required. Robotaxi as planned.\n\nBottom line is: the owner of the car should never have to drive it for other people. He just gets money for letting other people borrow it, first as  drivers (step 0 and 1) and later as passengers (step 2). Step 0 could be  implemented today with no autonomy. No Uber chauffeurs at any stage! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My experience with car sharing and why I think Tesla's would blow other services out of the water:**\n\nI  live in Stuttgart Germany, where the car2go fleet is all electric Smart cars. They are great! (The very early versions had Tesla power train). I  use it sporadically, besides public transport. I would use it more often if  there were more cars available. The problem is that you can't count on it to get to work. The fleet follows the general  commuting patterns: gets concentrated in the city centre during  the day, and in the residential areas in the evening.  So there's never one when you need it unless you wake up very early. For the same reason,  parking at the destination can be a challenge, which sucks when paying by the minute.\n\nBesides  this there are some user experience annoyances that Tesla already solved: I get on a car2go and I need to look around for the key,  it doesn't know my seat position,  I need to adjust the mirrors, the navigation asks me to accept the terms  and conditions (every single time), radio and is still set to whatever crap the previous person was listening, navigation system is useless and doesn't  know my home or work location. With a Tesla all of this is preset and magically adjusted your preference as you enter the car.\n\nMore on parking: I have to spend a couple of bucks looking for a parking spot, maybe risk a fine and wasting energy, just to let someone take the same car a couple of minutes later (in some locations it literally takes seconds). Driving around the block at 10km/h is something that can be done  by a Tesla today without any driver. Perhaps in restricted areas, such  that you don't walk out of the car in the middle of a major avenue. A  cross-City summon even if not at full speed, would be a total game  changer in Carsharing and city commuting in general.\n\n  \n**What's needed?**\n\n* Phone app - check\n* Always connected car - check\n* Specially tailored insurance policies - check\n* Driver/occupant monitoring and logging - check\n* Active action on bad driver inputs, accident avoidance - check!\n* Regulatory approval - check for Step 0, take as long as necessary  for Step 1 and 2\n* Charging - Can be a challenge. On Car2go, users get a bonus credit (5€) to if they bring a car with <50% charge to a charging station and plug it in. If Tesla  suddenly introduces this service, existing city charging infra-structure will be instantly overwhelmed. Highway Superchargers are not useful. Tesla would need to install city superchargers, or rely on individual car owners to charge the cars at home. With autonomy, we'll have to make peace with those alien-anal-probe-like chargers.\n* Full Autonomy - not necessary, but eventually check, of course.  \n\n\n**Value for the owner**\n\nYou don't want other people driving your car?  Germs? Fair enough. Buy a brand new Tesla for yourself, have the old one working 24/7 to pay for it. The fact that the car can make money for you even without autonomy is an instant retroactive value boost to all existing Tesla's in the world, independently if you bought the FSD package or not. Re-sale value would sky rocket. Even the shittiest, most scratched, high mileage battery degraded, smelly Tesla can be making money for you and all you need to do is tick a box in your phone app.\n\n**Value for the commuter** \n\nI (broke, but being able to drive) get to go to work driving a fancy electric car every day, or if I feel like it depending on the weather.  No more paying for parking.  No more issues with living in a city apartment and not being able to charge the car. Clean air in the cities. If I need a car just for the weekends, I'll just walk around the block and pick my favorite. With autonomy: Also while drunk.\n\n**Value for Tesla**\n\nActually, providing a Step 0 service might suck for Tesla because less people would be buying the FSD package in the short-mid term. But in car-sharing mode, all autonomy features would be activated. With FSD or not, I could imagine the owner having to pay a substantial fee in order to put his private car in the network. That's still 100% profit. Then, obviously, both Tesla and car owner profit from the user.  Tesla can also be the owner of most of the fleet, that would be all of our returned leases and lemon cars. Finally, have I said how much I enjoy the Smart fortwo electric? Imagine turning an entire city into a show room, and have your potential customers pay for test drives. That's almost as good as having your customers pay to help you train your neural network, that you'll later charge even money for.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThere's no need for autonomy for Tesla to immediately implement most of what the Robotaxi service shall be. Current levels of automation and connectivity would be a game changer for a type of service that already exists (even though no one seems to be aware of it in the US). The Tesla network can be implemented today, with the customers (very happily) doing all the driving. There is no need for unqualified chauffeurs or regulatory approvals. Lots of bad publicity will be avoided. Robotaxi will build up on this foundation. When full autonomy is turned on by the press of a button the only difference is that you can watch netflix or sit on the back seat.\n\nEdit: On the call they referred to to the ride-hailing service when talking about insurance. The zero details given makes me think they haven't really thought about how it's going to be implemented. Most likely the only thing in Elons mind is full absolute kick-ass autonomy from the get go. Also if either owners or customers say \"Nah, I'll drive it myself thanks\" then a fully autonomous car may loose some of his value. Elon says a Robotaxi with full autonomy will be worth 100k, but that's collective value of being in a shared network plus the value of being self driving.
