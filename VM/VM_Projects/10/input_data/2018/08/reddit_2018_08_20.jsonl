That is unlikely to happen unless they add the RayTracing software to the $200 every-man cards like the 1060 and 1050 since those cards make up the bulk of the gaming market.  Since the Nvidia technology is proprietary vs the Open Source version that AMD is using you'll probably see the normal split of Linux users going with AMD technology and Windows users going to the Nvidia technology.

One of the reasons why Fortnite overtook PUBG it runs much better on lower end systems.  WoW, League of Legends, DOTA2, Overwatch, Path of Exile, CS:GO, Warframe.  These are all games that work on low end and consistently have the largest player bases.  Frigging Hearthstone has something like 50 million players off and on.  RayTracing won't come to those games or games of that nature.\n\nYour God of War 2 (5?), Jurassic World 2 or Far Cry 6 will, but it will be disabled for most gamers.  Just like hairworks is disabled on most games because it's a horrible resource hog that doesn't improve graphics enough to justify the extra overhead.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a wonderful marketing move by Nvidia.
