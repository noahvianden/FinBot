{"title": "Should You Buy Activision Ahead of Earnings?", "selftext": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/314769/should-you-buy-activision-blizzard-atvi-stock-ahead-of-q2-earnings\n\nShares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI)\thave climbed over 8% during the last three months on the back of a solid first-quarter performance, overall momentum in the gaming industry, and a major new partnership with Disney (DIS)\t. So let’s see if Activision Blizzard stock might be worth buying ahead of the release of its Q2 financial results Thursday.\n\nOverview\n\nActivision Blizzard and Disney announced on July 11 that the two sides reached a multi-year rights agreement that saw ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, ABC, and various Disney-owned streaming services broadcast the playoffs of the gaming giant’s new esports league. The deal is also set to include coverage of the second season of the Overwatch League and will amount to hundreds of hours of live coverage and highlights. Amazon’s (AMZN)\twidely popular Twitch streaming platform also covered the Overwatch League this season.\n\nActivision Blizzard’s Overwatch league features 12 teams, spread across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. The league also boasts some big-name owners, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who all paid $20 million per team to reserve franchise spots in the inaugural season. Intel (INTC)\t, T-Mobile T-Mobile (TMUS)\t, and HP (HPQ)\tall sponsored the Overwatch League this season. Meanwhile, the overall esports economy is expected to total $906 million in 2018, up from $696 million in 2017, according to market research firm Newzoo—with the potential to hit $1.5 billion by 2020.\n\n\nThe company looks poised to cash in on the growing popularity of esports, which features other industry powers such as Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) . Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard posted record first-quarter digital, mobile, and in-game revenues and net bookings, with operating cash flow up 29% from the year-ago period. The company’s well-known franchises like Call of Duty and Overwatch continued to drive top-line growth, while Candy Crush remains one of the most popular mobile games in the U.S.\n\nATVI closed Q1 with 51 million monthly active users across its Activision titles, while Blizzard’s MAUs reached 38 million. King’s—which includes Candy Crush—monthly active user reached 285 million. Investors should note that the global games market, made up of 2.3 billion gamers, is projected to climb by 13% in 2018 to hit $137.9 billion, based on an April Newzoo report.\n\nPrice Movement & Valuation\n\nMoving on, shares of ATVI have surged over 300% during the last five years, which outpaces its industry’s 180% climb and crushes the S&P 500’s roughly 70%. Over the last 24 months, Activision Blizzard stock has jumped by roughly 84%.

It also now expects to spend less that $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2018. \nThis quarterly update is a crucial one for Tesla. Investors have growing concerns about the sustainability of Tesla's profits, the reported quality problems with its cars, and overall demand for the Model 3, which is the company's biggest bet by far.\nTesla said it produced 53,339 vehicles in the second-quarter and delivered 22,319 Model S and Model X vehicles and 18,449 Model 3 vehicles, totaling 40,768 deliveries. \nThe company said in July it was able to repeatedly hit its target of producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week. \nProduction, though, is many months behind schedule and the company has resorted to setting up assembly lines in temporary tent structures.\nTesla is now aiming for a 6,000 vehicle per week rate, which it hopes to achieve by the end of August. By the end of the year, it hopes to ramp up to a rate of 10,000 per week.\nTesla's total automotive gross margins increased to 20.6 percent, fueled in part by a the fact that Model 3 gross margins turned slightly positive in the second quarter. Tesla expects Model 3 margins to be 15 percent in the third quarter. Tesla expects to produce 50,000-55,000 Model 3s next quarter, and deliveries should exceed that number. \nThe company burned through more than $700 million in the quarter, a drop from the more than $900 million it spent in the first quarter. \nMany analysts think the company will have to raise fresh capital by the end of the first quarter of 2019. Tesla seems to have taken another step toward getting its finances in line by recently hiring a new chief accounting officer.\nTesla has also courted controversy in recent months due to the erratic behavior of Chairman and CEO Elon Musk. On a conference call discussing its first-quarter earnings, he called questions posed by analysts \"boring, bonehead questions,\" and more recently caused a stir with some off-color comments on Twitter. Some investors worry Musk's online presence risks alienating fans and potential customers, and distracts investors and employees from Tesla's basic goals.\nThis is breaking news.
