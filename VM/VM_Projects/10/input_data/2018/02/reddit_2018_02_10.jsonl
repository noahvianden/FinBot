{"title": "Managing short puts during market stress?", "selftext": "Hi, the past week has been pretty uhm \"exciting\" to say the least. I lost a good amount on Monday with the huge down move. To be fair, maybe I took a position too large for my actual comfort. At any rate, it makes me wonder how you're to manage short puts in these types of events.\n\nOn 1/15/2018, /ES P2500, collected 4.65; I believe Delta was around -10\n\nOn 1/23/2018, ES P2625, collected 7.00; I believe Delta was around -10 (maybe a bit higher, I was a little more aggressive what with the huge run up we'd had)\n\nGoing into 2/5/2018, I had 2 naked /ES puts expiring in roughly 40 days. I'd seen the market beginning to stall a little bit, but since the Deltas were already less than 10 each, I wasn't worried - I figured I'm safe so I didn't do anything. Then I left my screen for a while and when I came back later, the market tanked. My P2625 was ITM pretty badly and coupled with the huge expansion in volatility, I both of the puts had jumped in value. I found myself facing a ~15,000 loss from my 2 /ES puts.\n\nI considered exiting the position but figured the volatility would drop even a little bit - I grit my teeth and held on. So on Tuesday I watched my loss go from 15,000 down to ~6,000-8,000 (at a point it even dropped to -3,000 but I can't call the top etc...)\n\nIn this case I was just lucky that things stabilized and there was a bit of a dip in IV and the market came back moving my P2625 back to OTM. So I closed out of my 2 puts at a net loss of ~6,000.\n\nWhat would've been the proper thing to do? Buying a put would've cost an arm and a leg with the spike in IV, it seemed really risky to sell a call to make a strangle or even a straddle since it could bounce right back up past the strike and I'd be facing losses on both sides, one from IV, one from direction. I considered the \"exit when your loss is twice the credit received\" but 1, I didn't see that happen since I wasn't at my desk, and when I came back it was waaaaay beyond that rule. I also considered rolling out in time, but the credit received was pretty small and I still had quite a bit of DTE. What really screwed me is that the initial credit was really small relative to the price jump during the VIX explosion.\n\nWhat could I have done better? Or what would you have done given that situation. Now, it seems like even selling 10 deltas is pretty risky...", "id": "7wj0dt", "created_utc": 1518233449.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "The proper approach is to define your exit points before you enter a trade.
