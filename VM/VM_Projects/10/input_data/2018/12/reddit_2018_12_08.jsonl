If they own their own music- they can reduce costs and also include adds- like other platforms do today( or charge a nominal fee) \n\n\nThis is honestly not good news for Spotify- unless they start doing similar tactics. \n\nSpotify/Pandora all have to pay royalites to the Music Cartel- so there is still a dependency on them.\n\nApple music plans to remove that cartel. Take the money straight. \n\nApple Music has been trying to get exclusive artists and releases for a while now( personally seen the difference) \nIt didnt exactly pick up- mostly cause of services costs\n\nBut imagine they are able to sign Artists like Drake/Beyonce ( the future Artists into Apple Music directly)\n\nDr Dre is already with them and Lovine is in a Consulting role. \n\nAnd we all know Dr Dre’s success as a producer and artists- created the biggest name  in Music only second to Quincy Jones.\n\nThese are they guys leading this effort( and Apple is poaching even more executives from the Music Cartel in LA)- finding Artists to sign to Apple is easy peasy for them. ( and they get even more richer in the process)\n\nI am sure- they can get artists to sign to Apple music- as time goes by( like a new Jay Z /Taylor Swift Album on Apple music) ( and Tidal is failing) \n\nPeople will SUBSCRIBE to their service even more if they have original artists signed to them. \n\nAlso- Apple Music has Signed up with Amazon- to play Apple Music on its Alexa/Echo devices.\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/story/apple-music-on-amazon-echo/amp\n\nSo Even more platform reach( not just on people’s phones)\n\nThis is confirmation of Apple’s path towards the Services side- and as more days go by- it just gets more and more clear what their strategy is\n\nAlso- reducing Entire revenue streams on just Hardware is proving to be costly and too many other factors- including the trade war shit with China. \n\nThis increase in the services side of the business helps reduce that profit dependency on the Hardware side. Yes its still a hardware company( for now) but it is WAAAYYYY more easier to be on the Software services side then hardware any day.

While Google and Facebook still hold dominant positions, Amazon's advertising business is growing rapidly enough to cause concern. Given Google's lack of diversification, that's more than a bit of an issue.\n\n2. Culturally Google has had a number of issues over the last couple of years. While people may not regard this as material, I think it's concerning including recent walkouts.\n\n3. A number of the \"other bets\" have been somewhat disappointing, including Google Fiber. Verily has had disappointments (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/google-s-health-moonshot-comes-back-to-earth), as well. I don't think Nest has lived up to expectations. Some neat other projects that weren't part of the other bets (Project Ara) were given up on. Boston Dynamics - the robots whose demonstration videos go viral every time one is put out - was sold to Softbank. Even look at something like the Pixel phones, which have gotten good reviews (as did the Google Nexus phones line previously), but I don't think that Google has put enough of an effort behind either line of phones to get any sort of material market share.\n\n4. Google has to push towards diversifying the business over the next 5-10 years. Waymo has to work. I think there's a lot of pressure on Waymo to become a significant business in regards to Google's need to become a more diverse business in the coming years and move away from becoming so reliant upon ad revenue.\n\n5. Regulatory risk, including dealing with GDPR. The Trade Desk (TTD) has benefited from Google's restrictions (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/googles-data-restrictions-help-ad-tech-firm-trade-desk.html) \n\nPersonally, I'd rather Microsoft or a number of other things in tech.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think a lot of the issues you pointed out are not unique issues to Google.\n\n- Employee issues\n- Previous failed new products/services\n- Pressure for new product to succeed\n\nI think a big question is their main revenue from ads.

Previously, it thought the company was only going to make $2.89 billion.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon will take the third spot behind Google and Facebook.
