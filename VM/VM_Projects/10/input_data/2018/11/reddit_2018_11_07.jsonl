{"title": "Apple wanted investors to be mad about not reporting unit sales.", "selftext": "Think about it.\n\nApple no longer wants be looked at as a pure hardware play. Hardware companies get crappy PE ratio's.  Usually 8-12 PE only. While software/services companies get 20-30 PE ratio's with even just mild growth.\n\nSo what is the best way to 'get rid' of investors who look at Apple as a hardware company?  Stop reporting unit sales.  That will scare away all the investors who still view Apple as a hardware company. Do you think investors get scared away because Amazon does not report Echo unit sales every quarter?  Or that Microsoft does not report Surface unit sales every quarter?  Hell no. Because those companies are not viewed as pure Hardware plays.\n\nSo here is Apple's basic plan:\n\n1. Announce the end of Unit sales reporting. And do a bad job explaining it.\n\n2. Those who viewed Apple as a pure Hardware play will sell their shares.\n\n3. Stock will drop hard. This will enable investors who believe Apple is a services company to get a discounted price.  Also allows Apple to buy back shares at a cheaper price.\n\n4. The investment base is now made up of investors who believe Apple is a software/services company.\n\n5. With decent growth Apple will have PE expansion to 25-30 PE.\n\n6. Apple and Apple investors win. Again.  You don't become a Trillion dollar company by being dumb.\n\nAnd this has been in the works for a LONG TIME.  The first Apple watch was released over 3 years ago.  And Apple decided not to report unit sales.........This plan was in the works for YEARS.  But Apple waited until services revenue was 15-20% of revenue.  In a couple years Services revenue will be 25-30% of revenue.
