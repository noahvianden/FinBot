{"title": "Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)", "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

{"title": "Is it time to hedge volatile stock holdings with an investment in gold?", "selftext": "* Lagging and volatile global stocks, a strengthening US dollar, and prospects of slowed interest rate hikes combine to create a potentially bullish outlook for gold prices.  \n\n* From its value of USD$2,925.51 on October 3rd, 2018, the S&P 500 has fallen 10.01% to USD$2,632.56/share. Over that same time period, the price of gold has appreciated 1.69% to USD$1,223.38/ounce. A continued downturn in US stocks coupled with a downturn in global stocks will work to potentially drive further appreciation of gold prices.   \n\n* Current high levels of inflation, as indicated by growth in the US consumer price index and producer price index in 2018, should also work to create a favorable environment for gold prices. The United States has seen consumer price index and producer price index growth above 2% for every month of 2018 -- the last time these indicators observed growth in excess of 2% over 10 consecutive months was from June 2011 through April 2012, when the price of gold appreciated by 7.84%, and from May 2011 through March 2012, when the price of gold appreciated by 7.42% respectively.   \n\n* Strength in the US dollar also supports a bullish environment for gold prices.  The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index’s current value of 96.9920 is at the highest level seen since June 2017. Historically, gold prices diverge from the value of the US dollar amid a downturn in the latter.   \n\n* Prospects for deaccelerated interest rate hikes in 2019 by the US Federal Reserve also bolsters a long-term bull case for gold prices. A slowdown in the pace of interest rate hikes by the Fed will likely spark higher inflation of the US dollar, which may cause investors to increase gold holdings to hedge against inflation.  \n\n* While indicators like a strengthening US dollar, volatile global stocks, and high inflation combine to form a bullish environment for gold, supply and demand levels for the precious metal tell a different story. According to GoldHub, supply levels of gold have held steady since 2010 while real demand for gold (by the technology and jewelry industry) has trailed off. Although the current macroeconomic environment appears favorable for an investment in gold, gold supply and demand levels actually work against this thesis. Investors seeking to hedge their stock holdings with an investment in gold should tread cautiously and plan for at least a 1-year holding period.  \n\n* What do you all think about a potential investment in gold?

Salesforce costs $25 – $300 and offers an extensive AppExchange network with functionality that’s great for sales teams.  \n**Salesforce is a CRM** software designed specifically for mid- to large-sized sales organizations. While the tool offers things like contract and order management, its differentiating features include its cross-sell knowledge base or the extensive number of sales automation tools offered for free through its AppExchange. Salesforce is therefore focused more on managing sales and sales-related activities than general operations management.  \nWhereas,  Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a CRM for large teams with sales and general operations management functionality. It’s a Microsoft product and works very well with Word and Excel, and you can also purchase modules like accounting and inventory management. However, it does not integrate well with third-party tools like MailChimp or QuickBooks. For this reason, it is best for organizations wanting to manage all business operations in one place using Office tools.  \nSalesforce and Microsoft Dynamics 365 both have web-based user interfaces that group information such as accounts and related follow-up activities on a single page. Depending on the pricing plan, additional fields and customized dashboards can be added by users with administrative privileges. Both tools are loaded with functionality that can overwhelm the average user, and training is therefore recommended for either tool.  \nBut, Salesforce is much ahead of any of its competitors as it is a cloud-based tool rather than a desktop app, which means the tool is accessible wherever you have access to the internet. The user interfaces itself is a web page that you navigate by clicking on links that are grouped by headings such as accounts, leads, campaigns, and forecasts and reports.  \nSalesforce hosts an app exchange marketplace where one can locate various third-party applications that can improve Salesforce’s core functionality. Added features may increase efficiency and leads to ROI to businesses.  \nSalesforce provides access to success communities, where you can interact with other Salesforce customers, get guided online training, access a self-service portal, and have guaranteed a response within two business days as part of any Salesforce license. Additional support, like 24-hour assistance, can be added on for an additional fee based on the needs of your business.  \nHowever, Salesforce for growing sales teams based on its core functionality, design with sales teams in mind, integration with third-party apps, and entry-level pricing point.
