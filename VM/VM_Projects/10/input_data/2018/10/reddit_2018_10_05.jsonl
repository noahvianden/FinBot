Low rates correlate to increased demand (spending, consumption) and therefore production to meet the demand, especially in sectors that require financing (for most people) to make purchases (housing mainly). Low rates for a long time causes a boom in those sectors, which in turn causes a rise in prices as the price for materials and equipment and other inputs. As the supply of finite resources (land, labor) and other resources begins to tighten but are still demanded by the market, inflation naturally occurs (prices go up). So the amount of spending and consumption causes the prices to go up in a low rate, credit-driven economy (demand-pull inflation). Raising interest rates is an effort to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from getting out of control. The idea of boom and bust is part of the business cycle but the Fed is trying to manage how hard the bust will be. The stock market has reacted somewhat irrationally to Trump's presidency even though it managed to level out and not be too volatile. As unemployment has continued to drop, even after the Fed began raising rates, Powell and other Fed execs probably became concerned they haven't been acting fast enough and in turn possibly allowing inflation to run amok. That is not the case however. The stock market is reacting to the possibility that rates are going to increase to the point where spending and saving level off. Housing is expensive in many markets and wages are finally starting to show an ability to rise. By slowing demand through raising rates, prices will level off including the price of stocks. So in a way, raising rates will temper the stock market by tempering spending of companies and individuals. \n\nWhat I would say about a \"market going down\" or a bust or signs of a recession (although I don't think there will be a full-on recession), is that once unemployment shows signs of ticking back up, probably in the coming months, maybe early next year, there might be a panic. A few months of up-down-up-down are probably nothing to fret over, but a couple months of greater than .1% increase in unemployment will likely mark a change in market sentiment. I think the beginnings of that are happening at the macroeconomic level and will likely be incorporated into the markets by BB and funds in the not too distant future. The market won't necessarily \"go down\" but a short period of a bear market might come into existence and possibly spread a measure of fear into smaller investors leading them to pull money out of equities and into fixed income.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> What I would say about a \"market going down\" or a bust or signs of a recession (although I don't think there will be a full-on recession),\n\nwhy do you think there  won't  be a  ''full-recession'' ?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "At least compared to 2007-2009, I don't think that it will be anything like that. Since it's the most recent one in everyone's mind, it is how people will judge what is going on but the causality of that one was brought on by a myriad of factors that haven't been happening or haven't been as noticeable this time around. Sure, employment is up, credit has been easy, and prices are up on stocks and real estate, but are there any banks or lenders with toxic assets on the books like before? How are we to know? I honestly don't think so. \n\nIf there is going to be a downturn in prices, imho, it won't be as drastic as before. I think markets cleared sufficiently last time - businesses that are still around have done so by either organic growth, acquisition, or mergers. I just think we'll not see a similar catastrophic fallout but maybe a bear market or a stable pattern of little growth marred by higher interest rates.\n\nedit: I think if something happens, the Fed may halt raising rates for a couple quarters, maybe a year or longer if unemployment spikes or signs point to a recession; but, I think this time around a concentrated business cycle contraction would be the term most appropriate. If a significant drop in stocks happens, that may just be a \"correction\" as, at least since the 2016 election, the stock market went up, at least in the first few months, on the premise that the not-too-distant future will bolster values.
