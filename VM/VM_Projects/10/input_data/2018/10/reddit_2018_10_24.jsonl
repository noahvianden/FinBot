This, combined with Fed roll-over cessation will produce a feedback loop that will result in the Treasury increasing the interest rate offered outside of the Fed's attempts to set and fix the interest rates for US denominated debt.  This will further amplify the feedback loop.\n\nIn short, the Fed is currently experiencing another \"taper tantrum\" that's being disguised by shitty trade policy, allowing the Fed to look to other way and continue tightening.  Eventually, the trade policy chickens will come home to roost, repatriation of corporate funds will dry up, tax revenues will fall short, interest rates will be *required* to be hiked well above the Fed's schedule, corporate debt defaults will increase and stock buy backs will tail off, foreign returns seekers participating in the US equities markets via margin accounts will cash out and further, larger Keynesian stimulus will be required to keep the wheels from coming off (I don't know... maybe another war?).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. OK, but the Fed still didn't *create* debt during the crisis, it *purchased* debt. Debt that was already guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. But you mean they increased their balance sheet. Or perhaps you also mean that these Fed interventions increased liquidity at banks and thus also helped fuel private sector credit creation? \n\n2. The treasury debt is sold in an auction format, so no change in demand is going to create budget shortfalls; a lack of demand would simply cause the market rate to increase. And the Fed typically doesn't intervene to try to influence those rates, they only target the overnight Fed Funds rate.  \n\n3. You are right though that QE did have some influence on those rates. And that since QE is now being unwound (with the Fed balance sheet reduced by about $270B already over the last year), that could now continue to put some upward pressure on those rates.  \n\n4. And you are right that higher rates make equities slightly less attractive relative to bonds. I would add here though that increasing inflation expectations are likely an even a bigger risk factor which could also help to push those market rates higher, and asset valuations lower. And increasing inflation and inflation expectations are really the main thing that would cause the Fed to keep raising the Fed Funds rate, as well.   \n\n5. But I think you are overestimating the degree to which there would be foreign outflows from US bond markets. The truth is most countries have less responsible central banks, and in many countries even less responsible fiscal policy. When interest rates rise in the US, most of their currencies will fall vs. the dollar. They really want to be holding US assets when the dollar is strong. \n\n6.
