It's not a certainty that the market will tank in 2019/2020. That's just the current forecasts from big banks and economists. The problem with forecasts is that they make assumptions, some of which are extremely sensitive to current inputs. If things change in the present day, that error is amplified by orders of magnitude in those forecasts. For example, say the orange cheeto in the whitehouse calls up boss man Xi tomorrow and they work out a deal. Tariffs are gone. How much does that change your view of things? Is it likely? No. Is it a possibility? Very much so.\n2. LEAPS are a waste of capital unless you're hedging something you already own. You're tying up huge amounts of capital for an event that you believe will happen over a year out. The opportunity cost of buying those options is ridiculous, given how many other trades you can make until then.\n3. Given your long-term view, you need to look at the long-term correlations between equities and gold. To be honest, they're not great. One of the reasons the financial services industry likes to tout gold as an asset class is that it's a *diversifying* asset, not a hedge. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or doesn't know the difference between diversification and hedging (which is actually worse). The long-term correlations between gold and equities are close to zero. Hence, it makes a great diversifying addition to a portfolio, but a terrible long-term hedge. To be honest, bonds are actually the same way. Anecdotally, bonds are thought to be another \"flight to quality\" type asset. Empirically, this is true in certain cases (days where stocks have heavy declines tend to also be days where bond prices rise), but on time frames more than a day, this relationship also breaks down. There's loads of academic evidence of this out there, which is actually really interesting, and I'd encourage you to look into when you have some free time.\n\nWith the above considered, I'd say your idea isn't necessarily an \"obvious\" move. If it was, we'd already be seeing the big banks taking huge positions, driving up the vols, and pre-pricing it in. There's another line of reasoning that you may also have not considered, which is why not cash vs. gold? Why not bitcoin vs. equities? The fact that cash is fungible really puts a damper on relationships like these, and it's probably something you should consider.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Isextremelyhelpful", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "ismoderatelyhelpfulsometimeswhenifeellikeit", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Great write up, and really feels contrary to what one hears in the financial media (who—every time there’s a down day in equities and an uptick in gold or bonds jump to the “risk off” and “flight to quality” narrative). \n\nAre there any readily available studies that you can point me in the direction of?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I wrote this with either a PIMCO or an AQR paper in the front of my mind?
