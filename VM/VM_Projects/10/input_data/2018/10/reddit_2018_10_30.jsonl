And the housing bubble in 2008 was fairly obvious, but it wasn't at all obvious the widespread impact that bubble bursting would have, including on equities markets. Some understood the way those risks had been spread throughout the shadow banking sector, but most did not.    \n\nAs for today, I think it is clear that valuations are high. It is also clear also that the Fed has been hiking interest rates (one old saw is \"don't fight the Fed\"). And also that inflation might be in danger of emerging as a threat. It has also seemed likely that we were in the late stages of a recovery and that profits would eventually peak. And also that the changes in the tax law would likely give a boost to profits for 2018, while tariffs would likely have a negative impact on profits, starting about now, and especially next quarter. \n\nWhat is interesting today though is, it's not clear how much broader economic impact there will be from this. The economy is still doing fine. \n\nI had expected a bear market might eventually be triggered by increasing inflation, but inflation has remained calm. Interest rates haven't really risen that much yet. Longer term, looking at the political climate, I see little appetite for either fiscal or monetary discipline, and that could eventually lead to an extended secular bear market, driven by rising inflation expectations, like 1964-1979.  \n\nBut it's far from obvious if a longer bear market is starting now. The recent decline is due not to one thing, but a combination. The problems in emerging markets were triggered partly by the strong dollar, caused by the strong U.S. economy, and rising short term rates. Tarriffs are a separate problem. \n\nBut I can see a scenario though where the U.S. economy keeps humming along through this, and this ends up a brief market blip (like October 1987), and within 6 months time, maybe everyone has adjusted to tariffs and new price levels, or some tariff deal has been cut, and suddenly profits are again on an upward path.  \n", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
