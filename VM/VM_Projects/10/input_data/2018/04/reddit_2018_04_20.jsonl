{"title": "Can anyone provide a bull case for Google heading into earnings? Simple bear case inside", "selftext": "Discussion here should be strictly limited to Q1 2018 performance, thus future investments like Waymo should not be included. Not interested in long term stuff; just playing earnings on Monday.\n\nAlso, I personally have no position and am simply looking for someone to provide a bull case that counters the following points:\n\n---\n\nThe post is ordered from things that had the most impact on Google's miss in Q4 2017 to the least impact.\n\nGoogle missed Q4 2017 earnings because its traffic acquisition costs increased significantly. This is due to the increased share of mobile search at the expense of desktop search (Google has to pay Apple for mobile search), as well as mobile search simply being less profitable.\n\nHas Google done anything to remedy this in Q1 2018? I do not believe they have. Mobile as a percentage of total search has probably continued to increase, meaning continued increased traffic acquisition costs and thinner margins.\n\nSpeaking more generally, Google's desktop search is being eroded by customers going elsewhere for product searches; elsewhere meaning Amazon. If you are looking to buy a lamp, you used to search \"lamp\" on Google, see an ad for lamps on Amazon, click the link and go to Amazon, and provide Google a profit along the way. Now consumers just search for \"lamp\" on Amazon's own search bar. Nothing Google has done in the past quarter has diminished this trend.\n\nLastly, Google is seemingly displaying technical negligence in terms of defeating adblocking services. Lets take the example of a search for \"lamp\" with adblock enabled (specifically ublock origin).\n\n- This is [Google's search result](https://i.imgur.com/xAOOzOE.png). No ads anywhere on the page.\n- This is [Amazon's search result](https://i.imgur.com/wQz6FBE.png). At first, this is unremarkable, with a similar lack of ads, but [scroll to the bottom....](https://i.imgur.com/LqGd8Og.png) and you clearly see 3 ads.\n\nAlso, take the example of the two video services Google and Amazon offer, Youtube and Twitch respectively. Adblock blocks 99+% of ads on Youtube. Adblock blocks 0% of ads on Twitch because Amazon figured out how to inject ads directly into the video stream. As it stands, every video stream provided to a user with adblock on is a money loss for Google.\n\nIt is likely that Google simply decides not to counter adblock for pro consumer reasons, but the potential margin miss there will just continue to grow in desktop as more users install adblocking services. Furthermore, look at that Amazon lamp ad again and I doubt any consumers are bothered in the least.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, if anyone actually has a bull case for Google reversing the trends that led to an earnings miss in Q4 2017 i'd like to hear it. As it stands I have no position but if google rises alot on monday then I might sell a call or something.\n\n---\n\nedit: \n\n- decided to buy puts before earnings [yolo](https://i.imgur.com/PbisUqs.png)\n- Sold after the dip on earnings, 39% profit\n", "id": "8dp3hl", "created_utc": 1524243127.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "I work in paid search.
