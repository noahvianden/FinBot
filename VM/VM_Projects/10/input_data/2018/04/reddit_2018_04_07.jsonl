When you think of rich individuals you think of their \"net worth\" or equity.  You think of Bill Gates having 80B of \"equity\".  Companies are largely valued on their ability to generate cash.  Not on their retained earnings.  All sorts of wonderful companies have negative equity.  How much cash does Philipp Morris really need to keep on hand?   Or Coca Cola, or Facebook (until recently??) ?  If you really dug into McDonalds 10k and found out how many properties they owned, and then \"marked to market\" that real estate, my guess is the common equity does have a positive net worth, but I have never done the work on MCD.  I like the company, just haven't dug in that deep.  I have done it on Autozone.  AZO also shows a negative equity and everyone is always setting their hair on fire over the fact they have no equity.  But again, if you marked to market the real estate they have carried on the books at cost for decades, my guess is their equity is actually positive.  MCD doesn't really have any receivables, their inventory is probably a joke, so they just don't need to have a massive amount of equity to draw from.

You are thinking correctly.  But a couple of things.  GAAP accounting isn't perfect.  McDonalds probably owns 1,000s of stores across the world that are carried on the books \"at cost\" from forever ago.  As far as I am aware, they don't re-apprase, and mark to market that real estate every year or two.  So their \"Property, plant and equipment\" is probably understated by a long shot on the books.  People get caught up on Ben Graham style liquidation value for margin of safety.  So you glance at the balance sheet and see a - equity dollar amount and go wild.

Dollarama’s stores generated aggregate EBITDA of $703 million in F2017.  If accounting book values are to be believed, the core value of Dollarama’s assets ($1.54 billion) was just 2.2x F2017 EBITDA – far less than any reasonable observer would pay for the business on an Enterprise Value.

If these assets were to be re-marked to a market-like valuation, we think they would trade well above the 4.8x TTM EBITDA suggested by their book value in F2011. The low book value occurs because, once set up, stores require very little capital to maintain or grow sales, resulting in declining book value due to depreciation. Why this is important is because when Dollarama repurchases shares at current market prices which are in excess of the book value, it is recognized as a reduction in retained earnings, which is causing negative equity.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "$3.3B is a tiny fraction of the market cap of MCD.
