While the 3 main companies in the sector are trading at P/E's around 40, $AXP and $DFS are trading at P/E's of 15.72 and 13.01 respectively, with forward P/E's of 11.75 and 8.24.

I think electronic and cashless payments are only going to grow as well. Better yet is that Discover still has many places that don’t accept it so there is room to grow if they tread wisely. \n\nI can’t speak much on American Express as I don’t use them personally and haven’t really looked into them from an investing side either. I’m not the biggest fan of credit companies that charge additional fees but I think it’s clear their target base are wealthy individuals and businesses. Many of the businesses I’ve dealt with use them for buying stuff because of their rewards but they can be hesitant on accepting them as a means of payment from customers because of the fees with them so it’s kind of a double edged sword. I’ll have to look more at their books and numbers to get a better grasp.\n\nYou probably already know or have at least heard it already but Visa is a great company to invest in as well. They make and are behind so many different types of credit,store, and gift cards. Even better is that they deal very little with actual lending/credit and more with producing the cards and processing payments. This helps limit some risk and allows it to have its hands in multiple platforms and businesses.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">  I think electronic and cashless payments are only going to grow as well. Better yet is that Discover still has many places that don’t accept it so there is room to grow if they tread wisely.\n\nThis is the argument I don't understand from DFS (and AXS) bulls.  What in 2018 is different from say 2016 when they also had tons of room to grow and be accepted?  Over the last two years V has grown its volume of transactions processed by 49% while DFS has grown by 3%.  So what has changed in 2018 compared to 2016 that DFS can all the sudden stop V's momentum and growth?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great question. First off, I’ll say that I’d take Visa any day of the week over Discover if I had to pick between the two companies in terms of investing. I’ll also admit that I didn’t realize just how much larger and faster Visa grew into comparison to Discover. I knew they had the edge but did not know it was that great. Wow!\n\nWhy do I like Discover? I think the last year or so Discover has really shown it’s serious in competing with the big credit companies and wants to finally move on to the same tier as them. In the past Discover always seemed like it was a good card but still a notch or two below companies like Visa, America Express, and MasterCard. I think this is evident in their cashback rewards and new customer offerings (cashback 2-5%, no interest first year, more competitive rates). These rewards certainly come at a cost but they help build loyalty and attract customers. Discover is also nearly always at or near the top of consumer ratings and customer satisfaction.\n\nI also think Discover has been trying harder to break into markets outside the US. For this company, there is still a ton of potential and growth for it internationally. Have they even fully tapped the US market yet? The ultimate question is whether they can give consumers enough of a reason to move over from other cards to them or at the very least add their card to their wallets. The company also seems focused on younger adults, which can be a double edged sword in that earning consumer favorability and trust early on can make life long customers but these types of people are also more likely to experience financial woes so bad that the company struggles to profit off of. I think as Visa shifts more focus on international goals, Discover will have more opportunities to prove their worth in the US market.\n\nDiscover is also trying to greater diversify itself as well. It’s further pushing its banking options with competitive interest rates for savings accounts and loans. This again adds risk but also potential for higher rewards, especially with rates continuing to rise. When you look at Discover and Visa, you’ll see that they’re actually pretty different with one being more like a banking institution and traditional credit card company while the other is basically a payment processor platform and card maker. While they’re both in finance and fintech sectors, owning both gives further diversity.\n\nLooking at the stock, Discover also seems to offer some value when compared to other credit card companies. Visa trades far higher than Discover does in terms of price/earnings. The company also pay a respectable and growing dividend around 2% which is nearly 3 times what Visa offers. Visa is still a great addition to any portfolio but Discover seems like a better value play as well and more of a hidden gem type stock when compared to other credit and banking companies. Discover also looks to have more flexibility in terms of cash flow when compared to Visa. I still think it’s not a bad idea to buy visa, especially during any dips, but I think you’re going to be paying more of a premium with Visa as the more “expensive” stock.\n\nI think you can’t go wrong with either company but Discover currently has the better value and is more of a higher risk/reward play compared to Visa. All that said, I’d still take (and already have) Visa over Discover. Visa is just a great company that isn’t your typical credit card company and already a leader in the cashless payment platform.
