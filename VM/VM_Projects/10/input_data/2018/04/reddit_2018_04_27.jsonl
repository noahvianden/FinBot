", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Also, realize this is a low probability play. You have worse than 2:1 odds of making money. (Still way better than the trade you wanted to do, though.) \n\nAMZN volatility is at a mid-range here just after earnings, so buying a call vertical or selling a put vertical are both reasonable ways to play a bullish assumption. But instead of putting yourself in a situation where AMZN has to go up significantly for you to just break even, why not structure your trade with a greater probability of success?\n\n(I'm going to do these examples in May, since that was the expiration you picked, but I'd be more inclined to use Jun, with just 21 days until May expiration.)\n\n[With AMZN at around 1585, buy the 1575 call and sell the 1595 call for $10.68.](https://i.imgur.com/DkJm7kf.png) You have a 53.4% chance of making money at expiration. Your max gain is $9.32 and your max loss is $10.68, which is also your capital required. By placing your strikes on either side of the current price, you dramatically increase your odds of winning on this trade.\n\nOr sell an out of the money put vertical. Since my first example, AMZN has fallen to 1575. My target for short verticals is one-third the width of the strikes, so for a $20-wide vertical, I'm looking to collect about $6.67. [In this example, you can get $6.87 for selling the 1545/1525 put vertical in May.](https://i.imgur.com/DK6U6HR.png) This gives you a max profit of $6.87 and a max loss of $13.13, with a 65.7% probability of making money at expiration. (Your 2:1 odds of success are paid for by the fact that this trade has a 1:2 reward:risk.)\n\nI like the short put vertical here personally, because the long call has you paying slightly above par (1575 + 10.68 = 1585.68, when the stock was at 1585.00), but either are good trades for a bullish assumption on AMZN. Your breakeven on the short put vertical is 1538.33 (a 2.3% decline from 1575.01), while on the long call vertical it's 1585.68 (a slight increase from 1585.00), meaning that you can actually be up to 2.3% wrong on the short put vertical and still make money, whereas AMZN still has to go up for you to win on the long call spread. Either is better than doing a long out of the money call vertical, which is way better than buying a naked OTM call, both of which require a significant increase in the price of AMZN to simply break even.\n\nOn either of these trades, managing early will increase your odds of making money. This is one reason why I'd pick Jun (49 DTE) over May (21 DTE). Ideally, I'd like to be out of this trade with 2-3 weeks to go. That gives me 4-5 weeks to find an exit when the market swings in my favor. If it moves against you and is never profitable, you don't have to do anything—your risk is defined. (Don't let it expire between the strikes, though—you'd definitely want to close it out if that's the case on expiration Friday so you're not left holding a long or short position you don't want and possibly can't afford over the weekend.)\n\nThe long call vertical will react faster to changes in the underlying, so if you think AMZN will move up rapidly and soon, that will give you a quicker exit and a larger profit. However, the short put vertical is more forgiving if AMZN moves sideways or even down a bit. So your confidence level in your bullish assumption could also influence you to favor one over the other.\n\nThis stock is all over the place today, so the examples above will certainly be stale by the time you read this. Just keep these guidelines in mind: \n\n* buy verticals with the long strike in the money and the short strike out of the money and look to pay about half the width of the strikes (if IV is low and/or you are more-confident in your assumption)\n* sell verticals where both strikes are out of the money and look to collect about one-third the width of the strikes (if IV is high and/or you are less confident in your assumption)\n\nAs an aside, if you are going to actively trade options, you're going to want to switch to an options-centric broker if you can.

Due to general negative sentiment in the markets, I'm laying off on high-risk plays for now and have instead gone deep into Disney Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPSs) for a somewhat risky and leveraged play without the extreme risk of FDs. I'm still in on the PTLA play for anyone wondering. The day after PTLA's FDA decision is Cinco de Mayo, so no matter which way this play goes, you can go get wasted the next day. \n\n-\n\nFDs aren't for everyone. They rely on short-term movement in your direction, otherwise they can quickly drop 50%+. \n\nLEAPS however are a bit like leveraged shares when looking in the 2-3 month range. A change of 1% in the underlying could equate to a change of 3% to 10% in LEAPS -- this change does not extrapolate when you get into large changes, and the change depends on how OTM or ITM you go. Time decay is also minimal and sometimes insignificant when you take into account an upcoming catalyst. So while there is, theoretically and actually, time decay on LEAPS over the course of a single week or two, that time decay is overshadowed by any catalyst that may also be coming up in that time frame. \n\nNice thing about LEAPS is that you can actually baghold them if the play doesn't go your way. I still would advise against it, but it's possible. Time decay on LEAPS is relatively low as long as you're not bagholding 5+ months or something after the play has gone sour. So LEAPS are good for largely stable companies with strong fundamentals and support.\n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n* **DIS Jan 2020 120.00 calls**\n\nI'm choosing Disney here because it hasn't dropped too much below $100/share lately. For over a month now, Disney has been trading in the $98-$102 range, which makes me think that it will be stable going into earnings on May 8th. I bought over 17 grand worth of LEAPS yesterday because I'm banking on a small reversal in price leading up to earnings. I also thought that today would be a green day after a reversal in general sentiment, but I guess that didn't pan out. The markets are still taking profits and selling off on good news. Since yesterday, my LEAPS have decreased in value by around 5% due to an underlying drop of around 1%. This should give you an idea of how much leverage you're getting into.\n\nI think Disney is going to announce concrete plans, this coming earnings report, about exiting Netflix in 2019 and launching their own streaming service. We're only 7 months away from 2019. I'm also basing this prediction on Disney's hopeful acquisition of Fox and its eventual majority ownership of Hulu. The deal is being held up by Comcast's unrequited love for Sky plc, but beyond that, I think it's inevitable that Disney eventually come in control of Hulu. Comcast will overpay for Sky plc, and Disney will come out ahead because they'll get to own Hulu for cheaper. \n\nAfter that, it's only a matter of time that Disney launches its own streaming service, which will completely overshadow Netflix. If there's anything Disney does really well, it's making hit movies for all age groups.  \n\n-\n\nI'm betting on a move back up to the $110/share range, which would make these calls **profit ~70%**. A move up to $110/share is where Disney was roughly 2 months ago. If Infinity War brings in a $3B box office, we could see a couple percent increase in share price as well. A move up to $105/share would make these calls **profit ~30%**. \n\nThis play is, I believe, not *that* risky because I don't expect Disney to drop below $90/share. Disney would have to announce some truly devastating news, which I don't think is possible. A drop to $90/share would make these calls lose up to 50% in value, which is a lot, but is something I believe to be a worst-case scenario. I also don't think Disney would stay at $90/share for long. \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8feiqh", "created_utc": 1524858761.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Never trust a mod", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "I currently own these exact calls.
