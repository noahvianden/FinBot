Amazon's \"profits\" are a rounding error to their revenue as Amazon is currently seeking marketshare (and has been for over a decade now). Amazon is not an apples to apples financial comparison simply because Amazon's strategy is to trade profits for marketshare.\nIf you look at Amazon's cloud segment (where they have 60%+ marketshare)-- you will see that their margins in this space is huge.\n\n> 2) It's P/E is high relative to CVS which has Pharmacy Benefit Manager Business which makes it distinctly different and hard to compare. It's right in line with Target, below Walmart, etc.\n\nNote: CVS is a debt ridden elephant which is a walking disaster. Arguably they are criminally overvalued:)  If we are going to do comps of Walgreens to generic retail, then its worth recognizing that retail as a sector is a walking zombie -- Sears/JC Penney/REITS..all of these comparisons are flashing red. In-line with a sector that is arguably overvalued doesn't equate to being undervalued.\n\n>3) We as investors can't look at Amazon like they are going to crush literally any industry they see fit. We are oversimplifying a) their want to enter the industry and b) their ability to do so. You can't just decide one day to start selling prescription drugs.\n\nCompletely agree. However my point is this --- Amazon is not even trying to compete (yet) and WBA's margins are thin. IF they were to compete, the logical consequence is that their margins would approach a tipping point which makes the company structurally unsound. This makes investing in the firm HIGH risk -- not because of the competition threat per se, but because they have such a shallow financial moat.\n\nWhat would be more intriguing (from an investment standpoint) is if you positioned your thesis as a TAKEOVER play by Amazon -- similar to the whole foods acquisition. \n\n\n\n ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "All fair points, appreciate the back and forth.

But thankfully, we have a POTUS who's standing up for our country as we've been walked over and used by other nations for decades - not anymore. And a POTUS who expects other nations to REALLY \"pay their fair share\" (see tarriffs/EU/increased exports). A POTUS who's working to level out NK and KJU. Currently talks to occur with Iran, Taliban.

Increased taxation\n2. Elimination of tax cuts\n3. Drastic reduction in military\n4 Somehow, someway an attempt at a single-payer healthcare system that would cost 32.6T over 10 years. And with only tax increases to fund it (add 10% VAT, income [increase 10%] and an additional 10 % for a total of 30% or more tax increase on most all Americans. (Sounds great with the exception of actually being able to fund it and of course it being government run healthcare)\n5. FREE school - $$ ??\n6. The abolition of ICE. Those who police our borders, on average, preventing 10 terrorists daily from entering our country. Democrats want ICE gone. We already know ms-13 is in the country. ICE is who apprehends this garbage from our streets. If ICE were to be abolished our country would be fucked. To hell with all the political shit talk, fact is, without ICE and unenforced borders we'd be overrun by terrorists, gangsters, people who have ill will towards our country and God only knows who else.\n\n**Notice that Democrats can't attack POTUS's agenda. Because they know it's proven a success. So they can only attack him personally and with their ongoing Russia collusion narrative when all along POTUS has been FAR tougher on Russia than and previous administration. Barack Obama is who was over heard on hot mic explaining that he'd \"have more flexibility after the election\" (hmm, interesting all things considered), Obama is who told the nation from the Rose garden at the WH that Russia couldn't do anything (ie mess with elections/voting) all the while Russia was working nefariously in the background AND Barack Obama knew as he had been informed by IT Intel at the time AND Barack Obama told IT team to \"prioritize other items\" ahead of Russian issues (in other words Russia bullshit began during Obama's tenure); it was Susan Rice who unmasked individuals and Barack Obama who wiretapped Trump tower; HRC and DNC. funded fake dossier. FISA warrants signed off using fake dossier. And had HRC been elected, we'd have never known a thing about any of this. Democrats have had to scuddle around, refuse to speak to congress and ignore court subpoenas to hide their guilt. The facts as they stand simply leave no room for any other possibility than corrupt, partisan high ranking FBI working in coordination with HRC, the DNC amongst others to ensure that Donald Trump was ousted and that HRC would be our next president.  And honestly, they did a pretty damn good job in all their shadiness, subverting our laws etc at getting HRC in office. But HRC's own arrogance was her demise. By overlooking important constituencies and regarding 1/2 the nation as \"deplorable\", calling everyone\"racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic, islamophobic, blah, blah, blah\", she fucked herself. Funny for all the blood, sweat and tears Democrats lost in playing their crooked game and hoops  jumped, just like that, HRC blew it all, the dummy! Thank God for our founders and their decision for an electoral system! The wise guys knew well in advance times as these would be upon us.\n\nI honestly can't see how anyone would vote Democratic. \n\nProblem I see: the Democratic political elite (class) and the Democratic electorate are on 2 pages. The political class have an agenda, which largely is power driven but an agenda that will damage the US irreparably. Democratic politicians package everything under one form or another of identity politics (GLBT, international, gender, pay issues, abortion, environmental issues and more) which is all fine and good as far as the everyday, local voter is concerned in taking concern with these issues. But I believe the Democratic electorate is attached to whichever of the issues they choose, giving power, unwittingly, to a Democratic political class who otherwise have a far different (and not so secretive) agenda underway. And with research, going back to the 1800's one can find these answere. In short, I believe the Democratic electorate is being utilized to build its power structure. And because they're struggling, now trying to sell repackaged socialism, they need as many illegal citizens as possible to boost their votes in November. Hence: abolish ICE, they don't like voter ID laws (because dead people voting is A-OK with them and NEVER have been interested in cleaning the rolls or simply ensuring voter integrity). Simply put, I believe the Democratic electorate are good people. They just don't have the same agenda in mind as does the Democratic political class. And the Democratic political class will continue to divide, divide, divide, and drive wedge after wedge (male/female, rich/poor, gay/straight, prolife/prochoice, race/race & nationality/nationality) until we, as a nation, are so divided that we simply cannot stand.\n\nI could go on and on and on. But to your thinking, I'd say invest, have fun. POTUS is balancing and correcting decades worth of shit that previous administrations either ignored, caused or kicked along down the road.  It's no surprise times could be a little rocky til things settle. But not rocky as in 1/2 the nation on welfare, high unemployment, low GDP etc.\n\nAnd remember that POTUS has kept ALL of his promises. He's still working healthcare and border wall.
