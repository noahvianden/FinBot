{"title": "First Attempt At \"Organized\" Options", "selftext": "So since my RH account became approved for options, I have attempted to use methods (which I have found to previously work with a high degree of success to buy stocks) to predict the direction of a stock. However, the biggest hole in this strategy is I can never predict a good PT or essentially strike when trading options. After imploding my account with options, I figured it was time to figure out how things actually worked. A few quick searches introduced me to the concept of a straddle. I was wondering how you can calculate the break even of a straddle. Essentially, as what share price on the call or put is my initial investment recovered? Currently I am considering $BAC 4/6 29.5 put/ call options. At the time of posting .95/put .65/call. If anyone could walk me through this calculation I would really appreciate it.
