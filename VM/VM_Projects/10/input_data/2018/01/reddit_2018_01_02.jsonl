{"title": "Thoughts on possible Amazon acquisition of Target?", "selftext": "Hey guys, I’ve been reading some news articles about talks of Amazon acquiring some, if not all, of Target because they like their retail setup and believe target could be a good partner for their retail ventures.\n\nWhat do you guys think this will do for the value of Target? They’re already up ~3.5% on the day but that’s just anticipation. Also, when they acquired Whole Foods, they did a total buyout and purchased all of the shares back from owners. Do you guys think this total buyout a possibility if this acquisition comes to fruition?\n\nNote: I’m not investing in anything, I’m an economics major who’s just interested in how the market works.", "id": "7nocup", "created_utc": 1514918514.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Amazon isn't going to buy Target.

They need an overhaul of their design for products that you search for but don't really know exactly what product you will buy.  Shoes for example are a terrible product to buy unless you know the exact brand name.  Even then if you search on their store, it doesn't save the shoe size and if you click a different color, the shoe size doesn't save.  That is where Amazon kind of fails in my opinion and why I actually prefer target over shopping online because I am more of an impulsive buyer and want to be able to use the product right away instead of a week.   I don't think they need to but I think Amazon needs to build an online model that is more compelling of an experience than going to the store.  Think Tinder but with different groups of grocery items that you swipe right to move on and put in your checkout or left if you don't want them know but maybe later.  Then at checkout you take the items that the person took a while on and place them in an are you sure you don't want this ad.  It is easy.\n\nI feel like Amazon is growing too fast and overextending itself through acquisitions that they shouldn't really need to do.
