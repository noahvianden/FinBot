Here's a brief review of the week.\n\n$AVGO massive bearish break out to down side below key support levels.  In hindsight, the descending triangle pattern (lower highs and lack of higher lows) really tells the story.   \n$TXMD attempted breakout, but unable to cross key level in 6.54 range.  \n$HEI Absolutely gorgeous breakout to new 52 week high and still going.   Unfortunately, options turned out to be very illiquid, so trade was never entered.  \n$AIMT No signficant action.  Good candidate for next week.  \n$CARO Flirting right at resistance.  High probability breakout next week.  Unfortunately realized its not optionable!?  \n$VHI Also flirting with breakout, volatility really tightening.  Its coiled and ready to pop next week.  But also not optionable.. Just watching for educational purposes.  \n  \nI'll provide some more insights into my scan methodology with next weeks picks.  \n  \nIn the mean time, one of my favorites from 2 weeks back. $PFE decided to explode on Friday ahead of earnings.

SEC makes a pretty important exception in their definition of a day trade:\n\nIf a position is opened and held overnight, and then closed on a following day *prior to the opening/addition of the same position later in the day*, then no day trade has occurred.\n\nIE:  You buy calls on a Monday and hold them until Tuesday.  On Tuesday morning you sell those calls, but on Tuesday afternoon you buy those calls back.  0 day trades.  You could do this with stocks and it still wouldn't be a day trade.\n\nIf you bought 1 share of something on Monday, then bought 1 more share on Tuesday morning, then sold the 1 Monday share Tuesday afternoon, that's be a day trade because the sale wasn't before the purchase, even though the share sold wasn't the share bought that same day.\n\nBut yeah, what you're talking about is not at all a day trade.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I do this like everyday haha ", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just don't open and close a trade on the same day..\n\nYou can however buy or \"open\" options of different strikes and expirations..\n\nI like the way it was told to me, if you are in the day trade restriction, just don't ever do a \"round-trip\" trade in 1 day with the same stock ticker..\n\nRound-trip means open and close any position you have..", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is buying SPX on expire day, and letting it expire, a day trade?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "No. But you should go all in for MU calls.
