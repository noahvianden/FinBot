The new platform is aiming to take on giants like Alphabet‚Äôs (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and could mark the start of a new era in blockchain based media, if successful.  Simplifying video monetization and management.  The company has built a digital platform which will offer media companies, content creators and advertisers the applications they need to monetize, manage and analyze their videos. In a statement, AlphaNetworks Founder and CEO Seth Shapiro said that the media industry is currently at a turning point. He noted that an average household is paying for 206 channels but only watches 15 of them.  He raised concerns about the rise of channels for ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. According to Shapiro, TV is no longer the trusted source of news like it was 40 years ago. He adds that there are many great content creators and influencers online but they are yet to make a living from their work. Shapiro said that the new platform will ensure that content creators benefit from their work.

You don‚Äôt see the CEO of Anheuser-Busch saying ‚Äúoh hey world a future without alcohol can be a reality‚Äù because number one we‚Äôve been there tried that and it didn‚Äôt work, and number two it‚Äôs just not realistic, a person can be alcohol free, but trying to impose that on billions of people at once isn‚Äôt realistic, and the same goes for cigarettes. \n\nComing out with the IQOS as a smokeless tobacco product is a nice thought, but if someone who has been smoking cigarettes for 10 years and has no interest in quitting do you really think they‚Äôre going to be going out and buying an IQOS? Probably not because despite the reality of how bad smoking is for people, some don‚Äôt care and are content with their leisure activity, which they have the right to do, and PM should be seeking ways to keep that in place for their loyal customers and find ways to work with the FDA to make that happen in the most ethical way possible. PM needs to embrace itself for what it really is, and not the exact opposite, having the IQOS as another product is smart, but to come out and say it‚Äôs the future altogether is just dumb. The saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be something you‚Äôre not‚Äù very much applies to PM right now. \n\n The IQOS looks just like the vape pens I used to buy in DC when I used to smoke pot, smokeless marijuana. And that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll get to my final reason, marijuana. Why in the world  has PM not been pleading with the government to legalize marijuana? Personally I think it‚Äôs just as unhealthy for people as cigarettes and alcohol, and is a literal cash cow like the other two, so why aren‚Äôt we seeing any momentum with this here? \n\nYou would think that by 2018 where casually smoking a preroll or pot vaping in downtown DC is as common as it was back in the 40‚Äôs where people were casually smoking cigarettes over a cup of coffee in their offices chatting away. You‚Äôd think one of the worlds largest Tobacco companies that has had a consistent 5 year low would be banging on the governments door doing whatever they could to move the process along so they could start mass producing a product that consumers really want, marijuana and the smokeless marijuana alternatives vape pens sold as singles in tubes, idk realistically all that IQOS and the vape pens and all that stuff is pretty bad for the environment, so that would probably be the next battle/lawsuit, but regardless of that, where is the innovation PM? Ambition is not the same as innovation and I think that‚Äôs what it really comes down to, as ambitious as PM makes itself out to be the company takes little to no steps towards the right kind of innovation it needs to keep itself going, it needs a mix of younger people to help the board to see what the right kind of innovation is before it‚Äôs already happened, it needs to quit suing countries over regulation laws and discontinue selling their products in those countries and put those resources used for legal fees and the job cuts that would come with the discontinuation of those products sold in those countries and put that money toward 1. Merging back with Altria 2. Fighting for the legalization of marijuana, the right to produce it and the right to acquire pot businesses already established within the US. \n\nPeople aren‚Äôt buying PM because it has not been showing itself to be innovative company and that‚Äôs what younger investors want. They want innovation and they want to see change, and until PM puts its big boy pants on and gets to work, it‚Äôs going to keep getting worse.
