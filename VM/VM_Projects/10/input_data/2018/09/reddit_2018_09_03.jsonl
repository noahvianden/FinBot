Markets are closed.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hi, I am a noob when it comes to options, considering I never really looked into them, but I understand the basic concepts. However, today I found a call option for Amazon expiring in december with a strike of $960. The purchase price is around 90 euros. So, if my understanding is correct, if I pay these 90 euros today, I will be able to buy an AMZN share for $960 in december, right? My question is, how is this not free money? There is basically zero chance that AMZN drops by more than 50% by december, on the contrary, I believe it will go up. So why is this call option so cheap? And why would I not dump a shitload of money into this? This seems like extremely high reward for relatively low risk.\n\nAnd couldn't I simply buy the option, exercise it immediately and have almost 100% immediate profit? I am either missing something or this is a mistake, right?\n\nThank you for any insight.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Your broker is showing you the bid is 90, but you won't actually be able to purchase it at 90 (or in other words, no one will sell it for 90) because the option is worth around 1052 + premium (current amzn price 2012 - 960 = 1052 + the option premium).\n\nDue to varying data feeds by brokers, they might display 90 as the last bid price, but the last bid was much much higher.\n\nAgain even if the broker says it's 90, if you put in a buy limit at 90, it won't trigger until you increase the limit price to over 1052 or amzn falls 96% (which ain't gonna happen).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Call options are actually 100 shares. So it gives you the option to buy 100 shares of amazon at $960 each by the expiry date. So if the stock price goes above $960 by X amount, the money you make is (X-960-premium)*100. It’s not free money because the shares could go down which renders the call worthless. The risk of it (among other things) is that there’s a time limit so you’re basically betting that a stock is going to go up (calls) or go down (puts) above/below the strike point (in this case $960) before the expiry date. \n\nMore knowledgeable people should check my math cause I’m still shaky on options", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I've been reading more about buying Calls lately, and I have a potentially stupid question.\n\nIf I buy a call option and as it comes up on the expiration date, I can simply allow it to expire without paying for the shares, correct?\n\nIt's my understanding that I can essentially use calls to hedge my bets for simply the low price of the premium, instead of tying up my capital in the shares, and if my hunch doesn't play out I can let the call expire and all I have lost is the premium. I'd like to ensure I am understanding this correctly. \n\nThanks for your time. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.
