{"title": "Option Trading Advice for Tesla", "selftext": "Hello Everyone, before I get downvoted for asking possibly simple questions regarding options, I want to make it clear that I am very new to trading options. I have been trading stocks for several years now but I have avoided options. \n\nI would like to know what some of you think about placing a put option for a struck price of around $265 (Tesla is currently trading for about $270 after hours) tomorrow for Tesla as with everything going on I expect their share price to drop. I would want to place an order for a 1 day contract and sell before the contract expires.  I fully expect the put ask prices to skyrocket by tomorrow morning due to the response of the market to Elon Musk being sued after hours.\n\nI am wondering if it’s a complete dumb idea to purchase the put contract as since there was already a drop of 13% after hours, is there much room for it to drop further? Would this even be profitable even and worth the risk? I know it is impossible to predict these things for certain I’m just looking for input.\n\nThank you everyone for the help, and as I said i am a beginner when it comes to options (and reddit in general) so any advice is greatly appreciated.
