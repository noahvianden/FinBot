I'll let you know right now that high-return, low-risk trades are almost non-existent. I can be very sure that without some really crazy news, the first three options will expire worthless and likely never be worth more in the coming week than they were when you bought them (time decay is going to gnaw away at those premiums each and every day). Sure, you didn't put in a lot, but you're also making it very difficult for yourself to win. It's like your're playing roulette by putting a few dollars on some random number hoping you'll get really lucky...\n\nSo, what should you be doing instead? Well, you have at least two much better options (no pun intended):\n\n1. Just buy the stock. I know it sounds boring when you have the whole world of options available, but if you're not going to be willing to choose options that have a good shot at being in the money, buying the stock is much wiser. You won't have time decay working against you, and you don't have to feel like you're going to the casino with way-OTM weeklies.\n\n2. Maybe more appealing would be to buy/sell bullish spreads. There's still the possibility for good short-term return (which I think is what you're after), and you can have time decay working for you.
