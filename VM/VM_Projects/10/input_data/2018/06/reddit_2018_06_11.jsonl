{"title": "Home Depot (HD) - Bullish Options Action Trade for June 11th, 2018 | OptionsPlay", "selftext": "On Friday's Options Action, the crew analyzed the performance of the homebuilder's sector. After selling off substantially since Jan, this sector has started to turn bullish again just this week. Looking for a bounce higher, HD is the large\\-cap name in this sector that would attract institutional investors. Coupled with cheap fundamental valuations and bounce off a bullish trendline, HD has upside to run. Expecting HD to trade higher, Michael Khouw suggests buying a July 200 Call for a $3.25 Debit. As of Friday's close, this option is trading at $3.60.\n\nWe've structured this trade in OptionsPlay so you can analyze and view this trade along with the supporting technical chart at your convenience.
