I've noticed that the various indicators (MACD and now RSI) all behave differently at different volatility levels as measured by the VIX.\n\nMost of these indicators have a pretty positive correlation to 7-9 trading date out. So looking at November 27th Expiration and choosing 2.5% below current Market price.\n\nSPX =3115 - 2.5% = 3035\n\nThe statistical probability that that will be breached is 13.25%. Historically that trade has lost 12.5% of the time, so pricing and history are really close right now.\n\nRSI between 70-80 -- If I put this filter on the 6673 daily close prices that I have, The historical loss rate drops to 4.7%. Rather than RSI > 70 being a bearish signal, historically over 8 trading days, this trade wins significantly more often than when the RSI is lower. There are 450 data points that fit this condition so a very large sample size which give a 1.95% margin of error with 95% confidence.\n\nWhen I filter the results against low VIX (lets say less than 13.5) my sample size drops to 227, which is still a good large sample size for the results...now this trade has only lost once...or 0.4% of the time.\n\nTwo simple filters that take us from a 12.5%-13.3% loss rate to a loss rate that is more than 10x smaller.\n\nSeems like now is a great time to sell premium on the SPX...your thoughts?", "id": "dwtwfp", "created_utc": 1573838585.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Yes.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "No.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Side walk", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "After reading a couple of books on technical analysis, and looking at charts with technical signals, seeing what happens after the signals historically, I decided technical signals ain't worth much.
