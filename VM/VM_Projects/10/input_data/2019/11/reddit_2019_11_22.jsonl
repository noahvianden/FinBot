However PayPal should be able toquickly  leverage its own platform with 300 million users to significantly increase Honey’s user numbers (currently 17 million) and revenue.\n\nIn return Honey should help engage PayPal at an earlier stage of the sales funnel , develop a deeper relationship with consumers and increase usage (90% of Honey users are active every month).\n\nAdditionally, the acquisition will bring valuable data insights into online shopping behavior allowing PayPal to reach deeper into online shopping and offer a wider range of services and solutions to consumers and merchants. \n\nPayPal’s stock is down 1.5% but it looks like a good way for the $120 billion company to use part of its $11 billion pile of cash.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.
