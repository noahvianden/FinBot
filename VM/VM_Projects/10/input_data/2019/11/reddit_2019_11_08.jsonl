Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia Tuturiol](https://www.investopedia.com/university/all/fundamental-analysis/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "dtcbop", "created_utc": 1573200456.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Your Weekly /r/stocks Recap\n\n\n\n**Friday, November 01 - Thursday, November 07**\n\nTop 5 Posts | score | link to comments |\n--|--|--\nGoogle to acquire Fitbit, valuing the smartwatch maker at about $2.1 billion | 565  | [147 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dq4xdj/google_to_acquire_fitbit_valuing_the_smartwatch/)\nUber CEO: ‘We are very, very, very different from WeWork’ | 438  | [146 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dsjxxt/uber_ceo_we_are_very_very_very_different_from/)\nSome interesting news in the stock market this week | 403  | [31 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dqindj/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/)\nHow would you feel about a subreddit for european stocks similar to /r/stocks? | 386  | [75 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ds0awc/how_would_you_feel_about_a_subreddit_for_european/)\nBoeing’s bad week in Washington: US lawmakers push CEO to resign, but investors wait for 737 Max approval | 335  | [41 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dr4jsd/boeings_bad_week_in_washington_us_lawmakers_push/)\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4 Most Commented | score | link to comments |\n--|--|--\nWhen do you personally feel it’s time to take profits and run? | 303  | [215 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dsylmq/when_do_you_personally_feel_its_time_to_take/)\nHow much would Uber stock price have to fall before you would consider buying? | 178  | [165 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dsfknu/how_much_would_uber_stock_price_have_to_fall/)\nAm I the only that feels everything is overpriced and building cash? | 63  | [134 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ds8fxj/am_i_the_only_that_feels_everything_is_overpriced/)\nWhat stock would you buy today and hold for 30 years? | 24  | [126 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dqdam7/what_stock_would_you_buy_today_and_hold_for_30/)\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/stocks.

It's especially interesting that bears are always talking about Tesla's margins, yet often claim that the lower range of Tesla's competitors doesn't matter.  That range difference has an incredible effect on margins for all EV makers, considering the battery is still the most expensive part of an EV.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "It is a really important point, many analyst were critical of Tesla when they moved from selling luxury high end Model S/X to more affordable Model 3's. They probably wanted Tesla to stay in that high margin market since automotive has always had terrible margins, Tesla decision to move from the high margin luxury market to low margin cars just made no sense to them. \n\nThe thing is, with ICE cars all manufacturers pretty much manufacturer them for the same cost and nobody really has a huge price edge in manufacturing, lower priced cars just means lower quality. EVs is a new technology and there's a lot of technological advantages you can use to sell a better car for a lower price. If Tesla needs 20% less batteries per car (battery is around $8k per $40k car) then that's 4% margin right there. If other companies are paying $130/kWh for their battery packs and Tesla makes their own for $100/kWh, that's another 4% margins. With just those two factors, if other manufacturers would be selling EVs at 0% margins, then Tesla could make a car with the exact same specs and quality and still make 8% margins. \n\nThis is how you can make a ton of money selling affordable cars to the mass market.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": " I don't understand where the 24 kWh / 100 miles comes from.
