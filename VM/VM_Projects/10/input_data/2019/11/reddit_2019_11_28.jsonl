In this case it would make sense for them to install a MegaPack and reduce the demand charge to a fraction - it would bring back the cost of the MegaPack quickly.\n\nA additional advantage would be some resilience during power outages: a ~3 MW MegaPack has enough power to recharge ~120 Model 3 SR+'s from 40% to 90% during a power outage.\n\nFinally, doing this would also allow them to install solar panels and trickle-charge the MegaPack all day, basically for free.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Nice, our Xmas trip to LA was a bit of a hassle.

{"title": "How to Explain TSLA to normies at Thanksgiving", "selftext": "I'm so happy that you have came. There are so many things I want to tell you. We are getting together, we are sharing our lives. You're a part of our family. There is something out there. That I don't want to talk about. I don't want to talk about that today, maybe another time. \n\nyou are here. I am excited to tell you how I made myself. I made myself with this thing called an option. Not like those options. More like two or four options depending on which options you want. You can sell options or you can buy options. They're kinda like turkey's. Remember that time we caught a wild turkey and then I shot it while you sat on it like a horse? Yeah me too, I am so glad you could make it. Well anyway the options are like that turkey. You can either buy your own turkey or catch a few of them and sell it for some pocket money. Well I sure pocketed a whole lot of money with options.\n\nI really like buying calls. They are the best and they can be really cheap, anyway I want to tell you that TSLA is going to be the greatest company and will eventually be as domininant in the tech industry as Apple or Microsoft, but for hardware. Specifically their batteries. Have you heard about the batteries Elon has been working on, yeah the cars are just a front for the batteries. Like to display their power and stuff. You, know like a full tank of gas goes about 300-400 miles well elon's batteries can do the same thing without an engine, yeah it's pretty cool.\n\nBasically I just trusted elon, and he said that was going to take Tesla private and I was like \"what\", just like when you started to drag the turkey toward our campsite. Like I was really surprised, I thought you just wanted some fun and not any food, but anyways. I got really excited because I had just written some naked calls for the Septmember, a month after the announcement. I had basically just hit the jackpot. Like when we were going home and I saw a couple of wild turkeys on the side of the road and we hadn't hit our bag limit yet. Well enough said, I sold those calls and took them all the way to the bank.
