I always check the \"price\" of the option with an option pricing model to see if the puts are expensive relative to symmetric calls (which you can also do without an options pricing model). When puts are expensive, even though you have to buy a put as part of the strategy, this is nonetheless an advantage.\n\n3.

I do this only for stocks that appear to be strongly trending up that are nonetheless being hedged heavily with puts. I (we) have models that look for these stocks. However, TSLA has been strongly trending up since September and our model has a horizon of about that length, BUT, this is a couple of trading days away from the beginning of the new year, and THAT has the potential to wildly volatile (we are setting up index strangles).\n\nBut I am not going to try to talk you out of it.

The real risk is controlled by your choice of delta for the hedge ... the lower the delta the greater the credit (net initial cash) but obviously the less the protection and the greater the maximum loss.\n\nWe use our differential equation model that looks a little different than BSM, all values set to daily rather than annual (like daily volatility, daily log growth rates), sometimes adjusted with a Poisson distribution (to model 4-sigma etc. possibilities), solved brute force for implied volatility and sensitivity analysis for discrete Greeks other than IV.\n\nBut you don't need a fancy model. Inverted BSM (to solve for IV) and the Greek formulas to solve for the deltas and gammas are just fine AND you don't really need that.

Advice in the second post is clearly think about what you are doing and research because it is no where near as simple as you think it is. The advice here will be- you clearly do not grasp what you are talking about and need A LOT MORE KNOWLEDGE before doing anything like this. \n\n>  You're speculating that these companies are out there to make things complex and that playing with other people's money isn't free.\n\nYou said yourself they are charging you a margin fee. \"$14.41 daily rate and a weekend rate of $43.23\". Which equals roughly 6k. This is a fee for using their money. This fee is one way they make money and will only be coming out of your 13k. You are paying them 50% in a fee. This is large. This is horrible. This is a bad idea. In most cases this will kill an account. \n\n\nIt is complex because with this leverage you are playing in an area you do not understand. You are now playing with CFDs and derivatives. See https://www.etoro.com/trading/market-hours-fees/?category=stocks  which have even more fees!!!!\n\n> I'm sure the only reason they allow you to trade with their capital is in hopes that you succeed, if the stock goes up and I cash out, I make money and they make money.\n\nNo. They make money from the fees. Those are massive fees. They hope you succeed because you will pay more fees. \n\n> I don't see how they'd make things complex or try to make ways to eat into your capital as you more than likely wouldn't trade again making them lose potential money that you would have traded in future had it been not advertised as the fees they've stated for X5 leverage.\n\nSee the website I just posted. \n\nYou have 50% fee for the leverage. THEN you have a 6.4% for buying. A 2.9 for selling. \n\nUnless you are INCREDIBLY lucky,these fees will kill you overtime. It will not be fast, but you will slowly bleed to death.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "It's practically impossible to perfectly time the market, a stock may raise more than 1% from the lowest of the week every single week, but more often than not you buy in early or late and may only get 0.5 on that week, but you aim for 1%, so it doesn't hit the 1% you keep holding, but on the following week you might hit stop loss before it goes back up. With leverage you are much more vulnerable to sudden random drops in price, or bad news. You will probably end up losing money because of spread and fees, I think you need about 7-8 good weeks (you hit your 1%) to compensate a bad week (when you hit stop loss of 5%).
