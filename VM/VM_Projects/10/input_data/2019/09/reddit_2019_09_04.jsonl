I usually make these plays on SPX, but decided to use NDX this time to save on comissions. That said, the nasdaq is quite a bit more volatile so I'll be more willing to close this position early.\n\n###Intended exit method\n\nEvaluate index movement following release of beige book from Fed. Ideally like to close this for $700 or less.\n\n###What I will do if the trade is challenged?\n\nBuy/Sell a couple contracts of /NQ. Will consider adding some debit spreads to offset risk. Feels like risk is only to the upside ATM.\n\n\n###Outcomes\n\n7600-7625 put spread x4 opened for $3.74 credit @9:08 AM\n\n7740-7720 call spread x5 opened for $2.41 credit @9:11 AM\n\n-7610+7630-7650 long put butterfly spread x5 opened for $1.05 credit @11:30 AM\n\n7675 long puts x2 opened for $0.25 debit at 2:35 PM\n\n7710-7720 long call spread x7 opened for $8.50 debit @2:40 PM\n\nEverything but my 7710 calls expired worthless. \n\n**Total Comissions Paid**: $71.21 (will have a $5 assignment fee tomorrow morning)\n\n**Total Profit**: $3714 (64.4% ROI)\n\n#[Final Position](https://imgur.com/a/71O6qVp)", "id": "czmjhv", "created_utc": 1567611624.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Have you looked at bid/ask spread on NDX?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It has a notional value of 770k, what do you expect?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "How do you decide what new positions to open as the underlying moves through the day?
