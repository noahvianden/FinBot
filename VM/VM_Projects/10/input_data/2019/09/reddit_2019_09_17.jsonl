Which means you'll need to have the cash to purchase 100 shares of MSFT sitting in your account for whatever strike option you choose ($13,500 for the $135 strike put).  \n  \nOne way to make this move without having uncapped risk is to simultaneously buy a Put that is further out of the money, so for example, if you are trying to sell the $135 put you could buy the $130 put with the same expiration. You are still receiving a net credit, albeit less of a credit, but now your risk is capped.   If this trade goes against you, you own the long option to cover you. Say MSFT goes to zero and you get early assignment (forced to exercise). You now have the $130 put to cover yourself, by exercising it or simply selling it for the option premium (which would actually be the correct choice most of the time due to the time value it still has).\n  \nThis is referred to as a **Vertical Credit Put Spread**. To do this in ToS, you can right click on the $135 put, select \"Sell\", then \"Vertical\".  \n  \nIt looks like you have the right idea though- take everyone's advice and learn everything inside and out before putting real money down.

{"title": "Options market 9-17-19", "selftext": "U.S. stocks are modestly lower, with the global markets likely cautious ahead of tomorrow's Fed monetary policy decision, while digesting stronger-than-expected reads on industrial production and homebuilder sentiment. Geopolitical concerns continue to linger after the weekend's attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Crude oil prices are giving back some of yesterday's surge amid reports that Saudi Arabian output may be restored to normal sooner than expected. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar are dipping, while gold is rising. Kraft Heinz is seeing pressure after private equity firm 3G Capital Partners disclosed that it has pared its holding of the company. Asia finished mixed and Europe is diverging.  \n\nAt 10:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%, the S&P 500 Index is little changed, and the NASDAQ Composite is dipping 0.1%. WTI crude oil is falling $3.90 to $59.00 per barrel and Brent crude oil is dropping $4.48 at $64.54 per barrel, and wholesale gasoline is decreasing $0.09 at $1.66 per gallon. The Bloomberg gold spot price is $2.82 higher at $1,501.21 per ounce, and the Dollar Index—a comparison of the U.S. dollar to six major world currencies—is dipping 0.1% to 98.49. Natural Gas prices have traded in a range of $2.63-2.71 and were last seen trading lower by $0.024 (or - 0.90%) to $2.657/MMBtu.\n\nSource: Schwab Center for Financial Research\n\nToday’s Bullish Activity\n\nMoving higher this morning is Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. (CBRL + $5.21 to $170.05) after the country restaurant and gift shop reported fiscal Q4 earnings of $2.70 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.21 beat) on revenue that fell 2.9% year-over-year to $787.1M (above the $781.9M expected) as comparable store restaurant sales growth was 3.8% and traffic growth was 0.2% (both year-over-year). The company issued upside guidance as full-year 2020 adjusted EPS is expected to come in a range of $9.30-9.45 on revenue of $3.15-3.20B (vs. the respective $9.29 and $3.15B consensus estimates) with comparable store restaurant growth expected to be 2.0-3.0% and comparable store retail sales growth expected to be approximately 1.0%. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the September 20th 172.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 726).  \n\nAlso trading to the upside is KLA Corporation (KLAC + $6.81 to $154.00) after the semiconductor equipment maker reaffirmed Q1 guidance, increased the quarterly dividend and increased its share repurchase authorization ahead of its investor day presentation later today. The company reaffirmed Q1 EPS of $2.04-2.34 on revenue of $1.31-1.39B (vs. the $2.20 and $1.35B consensus estimates), upped the dividend from $0.75 to $0.85 per share and added $1B to its existing share repurchase program, which had $859M remaining as of June 30th, 2019. Puts are outpacing calls roughly 4:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the October 18th 120.00 put (volume is 1,240) and 125.00 put (volume is 1,240).\n\nLastly, a couple of stocks are moving higher following bullish analyst moves:\n\nSnap Inc. (SNAP + $0.45 to $16.21): Susquehanna upgraded the social media company to “Neutral” from “Negative” and hiked their price target to $18.00 from $12.00, citing positive ad trends; calls are outpacing puts roughly 7:1 with the September 20th 16.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 26,212). \nSplunk Inc. (SPLK + $2.92 to $117.75): JP Morgan upgraded the cloud analytics company to “Overweight” from “Neutral” and put a $130.00 price target on the stock, citing the company’s transition to the renewable model and favorable second half bookings; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:1 with the September 20th 119.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,458). \n \n\nNew 52-week highs (26 new highs today): Cypress Semiconductor Inc. (CY + $0.02 to $23.38), Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS + $5.37 to $329.67), Prologis Inc. (PLD + $1.22 to $86.44), Tribune Media Corp. (TRCO + $0.02 to $46.67)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome unusual call activity (~5:1 over puts) is being seen in Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS - $0.90 to $57.97) which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 2020 60.00 call. Volume on this contract is 15,436 (vs. open interest of 1,830) which mostly consisted of a 13K block that was bought for $3.20 when the bid/ask spread was $2.99 x $3.25. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.\n\nAlso seeing some heavy call activity (~16:1) is Zuora Inc. (ZUO + $0.36 to $15.67) as option traders primarily target the January 2020 16.00 call. Volume on this contract is 4,786 (vs. open interest of 251) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for $1.80, which suggests bullish intent.\n\nToday’s Bearish Activity \n\nShares of Corning Inc. (GLW - $2.17 to $27.88) are gapping down after the display glass maker reduced its 2019 outlook in two of its business segments earlier this morning. Corning said it now expects optical communications to decline 3-5% for the year (vs. a prior forecast of “low-to-mid-single digit percentage increase”) and within display technologies, Q3 prices are expected to be sequentially flat and full-year glass prices to decline by a “low-to-mid single-digit percentage” (vs. analysts expectation for a 2.1% increase). Today’s ~7% drop puts the stock below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $29.88. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 4:3 with the November 15th 24.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 4,995).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC - $1.20 to $28.42) following news that the company’s second largest shareholder, Brazilian equity firm 3G Capital, sold 25.07M shares for $28.44/share. Sources also reported that Credit Suisse purchased the shares from 3G and is re-offering for $28.60/share. Shares of KHC moved above the 50-day SMA last week but today’s ~4% drop puts the stock back below that moving average, which is currently $28.70. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the September 20th 28.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,573).   \n\nLastly, e-commerce platform Shopify Inc. (SHOP - $7.18 to $330.75) is gapping down after the company priced 1.9M of a Class A subordinate voting shares at $317.50 per share. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the September 27th 335.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 1,426).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (8 new lows today): Altria Group Inc. (MO + $0.29 to $41.70), Bloom Energy Corp. (BE - $0.76 to $3.43), Myovant Sciences Ltd. (MYOV + $0.18 to $6.15)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~150:1 over calls) is being seen in the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT - $1.03 to $192.51) which is primarily being driven by some block activity on the October 18th expiration:\n\n191.00 put – a 2,500 block traded for $4.05, directly in the middle of the $3.90 x $4.20 bid/ask spread (open interest is 73)\n184.00 put – a 2,500 block was sold at the bid price of $2.00 (open interest is 2)\nWe know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a $7.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $2.05 (x 2,500 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions), which suggests that the block trader believes that IYT will close below the break-even price of $188.95 at expiration.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\nVanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ + $0.67 to $93.11): The top two most actively traded contracts across the board are coming from this ETF this morning:\n\nMarch 2020 88.00 put (volume is 60,104 vs. open interest of 44): a 58.95K block was sold for $2.33 when the bid/ask spread was $2.25 x $2.45\nMarch 2020 82.00 put (volume is 120,109 vs. open interest of 20): two 58.95K blocks were simultaneously bought at the same time at an average price of $1.245 (one for $1.24 and the other for $1.25) when the bid/ask spread was $1.15 x $1.30\nWe know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a put back spread was established for a net debit of $0.16 (x 59.85K contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions). This ratio spread has a break-even price of $75.84 (82.00 strike minus the strike price width + net debit) and begins to increasingly make a profit the more VNQ drops below $75.84 (suggesting bearish intent).   \n\niShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG + $0.07 to $27.29): Today’s option volume is 11,145 (vs. average daily option volume of 1,128) which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 2020 25.00 put. Volume on this contract is 10,002 (vs. open interest of 915) which nearly entirely consisted of an 8K block that traded for $0.40 (directly in the middle of the $0.35 x $0.45 bid/ask spread) and (nearly at the same time) a 2K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.45 (suggesting bearish intent).\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 0.18 to 14.85) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 14.57-15.03) as equity markets are lower around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 58, SPX - 2, COMPX - 2). VIX option volume has been heavy today at 552,671 contracts (#3 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been definitively call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.22). The most actively traded contract is the September 18th 18.00 call as volume is 63,618 versus open interest of 143,571.", "id": "d5ltow", "created_utc": 1568748222.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Fuck yeah, this dd makes my pp hard", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "couldn't have said it any better", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I don't come here to read entire books.
