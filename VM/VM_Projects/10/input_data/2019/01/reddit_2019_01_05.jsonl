You got that right.\n\nNow, you gotta check on the probabilities of those outcomes. As you'll see, it's much more likely that a long option trade will lose money. You'll typically lose a bit multiple times, and the few times you'll win, you'll win big.\n\nThe \"insurance analogy\" is probably helpful here. When you buy an option, it's similar to when you buy an insurance policy. You pay a bit now, a bit tomorrow, a bit the day after. In case of the \"insured event\" happens, you get a big payout. In the case of options, the \"insured event\" is a big move of the underlying instrument up (if you buy a call) or down (if you buy a put).\n\nThe amount you \"pay a bit now, a bit tomorrow, a bit the day after\", in the options world, is known the \"theta\", or \"premium decay\". Options lose value the closer you get to expiration.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I get the premium for buying options, but I dont get theta/premium decay.\n\nSo if I buy a $320 TSLA call that expires 1/11. Contract price is $7.75 so it would cost $775.\n\nIf I am understanding this correctly, if the price goes over $327.75 anytime before 1/11, I exercise the option and collect profit. If the stock price never gets to $327.75, the option expires and I lose my $775.\n\nWhere does premium decay factor in?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "There are some holes here that may need to be filled in, or you glossed over them on purpose. I'm going to assume you don't understand, so please don't take offense, it's for the completeness of the answer, not calling your intelligence into question.\n\nWhen you buy an option that is out of the money (OTM), the complete value of that option is time value. It is what is termed 'Extrinsic Value'. Now assuming you bought time, i.e. your days to expiration is greater than zero then any price movement in your favor (up for a call, down for a put) will garner you a profit. What you are describing, needing to be over $327.75 is AT EXPIRATION. So on the day of expiration you will need to be at that value to break even since your account is debited as soon as you make the trade and you will need INTRINSIC value (This is basically how far the stock price is above (or below for a put) your strike price. Any money outside of that # is extrinsic value or time value)  on expiration day to have any profitability in the option. Here is why:\n\nTheta is is the rate at which your option contract loses its EXTRINSIC value, which in this case is 7.75. There is a curve to represent this decay, and the rate rapidly begins to increase at the 45 DTE point in time. The movement in the stock needs to move MORE than the daily theta decay to see a profit on a given day, and more than what you paid for the option by expiration to see an overall profit on the trade, at expiration. \n\nAlso another point to make, you don't need to exercise the contract to receive your profit, you can (and should) just sell the contract to close (Sell to Close order) at any point when your profit target is reached. This will save you in commission fees since exercise/assignment fees are pretty large and can eat up a lot of your profit margin.\n\nI'm on night shift and I've been up for 14 hours, I proofread that a few times but if I missed anything, something doesn't make sense, or you have more questions feel free to let me know!

I'm actually bearish on Netflix as Disney will be more of a player than most people think. But let's carry on.\n\n*First three are not trade war stock still they are not fully immune.*\n\n???\n\nRegardless of what happens, in a trade war, pretty much all stocks suffer. A trade war affects raw materials and labor. It's a ripple effect all around. I'm not disagreeing with your statement. I just feel it has no weight. Trade wars benefit no one.

If meeting goes good (less chance) buy long call DTE march 1 for amazon and Netflix. If meeting goes bad buy more apple put Feb 15 DTE*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWon't comment on the idea itself but I think your dates are a bit incorrect. First off, Apple has its earnings report on February 7th, 2019. So you're gambling on the fact that Apple will report a terrible quarter and will continue to drop past February 15th. Apple has already announced that their numbers are taking a hit so investors have the expectation that the stock will drop.  The negativity is already priced in. So with a 'put' on the dates you've listed, you're expecting an even larger drop but even with all of the issues facing Apple, it won't go as low as you think. You're discounting the Cook-effect, where when the window opens, Apple buys back its shares. And Buffett \\*will\\* buy more when he sees a nice price. Also if there is even a semblance of surprise with the sales of the Iphone, the stock will move upwards. I'm not disagreeing that Apple's stock still has room to drop but I'm disagreeing with you on your puts on those dates, especially after an earnings report. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Other Important points: Border wall shutdown: No solution within next week.

I'm not a Trump supporter but even I can state that Trump knows that it isn't the best interest of his term or the structure of the economy to continue with the trade war. His strategy is he hopes to negotiate with China, to get something better than our current terms with China, and until he gets what he wants, he'll continue the trade war. But one of two things will happen.  First, a deal actually happens. And should that happen, the trade war will end. Or second, a point comes in where the trade war ends as all trade wars have ended in the past, the realization that you cannot do this with China. Bush failed with this in 2002 with a steel tarrif. Obama failed as well. For a history lesson on this, you can view this article here:\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)\n\nThe summation?  A trade war doesn't last forever. It either comes to a deal (best case situation) or it comes to a cease-fire where one realizes you really can't f with China.\n\n*Trumps position is weakening and china will exploit that to buy time.*\n\nChina doesn't have time. This is actually why I fully disagree entirely with your statement prior in your belief that the trade war will continue for the entire term of Trump's presidency.\n\n*(+) Feds became dovish (+)*\n\nNot much weight here. They were dovish one day before you posted. So it's just facts prior to what you wrote.\n\n*Within next 3 months general stocks remain same or move up. Don't go down much.*\n\nDisagree here. If we get a negative response in this upcoming meeting with China, this could turn very ugly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Possible things on the table: Trump impeachment: New government will be stable and china trade war will stop.
