The $ return on time for reading a good book that teaches options properly can be very worthwhile.\n\n1) May or may not fit your personality, but a lot of traders find it helpful to step back and evaluate trading around earnings as if a separate trade (whether they are holding a position or not, and whether they plan to close it before earnings or not, it's a useful mental exercise). \n\nBasically *analyze trading and holding that call option between earnings dates on its own terms*...Now imagine closing that position right before earnings, hopefully booking profits, all that cash is back in the account, win! congrats!...Ok now back to work, starting from scratch, a clean slate, thinking of this as a fresh new trade: Look at the available cash balance one has to work with, *analyze a trade to buy that call option right before earnings and hold it through earnings as its own trade*. \n\nWould you buy it? Why? Do you want to buy it *but* only if you can hedge some of the risks?

Hedge it or keep it. Delta and gamma for example. \n\nDo you have an opinion on the options' volatility pricing, whether along the smile or across the calendar? Hedge it or keep it. Vega for example. \n\nAs I'm sure know, your delta is very close to .5. Tomorrow is pretty close to a coin flip for your calls. You cannot protect yourself from any levels of risk without giving something up. You can pay for protection with a certain payment up front and knowing one side will lose (buying puts for example, though IMO if you're going to buy puts, adding a 1/18 300Put sounds fucking retarded, great way to lose everything), another way is writing a spread to alter your upside/downside profiles (btw puts vs short calls aren't as different as people think)\n\nDon't forget, when evaluating the price of hedges, even if you do nothing to hedge a long ATM call option and even if NFLX stays flat tomorrow, you are still expected to lose a not insignificant amount of money because of theta and vega. March 25 2019 does not have another NFLX earnings call before it right? So this is your IV event in the price?
