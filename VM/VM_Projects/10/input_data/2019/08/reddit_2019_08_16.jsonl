If you don't know how much money you spend in 3 or 4 months, it's time to start a budget. There are free programs, you just enter every single transaction you make and see how much you spend every month, including rent, bills, everything.\n\nOnce you have enough **cash** to survive losing your job for 4 months, and you have enough for rent and food and everything, *then* you can start investing. And by cash, I mean in a bank savings account that grows at least 1.5% per year, so it keeps up with inflation.\n\nAt that point, it's still better to invest in a Roth IRA, or something tax-advantaged, than to start buying stocks. Buying stocks is basically gambling, and some people do win. But it's higher risk. Tax-advantaged means you pay taxes right now as you put the money away, because your income is low enough that you're in a low tax bracket. This money is \"gone\" until you need it (in 10 to 30 years from now) when you will hopefully make a lot more per year, and therefore be in a higher tax bracket, but you've already paid the taxes so you don't lose any when you take it out.\n\nOnce you have opened a Roth-IRA or something else similar, then you can pick a stock and buy. Really you shouldn't get into this game until you have enough money that, if the price drops and you lose it all, you still have savings and other investments and you can recover. And if you do buy, plan to not sell for years and years. Buying stocks should not be a short-term income supplement. IF you spend $1,000 on some stock, and it goes up 10% over a good year, then you sell, you'll have earned $100, minus the $10 or whatever it cost to make those two transactions. That's not much gain, you really can't supplement your income with that. These things take time, and it's better to put it into a long-term investment account where you may have 5% growth every year, and you keep putting more in, and it keeps compounding, and when you're 50 years old it'll be way more. Of course you will have to wait that long.\n\n **Most important part here!**\nThe best way to make more money, short term, is your day job. Things like taking a class (a trades class, like welding or electrician) could get you a better job which pays an **extra $20,000 a year, right away**.

Often times things get hard at work and I come home and my wife yells at me and I just go to bed feeling like shit but that's ok because its normal.\n\nMeanwhile me and all the other autists take all your money and manage dope space programs while  snorting blow off strippers.\n\nSerious shit tho its not a disorder, it's an uncommon mindset that has utility.  Some people have it bad but a large reason behind why it gets so bad is people like you who treat it as something that needs to be \"cured\".  My parents hooked me up with quality therapy that helped me learn human emotion rather than caging me up in a shittily funded public program like many parents do.\n\nThe current system is fucked, but for those dealing with autistic children please please please \n\nDont put your kid in a public program send them to school it's important that they live life like a regular kid so that they can eventually integrate to some extent.  Yes they will get bullied I somehow didnt that much but it's the only way they can learn outside professional therapy which most cant afford", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}
