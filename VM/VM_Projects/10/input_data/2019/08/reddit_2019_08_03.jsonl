A few weeks ago I bought cheddar flow which allows me to see big orders. \n\nI‚Äôve been wanting to broaden my trading from just day trading options to doing earnings plays.\n\nSo I‚Äôve noticed at least a 90% success rate with the unusual option activities on companies reporting earnings.\n\nExample...the day before $KO reported earnings a few minutes before market close someone placed a 300k order on weekly calls. $KO beat. Same exact thing happened on $ETSY $COG $TXN $PG $PFE and many more. If I had followed all of these alerts I would have made over 6k. I only followed the ones on $TXN $PG and $ETSY and made about 3k.\n\nWhat I learned: don‚Äôt play reports that have blocks but not sweeps. Sweeps are usually from one person. Also if there‚Äôs a mixture of call and put sweeps, don‚Äôt play it. The stock might go side ways and screw everyone. \n\nAny thoughts?", "id": "clmwuy", "created_utc": 1564861433.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 7, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe, but I am skeptical.
