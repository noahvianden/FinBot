{"title": "Question about the 5 year market increase", "selftext": "I know people say disregard recession, invest now and always. \n\nBut looking at the 5 year track for many stocks it seems difficult for me to get into it now.  For example Nvidia was $20 per share 5 years ago. And its $170 now.  Amazon was a $300/ share and now its $1700/ share.  It's obvious the market has grown exponentially well in the last 5 to 10 years.  Even though I only gave 2 examples a lot of the market seems to be at a premium right now.  \n\nSo should I buy into stocks like apple, google, amazon, microsoft, now while they are at an all time high and expect them to continue growing. Or should I look for stocks that are coming up now and will be higher in the next 5 years.  A lot of people made wealth by buying into these companies but 5 years ago I could have purchased almost 6 shares of amazon for the price of one today.
