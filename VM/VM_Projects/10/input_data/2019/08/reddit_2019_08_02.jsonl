But fuck it. \n\nI called the hourly H&S reversal a couple days ago and here are my price targets:\n\nBest possible scenarios for the bulls: \n\nwe stop right about here on the short term trend line/50 period moving average on the daily and reverse and back to our regular scheduled programing. That would be around a 3% decline from the highs of this week. \n\nMost likely/neutral scenario: \n\nwe mill around a bit at this price level ultimately breaking the short term trend line/relative support around $291.50 - $290.50 and then ultimately my price target would be somewhere around the low of the May dip @ $275ish give or take. But keep in mind that it looks like that would be creating the head of a much larger H&S pattern if we bounce back up from there. The H&S pattern would be negated if we reach back up to the $301 price level, and if that happens my price target is around $304. If this plays out it’s be a 8-9% decline from the highs. \n\nBest case for the bears scenario: \n\nwe break through the major support at $275ish and then my next price target would be around the $250 price range. Keep in mind this is still a relatively bullish analysis as some chartists are calling for a ~30% drop. I’m not sold on this being it though. If we do hit that long term trend line at around $250 and it holds expect us to rip to new highs by EOY. If it breaks, buy gold, run for cover and try not to check your portfolio. If this plays out and trend line holds it’d be about a 15% decline from the highs. \n\nAs i got rekt on AMZN and AMD earnings i’m really just holding onto the seat of my pants with a couple OTM puts and a fat silver play but these are my price targets.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/8eMK77AR/", "id": "cl68ft", "created_utc": 1564762666.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "SPY 325c.
