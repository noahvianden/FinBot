It's been the longest expansion in modern history. As we've seen with other recessions, there's been relatively little regulatory foresight to avert it. This crisis, like others, will happen because too much debt has accumulated somewhere, or multiple places, and people become unable to pay it off. 2008 was mostly housing debt. \n\nRight now, student loan debt and credit card debt and car loan debt are very high. Deliquency rates are rising for car loan debts. Business debt is high. Poorly-rated debt is high. Unprofitable startups and venture capital are involved in a lot of debt. Governments are in a lot of debt. Companies are taking loans and using that money to buy their own stocks. As you can see, lots of debt. \n\n2, China has rerouted much trade through Vietnam and other countries to avoid tariffs. And the prices of other goods have increased. This is straining China's already-strained economy and accelerating its debt problem. \n\nEven if everything was dropped tomorrow, it would take time for trade routes to be re-established. The uncertainty will linger. Farms in the US that have gone bankrupt will probably not be coming back, since many of them have been scooped up by massive farming corps. China's debt won't disappear. \n\n3, governments have been in stimulus mode for years, and the situation isn't improving. The US had a huge tax cut at the beginning of 2018. The Fed is cutting rates now. Other central banks have been easing or trying to stimulate. This is something that should be worrisome. It means when the recession deepens, governments won't have as many tools left to stimulate the economy. \n\nAccording to the data, the coming recession should be less bad than the 2008 recession, but there are factors at play which could unfold into an even more significant crisis in certain scenarios.

Now it's somehow down to 38 after hours today after a market dip of 3%. Unless an IPOs first earnings report smashing expectations has somehow been priced in for a month, which makes no fucking sense, this feels way underpriced for now.\n\nThey don't buy shit from China so they don't have to worry about Trump tweets. And yes, retail is hurting, but it's hurting because people can buy the same shit for the same price or less online without leaving home, and they can't do that with stores like GO - not only because they're grocery and buying groceries on a place like Amazon is like shitting your wallet down a toilet, but they are far cheaper than any other IRL grocery stores and will stay that way. People love getting deals and stretching their dollar, or perhaps put another way, they don't like the thought of pissing money away if they can avoid it by overpaying for shit, and the earnings report proved all that. When I had discovered this place when a new location popped up near me, a few years back, the first time in there I couldn't not look at every single thing in the store awestruck on the pricing. They had 5 lb blocks of white cheddar Velveeta for $8 when 1 lb is like $7-$8 at other places. CHEESE George, CHEEE^(EEESE!)\n\nMacy's on the other hand blows, as their ER proved, because they're trying to sell you $50 shit for $100-$200 when you can easily find it for $50 online. Perhaps great when the wealthy made up 1%, but now it's like 0.1% and the rest of people aren't havin' it. Oh right, you can go to their closeouts and look through racks of random shit for 2 hours and hope to find that $50 online item there for $49.95, I forgot. Plus people in general are shying away from department stores because they could just shop online and have an extra hour of not aimlessly walking around a department store to do things like absolutely nothing with. That's partly why JC's Pennies.\n\nSo GO calls make sense to me. I did this shit with OLLI just yesterday for the same sort of reason after it inexplicably went down 5% the day before, and sold at 49% profit on a pretty modest play (the YOLO play would've been 82.50 calls for 350%+ gain).\n\nMaybe not buy calls for 8/16 unless you feel extra YOLOrific because who tf knows what crazy shit is happening tomorrow and Friday, but 8/23 or further out to give time for investors to get a clue.\n\nDisclaimer: The aforementioned OLLI trade was my first ever, 2nd ever was an APPL put mid-day today expecting the China tariff news yesterday would wash away today on a down market, got away from it with a 3% gain after that didn't happen, and this marks #3 and a strangle on SPY for next Weds as #4 giving this ridic volatility, so we'll see.

NVIDIA guided for Q2 revenue between $2.50 bln and $2.60 bln when it reported Q1 results on May 16. \n\nNVIDIA is one of few chipmakers that have not rebounded from the industry-wide swoon at the end of 2018. The stock bottomed in the 130 area in late December, and it has traded in a sideways range since then. Shares hit a 2019 high (193.47) in April, but they are now closer to their December low than the April peak. The lack of a meaningful rebound from last year's low resulted from an underwhelming launch of RTX video cards. The company overestimated its pricing power, which resulted in disappointing early sales of these cards. Furthermore, competitor AMD (AMD 30.07, -0.17, -0.6%) has continued narrowing the performance gap between itself and NVIDIA. Industry reports suggest that AMD will unveil (likely cheaper) cards to compete with the top end of NVIDIA's lineup later this year. GPU sales make up more than half of NVIDIA's revenue. NVIDIA is clearly feeling the heat of the competition from AMD, considering the company has already updated its RTX lineup from a year ago while industry reports suggest that the company will launch another top-end card in the near future as it seeks to rediscover the demand sweet spot for its products. NVIDIA's decision to continue tinkering with its latest product lineup suggests that gross margin is likely to feel some pressure. The company reduced its inventory in Q1 from a record that was reached in Q4. Additional progress on this front would be encouraging.\n\nNVIDIA trades at 23.9x forward earnings expectations, which represents a discount to AMD's 34.6x forward multiple.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "sir this is a wendys", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ok?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Just sharing info from Merrill Lynch in regards to the earnings report.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}
