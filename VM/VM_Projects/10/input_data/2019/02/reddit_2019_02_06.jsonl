{"title": "Exploring Iron Condors", "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI just started studying iron condors and was exploring an idea that I was hoping to get some feedback on. \n\nThe stock is Electronic Arts (EA). They are getting crushed right now because of earnings and so I thought it'll be awhile until the stock sees any recovery. I'm thinking of setting up an iron condor until April. Here are the details:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStock Ticker: EA (Current Price: $79.34)\n\nStrategy: Iron Condor\n\nSell Call Strike: $90 \n\nBuy Call Strike: $100 \n\nSell Put Strike: $70\n\nBuy Put Strike: $60\n\nImmediate Credit as of posting: \\~$2.34\n\nBreakevens: $67.53, $92.23\n\nMax Loss: \\~$7.68\n\n(I threw this into thinkorswim's analyzer and if I'm reading this correctly it says the strategy has a 89% chance of staying in max profit range? But I'm unsure if my understanding is correct)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my idea was that EA just had a huge \\~13-15% drop today and so a lot of the downside is baked in already. I'm hoping traders will stay away from EA at least until their next big game announcement which is probably going to be around the E3 event in June. The only things they have going for them at the moment is the release of their two new games Anthem and Apex Legends. Anthem is already being highly scrutinized and many people are not preordering the game. Apex Legends had a great launch the other day but not sure if it will be enough to pull EA out of the ground and its success is being overshadowed by last night's earnings release. If anything I assume EA to be trading in this range until their next earnings call in May. Would love any feedback on the Iron Condor setup or my thoughts on the short term EA trade.

Also, there is no way this has an 89% chance of probability, a better estimate would be somewhere between 60-70% (closer to 60 for April, 70 for Mach). This is a long theta play so you are making about $0.02-0.05 per day depending on expiration. \n\nAt 71 days, its out of my comfort zone for iron condors (make money too slow), but you do have ample opportunity to defend and make adjustments. \n\nYou should also consider doing a short strangle as an aternative at this time range, I'm getting a $800 buying power reduction with a $3.20 credit recieved.

Ideally, the perfect IC receives more premium than loss %. This trade may be successful 70% of the time, but the 30% of the time it losses will more than offset any premium you collected from the 70% wins.

It is a volatile name though so there may still be IV; an IC is a directional assumption that IV will drop so make sure that flows with your thesis.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the write-up/link!
