In other words, for periods longer than one day the return of the ETF is NOT\r\nexpected to match the performance of the commodity, benchmark or index for the same period of time.\nThis is known as the effects of compounding that you mentioned in your post. \nThese bull ETFs you speak of are meant for short term trading.\n\nYou are probably better off using LEAPs or Margin for long term leverage.

Since leverage needs to be reset on a daily basis, volatility is your greatest enemy. This probably sounds strange to some traders. In most cases, volatility is a trader’s friend. But that's certainly not the case with leveraged ETFs. In fact, volatility will crush you. That’s because the compounding effects of daily returns will actually throw off the math, and can do so in a very drastic way.  \n\nFor example, if the S&P 500 moves down 5%, a fund like the SSO should move down 10%. If we assume a share price of $10, the SSO should be down to about $9 after the first day. On the second day, if the S&P 500 moves up 5%, over the two days the S&P 500 return will be -0.25%. An unaware investor would think the SSO should be down 0.5%. The 10% increase on day two will bring shares up from $9.00–$9.90, and the SSO will, in reality, be down by 1%. It decreases a full four times the decline of the S&P 500.\n\nTypically, you will find that the more volatile the benchmark (the S&P 500 in this example) for a leveraged ETF, the more value the ETF will lose over time, even if the benchmark ends up flat or had a 0% return at the end of the year. If the benchmark moved up and down drastically along the way, you may end up losing a significant percentage of the value of the ETF if you bought and held it. For example, if a leveraged ETF moves within 10 points every two days for 60 days, then you will likely lose more than 50% of your investment.\n\nCompounding works to the upside and the downside. If you do some research, you will find that some bull and bear ETFs that track the same index both perform poorly over the same time frame. This can be very frustrating to a trader, as they don’t understand why it’s happening and deem it unfair. But if you look closer, you will see that the index being tracked has been volatile and range-bound, which is a worst-case scenario for a leveraged ETF. The daily rebalancing must take place in order to increase or decrease exposure and maintain the fund’s objective. When a fund reduces its index exposure, it keeps the fund solvent, but by locking in losses, it also leads to a smaller asset base. Therefore, larger returns will be required in order to get you back to even on the trade. \n\nIn order to increase or reduce exposure, a fund must use derivatives, including index futures, equity swaps and index options. These are not what you would call the safest trading vehicles due to counterparty risks and liquidity risks.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/why-leveraged-etfs-are-not-longterm-bet.asp", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "So why ask randos on the internet?
