Reasons being\n\nI think the biggest reason is that S, and to some degree X sales, were always inflated because many people who can afford to by $80k+ cars but wouldn't normally buy them decided to stretch for the S/X when nothing else was available. But now that the Model 3 is here and available, you just don't see many people trading in a Prius for a car that's ~3 to 4 times the price.\n\nBut also, when compared to the Model 3 the S/X lack some stuff:\n\n- Less access to EV incentives because many cap out after $40K or so\n\n- No phone key\n\n- No future proof interior cam or keycard capability (robo taxi?)\n\n- Older battery cells limited to ~200kW charging though no one's ever seen that charge rate\n\n- No CCS (i.e. EU)\n\nSo in EU for instance, the Model S/X don't qualify for a lot incentives cuz they're too pricey. The cars are too big to be comfortable on a lot of streets. They top out at 150kW at 3rd party chargers that Model 3 can get up to 200kW on. And you have to bring your CCS adapter if you want to actually use those 3rd party chargers. On top of that, they're very expensive luxury cars that are missing some basic comfort features like vented seats.\n\nI think if Tesla wants to sell more S/X (S especially), they'll have to provide more comfort features buyers would expect for that price range. They'll also have to add in a lot of the Model 3 tech.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think there‚Äôs no small percentage of people who just wanted a Tesla - whether because it‚Äôs an electric car that‚Äôs fast, because it looks awesome, because of Autopilot, or for whatever other reason - that are now purchasing a Model 3, when they would have otherwise purchased a Model S.  Also, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs quite a few people who have never heard of a possible interior refresh of the S/X, that went for another car because they just didn‚Äôt like the interior of the S/X.
