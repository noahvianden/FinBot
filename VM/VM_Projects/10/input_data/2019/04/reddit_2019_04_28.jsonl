{"title": "Options for vaccinated", "selftext": "This is not \"everything you wanted to know about options but were afraid to ask\" but it's a starting point. It is intended to be an educational post and as such it's simplified and many experienced option traders here will feel the urge to correct me. Go ahead and add the gasoline to the flames.\n\nI assume you read somewhere the definitions of \"call\" , \"put\" , \"strike price\", \"open\", \"close\" and other basic terms. After you read  all of that and opened brokerage account and got ready to get rich quickly. Here is basic guidelines;\n\n1. ***Don't buy calls with intention of get the shares***.  If you want to get shares of a stock, just buy them. You buy calls and puts with sole intention to sell them. Think of calls as temporary baby stocks whose prices are in strong correlation with mama stock and you just trade them.\n2. ***Don't let your calls and puts to expire***. If your bet goes south because you are wrong, don't let it go to 0. With stocks you can let them sit in your account because they rarely go to 0 and they may recover in a few years. Options don't. Even if you sell them for pennies , and get a measly 100 from original 2k , it's still 100 that keeps you in the game.  Small note before smarties jump on it : there are strategies when you want your options to expire. Yes, I've done it as well. These strategies are next level of option trading and should be explained after this point is deeply engraved.  \n3. **Put/Call parity**. Or as a physicist in me would say \"time invariant\".  Buying calls = selling puts. Buying puts = selling calls. \n\nWell, it should be enough to memorize for today. \n\nAn example of trading strategy which is suitable for stock traders who want to experience the thrill.\n\n*Covered call*.  You bought a 1000 shares of $AMD at 25 and you feel smug now and you brag about it on parties. Well those 25k are just  locked in your brokerage account. If AMD goes to 35 you are planning to sell it and be 10k richer. If AMD goes to 25 you are as good as you put them in a bank account. What you can do is to sell 10 calls at 35 strike expiring in June and get 550 for that.  So if AMD goes up but not up to 35 by June 21st, who cares , you already have 550. If AMD goes down to 25 , you are still better than if you put those 25k in the bank. If it goes to 18 - you're screwed just like you would be screwed if you were just holding shares. What if it goes to 50 (hey, a girl can dream) ? Well, you were planning to sell it at 35, don't you?  And now how it goes back to the 3 points above:\n\n1. Obvious , you already bough shares.\n2. This is how it gets fun. Sure you can let calls expire on June 21st when AMD is at 29. But you be better buying them back for 5 cents a day before. There is always a chance of some announcement  after hours on Friday. Some Bezos may decide to buy them out for 40 a piece. You can't trade options after hours, but you can get assigned. Or you may want to 'rinse and repeat' or as it also called 'roll them over' . Look it up as a homework assignment. \n3. Say you don't have 1000 shares of AMD at 25 but you want to and you have 25k allocated for it. Too bad it's at 28 now. Well, sell 10 June puts at 25 strike. You get 1200 cash for it now and if AMD drops to 24 in June you will still be better than the guy who brags on parties that he got AMD at 25. \n\nGood luck", "id": "bibx7f", "created_utc": 1556462622.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "OK.
