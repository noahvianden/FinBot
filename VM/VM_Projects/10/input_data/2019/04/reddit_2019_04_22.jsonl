Sorry if this comes off as too abrasive.  \n\n\"I dont buy XYZ stock because the single product that the company makes, out of hundred of services/products, I dont like\"\n\nDo not let your opinion on one product from a company make the decision for whether you should buy or not. I hear all the time from bad investors, \"I wont buy facebook, snapchat, or Apple because I dont like their...\" There is more complexity to consider to these companies. I personally do not like any of these companies as a consumer, but after reading their 10-k report (document that tells me how much debt they currently have, CEO experience, revenue they're making) I have profited by making plays with this knowledge. \n\n\n\"A candidate just got elected in office and they will make the markets rally/crash\"\n\nThis is another bad common opinion. The market does not care who is in control of congress or the white house. Political offices have smaller influences on the stock market, with the exception of policies that would explicitly effect companies. Such as Warren calling for the break up of Google and Facebook. Better indicators before political office would be the federal reserve lowering/raising rates, US dollar strength, consumer index, etc.\n\n\n\"I feel like the market is too high\"\n\nStop using your feelings, justify an opinion with evidence without using past stock prices. Do you have proof the European economy is suddenly at a higher risk of recession? Make a hypothesis. \"If the Brexit vote passes, then English banks will lose revenue\" Then fine evidence to support your claim.\n\n\n\"The weed market is going to explode!\"\n\nThis is speculation. Which company is going to do well into the future? Think back to the dot com bubble, everyone said Napster was about to take off while there was a ton of speculation occurring about the internet and how revenues would be made in the future.
