{"title": "My thoughts on Disney", "selftext": "I've got an mess of thoughts in my head about Disney right now. \n\nDisney revenue will be highly profitable. No licensed content means generating a lot of easy cash. Also that internal licensing scheme is great. Disney Corp can invoice Disney+ and count it as revenue. \n\nI'm not concerned for subscribers, I think 100m is easy for Disney, especially since YouTube became so toxic for kids programming.\n\nHulu is already 25m subscribers and it's terrible. That news about ATT selling their Hulu stake is interesting. Basically means Disney bought Fox's share and now ATT's. Hulu at $6, Disney+ at $7. Wouldn't be crazy for Disney to move quickly and buy out Comcast to merge Hulu and Disney+. I don't think Hulu customers will complain about paying another $1 if it came with Disney content. \n\nAnother thing. Spotify is getting globbered by Apple music. Amazon is getting ready to launch a music service. Hulu already includes Spotify free. Spotify has an ex-Disney guy on their board. If Disney or Hulu makes a move to acquire Spotify. It would be:\nApple TV + Music\nAmazon streaming + Music\nDisney+/Hulu + Spotify\nNetflix \n\nSpotify is affordable at ~25B. This move makes Disney more able to provide a complete media delivery package, more similar to Apple and Amazon and less like Netflix. I can even imagine their park tourism being bundled as a monthly service. Looking forward Disney will be a technology service company.\n\nNetflix can't compete. They're short on cash. They need to show profitability to remain interesting to investors.\n\n[I'm pretty happy with how I played Disney last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bceecs/i_only_cash_out_15000_returns/)\n\n[I’m expecting Disney to hit $150 within the month. ](https://i.imgur.com/t3AJ5Ie.jpg)", "id": "bdqmqf", "created_utc": 1555396220.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "$150 by EOM?
