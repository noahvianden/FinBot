{"title": "GE Stock Report", "selftext": " \n\n#### BR Technicals’ Technical Analysis Report – General Electric (GE)\n\n#### Published April 4, 2019\n\n#### Prepared By Brandon Ross, CMT \n\nYou can read the report with charts & also download the PDF here:  [https://www.brtechnicals.com/ge-stock-report-april-4-2019/](https://www.brtechnicals.com/ge-stock-report-april-4-2019/)  \n\n## General Electric - The Company\n\nGE was founded in 1892 by Thomas Edison with help from J.P. Morgan. It was an original member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it remained a component from 1907 to 2018, where it was eventually replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Today, the company is in the industrial sector, and is classified as being in the diversified industrials industry. General Electric began as an electric company, but it is now an industrial powerhouse. \n\nIf you look around your home, you may find a GE microwave, refrigerator, or even GE light bulbs, but they also build airplane engines, medical equipment, and various locomotives. They are even in the oil and gas industry. GE is a vast company, and was once a staple of the U.S. economy. However, we can see in the chart above that the stock has been hurting since topping in 2016-2017. Earnings mishaps and company management has hurt the stock in recent years.  \n\n### GE Long-Term Analysis\n\n* An uptrend began in early 2009.\n   * Lasted until 2017 where the trend line and 200-weekly moving average were broken.\n* GE fell out of a symmetrical triangle to signal the top.\n* Bullish divergences in the weekly MACD and RSI indicators.\n   * Notice the trend line support bounce after the stock fell out of the triangle pattern. \n\n### GE Medium-Term Analysis\n\n* After falling through the bottom of the triangle, the stock tried to recover as it bounced off of the long-term trend line support on the 10-year chart. However, the triangle resistance held, and the stock continued lower.  \n* The stock then gapped lower to break a $20 support, signaling that this was more than a correction.  \n\n### GE Short-Term Analysis\n\n* After falling through the bottom of the triangle, the stock tried to recover as it bounced off of the long-term trend line support on the 10-year chart. However, the triangle resistance held, and the stock continued lower.  \n* The stock then gapped lower to break a $20 support, signaling that this was more than a correction. \n* GE is now in a confirmed downtrend, but today, is looking to try and break it.\n* After falling below $6.50, the stock recovered to $11, but has since moved into a diamond formation at the downtrend line resistance.\n   * These are generally bearish patterns, and I would expect the stock to continue in its downtrend from here.\n      * The weak volume beginning in mid-March is another bearish sign for the stock.\n* Testing the 200-day moving average and downtrend line. \n\n# General Electric Stock Report\n\nGeneral Electric stock has been a staple of the U.S. stock market for many years. Their consistent dividend payouts, and its correlation the U.S. economy made it a part of many portfolios. Plus, it was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and is still part of the S&P 500. But the stock has underperformed the last 20 years. The stock peaked in September of 2000, and hasn’t been that high since. \n\nRecently, General Electric stock has fallen on some hard times since peaking in July 2016. Since then, the stock has lost more than 65% of its value, and at one point was down as much as 75%. The stock may have bounced back slightly, but I think there is still room for the stock to run lower. The diamond pattern is a bearish formation, and it is coming off of the minor recovery the stock made from $6.50. It is also brushing along the downtrend resistance line and 200-day moving average.  \n\nThe stock is rated a SELL, and this may be the best time to sell, whether it is selling a long position, or selling short. There is simply too much going against the stock for me to think it will break the current downtrend. \n\nHowever, there is some hope for GE bulls. The long-term weekly indicators are showing bullish divergences, so the pain may be weakening over the coming weeks or months. But that is the problem. The long-term indicators are signaling a bullish divergence, and that will likely take time take to play out. So, what wi;; we look for in a bottom? \n\nThe past two bottoms in General Electric stock came fast. The stock reached its bottom after a final plunge in the stock, then it came back just as fast as it fell. But the stock found bottoms when the rest of the stock market found a bottom. That is to say, the stock market as a whole was falling because of an economic recession. GE was reacting with the broader market. This time it is different. The stock isn’t falling because the economy is weak. The economy is strong, but the company is weak.\n\nGE investors should wait for a clear sign that the stock has found a bottom before jumping in on any rallies. The first sign would come from breaking the downtrend and 200-day moving average. Another signal would be generated if the 50-day moving average were to cross above the 200-day moving average. This would tell us there is momentum in the price rally. But if we’re lucky, the stock will have a clear reversal pattern signal for investors to jump in on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee the charts & download the report PDF here:  [https://www.brtechnicals.com/ge-stock-report-april-4-2019/](https://www.brtechnicals.com/ge-stock-report-april-4-2019/)", "id": "bb9ug0", "created_utc": 1554826532.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for this.
