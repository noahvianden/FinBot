Here are some tips on options since you're new to the sub:\n\n1. Options are super risky. While you can make a lot of money much more quickly than with stocks, you can also lose everything very quickly.\n\n2. Never listen to anybody on this sub. We're all completely autistic and have no idea what we're talking about.\n\n3. You never know more than the market, and there is always risk in every investment (see: u/1r0nyman)\n\n4. Put all your money into $BYND calls.
