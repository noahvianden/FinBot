But sometimes things run hot and employment is high, people feel good and they buy more and more, this leads to supply issues so prices increase, with that increase comes inflation, people need to make more to pay for things that are more expensive over time. \n\nThen there’s the cold, when spending slows for either a good reason like govt intervention, or a bad reason like a black swan event. Let’s focus on the govt intervention, govt raises rates so inflation will be kept in check by making loans more expensive. This means companies have to sell less stuff, like cars, so they’re then forced to lay off workers because profits are down and they either stop paying some people or go out of business really fast. Those people who are out of work can’t buy as much stuff while on unemployment. This feedback loop occurs until things stabilize and equilibrium is reached, essentially.\n\nIt’s actually not that scary, what’s scary is that people panic and the news acts like the world is ending when really unemployment may not even get very high at all.\n\nThis is a very simple explanation of things.
