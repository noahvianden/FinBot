Or is IV still going to continually rise at the earnings date approaches? I don't plan to hold through earnings, I was thinking to exit the position about 10-20 DTE, but now I'm thinking if IV will continue to rise to offset what I would've earned through theta decay.\n\nThanks!", "id": "aydotx", "created_utc": 1551971891.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "IV will continue to rise up until earnings, but that's partly an illusion. IV rises into earnings for 2 reasons - the actual pricing in of the expected earnings move, and the fact that the \"earnings weight\" in the options increases each day as we get closer to earnings. The latter is what I mean by an illusion. If there are 10 days to earnings, the earnings weight would be 0.1. But if there are just 2 days, it would be 0.5. In the latter case, the IV would be much higher, but that doesn't mean you get vega gains by holding from day -10 to day -2.\n\nWhat you need is the earnings move implied by the options right now.

The April 20 calls and puts will start showing sizeable increases in IV around the Thur or Fri prior to the earnings report, like the 11th or 12th of April, and will eventually go above 3-sigma.\n\nBut if you are in your condor now, by the time we get to April 18th, you will likely be far away from the centering price at that time, with one of the options strongly ITM with a high value and delta (absolute value) and other close to worthless.
