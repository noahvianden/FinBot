So a plane that may have faulty engineering (a broad subpoena has been issued by a grand jury) is too big to fail? That is horrifying for the flying public. I have read that 2 planes crashed, over 300 people are dead.  There are airlines staring to reconsider orders and initiate lawsuits due to airplane rental fees and increased fuel costs. Boeing is still building the planes, but not delivering them, so they will need to rent plane storage space.
