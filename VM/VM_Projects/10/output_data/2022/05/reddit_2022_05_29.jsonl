Let's ignore the premiums to keep it simple. \r  \n\r  \n1) Your collar has $100 stock with short $$105 call and a long $95 put.

The options in each position all expire at the same time.

Calculate the theoretical  prices for all options involved. This eliminates price variation (skew, series distortion, etc,) and wide bid-ask spreads.
