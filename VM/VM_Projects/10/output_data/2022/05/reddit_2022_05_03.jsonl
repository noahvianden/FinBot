{"title": "Basic Trade Bot Proposition", "selftext": "So I'm far from an expert in trading, but if I've learned anything, luck and suppressing impulses go further than human intuition and, frequently, research. How about a trading bot that does the following:\n\n* Picks a stock\n* Buys a lowish set amount, say like 3% of your available buying power or a set dollar amount\n* Sells when that stock goes up by a very low set amount, say 1 or 2%. This limits gains but removes human emotion.\n* Holds if it doesn't ever go up by that amount above purchase price\n* Maybe alerts you if it's held that stock for more than a week or so \n\nEssentially this would make money off small fluctuations automatically, and would only sell for a loss if you choose to. It would prevent impulse decisions, and choosing stocks based on excessive hype/FOMO, which usually fail me. This assumes the price eventually increases, which is obviously not a given but for this to lose money it would require the moment of purchasing to be the highest point of the following 7 days, which is unlikely depending on how the bot picks stocks. Of course this can happen, but if the bot only invests a small amount and diversifies what you invest into, risk can be limited. To increase profits, scale up the bot's number of stock purchases. \n\nFurther considerations:\n\n* Trading fees\n* Day trading limitations\n* Time to exercise\n* Inflation\n* How the bot picks stocks. Randomly? Within an industry? Based on recent growth? By popularity? Low or high volatility?\n\nIs this worth looking into? Is this fundamentally flawed? What are your thoughts?

{"title": "What Start-Ups See in BlackBerry IVY !", "selftext": "\nWe\u2019re pleased with the Fund\u2019s momentum and the early successes. Our close ties with the automotive ecosystem opens many doors and the BlackBerry IVY platform allows start-ups\u2019 lean R&D teams to focus on driving product roadmaps and not bespoke, time-consuming vehicle integration work.\n\nThe start-up community has been receptive to the Fund\u2019s creation and IVY\u2122 in general, with the volume of pitches exceeding our expectations. Start-ups are unanimous in their praise for the BlackBerry IVY platform\u2019s unique ability to access and surface harmonized data across multiple vehicle makes and models. Many have remarked that IVY is the silver bullet that they need to win over OEMs. Additionally, the entire automotive investment community has been very welcoming, we\u2019ve forged relationships with the venture arms of OEMs and institutional investors focused on the smart mobility space.\nThe common refrain from start-ups is that putting software into vehicles is much harder than anticipated. The lack of consistency in accessing sensor data due to multiple vehicle platforms, differences in signal formats, and inertia from complex internal processes continues to validate the value proposition of BlackBerry IVY.\n\n\n\nhttps://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/05/the-blackberry-ivy-innovation-fund-one-year-on-where-are-we-now", "id": "uha0z9", "created_utc": 1651559855.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|105|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|434|**Previous DD**|[x](https://i.redd.it/0f9uqdrnqp581.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4pecy/bux_zero_is_giving_away_free_shares/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uha0z9)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uha0z9)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16002169251441956}, {"body": "I can't read that.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10264047980308533}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06554208695888519}, {"body": "Oyyyy you gotta add some rockets, references to tendies and such", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06310990452766418}, {"body": "Bag holder confirmed", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1400209665298462}, {"body": "BB going back to to $20?
