The only risk is mainly the risk of stock price going down. \n\nIn addition, with interest rate so low, it makes no sense to put money in savings where it'll just be eaten away by inflation. \n\nIn regards to balance sheet tightening, this is where I'm not too familiar, but my guess is that it allows the Fed to distribute cash into the markets allowing the large players to take advantage of. And of course, those cash will go into the stock and housing markets.\n\nLastly, the interest rate has an impact on PE ratios of stocks, because it serves as a risk-free yield to which all other assets' expected return is based on.\n\nWhen interest rate is near zero, the PE of stock can almost be \"infinite.\" But when interest rate goes up, the PE of stock starts to shrink, with the greatest effect going from the smaller numbers to higher numbers.\n\nFor example, 1% -> 2% interest rate means the risk-free PE threshold shrinks from 100 to 50, while 2%->3% it is from 50 to 33. The higher the interest rates, the slower the PE shrinkage occurs as rates are raised.\n\nHowever, at 3-4% interest rates, it means a lot of the companies' PE will be dramatically to pushed down.\n\nNow imagine if interest rates of 7-8% do come about, then the risk-free PE is around 12. Even blue chip companies' PE will probably shrink to 5-6, and growth companies to like 10. \n\nThat's why the market will \"crash\" if that happens, in addition, to of course, harder to access funds, cash becoming more valuable and recession fears.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I see, I thought that increasing interest rates simple made it more expensive for companies who have borrowed money, and that increased interest expense would eat into their profits?\n\nCould you please explain a bit further about the risk free PE threshold?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You can consider each company's earnings as a yield on their stock price. If company A earns $4 per share in a year on a $100 stock price, you can say they are yielding 4%, or the inverse of that is the price to earnings ratio (PE ratio) of 25.\n\nIf 10 year Treasuries is giving investors 4% as well, and you don't see the company A growing its EPS at all but expect it to stay at $4 per share for the foreseeable future, given a choice between the 10 year Treasury and company A, the risk-free choice is the 10 Year Treasury. Because while you think company A will maintain $4 / share EPS, you don't know that. A recession may happen or its competitors may eat its marketshare or consumer preferences may change--those could all decrease its earnings.\n\nSo you discount the company's PE ratio you would use to calculate the expected stock price from the risk-free PE (which is the inverse of Treasuries' yield of 4%) of 25 to account for the fact that company A's earning is not certain. How much discount is highly variable and inaccurate -- you'll just have to guesstimate. So I think 10-15 is fair PE for a non-growing company at 4% 10 Year Treasury.\n\nIf the company is growing, then you give it less discount to the 10 Year, and if it's growing very fast, it can even have a premium to the 10 Year. This only works for companies who actually have a positive EPS. \n\nAnother way to look at it is to discount future cash flow to present value using the risk-free interest rate, so the higher the interest rate the lower the present value.

The legacy (hell even Tesla) *cannot* produce enough even if they wanted to go 100%. It's never been a question of demand. Extremely ironic that engineers miss that fact. Lots of supposed \"numbers and statistics\" but ultimately their analysis boils down to a complete misunderstanding of customer sentiment in three continents and ignoring supply side. *Everyone*, save for enthusiast petrolheads, want an EV that outperforms literally every car in every discernible metric for vehicles under $100k USD. They just can't produce them fast enough.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Agree on the general consideration that Engineers do not usually make great salespersons, and really you do not want them to be in the smoke and mirror business.\n\nNow about the TAM there are indeed two opinions. stress on the opinion, ours and the alternative. The alternative looks at the total Petroleum/Oil infrastructure, from extraction to the pump, including the ICE industry and its ramifications that is something in the order of 10 T$/year with about another 200 T$ in infrastructure  (very rough calculation based on replacement cost at current currency value). \n\nIf we dismiss the announcements from governments, LICE OEMs and Oil companies as \"green washing\" propaganda and look at the actual investments, even at the 10 year horizon, there is a clear gap between wishes and reality.\n\nIf we exclude Tesla, then the gap become even more rich of significance. This bring us back to the \"opinions\" about TAM. Fer me and probably you and the readers/writers of this post, TAM for Tesla is basically infinite, or in the order of several tens of T$ but, as you correctly and wisely point out , the whole technological change away from petroleum/oil is production constrained, even if the TAM was limited to the \"green entitled rich consumers\" (GERC - sounds like Jerks when my colleagues and FRIENDS pronounce it).\n\nIn these conditions, it is hard to find \"in the numbers\" a clear global trend turning away from the Petroleum/Oil economy. And I cannot fight these measures, in good conscience, well, not until this year with the China's trends.\n\nWhat the China numbers may tell us is that the TAM is indeed much bigger than the expected GERC segment, and there is indeed an economy in the world that is investing closer to the 1 T$ value per year into the technology change.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that, past the proclaims and goals, the actual investments into shifting the energy chain has lagging so much behind that is no longer believable beside a PR stunt.\n\nFor me, with my investor hat, it is great news, meaning that Tesla basically will go unchallenged dominating the BEV and Battery energy market for the next 20 years. At the same time, if I put my old, very old and teared up green hat on,  I see Tesla as the only, sadly only, actor of change in the order of few T$ in 10 years (I am not talking about market capitalization but actual economy impact).\n\nThat is if the \"signals\" from China would not be real... and these signals are making my very smart and skeptic colleagues and FRIENDS rethinking their models, at least correcting them.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">What the China numbers may tell us is that the TAM is indeed much bigger than the expected GERC segment,\n\nNorway's 50%+ share of BEV sales told us that too: it's an advanced economy, whose population, despite a lot of BEV-unfriendly cold weather, is very happy with buying & owning BEVs.\n\nThe \"limited TAM\" arguments against BEVs were proven wrong with the release of the Model 3: to any rational observer it's a much better car than a gascar in almost every regard.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I totally agree, as a matter of fact most of my colleagues agree too that a BEV drive-train is way more efficient and  effective (How they cannot? they are mostly engineers right?).\n\nNorway did not work for them because it is the prototype GERC country: they got rich via the north sea oil extraction, they are a \"socialist\"  Scandinavian economy, and they flipped on green concerns.\n\nChina, on the other hand, is a brutally utilitarian \"communist\" country  with basically no GERC population to speak of, at least in our \"in the middle of US\" common perception. Please note that the \"brutally utilitarian\" adjective is used in admiration toward the \"engineering\" prowess of the nation, not as a pejorative.\n\nIf Tesla stirs China towards BEV, the whole mighty power of that economy may do the many Trillions dollars trick of steering the world away from the oil ecosystem. In other words, the analysis were not concerned about Norway because it was the classic drop in the bucket of the effort of steering the world economy, but if China moves, it got their attention.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, Elon and Tesla just planned this that way...  you know \"accelerate the transition...\" not executing the transition.
