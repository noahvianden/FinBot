Others include Market Maker \"max pain\" theory and gravitating the price there.  And others coincide it with Bullard coming out and saying he didn't expect a recession for 2022/2023.\n\nI'm struggling to understand the example given in the thread.  I think I understand \"negative delta = short delta\" can have the following meanings:\n\n- buy a put or sell a call (both cases you hope underlying goes down)\n- buy put debit spread, sell call credit spread \n- buy VIX calls \n- sell stock/future\n- close out existing long delta positions\n\nIs the jist is if a trader is overweight negative delta and the market has gone his way throughout the entire day, for risk and compliance issues of his position despite being up bigly, he needs to get back to more positive delta real fast by EOD, and hence starts doing positive delta things (like buying stock, selling puts, buying calls, etc.) no matter the price?", "id": "uvdhqb", "created_utc": 1653234048.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "i read and sometimes even trade off various theories and \u201cexplanations\u201d like dealer gamma etc but deep down i don\u2019t believe anyone can understand the market action without knowing the intention of every big seller and buyer at each moment of the market. hindsight is even worse because we suffer from so many biases (recency, adverse selection, confirmation). the weirdest part is when ppl get excited that a prediction came true as if that\u2019s surprising (now compare it to how many times a prediction was wrong).

Meaning a violent downswing that spikes VIX to 40+.\n\nI don't think it will happen outside of some crazy macro black swan (monkeypox zombie sex apocalypse) and we just grind lower until market is satisfied with the blood offering. If you're down 40% already on long positions that have held throughout and don't need the cash soon, why would you sell now? The risk/reward tells you to just stfu and bear (goddammit) it for a little longer.\n\nJpow can raise rates all he wants, but if inflation is caused more from supply side, taming demand side through hikes won't help.

{"title": "I made an investing strategy tracking Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speeches", "selftext": "Edit: Here's the graphs for the people who can't read:\n\n[Calls](https://ibb.co/qg8q4M4)\n\n[Puts](https://imgur.com/a/D4Mo8Zd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Intro\n\nHey everyone! [So some background](https://reddit.com/u/schemeelectronic9058) \\- I make indexes/strategies that sound really fucking WallStreetBets-y but have a little bit of sound analysis behind them. I'm the guy who built the [Inverse Cramer ETF](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/), as well as the [South Park investing strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/uq1tbr/oc_an_investing_strategy_that_tracks_south_park/i8sjoq4/?context=3). Tl;dr - these meme strategies *seem* to work (I'm working on turning these into real ETFs, because they've gotten considerable attention)\n\nWhat I wanted to see next, based on some WallStreetBets comments, was whether I could find either an equity or an options strategy based on the JPow's speeches that seemed to have worked historically. Here's what I did:\n\n# The Data\n\nI took all the data I could find on Powell's speech dates [from C-Span](https://www.c-span.org/search/?sdate=&edate=&congressSelect=&yearSelect=&searchtype=Videos&sort=Most+Recent+Airing&text=0&personid%5B%5D=17815). Ended up being quite a few hundred videos. I wasn't looking for any bullish/bearish content from the speech. The signal I was looking to test for with this strategy was - can we glean any market information from the time of JPow's speeches, and/or do market participants act differently shortly after his speech?\n\n# The Strategy\n\nFuck JPow right? So anyways, I tracked the S&P with 100% of the portfolio. Whenever JPow spoke, I reallocated 15% of the portfolio into daily puts (at the specific time of the speech). Used the same purchase price as strike price, so I benefit from a directional bet rather than a magnitude one.\n\nI also did this with strategy with calls for fun. First time I've done an options strategy, so any feedback here is welcome!\n\n## Execution\n\nIn execution, it looked like this:\n\n* Took all the dates that JPow was speaking\n* Used the adjusted close/open to factor in dividends and splits\n* If you've followed along [my posts before](http://reddit.com/u/SchemeElectronic9058), I always start off with a naive algorithm as a sanity check. If I'm able to get some sort of signal without doing much work on structuring the data, that makes me happy because there might be some kind of strong signal that you don't have to do statistical magic for\n   * The naive algorithms used equities. What if we bought the SPY the day of JPow's speech, then sold either at end of day, or at open the next day\n   * This time, the naive algorithm failed. Becaue you're mostly out of the S&P, you don't get all the upside of the last 4 years. **In hindsight, the naive algorithm (and using equities) was pretty fucking stupid.** You'd have to have the thesis that the S&P has the biggest jumps only on days JPow speaks, and is otherwise flat or in a bear market\n\nAnyways, then I tried a daily options strategy. When JPow's speech is released on C-Span, I bought an option the next hour, and exercised by the end of day.\n\n# The Performance\n\n## Naive 1: Just buying on speech date\n\n|Date|Stocks|\n|:-|:-|\n|2018-02-27|97105.3463426343|\n|2018-03-01|98303.6362345755|\n|2018-03-21|94685.7219661292|\n|2018-04-06|93355.761104335|\n|2018-05-08|94869.3730303849|\n|2018-05-25|94869.3730303849|\n|2018-06-20|94449.9617615737|\n|2018-08-24|94802.7833436814|\n|2018-09-27|95041.43666641|\n|2018-10-02|93970.0572470764|\n|2018-10-03|92885.7173735969|\n|2018-11-14|94596.3558784654|\n|2018-11-15|95271.5724556757|\n|2018-11-28|95946.8387684013|\n|2018-12-06|93849.5873616183|\n|2019-01-04|95669.0401188474|\n|2019-01-10|96151.6987558228|\n|2019-02-06|95984.9039147756|\n|2019-02-12|95758.0573458121|\n|2019-02-28|95751.2319721327|\n|2019-03-08|96284.4657167932|\n|2019-03-10|97764.0898884726|\n|2019-03-11|98562.8497645389|\n|2019-05-09|99418.6615280234|\n|2019-05-20|99349.1028964104|\n|2019-06-04|100218.271581291|\n|2019-06-25|100132.39474189|\n|2019-07-09|100447.857935347|\n|2019-07-16|100139.556567132|\n|2019-08-23|98050.1581683374|\n|2019-09-06|98010.689175075|\n|2019-10-04|99091.3150387365|\n|2019-10-07|99169.6170588295|\n|2019-10-08|100018.908046896|\n|2019-10-09|101770.735244559|\n|2019-11-25|102442.909494463|\n|2020-03-26|102503.579220542|\n|2020-04-09|102732.539465094|\n|2020-05-13|105432.048862341|\n|2020-05-17|105043.496578372|\n|2020-05-21|105353.736299436|\n|2020-05-29|106001.622436472|\n|2020-06-19|104135.789493114|\n|2020-08-27|104475.51372991|\n|2020-09-21|102589.952213596|\n|2020-10-06|104307.270173123|\n|2020-10-19|104085.578497014|\n|2021-01-14|103803.761378614|\n|2021-02-10|104175.215894355|\n|2021-03-04|105043.209640479|\n|2021-03-22|103866.558722505|\n|2021-04-08|104654.980876694|\n|2021-04-14|105545.365259856|\n|2021-05-03|105464.188402278|\n|2021-06-04|105927.906480304|\n|2021-08-17|105186.581863344|\n|2021-08-27|105922.926761463|\n|2021-09-24|106515.600374551|\n|2021-09-29|106080.763286953|\n|2021-10-22|106078.419879038|\n|2021-11-08|104790.070230113|\n|2021-11-09|104382.686272829|\n|2022-03-21|103900.409262539|\n|2022-03-23|105473.104601321|\n|2022-04-21|102849.012433245|\n|2022-04-21|100290.205720949|\n|2022-05-17|97397.0718945674|\n\n## Naive 2: Buy the day after, sell end of day\n\n|Date|Stocks|\n|:-|:-|\n|2018-02-27|98538.1605113433|\n|2018-03-01|99754.1314764701|\n|2018-03-21|98175.4049886266|\n|2018-04-06|96796.4278470425|\n|2018-05-08|97454.5651037056|\n|2018-05-25|97454.5651037056|\n|2018-06-20|96847.1511491482|\n|2018-08-24|97208.9275273888|\n|2018-09-27|97453.6379961647|\n|2018-10-02|97114.0819322116|\n|2018-10-03|96533.7617433334|\n|2018-11-14|98056.5766327483|\n|2018-11-15|98756.4918190371|\n|2018-11-28|98853.9169361238|\n|2018-12-06|96693.1212390324|\n|2019-01-04|98567.7013090071|\n|2019-01-10|99064.9839440634|\n|2019-02-06|98772.481180627|\n|2019-02-12|98758.1126091478|\n|2019-02-28|98751.0733996952|\n|2019-03-08|99301.0131088102|\n|2019-03-10|100448.206365389|\n|2019-03-11|100602.982848802|\n|2019-05-09|101476.508892025|\n|2019-05-20|101717.933386112|\n|2019-06-04|101944.911418399|\n|2019-06-25|101497.64703221|\n|2019-07-09|101579.285336059|\n|2019-07-16|100898.133111478|\n|2019-08-23|98792.9071149643|\n|2019-09-06|98753.1391364302|\n|2019-10-04|99841.9509503943|\n|2019-10-07|98980.8861910643|\n|2019-10-08|99157.9075909941|\n|2019-10-09|99859.4152394393|\n|2019-11-25|100072.886761556|\n|2020-03-26|100132.152889956|\n|2020-04-09|100355.816125791|\n|2020-05-13|102521.583765777|\n|2020-05-17|103203.782458112|\n|2020-05-21|103508.588692915|\n|2020-05-29|104145.127861185|\n|2020-06-19|102311.972801978|\n|2020-08-27|102645.747165666|\n|2020-09-21|103186.195741447|\n|2020-10-06|103991.865647335|\n|2020-10-19|103967.647707593|\n|2021-01-14|103686.14989294|\n|2021-02-10|103545.689926777|\n|2021-03-04|104408.438427203|\n|2021-03-22|103766.391141665|\n|2021-04-08|104554.052951613|\n|2021-04-14|105092.315292551|\n|2021-05-03|104978.649798298|\n|2021-06-04|105440.232999721|\n|2021-08-17|104540.459029258|\n|2021-08-27|105272.28082905|\n|2021-09-24|105861.313864149|\n|2021-09-29|104190.924649514|\n|2021-10-22|104188.622989627|\n|2021-11-08|103757.944275824|\n|2021-11-09|103321.145559394|\n|2022-03-21|104185.517834177|\n|2022-03-23|105248.537195062|\n|2022-04-21|102630.032096544|\n|2022-04-21|100076.673451684|\n|2022-05-17|97189.6995232384|\n\nAgain, the naive ones didn't do BAD - they just weren't exciting, and were really what you'd expect.

Was a pretty stupid idea in hindsight. What we did learn here is that JPow's speech dates are very much a confounding factor - he speaks during times of crisis, meaning following them is a play on trading volatility.\n\nThe best strategy based on the results here seems to be buying puts on a daily basis when there are inklings of panic and volatility, and then buying calls when you're sure people are panicked, scared, and volatile.

Too funny! And you believe Cramer when he says to buy this stock and sell that one too, don't you! I hate to burst your litte belief bubble, but the Richest Americans have been trying to create real inflation for over a generation now. That's because Generation X didn't fall for the Rich's greedy tactics. With Inflation. The Rich, who own 80% of real assets, get richer because of it. The Rich's assets become more valuable and their debt becomes less valuable. That's because they can pay back their debt with deflated dollars as long as they can continue to raise prices and people continue to buy. When it's Deflation. Those who continue to work can buy real assets cheaper as long as they can continued to work and the Rich hates it. Because their assets becomes less valuable and their debt is just their debt. If they have to sell assets to pay debt. Well they lose again. It's Lose, Lose. They hate it and try to get cheaper borrowing cost by getting their Fed to lower rates. Back with the \"Dot Com Bubble\". The Rich  used it to entrap their own Baby Boomer generation into the Market, to steal their wealth savings, while at the same time.  Setup the future Billionaire classes of Steve Jobs, Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerbergs that they could  ride off of for a few decades. Now because Generation X could see through them. General X didn't fall for the lure of greed and over leverage. They tought their kids, the Millenials, better about work, debt and leverage. So that when the Rich tried the 2008 financial crash. To gain real  assets and the real-estate equity wealth built up by the proprietary inheritance form the Boomer's parents. They entrapped as many as possible. But that did work as well as they hoped. Deflation still was rampant. So the Rich, needing a new slave class of workers. Imported their workforce and Off Shored jobs. Now when Obama deported alot of the illegal workers and then Trump and COVID-19 shut down the borders. Well that's when workers could demand a real living wage. They did. Then all the lies from Republicans about how that causes a loss of jobs and business would  go under was exposed. Now more workers valued work and money flowed into the hands of people who  actually would spend it. There by stimulating the economy greater. Well the Greedy Rich can't just pay you a living wage and maintain a 3500 to 1 ratio of CEO pay to workers now can they. So they used the Pandemic to inflate EVERYTHING! Now with this inflation. The Rich and those with CASH money get richer. There by taking away the wage gains of the Labor class and those who are actually doing the work. So now it's a battle between the Rich and the workers. The last time the Rich caused the Great Depression just to try and kill off the Labor Class. The only way WORKERS can win is with Union Membership. The Rich are scared of Unions because then they are forced to pay a living wage. Those wages built the economy of the 40's, 50's, and 60's. Now I don't think for second the Rich won't cash the economy to maintain their Greedy life habits, but Inflation is exactly what they want. Just not too much to crash the economy.

{"title": "Week of 5-23: Most Important Charts to Watch #002", "selftext": "Appreciate the reception I got last time, basically I'm just some guy trying to interpret the economy through what I perceive as significant price action inflections found by cross analyzing different asset classes both long and short. Instead of being judged on my ability to know every potential outcome, I'd rather give people both a bull and bear thesis then see if reality unfolds as such under those conditions. Ideally, these inflections will provide higher returns that are either uncorrelated and/or outperform the S&P. So here I go...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Chart #1 - Small caps vs Silver\n\n[IWM vs SLV](https://preview.redd.it/91r789ldl3191.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&s=90b0d8fbd63cfe5d5733ca6ad9816b932f7ce57d)\n\nSitting right at it's 6 month point of control with a consolidating range, I have to image we will see a significant move here soon. Which ever way this breaks will give us a glimpse into how much more inflation this market is willing to stomach and how concerned participants still are.\n\n* **Upside Breakout** \\- Market sees inflation levels as tolerable for the time being, we see a bottom in equities in general likely lead by small caps aka growth stocks. Potentially a small squeeze ensues.\n* **Downside Breakout** \\- Metals getting preferred over small caps likely means that inflation is still high and market participants still aren't happy about it, a breakdown out this range could mean more pain to come for equity bulls. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Chart #2 Bonds vs Gold\n\n[TLT vs GLD](https://preview.redd.it/v8b11kbqn3191.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3887995ae47cd2f0fa7ed431488eb500cee8da)\n\nAnother inflection indicator. It may not be a good predictor of where broader equities go as both of these are often known to be defensive in nature, however, this along with the Chart #1 agriculture basket I posted last week in #001 both make excellent inflation indicators.\n\n* **Upside breakout** \\- Yields top out (bonds bottom out and move higher) and inflation cools (gold lower or has a very shallow bottom)\n* **Downside breakout** \\- Inflation continues to hammer markets. Participants prefer gold as yields need to keep pushing higher (bonds prices lower) to fend off the aggriculture and energy bulls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Chart #3 - Small Caps vs Crude Oil\n\n[Russell 2000 vs Crude Oil](https://preview.redd.it/cpeyddctz3191.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fa6467ea04497a2c1a2587901cf26996aba22f8)\n\nEquity bulls would love to see a double bottom here as a rotation into more risk-on assets such as the growth stocks within IWM would be preferred over one of the biggest sources of inflation, crude oil. \n\n* **Upside breakou**t - Inflation starts to cool and market participants simultaneously get more confident about the economy. This is a very Fed friendly bet and would probably be the outcome the average retail trader would like both in terms of opportunity for growth stock bottom picking and cost of living going down. \n* **Downside breakout** \\- More inflation, specifically from energy continues to hammer growth stocks. Likely lead by retail to the downside. \n\n# Last Week's Recap:\n\n*Chart #1 - Equal-weight aggriculture basket* \\- Inflection not yet realized, gapped over trendline Monday and attempted a retest of the trendline, a continued push higher is likely to be bad news for equity bulls. It has outperformed the S&P since early April so perhaps we may see a pullback. A failed breakout would finally give us relief at the grocery store.\n\n[Soybeans + Corn + Wheat Equalweight](https://preview.redd.it/huk1d2wi34191.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=80fbf0cb594e677fc4e232cd04d4f011bcca02c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Chart #2 - Dollar Index v Energy Sector -* Outperformed the S&P last week and I believe this must choose a direction soon. A failure here will mean a deflationary situation will be upon us. Likely leading to both dollar and bonds continuing to outperform as an asset.  A continued breakout will again mean more energy inflation and a Fed potentially still behind the curve.\n\n[Dollar vs Energy](https://preview.redd.it/hkphwcrq44191.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf1fdeea9146dafe9716416bf8d4a79867348b1b)\n\n*Chart #3 - Emerging Markets v S&P -* Massively outperformed SPY last week, looking around I'm seeing Mexico massively outperforming SPY and China has gotten an oversold bounce with anticipation of a June 1st reopening.  Seeing this reopening actually playing out will need to continue being considered but that was a clean break. The chart shown below is one way you could have played the emerging market bounce, buying EWG (Mexico ETF) and shorting SPY to capture this spread.\n\n[Mexico vs S&P](https://preview.redd.it/mkezk7ex54191.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e71b3cd82fe88d83867449183b67fd5572cb343)", "id": "uvnbqo", "created_utc": 1653263192.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|994|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uvnbqo)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uvnbqo)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16993658244609833}, {"body": "Bers r fucked, your charts don\u2019t matter", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "What you have leading?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "His leading indicator is the futures opening green lol", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3530017137527466}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1721595972776413}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21608956158161163}, {"body": "But what about Monkey Pox??", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "approval ratings for Monke Pox not good", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4646163582801819}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03934255614876747}, {"body": "thanks\n\ni don't use ta, but good to see a skilled ta strategist at work", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12058901786804199}, {"body": "I'm not autistic enough to understand these.
