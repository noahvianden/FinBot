Or should I wait a while but possibly miss the best increases (wait until the market starts to trend up again and miss the initial few days or week)?\n\nAlso, I've been thinking of investing in Nintendo due to the announcement of the Switch 2 soon (2024). The Switch sold an increase in units since COVID happened (around 25 million in '20 and around 20 million in '21).
