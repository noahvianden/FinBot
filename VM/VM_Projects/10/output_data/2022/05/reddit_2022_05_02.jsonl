This could allow the broader market, particularly tech, to bounce over the mid-term as traders reassess this tightening cycle. \n\nHowever, the majority expectation is still for interest rates to continue rising aggressively over the coming months, and there is an argument to be made that front-loading these rate hikes not only helps tackle inflation, but also gives the central bank room to maneuver if the economy begins to slip into a recession. Therefore, if the Fed instead uses their forward guidance to reiterate this hawkish outlook, it could see selling pressure extend through May. \n\nOf course, all trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see if tech stocks can stage some sort of rebound this month, or do the downside risks still outweigh upside potential?", "id": "ugmkhu", "created_utc": 1651487218.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "We still got room to go down", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21646857261657715}, {"body": "It's not just the interest rate hikes, the Fed has to start selling those bonds and mbs", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4884601831436157}, {"body": "No. It's just started, nobody ever seen what's coming.

{"title": "AMD\u2019s earnings outlook expected to give a clearer picture of where the chip sector is headed", "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has served as a bellwether in chip-sector earnings of late, usually playing the foil to Intel Corp.\u2019s report, so analysts will keep a sharp eye on how the company expects 2022 to play out when AMD reports earnings Tuesday.\n\nFront and center is how AMD has fared amid contracting sales of personal computers, given that strong sales a year ago fueled by COVID-19 work-from-home mandates boosted results. The big growth area is expected to come from AMD\u2019s data-center sales, where the chipmaker continues to capture market share from Intel.\n\nSo far, the chip sector has been handing in mixed results. Intel Corp. doubled down on its bullish 2022 outlook even though the current quarter is showing signs of weakness and Wall Street is skeptical. Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s QCOM outlook was also bullish, but analysts could see support in the short term given strength in its handset business. Texas Instruments Inc. execs played it safe in issuing a cautious outlook because it expects supply-chain problems exacerbated by COVID lockdowns in China to affect the manufacturing operations of its customers. Chip-equipment makers Lam Research Corp. LRCX,  KLA Corp. and ASML Holding NV all reported that supply-chain problems are hampering sales in a high-demand environment.\n\nFor the past several quarters, AMD has turned in beat-and-raise earnings, but last quarter its full-year forecast was a little on the cautious side. That caution appeared to play well with the events that unfolded during the quarter \u2014 rising inflation, declining PC sales, a stronger dollar  DXY,  COVID lockdowns in China that are only worsening supply chain problems, and the heightened geopolitical risk from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \n\nWith all that staring the sector down, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso recently upgraded AMD to a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d from \u201coutperform\u201d with a price target of $160. In a note, Caso said he expects the chip maker to keep bleeding share from Intel, and that the two will \u201cbecome a sustained duopoly over time\u201d in the PC market.\n\n\u201cAs we have become more concerned about cycle risks given potential for slowing consumer demand and elevated inventory levels at customers, we favor those semi companies with strong secular drivers, more muted cyclical exposure and attractive valuations, for which AMD appears well positioned,\u201d Caso said. \u201cWe have strong confidence regarding AMD\u2019s position and share gains in the datacenter market.\u201d\n\nLast quarter, AMD turned in another strong print and rocketed past Wall Street expectations, and in the one before that analysts had trouble nitpicking results. \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-earnings-outlook-expected-to-give-a-clearer-picture-of-where-the-chip-sector-is-headed-11651271321?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-earnings-outlook-expected-to-give-a-clearer-picture-of-where-the-chip-sector-is-headed-11651271321?mod=home-page)", "id": "ugjcxk", "created_utc": 1651473105.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Shorter-term wise, the ER coincides with the FOMC meetings, so there's also that.\n\nIf the Feds announce a 50bp (or 25, less likely) and say the right things to remove market uncertainty, then the market could probably pump with will push AMD up too.\n\nI do believe the oversold condition helps too, similar to how FB pumped after ER", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "FOMC already confirmed a 50bp, that's no surprise.

I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I\u2019m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date.\n\nSo I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession.  But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. \n\nNow, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post.\n\n  \n\n\n[Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed.](https://preview.redd.it/6g78v16b00x81.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a5b3fc8938ad33265022ed285ed637ad47787f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earnings season :**\n\nAs we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tech Earnings Season](https://preview.redd.it/ah5otfma10x81.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1405b4fa92b679c534e704f4e658937cb8ddfc72)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis**\n\nMonday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[KO Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/6abdl35r10x81.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=64e104c2f19b2a66953b5eca0791ee13b54eb3e4)\n\nWhen Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation.\n\nSo the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[KO T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/f4vvws6320x81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=efff82a22fde6f90dfa592d793cf4243a4b2e0a0)\n\nAs for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call \"Bearish divergence\" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered.\n\nIf the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop )**\n\nBoi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/gzt1xcxn30x81.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=198cd7f826b6f836065df8033534ebb92d946127)\n\nMicrosoft kickstarted the show with a beating est.

Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly.\n\nBut the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours.\n\nBut visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because  transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GOOGL T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/1so6uh4w40x81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41a2ed50046c7d5349da599826a926a7517aa9b)\n\n \n\nAs for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 )**\n\nOh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A.\n\nWell Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up.\n\nPaypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing.\n\nPins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased.\n\nQualcomm, I have no idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  **April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/9kl9bd6x50x81.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=a15ec5df4b9853fb74e75575a31946b4cc206ebc)\n\n[AAPL Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/3mcjrf6x50x81.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be191d9f21931c96c2ba2f7914e1cfb1cec3fc6)\n\nThursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nNo one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/cuoe18en60x81.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=e598b375e2e51a77d373b7b630e46791e2635488)\n\n[AAPL T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/3y02o2en60x81.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e922591b08a5c7a0211381e858d0d6c4b5db32f)\n\nAs for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. \n\nFor Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day**\n\nThink of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Things are only going to get much worse from here. \n\n So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market.\n\nSo find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life.\n\n( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering :\n\n \n\n**Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates.**\n\nSo my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike](https://preview.redd.it/1vn8aej890x81.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcb1c6c62e6b2af53f83506c3349f5cd1bd4126)\n\nThe answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the \"Taylor rule\" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me.\n\nSo now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6duok8ob0x81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d136ac9bb1ccfcc2d4c71b5617bff9a2f51f5d6\n\nSo idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong.\n\nHypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023.\n\nHere\u2019s the calculation on how it could.\n\n50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy.\n\n5 X 0.50 = 2.5%\n\nTotal = 5.75%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what impact will it have ?\n\nAlmost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[At the end of large cycles we have Recession](https://preview.redd.it/wdrp0i1ec0x81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c1abbf5a3effd16fca362fc109443e055ae0c4)\n\nHypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2%\n\nWelcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : \"Million Dollar Advise\"\n\nLets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GDP negative  print vs Stock Market crash](https://preview.redd.it/4z2uis46d0x81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4f8de83709aef26c240cf187fe5acce0fb3a957)\n\nThis chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no\u2019s are going to be positive or negative. \n\n\\- If we are going to get positive no\u2019s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. \n\n\\- if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. \n\nSo you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% & -40% and cancel the noise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed**\n\nWe have talked about this in \u201c Credit risk america \u201c post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. \n\nAs for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Terminal Rate](https://preview.redd.it/ood4lc70e0x81.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=596d6e54b6360f23d350f75fd52a0489bb19452f)\n\nRemember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q3 : How much lower will stocks go?**\n\nWell, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top.\n\n( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q4 : What is coming \"Short Recession\", \"Stagflation\", \"Depression\" ?**\n\nFirst will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity.\n\nNow we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity?**\n\nFor this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works.\n\nRemember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs, and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers.\n\nThen analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion. ( These charts are by the author of Capital Wars, who is considered the father of liquidity )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[60 months bond market theory](https://preview.redd.it/e9u4hmoff0x81.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd70903c45482e683792b8599c8a560aa15c9a6b)\n\n[We are currently in turbulence](https://preview.redd.it/ip26rpoff0x81.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e86b69ad5adaa395b8e6d63fa2daf1cf864633f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it? This shall be your H.W.\n\nQ6 : What's up with Forex market ? \n\nEspecially japan and euro.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g](https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g)\n\nRemember : Dollar is strengthening, meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro, well, wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\nSorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo, who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating, but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity.\n\nRegards\n\nUchiha", "id": "ugjxqp", "created_utc": 1651475555.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. \"$30 is $30\", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard.

Physically own outright residential properties?  (If so, to rent out, or as an investment?)\n\n\n\n3.  Someone made a comment about BLK might want to liquidate real estate holdings.\n\n3b.  This only would be possible if they own individual properties outright which are unoccupied, (and/or foreclosed homes part of MBS they own for their own books, or also for ones they manage but no longer own?)\n\n\n\n\n4.  If they administered the creation of MBS securities and sold them all, though they may be the trustee, it\u2019s not their loss or problem if the things default, right?\n\n\n\nThanks for insight from learned apes!", "id": "ugs0d9", "created_utc": 1651504821.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|298|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ugs0d9)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ugs0d9)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.019355598837137222}, {"body": "Black rock is the Bear stearns of 2008. \n\nMBS is issued by entities that are backed by the government like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nGoldman Sachs (I think) was the one who created the system to where you can \u201cbet\u201d on the MBS.
