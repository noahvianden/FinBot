{"title": "Is there any reason to play a Long Call/Put Condor vs a normal Iron Condor?", "selftext": "Hello guys, I recently found the long call/put condor strategy, which is a condor strat similar to an iron condor but instead of getting premium upfront, you will pay a debit to open the strategy. To close it for profit, you would receive money instead of buying it back for cheaper on the regular iron condor. \nIt seems like they have similar profits and losses, so is there a reason to choose one or other?\n\nI tested it on tsla Feb11 975, 1000, 1050, 1075\n\nIron condor: max loss 377, max profit 2123\n\nLong call condor: max loss 384, max profit 2116\n\nLong put condor: max loss 328, max profit 2172 \n\nBreakevens only a few cents different for each. \n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Turns out its just a spread out butterfly strategy, but there\u2019s early assignment risk in the itm side.", "id": "rzqc3x", "created_utc": 1641730079.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "They are the same trade from what I can tell as well.  The only thing I can tell on the surface is that the long call/put condor would put you at risk of early assignment since you are selling ITM vs. OTM calls on one side of the trade while the Iron Condor, both calls and puts are ideally OTM.  My thinking would be to use these if you have more of a directional bias and wanted to cast a wider profit zone than using a butterfly, which using the same wing width costs almost 2.5x as much.  However, the butterfly allows you to make almost 2.5x as much if you are correct as well, so there's that trade off too.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "though, just so it is said early assignment isn't a risk with debit spreads.

I also wanted to point out your comment below may not be entirely accurate where you are discussing the differences between max gain and max loss.  On a short option you reach max profit regardless if you get assigned/exercised or not, because you automatically keep all of the credit.  \n\nLet's take two scenarios on ABCXYZ.  If I bought a $95 call last week for this week's expiry for $2.00 and sold a $100 call for $0.50, my max risk is $150.  IF ABCXYZ is trading at $101 and I get exercised, I get exercised on my $100 call, and for simplicity, let's say it is trading at $1.50 (0.10/day in extrinsic left).  Even though I was technically down $1.00 on the call, I now keep all of that $0.50 I wrote initially.  My long $95 is now worth $6 intrinsic + let's say $0.25 extrinsic, so $6.25.  I can sell this call for $6.25 + $0.50 I already received for a profit of $675 and use that to buffer my short position as a stop loss, just close the short position ASAP, or use the money received to buy a further OTM call as a protective leg if I think ABCXYZ may have a bearish outlook in the nearer future and keep the shares short.  \n\nA bull put spread of say $95/90 with the same criteria is opened for a $1.50 credit.  I received $2.00 in credit for the $95 and paid $0.50 for the $90, with a max risk of $3.50.  Let's say ABCXYZ is trading at $94 and I get assigned shares at $95.  I now keep all of that premium and can keep the $90 put as protection.  Further, if the share price falls further, I can sell the put for some appreciation, and make even more money after selling my shares provided the $90 still has some extrinsic value left.  \n\nIn both these scenarios I make profit on the short leg and the long leg is left to its own devices to do with it what I want.  In the debit scenario it absolutely makes sense to sell it and close out your short share position.  In the credit scenario, it probably makes sense to hold onto the long put as protection until expiry in case there is a price rebound you can take advantage of to sell the shares for a further profit.  Especially considering you have a cost basis of $93.50, and can theoretically sell your shares for a book-keeping profit due to the premium received in the same way you make money on The Wheel even though your avg. share price is still technically your assignment price.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35054659843444824}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17303812503814697}, {"body": "Put and call spreads for the same series options are synthetically equivalent so if you're concerned about early assignment when putting on an ITM spread, put on the synthetic OTM spread.

My point being... that I'm not the one to give advises. But today morning was one of those times where I woke up around 5 AM, was fully awake and knew I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. After scrolling through this sub for a few minutes, I suddenly had an urge to review my entire career in investing.\n\nNow, I have a feeling that many of you who are much more practical than me have already been doing this. But for those like me who haven't done this yet, I strongly recommend trying this activity!\n\nFrom the summer of 2016, where I made the first trade of my life (bought FB at 107), I recorded every single trade including dates, purchase/sell prices, and left specific comments about what I've learnt from investing in that company. It wasn't fun to begin with - going through all the statements and manually inputting them into excel; but it was fun at the end and I got a lot out of it. \n\nYou get to see how you evolve as an investor (and as a person). Back in 2016 I was happy with returns of couple hundred bucks from companies like MSFT and AMZN lol (imagine if I held strong until today). Later on I got to see few companies that I tried swing trading, where I obviously lost money, then I could see that I stopped doing swing/day trading at all. It was good to see that I learn from my mistakes! You also get to test your ability to forecast company's futures. I got to see a couple growth companies that I bet on actually thrive: like SQ, AMD (any of you remember how pessimistic the views were when AMD fell all the way down to $16 from being overvalued at $30?), and I also saw few other growth companies that I was wrong with. It gets very insightful to remember why I was so hopeful of a company, and to actually find out why the company failed years after.\n\nThere are so many other little things that you see and learn from, but I think this post will get too long to write them all. At the end of the day, I strongly recommend giving this a try because not only did I learn a lot from it, but it was also fun looking back at younger myself, which a lot of us forget to do while living a busy day-to-day life.\n\nHappy new years to you all, and happy investing in 2022!", "id": "rzvhji", "created_utc": 1641746181.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "me looking back at my past trades: \"why the fuck did i do that!!!?\"", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4135856628417969}, {"body": "I've been investing since 2016 and I agree with your post. \n\nOne thing you inspired me to do is make notes on why I made certain trades.
