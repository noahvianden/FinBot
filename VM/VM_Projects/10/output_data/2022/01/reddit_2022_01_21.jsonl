{"title": "[Gann Theory]There be any cycle in the stock market? US market crash every 7 years?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n \n\nAbsolutely, the answer is yes, but we can't apply a simple and fixed model to all stock markets. Each stock market is an independent viberation with its own cycle and development laws. Therefore, the cycle and law of the stock market will be introduced before presenting the text of this book.\n\nSince the 1900's, economists in western countries have engaged in the study the law of the cycle, and all believed that there was a long-term law in the economic growth or recession. There is noting new thing under the sun.\n\nIn 1930, the American economist S. Kuznets proposed a business cycle applying to housing construction, with an average length of 20 years. This long-term cycle is known as the \"Kuznets\" cycle, or building cycle. C Juglar, a French economist, published his Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In this book, he pointed out that the capitalist economy fluctuated every nine to ten years, as generally called \"Juglar cycle\". Joseph Schumpeter took this as the \"medium-term cycle\", or the \"Juglar cycle\".\n\nEdward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that the most statistically reliable cycles were 9.2 years and 3.83 years. He was also the founder of many institutions studying the cycles. Edward R. Dewey (1895-1978) dedicated his life to study the cycles (not limited to the business cycle) and in 1931, he was appointed as the Chief Economic Analyst by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Trying to find the cause of the Great Depression in 1929 and 1930 in the United States, Edward R. Dewey established the Foundation for the Study of Cycles in Pittsburgh in 1940. The following are some graphs about the cycles proposed by Edward.\n\nBusiness cycles can be categorized into long-term, medium-term and short-term ones. You may ask, is there any business cycle in the stock market or the economy? Let's begin with the stock market cycle and then we will talk about the real estate cycle.\n\nThe 30-year cycle is one of the cores of Gann's cycle theory. When making a prediction, the 30-year cycle can be divided in further, including the following different cycles.\n\n\u2022 30-year cycle\n\n\u2022 22.5-year cycle - (360 X6/8)\n\n\u2022 15-year cycle - (360X4/8)\n\n\u2022 10-year cycle - (360X1/3)\n\n\u2022 7.5-year cycle - (360X2/8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2ztf65vk0d81.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=77fbbf8a587ff21163496364dbdce5d991fa2dc4\n\nIf this 30-year cycle is applied to calculate the stock market cycle, you will get an amazing discovery . For example, Hong Kong's stock market crash in 1987 followed with another one 7.5 years later, namely in 1994, because of the upsurge of red chip speculation by foreign investors in 1993 and the United States' increase of the interest rates for 7 successive times. 15 years later, around the year of 2002 and 2003, the stock market underwent a huge decline because of the outbreak of avian influenza. In 2009, namely 22.5 years after that, HSI hit the bottom as a consequence of the financial tsunami. When it came to 2017, exactly 30 years later, HSI witnessed a depreciation in 2018 after experiencing the bull market.\n\nWhen the 30-year cycle is applied to Shanghai securities composite index, there will also come something incredible. As shown in the chart below, the first peak after the establishment of Shanghai Stock Exchange occurred in May 1992. Following Gann's 30-year cycle, another peak appeared in the half of 1999, exactly 7.5 years later. 15 years later, the year of 2007 witnessed the climax of the bull market. After 22.5 years, the year of 2014 marked the starting point of the bull market in 2015. It is thought that the year of 2022, 30 years later, will be another high or low point.\n\nJust as the old chinese sayings go that \"both people and things undergo great changes in a decade\", \"gold may become worthless in a decade\" and \"we cannot predict what will happen in a decade and don't laugh at poor people wearing rags\". These sayings point out the essence of the 10-year cycle. Juglar proposed that there was a 9 to 10 years' cyclical fluctuation for the market economy in his book Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In Business Prophecies of the Future Ups and Downs in Prices, Samuel T Benner stated that the highest point of trade price followed a repeated 8-9-10-year pattern. The 10-year cycle also plays an important role in Gann Theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54k4o1yvk0d81.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fff4f37895ba53272c0f69b48759a5e4f50bbde\n\nShanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 120 Months\n\nTake Shanghai securities composite index as an example. After reaching a low point of 998 in 2005, the high point of the bull market appeared in 2015, 120 months (ten years) later. After the low point of 1,664 in October 2008, another lowest point came in 2018, 121 months later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36gzwlkwk0d81.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d39b1edccdb868c57d64b6c2e92b3974c44a6da\n\nShanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 52 Weeks\n\nThe above chart shows that the Shanghai securities composite index also subjects itself to a 52-week cycle. In the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index, the time interval between the peak in October 2007 and the low point is 52 weeks. After that, there will be return in every 52 weeks, either the peak or the bottoming out of the market index.\n\nLet's see the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index and take \"7\" weeks as a cycle. It is found that from the high point of 2015, there is a relative turn in a cycle of 7 weeks or its multiples, namely 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70.\n\nIs this a coincidence or an accident for the above change in the stock market?\n\nNow, one question. Whether the movement in the stock market is driven by events or the high and low points at the previous time point (cycle)? Therefore, China's stock market proceeds in a cyclical way. The turning point can be predicted as long as the right starting point can be realized.\n\nThere is also a cycle for real estate. Although economists all over the world hold different opinions towards the research of the real estate market, but they serve the same effect. I will state the opinions of the following economists for your reference.\n\n\u00b7Michael Hoyt, the author of One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, studied the price of real estate in Chicago in a time period of 103 years since there were only dozens of wooden houses, and he found that its price cycles about every 18 years.\n\n\u00b7Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that each real estate cycle lasts for about 18 years.\n\n\u00b7Fred Harrison, a British economist studying the real estate market in the Britain and United States in the past 200-plus years, found that the housing price cycled about every 18 years.\n\n\u00b7Simon Smith Kuznets believed that the building cycle is 15 to 20 years.\n\nIt is coincidentally acknowledged that the real estate market cycles every 18 to 20 years. Starting from 1965, it is generally believed that the real estate market in Hong Kong has gone through three major cycles, the first cycle from 1965 to 1981; the second one from 1981 to 1997; and the third one from 1997 to now. The housing price often goes up or down along with the change of both internal and external elements.\n\nI have mentioned the Hong Kong real estate market cycle in different situations. It is not difficult to draw a conclusion from the cycle of Hong Kong's real estate market that the cycle works every six years. Since 1997, great changes occur every six years, including 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021. With Gann's 50% segmentation method, we can get that three years constitute a secondary cycle, namely in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.\n\nThe change of the real estate market can also be concluded with the 18-year cycle, which has worked since 1985. Undoubtedly, the real estate market in Hong Kong goes up after experiencing the lowest point in 2003. Predicably, that the year of 2021 is likely to witness the completion of an 18-year cycle. Stepping back again, the rise of the real estate market in 2003 can be explained with the 6-year cycle mentioned above since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1985.\n\nIt is likely that the upsurge of Hong Kong's real estate market will end in 2021, and then we should turn to the turning point that may appear from 2023 to 2024.\n\nThe economic cycle of U.S. stocks has a very obvious 7-year cycle.\n\n\\-In 1966, the United States experienced a \"credit crunch\". In August of the same year, the U.S. Treasury market suffered a severe \"liquidity crisis.\n\n\\-In 1973, seven years later, the world suffered the \"first oil crisis\", with stock market and economic problems and the first stagflation.\n\n\\-Seven years later, in 1980, Wall Street forced the Hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver , which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy.\n\n\\-In October 1987, the Dow fell 22% in one day on \"Black Monday\".\n\n\\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, and interest rates rose sharply from 3% to 6%, resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history.\n\n\\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan event of 9/11 triggered a severe setback in the global stock market, and the U.S. declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14, but the market resumed on the 17th, the U.S. stocks still had a panic sale, the S&P 500 index opened at 1,092 points and closed almost at the low of 1,038 points, down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed to 8,883 points, down 7%, and the stock market fell 14% in one week.\n\nThe 7-year cycle came to 2008, the financial tsunami, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks plunged.\n\n\\-In 2015, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks crash.\n\n\\-2022:?\n\nI would predict that in 2022, there may be a significant pullback in US stocks.", "id": "s97dlx", "created_utc": 1642759175.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Do economists not count Mid Feb and March 2020 as a market crash or what?

Shares of Netflix (NFLX) fell roughly 23% lower after the company posted a disappointing subscriber growth numbers, with the company projecting 2.5 million new users for the first quarter of 2022 versus the 6.3 million anticipated, according to Bloomberg data. Shares of Disney (DIS) and Roku (ROKU) fell in sympathy.\n\nMeanwhile, Peloton (PTON) stock has fallen below its IPO price after the company after the company announced it was cutting production of its product, citing waning demand. \n\nMark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said \u201cIt is hese infamous stay-at-home plays ... that had been bid up to valuations that get to the point where they're priced for perfection. Anything that is released about the companies' investment results or prospects that doesn't meet or exceed very elevated expectations leads to gigantic disappointment in the form of a share price decline.\u201d\n\nRecent market volatility can be attributed to the multidecade jump in consumer and producer prices reported last week, which served as a reminder that inflation remains the key driver of risk and uncertainty in the year ahead. \n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 7% in December compared to a year ago, the fastest pace of increase since 1982 and the eighth straight month in which inflation exceeded 5%. Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, core CPI rose 5.5%, the most since 1991.\n\nLike last year, inflation in the prices of goods played a large part in the jump. For example, prices of used cars and trucks soared 37%, and furniture prices rose 14% from a year ago. While pandemic-related supply-and-demand imbalances continue to drive prices for durable goods higher, services inflation is also strengthening but to a lesser extent, rising 3.7% in December. \n\nOn the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nThe extent to the rise in prices caused the Fed to pivot to a more hawkish stance, with policy suggesting the Central Bank stance is shifting from supporting the economy and the labor market to combating ongoing inflation. With higher prices persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. \n\nJeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, said \u201cI think there is a rotation going on towards those areas of the market that have been neglected for a long time \u2014 not just months, but years. Areas like financials and energy. Even health care, which is an area that had done a bit better during the pandemic really isn't seeing any kind of multiples as it did in the past. I think those areas of the market have more durability here as we look at an environment where earnings growth is slowing so valuations matter more,\" he added. \"And many of these companies can look to generate earnings growth in this environment of rising interest rates and commodity prices, whereas tech is a bit more challenged as goods demand begins to slow.\"\n\nA gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased solidly in December, suggesting the expansion would continue despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipated interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve to tame high inflation. \n\nThe Conference Board's closely watched[ Leading Economic Index (LEI) ](https://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=1)rose 0.8% in December, matching consensus estimates, according to Bloomberg data. This picked up from November's 0.7% clip, which was downwardly revised from the 1.1% gain previously reported. \n\nAtaman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at the Conference Board, said \u201cThe U.S. LEI ended 2021 on a rising trajectory, suggesting the economy will continue to expand well into the spring. For the first quarter, headwinds from the Omicron variant, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures\u2014as well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s expected interest rate hikes\u2014may moderate economic growth. The Conference Board forecasts GDP growth for Q1 2022 to slow to a relatively healthy 2.2 percent (annualized). Still, for all of 2022, we forecast the US economy will expand by a robust 3.5 percent\u2014well above the pre-pandemic trend growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cA gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.\u201d - Seneca", "id": "s9l0rk", "created_utc": 1642799370.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Damn someone really must\u2019ve hated the new season of Ozark", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07489583641290665}, {"body": "The major indices are down to where they were last summer--that's not a particularly big hit yet.

Are we headed for a more serious correction / market crash? I think so. The 10 year treasury yield is at a multi-year high. Inflation is going gangbusters.  Russia is on the brink of war with Ukraine. Omicron has left the healthcare system on the verge of collapse. Netflix, an established blue chip stock lost 20% today alone. This is not an anomaly, it\u00a0is a sign of things to come.\n\nProvided we are in for a red 2022, what could be better than shorting the whole market? Shorting the shittiest part of the market. Let me introduce you to the Russel 2000 index, much like Cathy Wood's ARK ETFs, the Russel is full of shitty small cap stocks which this community salivates over due to their \"high growth potential\". We all know its the Microsofts and Apples of the world making the real money, most of the companies on the Russell are dogshit, who are we kidding?\n\nAs you can see from this chart, the Russell has been as flat as Brie Larson for the majority of 2021. Even under good market conditions the Russell was struggling, yielding -6% in the past year compared to SPY +16%. So who will get hit the hardest by the crash that is unfolding? The shitty growth companies in the Russell 2000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pgsr3sz3sxc81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a4072100453d3e116826a03c3ed9c58656e702\n\n Lets talk about stage analysis. It's so simple an ape can figure it out. Stage 1: stonk is flat. Stage 2: stonk goes up. Stage 3: Stonk tops out. Stage 4: Stonk goes down. Can you guess what stage the Russell is in right now? You guessed it. It's a classic stage 4 decline. That purple line is the only crayon that really matters at the end of the day, the 200 day moving average. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbec7wfwsxc81.jpg?width=490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=794ca160a70fbc311e8808a60f4ad631c1822611\n\nEnter SRTY. It's a triple-leveraged inverse ETF of the Russell 2000. Triple leveraged funds definitely have their faults, the volatility can eat into your gains and there are a lot of fees associated or whatever. But I think the correction in the coming months/years will be one-sided enough to be worth using leverage. If you're a gigantic pussy baby you can use RWM which is the un-leveraged equivalent of this.\n\nHowever you feel about the market overall, you have to admit the Russell is shit, and I expect it to dump especially hard in the coming months/year. \n\nI do not have a price target, I intend to get out if the Russell makes a significant move back above its 200 day MA and into its 2021 consolidation area, otherwise I'll just let it ride, and I'm not too worried.\n\nI should preface that I have a terrible track record financially, I lost over 50% last year, most of which was from bagholding MVIS. But I used this same stage analysis to get out of that at $11.50 and now it's at $3.50, so there's that. \n\nSo there you have it, get SRTY. \n\nPosition: 500 shares of SRTY and I plan on buying another 1000 once my settled funds become available in my non-margin accounts (I have had multiple good faith violations)", "id": "s8xq9v", "created_utc": 1642726365.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "So this mean stonks go up or down", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Down \ud83d\udc3b", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "News says sell so i will buy \ud83d\ude01", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Just be careful out there ape", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16959057748317719}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26972395181655884}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2579679489135742}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23658396303653717}, {"body": "The daily candle on 1/12 looks ominous!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Idgaf about daily action, this is a long play", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Cya later alligator!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10996328294277191}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2141963243484497}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2156291902065277}, {"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|57|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|932|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6feuq/message_in_a_bottle_gme_to_4300/) \n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=s8xq9v)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=s8xq9v)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2853183150291443}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sign of?

{"title": "Value Buying and War Profiteering with this Intel INTC bull(shit)ish DD", "selftext": "Let's start of with the basics and normie shit.\n\nIntel has been getting curbstomped by Semi-conductor industry darlings AMD and NVidia. Apple has moved away from Intel with their new M1 cpus and INTC looks poised for rough times ahead.\n\nBut, the market may be overreacting as Intel's stock price is suffering so badly that it's P/E ratio is sitting at a mere 9.09 despite the Semi-conductor industry's average P/E of over 30, making it potentially severely undervalued. Especially since Intel remains an industry giant and has also recently stepped foot into the GPU industry. [More excitingly](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-looks-undervalued-poised-142150105.html), intel is planning on taking Mobileye, a market leader in driving assistance and self-driving cars (comparable and competitive with Tesla), public, with Intel intending to retain a majority stake. So perhaps the future is not so dark.\n\n[Grabbing Pat Gelsinger at the beginning of 2021](https://apnews.com/article/pat-gelsinger-bob-swan-1e72be04fdc13cb86ae3a05784fdf2c3) was also a great move as he is one of the best CEOs America has to offer, fit to lead Intel into a new age.\n\n**So far so boring. Okay so INTC may be a value buy. whatever, value is for shitters.**\n\n**WELL HERE COMES THE SHITPOST DD. IF YOU GET OFFENDED BY SOME OF THE POTENTIALLY POLITICAL SHIT IN THE FOLLOWING SHIT DD YOU DON'T HAVE THE GRINDSET, THE POLITICS ARE TANGENTIAL, THE GAINS ARE OUR GOAL.**\n\nA fact that many investors fail to consider is that INTC is actually an industry rarity. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple are all ***FAB-less***, meaning they outsource their production to semi-conductor Foundry giants, with the majority utilizing **TSMC** (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing). Intel on the other hand fabricates their own chips, and are in fact **investing $20 billion** on explanding their production by constructing [new chip factories in Arizona](https://www.itpro.co.uk/hardware/components/361015/intel-begins-construction-of-two-new-chip-factories-in-arizona).\n\nSo what?\n\n**Think South China Sea, Supply Chain issues, America vs China trade-war Import taxes and the China - Taiwan One China Fiasco.**\n\nWe've already seen the amount of damage supply chains can do to industries, and the Semi-conductor industry is no different. With the majority of tech companies previously mentioned not having in-house Foundries to fabricate semi-conductors, should any damage/issues arise for **TSMC** the **BIGGEST FOUNDRY** in the world, massive costs will be incurred on everyone of these companies.\n\n**Imagine for a second that the American Chinese cold war (that we all know is happening) escalates into a conflict in the South China Sea.** Supply Chains from TSMC will be completely severred or atleast severely impacted, meaning that a targetted supply chain issue will begin to occur in the world, negatively impacting ONLY **FAB-LESS** semi-conductor companies. An issue that Intel does not suffer from.\n\n**Now imagine for a second, another scenario in which China does take over Taiwan.** (Yes, shit idea I know.) It is HIGHLY likely that America will impose heavy trade bans/import taxes on China as a way of economic retaliation (We've seen this already, and other shit like the death of Huawei's overseas presence). Importing from **TSMC** becomes unprofitable or nigh-on impossible. China may also limit exports from key companies as a way of retaliation as well. Overall, the situation because much more difficult for **Foundry-less** companies. AND as a side-effect, Intel becomes an American Industry Patriotic Figurehead and receives Government funding, turning around its downtrend and **SKYROCKETING** to market leader territory, perhaps even becoming an international **Foundry** Giant, filling in the void left by TSMC's departure.\n\nNASDAQ:INTC TO THE FUCKING MOON (Riding on the back of a cruise missile)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**INTC** is potentially undervalued, but that's not the point. The point is that China and America are going to war, and it's going to shatter the Taiwanese Semi-conductor supply chain that Fab-less Semiconductor companies rely on. INTC has local and American foundries, therefore it will not be affected, allowing it to boom should conflict arise. War profiteering has never been easier.\n\n(Please don't be offended at the THOUGHT that China might take over Taiwan, this is a THEORY and I DON'T SUPPORT IT, BUT IT MIGHT HAPPEN.)", "id": "s93p1f", "created_utc": 1642744324.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m HEAVY in Intel.
