I've sold some calls and closed at gains and my cost basis (internally in my head) is now closer to $58 and the contract is trading at $55ish.\n\nMy question is this... If I feel \"fairly confident\" that AAPL won't end this year up over 15% (roughly $199 price area), would it make sense to sell a longer dated Call (let's say September 2022  200 for $6.9) and take that $1,380 and use it for something else (knowing full well I'm capping my AAPL gains).\n\nRisk with selling monthlies to me...

A 1 week short call and an 8 month short call end up the same way, with a loss on the long call (your scenario #1).\n\nIn any case, I agree with the other critiques in the thread. Going out more than 60 days on the short call is just dumb. The additional reward doesn't compensate for the much larger additional risks.\n\nI categorize PMCC traders into roughly two groups.\n\nGroup A is primarily interested in discounting the cost of the long call and gains on the long call are the priority. Whether the short call makes money is less important than the short call being a hedge and preserving gains on the long call.\n\nGroup B is primarily interested in the income generated by rolling the short leg. The long call is just a cost of doing business and whether it gains or loses isn't important, as long as it doesn't lose too much.\n\nYou sound like you are in Group A, which means you ought to be trying harder to prevent the short call from taking gains away from the long call, like by going ITM and getting assigned.

I mean, you\u2019re saying we have to wait two years for the 17% ROTCE, despite the booming economy. You\u2019re guiding for the second year in a row of negative operating leverage. I get it. That\u2019s not how you run the company. But $15 billion of investments, that\u2019s up one-half over last three years. And that $15 billion is enough to capitalize the 11th largest U.S. bank. So, you gave us that, but you didn\u2019t tell us what to expect from all those investments in terms of what specific market share gains are you targeting, what specific revenues do you expect, when do you expect that? Can you put some more meat on the bone here because this is -- at $5 billion of investment spend, look, it worked. You gained share. At $10 billion of investment spend, it worked. You gained share. But now you\u2019re going to $15 billion. It might not always work so well. So, can you, again, put more meat on the bones? The stock is down 5%. The feedback so far is like you\u2019re spending the rate hikes for investments over the next 10 years. That\u2019s great. You\u2019re in there for the long term, but a lot of the investors aren\u2019t planning to invest for a 10-year horizon.\n\n**Jamie Dimon**\n\n> Michael, I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023, we\u2019ll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital. It depends on fixed income markets. It depends on a bunch of stuff like that. But every -- but the 400 branches that we\u2019re building, those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousand bankers we\u2019re adding in private banking, and Chase Wealth Management, we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019ll get to breakeven but just we expect that takes a couple of years.\n> And so yes, we can\u2019t -- we\u2019re not going to tell you all of those things. And we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it, and there\u2019s a little bit of bubble expense in that.

{"title": "My first (concise) stock analysis, looking for feedback - AMC Networks (AMCX)", "selftext": " \n\nI've owned some individual stocks in the past alongside my ETFs but decided to get rid of them and do proper research on a stock before investing in it (as you should, obviously). I decided to look into AMCX since its ratios seemed very good.\n\n**TLDR**  \nAMC Networks gets most of its revenue from cable networks. It is however focusing on expanding its targeted streaming segments which can be their competitive advantage compared to Netflix and Amazon. They've grown their streaming subscribers by rougly 150% in the period of Q2 2020 - Q4 2021. Assuming they grow their total streaming subscribers from (an estimated) 8.5 million as of Q4 2021 to 17.5 million in 2025 and, in this time period, earnings from cable networks decline by 5% per year, they would have total earnings in 2025 of $410 million. Given a 10x earnings multiple and a required rate of return of 17.5% per year, the fair value is $44.9 per share vs the current price of $42.2.\n\n**Business overview**  \nBecause AMC Networks doesn't disclose these numbers I could only make rough estimates. I did still feel like it was important to do so, to get a better understanding of where their revenue comes from.\n\n* Cable networks: 50% of revenue\n\nTheir major source of revenue (and earnings) is cable networks, mostly spread around North America. These include AMC, IFC, WE tv and Sundance TV. AMC had 84 million subscribers in the US as of December 31st 2020.\n\n* Original content: 20% of revenue\n\nThis segment goes hand in hand with both other segments that AMC Networks operates in. AMC Networks has created some major hits such as Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead franchise. Currently shows such as Better Call Saul and Kevin Can F\\*\\*k Himself are some of the big names. This content is available through their cable networks and streaming services, as well as through other parties who own licenses.\n\n* Streaming services: 15% of revenue\n\nStreaming services account for roughly 15% of revenue. Their goal for the end of 2021 was to hit 9 million subscribers and in their latest 10Q, published on November 5th, they mentioned being 'on track' to hitting that goal.\n\n* Others (mostly international): 15% of revenue\n\nThis mainly includes the previously mentioned segments being marketed internationally. Again, because of the way they report their financials it's hard to tell how much revenue is made per segment, but this leftover 15% of revenue can pretty much be distributed to the previously named segments.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nIn their strategy there are three main focus points:\n\n* Focusing on targeted streaming segments\n\nAMC Networks has made it very clear that they don't try to compete with say Netflix or Amazon Prime, who are focused on the broad streaming market. AMC Networks simply does not have the resources to battle these parties. Since streaming has become so popular during the pandemic, they believe that customers will look for more specific segments of streaming, rather than a service like Netflix who does not have a specific focus. AMC Networks own streaming services that are targeted at specific segments such as British mystery, Horror and content dedicated to Black audiences. Their recent acquisition of Sentai Holdings, who also owns anime streaming service HIDIVE, is a great addition to this strategy. Albeit a relatively small one, with the company having an estimated revenue of $20 million.\n\n* Streaming as a bigger portion of revenue\n\nWith their focus on streaming segments also comes the goal of making streaming services a bigger portion of their revenue. As mentioned before, they said to be on track to hit 9 million subscribers by the end of 2021. They have also said that their goal (and expectation) is to hit 20 - 25 million subscribers on all streaming services combined. Again, finding exact numbers is hard, but in their Q2 2020 earnings call they mentioned 'being very comfortable' in that they would hit 3.5 - 4 million streaming subscribers by the end of 2020. Assuming they grew streaming subscribers by roughly 100% or 4 - 5 million subscribers in that time period, the goal to have 20 - 25 million streaming subsribers by 2025 seems reasonable. It is important to remember that the pandemic accelerated this growth and will possibly slow down as time goes on. However, on their Q3 2021 earnings call they did mention having a lower churn rate than competitors such as Netflix.\n\n* Producing more IP/original content and keeping this content exclusive\n\nAMC Networks has mentioned having a lot of original content in the making, stating that \"2022 will be the biggest year for content in the Company's history\". Additionally, they mentioned in their 2021 10K that they want to keep the rights to this content more so than in the post. They also said that they will not extent certain licensing deals with other parties, thus making the content more exclusive to their own platforms.\n\n**Fair value**\n\nBefore going into this I want to mention that I'm a complete novice at investing and, especially in the case of coming up with a fair value, I want to repeat that this is just my thesis, which probably contains a lot of errors.\n\nIf AMC Networks manages to reach 17.5 million subscribers on all streaming services combined by 2025 (which would be short of their goal of 20 - 25 million) and realizes a 9% net margin, this would roughly equate to ( 17 500 000 x $55 x 9% =) $86 million in earnings. If we expect earnings from their cable networks of roughly $420 million to decline by 5% a year it would equate to $324 million by 2025. This would make for total earnings of $410 million. Considering they have a substantial amount of long-term debt ($2.9 billion) I decided to apply a 10x earnings multiple and a required rate of return of 17.5%, which I believe to be pretty conservative. This would equate to a current fair value of $44.9 per share for a return of 17.5% per year. It's currently trading at $42.2 per share after it has recently gone up almost 30%.\n\nI'm looking to open a small position in this stock and add more if the stock price declines. As mentioned they have unfortunately seen a big rise in stock price whilst I was researching the stock, but it wouldn't be a bad thing either to wait it out for a bit and read their 2021 10K before opening a big position.\n\nI enjoyed the proces of researching a stock a lot and hope that you can give me some feedback!
