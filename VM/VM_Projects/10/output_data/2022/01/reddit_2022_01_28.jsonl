Take some time away from the screens, and spend time with loved ones.\n\n*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP:\n\n* V: Will look for more upside if it can hold over the 213 level after market open. Could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down.\n* AAPL: Potential premarket support at \\~ 163. Will look for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. Room for upside if we see strength, but we'll see how the market looks closer to open.\u00a0\n* TEAM: Potential support level at \\~310, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down.\u00a0\n* CLFD: Potential support level around \\~53. Will watch for more upside if it holds up, could get choppy if it breaks down.\u00a0\n* UVXY: Will look to trade this if the overall weakness continues. SPY in particular.\u00a0\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* CVX: Potential premarket support at \\~129.50. Other relevant support levels at 128 and 124. Will look for shorting opportunities.\u00a0\n* TSLA: Potential premarket support at 815, will look to short on the breakdown. Room for upside if it can hold up over support. Resistance levels at 830 and 840.\u00a0\n* XPEV: Will be looking for a retrace to support just under 30. Could see a bounce after reaching a premarket low of 30.60 though.\u00a0\n* COIN: Potential premarket support just above 165. Will watch for further crypto weakness, could provide shorting opportunities on a breakdown.\u00a0\n* AMD: Potential support level at 100. Will look for shorting opportunities if it breaks down. Other relevant support levels at 95 and 90.\u00a0\n* SQ: Potential support level around 102, could provide shorting opportunities on a breakdown. Room for movement to the upside if it can hold over support.\u00a0\n* WDC: Will look for possible ORB setup to upside, but we'll see what things look like closer to open. Premarket low of 47.40, could provide shorting opportunities towards 45.50 level from yesterday after hours if it breaks down.\n* KR: Potential resistance level at 44, will look for shorting opportunities if it fails to break over resistance.\u00a0\n* HOOD: Yikes.\n\n**Momentum Watchlist:**\n\n* PRVB: Potential premarket support at 3.80, with resistance at 4. Won't be too interested in trading if it breaks down below support and cannot recover.\u00a0\n\nNot much looking great for the momentum list at the moment, could be worth running the scanner a few times leading up to market open.\u00a0\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks\u00a0are looking to open lower this morning to conclude a volatile week. The more recent hawkish narrative from the Fed continues to weigh on the market, and lofty valuations are continuing to come down. While we know the Fed is looking at a possible first rate increase in March, there is still uncertainty regarding how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates. This lack of clarity seems to be spooking some investors. AAPL and V are each seeing strength after reporting strong earnings, it will be interesting to see if that strength continues or fades this morning. If AAPL turns over, it could drag the rest of the market even further. I'm expecting more weakness today, we'll see how things look closer to market open.\u00a0\n\nS&P Futures are down \\~80 basis points, Dow Futures\u00a0are down \\~80 basis points, and Nasdaq Futures are down \\~60 basis points. Gold\u00a0and silver are trading slightly lower, continuing the slide from Wednesday and Thursday. Crude oil\u00a0is seeing continued strength, and will likely approach the $90 level in the near future. Energy stocks are looking to continue their recent strength. Tech stocks are mixed after the recent weakness. With QQQ hovering around a key support level, things could get choppy if we see more weakness today. Chinese stocks are mixed in premarket trading. EV makers are seeing considerable weakness, notably XPEV and NIO. Airlines and cruise stocks\u00a0are down in premarket trading, although they have come off their premarket lows. If we don't see a strong bounce off support levels sometime in the next few days, they could be in for more weakness.\u00a0\n\nThe crypto market is trading relatively flat this morning, attempting to find support at these lower levels. We could be in for more choppiness, especially if the overall market continues to show weakness and people continue to dump their \"speculative\" assets. Bitcoin is\u00a0currently trading around 36,900. I'll be watching the \\~37,560 level as potential resistance, with potential support at \\~35,500. Ethereum is trading a bit over 2,400. Crypto-related stocks\u00a0are up a bit in premarket trading, albeit somewhat mixed.\n\nRemember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter.

They'd find ways of getting access to news stories before they go public, or worse, completely fabricate stories and leak them to the press, then get into positions that make them money as the retail investors flood in, and use options or short selling to make money as the stock plummets when everyone discovers the stories were exaggerated or fake. They rig the market by manufacturing volatility, then profiting off that volatility. **What's the moral of the story?** \"Big money\" sells at the top (latest example Nov/Dec 2021) so if you sell during this market downturn (Jan 2022) **you are allowing big money to buy back your stocks at bargain prices!

Here are the numbers: \n\n* **EPS**: $2.10 vs. $1.89 estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **Revenue**: $123.9 billion vs. $118.66 billion estimated, up 11% year-over-year\n* **Quarterly Profit**: $34.6 billion \n* **iPhone revenue**: $71.63 billion vs. $68.34 billion estimated, up 9% year-over-year\n* **Services revenue**: $19.52 billion vs. $18.61 billion estimated, up 24% year-over-year\n* **Other Products revenue**: $14.70 billion vs. $14.59 billion estimated, up 13% year-over-year\n* **Mac revenue**: $10.85 billion vs. $9.52 billion estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **iPad revenue**: $7.25 billion vs. $8.18 billion estimated, down 14% year-over-year\n* **Gross margin**: 43.8% vs. 41.7% estimated\n\nDuring a call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said the company, \u201cexperienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter\u201d, but he declined to give a specific number. For context, in Q3, Apple said supply-chain constraint cost the company more than $6 billion in revenue. \n\nCook continues, \u201cWe pride ourselves in getting products to customers who really want them, and we try to do that on a fast basis, and so it\u2019s frustrating that we can\u2019t always do that at the speed we would like. However, March is better than December, and so there are some encouraging signs there.

The Fed held rates at near-zero and reaffirmed plans to finish tapering by March, at which point we will likely see the first interest rate hike of the year. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand \u2014 particularly for goods.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said, \u201cWith inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March\u201d. It is likely the first interest hike will come either in March or April, after the Fed completes tapering.\n\nHere is the entire statement: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf)\n\nIn his press conference following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said, \u201cI would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming conditions are appropriate for doing so.\u201d \n\nBut the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed that \u201cit will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,\u201d and Powell\u2019s commentary suggests the first increase will happen on March 16.\n\nKathy Entwistle, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, said \u201cEverything the Fed is doing at this point we think has just been priced in over the last few weeks. And that's where a lot of the slide in the market has come from. And the big question is, will we slide a little bit more? What's happening? We're looking at companies and their earnings ... to determine whether or not we're going to have a little bit more of a pullback in the market or not. And that's based on what they can do going forward, where their opportunities are. And we've been hearing a lot about inflation. If you think about a 7% inflation rate, that's quite significant.\" \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Robinhood (HOOD) stock was extremely volatile today, dropping more than -14% in the morning after a disappointing earnings result before surging and closing the day almost +10% higher.

This represented the lowest reading since November 2011. Subindices tracking both consumers' expectations for future conditions and assessments of present economic conditions each deteriorated during the month. \n* Personal income rose at a 0.3% month-on-month rate in December, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday, missing estimates for a 0.5% rise, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Income had risen 0.5% in November. Personal spending fell 0.6% during the month\n* Earlier in the week, Bill Ackman announced his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, now owns more than 3.1 million shares of Netflix (NFLX), worth roughly $1 billion.

{"title": "Shopify\u2019s Revenue Could Climb Sharply in the Next 5 Years. The Stock Is a Buy for the Long Term.", "selftext": "Shopify, the e-commerce software company, is miles ahead of its competitors in helping merchants all over the world sell their items, says Gary Robinson, investment manager at Baillie Gifford. He is excited about the long-term prospects for Shopify (ticker: SHOP), which he thinks could increase its revenue by more than 30% over the next five years. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional business with very strong long-term growth prospects. There is a potential for Shopify to grow at supernormal rates for very long periods,\u201d he told Barron\u2019s in an interview. Shopify is also Baillie Gifford\u2019s biggest holding in its U.S. equity growth fund, which had $97.7 million assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2021. The Scottish fund manager tends to own its investments for five to 10 years and sometimes longer. It originally invested in Shopify in 2017, Robinson said. \n\nShopify CEO Tobias L\u00fctke co-founded the Ottawa company in 2006, when he was trying to open an online snowboarding store. The e-commerce tools at the time \u201cwere terrible,\u201d Robinson said. An accomplished programmer, it didn\u2019t take very long for L\u00fctke to realize that selling tools for small companies to build online stores was a better business long term than selling snowboards, Robinson said. \n\nShopify provides tools\u2014like a payment processor, a point of sale system, and a shipping partner\u2014that allow businesses around the world to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. Businesses use Shopify to automate routine tasks like payments, inventory and order management, shipping, as well as cash flow management. Retailers can use Shopify to connect to marketplaces like [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) (AMZN), Meta Platforms \u2018 (FB) Facebook and Instagram, and even TikTok, where they can sell to consumers, Robinson said. Shopify powers millions of merchants, including sustainable shoe company Allbirds (BIRD) and Staples Canada, in more than 175 countries. \n\nShopify went public in 2015 at $17 a share and has risen 4,800% since. Like a number of other tech stocks, it has had a rocky January, falling more than 37%, to a recent $853. The stock trades at 131 forecast 2022 earnings. Shopify was a major beneficiary of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused businesses to digitize. Revenue jumped 96%, to $767.4 million in the third -quarter of 2020, according to a statement. As the pandemic has eased, the company has continued to grow, although more slowly, with revenue rising 46% in the third quarter of 2021 from the quarter a year ago.\n\nShopify\u2019s gross merchandise value\u2014which represents all the products and sales from the merchants that use the platform\u2014rose 35%, to $41.8 billion, in the third quarter, while revenue was $1.1 billion. This means that the take rate, which refers to the percentage of the value of deals Shopify helps with that it keeps as revenue, is only 2.6%, Robinson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a phenomenal deal,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir merchants do, too. That\u2019s why they\u2019re flocking to Shopify in droves.\u201d\n\nRobinson estimates that the company generated an estimated $160 billion of GMV in 2021, which should grow by 30% over the next five years. Shopify is ahead of rival e-commerce platforms competitors like Adobe Commerce, Salesforce (CRM) and Bigcommerce Holdings (BIGC), Robinson said. \n\n[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) isn\u2019t a competitor to Shopify, he argued. Shopify is more of an operating system for merchants, while Amazon is a marketplace for merchants, he said. \u201cThere is a bit of overlap but they serve different customers.\u201d  This month, Shopfiy unveiled a partnership with [JD.com](https://JD.com), making it easier for U.S. merchants to sell their products in China, the world\u2019s largest e-commerce market with a $1.4 billion population. The company was profitable during the first nine months of 2021. Shopify has the potential to generate healthy profit margins in the long term, Robinson said. He wouldn\u2019t make any short-term margin predictions because Shopify\u2019s management continues to reinvest in the business, he said. \u201cWe are very supportive of that as shareholders,\u201d he said.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/shopifys-revenue-could-climb-sharply-in-the-next-5-years-the-stock-is-a-buy-for-the-long-term-51643388698?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/shopifys-revenue-could-climb-sharply-in-the-next-5-years-the-stock-is-a-buy-for-the-long-term-51643388698?mod=mw_latestnews)", "id": "sewcn4", "created_utc": 1643392099.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "I dunno why this sub is hating on SHOP so much lately.

A million $ is of no use to someone isolated on an island.  Although money can be a measure of wealth, since it is an accounting tool, the wealth that a sum of money represents can also vary greatly, as money is subject to inflation or even deflation.\n\n**Shares of stock or other assets are also not necessarily a measure of wealth**.  We saw late last year many ordinary people and politicians criticizing Elon for having 200-300 Billion in unrealized capital gains.  This is not the same as having 200-300 Billion in the bank, which in turn is not necessarily the same as having wealth.  When Elon started selling shares, we witnessed the effect on TSLA market price as his shares greatly increase supply on some days.\n\nIf I have sufficient resources to make the system meet my needs, I feel that I have enough wealth.  Those resources could be anything from tools of the trade to stocks that provide growth or dividends.\n\nTSLA provides shareholders the ability to make the system work for our benefit.  We can sell shares, or use shares as collateral for loans, or even sell options against our shares to acquire cash to buy things from the system.  The ability of TSLA to help us work the system will vary from time to time.\n\nI began to define wealth less and less in $ terms, and more in terms of what I was able to do in the world, things like: buy a computer, build a business, travel the country, no longer worry about my next rent payment or next week's groceries.\n\nIt stopped mattering to me whether I had $1M, or $2M, or $10M.  The accounting numbers were ultimately irrelevant.  When I no longer felt restricted in my ability to have the system work for me, I knew I had an incredible amount of wealth.\n\nThe market value of TSLA goes up and down.
