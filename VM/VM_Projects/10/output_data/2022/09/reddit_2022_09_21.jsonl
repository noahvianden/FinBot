It's not designed to measure implied volatility of different time frames. Here's what I would encourage you to do to grasp this concept. Do a google search for \"VIX 1YR\" and then do a search for \"VIX9D.\" Compare the charts. What you'll see is the 1 year VIX has much less volatility than the 9 Day VIX. The shorter the time frame is, the more volatile the implied volatility will be. That is because there is less time for price to revert to the mean. So the \"volatility of volatility\" will be higher. Volatility is the square root of time, and it scales exponentially. This is also why gamma skyrockets as expiration approaches. Today's FOMC event was like an earnings play. During earnings announcements, implied volatility will rise and then it crashes after the announcement. Same thing with 0 DTE SPX options on FOMC days.

{"title": "Meta Quietly Reduces Staff in Cost-Cutting Push", "selftext": "Meta Platforms Inc. META -2.72%\u25bc is planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions, as the social-media giant confronts stalling growth and increased competition, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Calif., company has begun quietly nudging out a significant number of staffers by reorganizing departments and giving affected employees a limited window to apply for other roles within the company, according to current and former managers familiar with the matter, in a move that achieves staffing cuts while forestalling the mass issuance of pink slips.\n\nThe reductions are expected to be a prelude to deeper cuts, according to people informed of the company\u2019s plans. While some savings will come from cuts to overhead and consulting budgets, the people said, much of it is expected to come from reduced employment.\n\nThe moves come after weeks of Meta executives publicly discussing the need for hiring freezes and \u201cruthless prioritization\u201d of its business, while avoiding use of the word layoffs.\n\nIn response to questions, Meta spokesman Tracy Clayton referred to CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s July statement that the company would need to reallocate resources toward corporate priorities as pressures mount on the business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about the need for our teams to shift to meet these challenges,\u201d Mr. Clayton said. He said giving displaced employees a period to apply for new jobs is a means of retaining talent that Meta might otherwise lose. He declined to say how many employees have been affected by the recent moves.\n\nThe company has been slashing its guidance for operating expenses since the third quarter last year but hasn\u2019t previously suggested it would reduce head count through means other than natural attrition.\n\nAmong some Meta employees, the process of reapplying for jobs within a limited window internally is known as a sort of human- resources purgatory they call the \u201c30 Day List.\u201d\n\nMeta, as of last year the name of Facebook\u2019s parent company, has long had a practice that employees whose roles are eliminated are subject to termination if they can\u2019t find a new job internally within a month. Many other companies also make efforts to reassign employees whose groups are closed or restructured.\n\nAt Meta historically, it was usually only employees that were deemed undesirable who failed to land new positions. Now, affected employees and managers say, workers with good reputations and strong performance reviews are being pushed out on a regular basis.\n\nMeta reported having 83,553 employees at the end of the second quarter, up 32% from a year ago.\n\nAs part of its own cost-cutting measures, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG -1.79%\u25bc Google has also required some employees to apply for new jobs if they wish to remain at the company. Last week, Google told roughly half of the more than 100 employees at the company\u2019s startup incubator Area 120 they would need to find other jobs at the company within 90 days, said people familiar with the decision.\n\nGoogle typically gives employees 60 days to apply for other roles in the company if their jobs have been cut, though Area 120 employees usually receive more time if their projects are canceled, said people familiar with the process.\n\nIn March, more than 1,400 Google workers signed a petition demanding that the company extend the typical 60-day period to 180 days for a group of more than 100 employees in the cloud computing division, citing the \u201cbarriers to transfer that many workers face.\u201d\n\nA Google spokesman said almost 95% of employees who expressed interest in staying with the company found new roles within the notice period. Alphabet had 174,014 employees at the end of the second quarter, up 20.8% from the previous year.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the staff reductions are notable after the biggest companies hired at breakneck speed through the pandemic. In May 2021, Tom Allison, head of the Facebook app, wrote a memo titled \u201cWhy is Hiring So Hard Right Now?\u201d Mr. Allison lamented a \u201cmajor supply and demand imbalance between our hiring needs and talent availability.\u201d With the shortage of engineers most acute, the company was hiring more recruiters, he wrote, but even those were hard to find.\n\nWith the economic climate cooling and the digital-ad market in turmoil, the language from some prominent tech executives is now distinctly different.\n\n\u201cRealistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said at a company town hall in June. Separately, the company\u2019s head of engineering issued a call for managers to identify employees who were coasting and place them on remediation plans as a prelude to their termination.\n\nThe memo\u2019s brusque phrasing led to considerable jeering and angst in the company\u2019s internal forums, according to posts viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeta\u2019s share price is off more than 56.6% so far in 2022, and the company\u2019s market value has dropped more than $685 billion since its peak in September 2021 as of the close on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle has been more resilient but the search giant\u2019s share price is also down 27.3% over the past year. In July, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Google would slow hiring for the rest of the year and urged employees to be \u201cmore entrepreneurial.\u201d Mr. Pichai said at a conference earlier this month that he wanted the company to become 20% more productive, without providing details on how he would measure the improvement.\n\nSnap Inc. is among the outliers in publicly announcing layoffs. The company last week said it would slash about 20% of its staff after growing its head count by around 65% since the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cWe must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses,\u201d Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in a memo to staff. He said the company was launching an opt-in talent directory to help departing employees find work outside the company.\n\nSilicon Valley continues to be a competitive talent market, so finding ways to relocate employees within a company can produce benefits, said Allison Rutledge-Parisi, senior vice president of people at Justworks, a professional employee services company.\n\n\u201cIt would be ridiculous for a company to jettison a group of people who they know, who they\u2019ve managed, they have a relationship with, who\u2019ve contributed, summarily without thinking through a methodology that would find them another place and another home within the organization,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are also potential downsides to having employees compete for a limited number of internal positions, including hits to productivity and morale, said Dave Fisch, chief executive of careers site Ladders. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of chatter, there could be a lot of animosity and finger pointing that naturally starts to arise,\u201d Mr. Fisch said.\n\nAt Meta, the hustle to get rehired is well under way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fast learner who is keen to take on a challenge and evidently by this post, someone who\u2019s not afraid to put herself out there,\u201d wrote a Meta data scientist on an internal forum last month, in which she said she was looking for a new position. \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take and I\u2019d be kicking myself if I ended up leaving without exploring every avenue I could.\u201d\n\n-WSJ", "id": "xkkifw", "created_utc": 1663802624.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "This just reinforces my thoughts.

{"title": "Cathie Wood says 'Dr. Doom' Nouriel Roubini's forecast of a 'long and ugly' inflation-driven recession is wrong", "selftext": "Nouriel Roubini is sounding the alarm that an inflation-driven recession is about to hit the US economy in a big way, according to an interview with Bloomberg.\n\n\"It's not going to be a short and shallow recession, it's going to be severe, long and ugly,\" the so-called Dr. Doom economist said, adding that the stock market could crash 40% in the event of a hard economic landing.\n\nRoubini ultimately expects the Federal Reserve will be forced to continue with its aggressive interest rate hikes and lift the fed funds rate to at least 5% due to persistently high inflation.\n\nBut Cathie Wood disagrees with Roubini on at least one part of his assessment, as she continues to stick with the thesis that deflation is about to take hold in the US.\n\n\"In our view, Roubini forecasting intractable 1970's-style inflation will be blindsided by outright deflation,\" the ARK Invest CEO said in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nShe argued that headline inflation is already unwinding on a sequential basis thanks to tightening monetary and fiscal policies, and that some commodity prices have fallen considerably from recent highs.\n\nSome deflation would be welcomed by stock investors, as it would mark an end to the recent period of high inflation and give the Fed more flexibility in its interest rate trajectory. But too much deflation could be a bad thing, as it can signal demand destruction.\n\nTo that point, Wood noted recent data on gasoline demand as reason to believe deflation is imminent.\n\n\"Gasoline demand in the US has dropped below the level hit during the depths of the coronavirus in 2020 to levels last seen 25 years ago in 1997, even though the number of cars on the road - most of them gas-powered - is much higher than it was 25 years ago,\" she said.\n\nIn fact, the total number of miles traveled by vehicles in the US fell 3% in July relative to the prior year.\n\nThe drop in gasoline demand came after the average price for a gallon of gas soared to above $5 in the US. Wood chalks it up to the fact that consumers do have the ability to balk at high prices and reduce their spending habits in response. Since hitting highs in June, gas prices have fallen sharply.\n\nBut whether it's inflation or deflation, one thing both Roubini and Wood can agree on is that the US will enter an economic recession, if it hasn't already.\n\n\"What we do see in these earnings results is that we are in a recession... We think this is an inventory-led recession, and I think that's coming through loud and clear. We're seeing advertisers cut back dramatically,\" Wood said in August.\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-roubini-long-ugly-recession-inflation-economy-crash-2022-9](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-roubini-long-ugly-recession-inflation-economy-crash-2022-9)\n\nCathie Wood says 'Dr. Doom' Nouriel Roubini's prediction of a 'long and ugly' inflation-driven recession is wrong, and says, \"Roubini and others forecasting intractable '70's-style inflation will be blindsided by outright deflation.\" Do you agree with Cathie Wood?", "id": "xk5hg9", "created_utc": 1663768225.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|276|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|88|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xk5hg9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xk5hg9)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11819741129875183}, {"body": "Says the person whose etf is down by how much???", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "One could argue she's an expert on deflation.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["deflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32723361253738403}, {"body": "Im pretty sure they are both wrong", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m pretty sure they are the same person\u2026", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4420112073421478}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06836366653442383}, {"body": "When has Cathy ever been right??", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Predicting TSLA at 4000 back in 2018.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07627991586923599}, {"body": "The 70's were sideways for awhile, but the US economy was changing and starting to outsource manufacturing and start the path of stopping to be assholes to women and minorities in the workplace at home.

{"title": "Fed raises rates by another 0.75 percentage point to fight inflation", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised benchmark interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point and indicated it will keep hiking well above the current level.\n\nIn its quest to bring down inflation running near its highest levels since the early 1980s, the central bank took its federal funds rate up to a range of 3%-3.25%, the highest it has been since early 2008 following the third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move.\n\nThe increases that started in March and from a point of near-zero mark the most aggressive Fed tightening since it started using the overnight funds rate as its principal policy tool in 1990. The only comparison was in 1994, when the Fed hiked a total of 2.25 percentage points; it would begin cutting rates by July of the following year.\n\nAlong with the massive rate increases, Fed officials signaled the intention of continuing to hike until the funds level hits a \u201cterminal rate,\u201d or end point of 4.6% in 2023.\n\nThe \u201cdot plot\u201d of individual members\u2019 expectations doesn\u2019t point to rate cuts until 2024. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues have emphasized in recent weeks the unlikelihood that rate cuts will happen next year, as the market had been pricing.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee members indicate they expect the rate hikes to have consequences. The funds rate on its face addresses the rates that banks charge each other for overnight lending, but it bleeds through to many consumer adjustable-rate debt instruments, such as home equity loans, credit cards and auto financing.\n\nIn their quarterly updates of estimates for rates and economic data, officials coalesced around expectations for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% by next year from its current 3.7%. Increases of that magnitude often are accompanied by recessions.\n\nAlong with that, they see GDP growth slowing to 0.2% for 2022, rising slightly in the following years to a longer-term rate of just 1.8%. The revised forecast is a sharp cut from the 1.7% estimate in June and comes following two consecutive quarters of negative growth, a commonly accepted definition of recession.\n\nThe hikes also come with the hopes that headline inflation will drift down to 5.4% this year, as measured by the Fed\u2019s preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, which last showed inflation at 6.3% in August. The summary of economic projections then sees inflation falling back to the Fed\u2019s 2% goal by 2025.\n\nCore inflation excluding food and energy is expected to decline to 4.5% this year, little changed from the current 4.6% level, before ultimately falling to 2.1% by 2025. (The PCE reading has been running well below the consumer price index.)\n\nThe reduction in economic growth came even though the FOMC\u2019s statement massaged language that in July described spending and production as having \u201csoftened.\u201d This meeting\u2019s statement noted that \u201cRecent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production.\u201d Those were the only changes in a statement that received unanimous approval.\n\nOtherwise, the statement continued to describe job gains as \u201crobust\u201d and noted that \u201cinflation remains elevated.\u201d The statement also noted again that \u201congoing increases in the target rate will be appropriate.\u201c\n\nThe dot plot showed virtually all members on board with the higher rates in the near term, though there were some variations in subsequent years. Six of the 19 \u201cdots\u201d were in favor of taking rates to a 4.75%-5% range next year, but the central tendency was to 4.6%, which would put rates in the 4.5%-4.75% area. The Fed targets its fund rate in quarter-point ranges.\n\nThe chart indicated as many as three rate cuts in 2024 and four more in 2025, to take the longer-run funds rate down to a median outlook of 2.9%.\n\nMarkets have been bracing for a more aggressive Fed.\n\nTraders had fully priced in the 0.75 percentage point move and even had assigned an 18% chance of a full percentage point move, according to CME Group data. Futures contracts just prior to Wednesday\u2019s meeting implied a 4.545% funds rate by April 2023.\n\nThe moves come amid stubbornly high inflation that Powell and his colleagues spent much of last year dismissing as \u201ctransitory.\u201d Officials relented in March of this year, with a quarter-point hike that was the first increase since taking rates to zero in the early days of the Covid pandemic.\n\nAlong with the rate increases, the Fed has been reducing the amount of bond holdings it has accumulated over the years. September marked the beginning of full-speed \u201cquantitative tightening,\u201d as it is known in markets, with up to $95 billion a month in proceeds from maturing bonds being allowed to roll off the Fed\u2019s $8.9 trillion balance sheet.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/fed-rate-hike-september-2022-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/fed-rate-hike-september-2022-.html)", "id": "xkckj4", "created_utc": 1663784294.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|279|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|88|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xkckj4)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xkckj4)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09292489290237427}, {"body": "Will this even do anything?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Leave me yerking it behind Wendy\u2019s", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "y\u00f8\u00f8rk them g\u00fcrks", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2752807140350342}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09048590809106827}, {"body": "Did it ??", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2652954161167145}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1544615626335144}, {"body": "Priced in?\n\n\nNope.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone lies.
