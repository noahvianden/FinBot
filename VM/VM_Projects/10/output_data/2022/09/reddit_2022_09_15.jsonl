{"title": "Please, join me in understanding $TSLA. I love this stock!", "selftext": "Tesla is now in second place for total sh0rt 1nteres1 (mods \ud83e\udd71)I like this stock.\n\nIt is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I\u2019m thinking about a few things:\n\nPresidential cycles: \n\n(formatted weird due to some rules)\n\nFor like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.\n\nTesla\u2019s trend:\n\nAbsolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I\u2019m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.\n\nNOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:\n\nIt really isn\u2019t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon\u2019s commitment to R&D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it\u2019s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don\u2019t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I\u2019d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYou gotta love him. He\u2019s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he\u2019s an absolute savage. I\u2019m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he\u2019s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.\n\nTLDR: Why the fuck haven\u2019t we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don\u2019t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife\u2019s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years? Then you will have literally missed the fucking rocket.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Take that as you wish, but I\u2019m jumping on the fucking rocket (hopefully before he does) \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019ve blown up my account 4 times and accidentally kissed my wife\u2019s boyfriend(Don\u2019t ask)\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc95\n\nEdit: Position - long 100 shares at $39.16\n                   - 2 500c 6/19/24\n                   -5 450c 1/20/23\n\nEdit: Spy at 395\ud83e\udd14 Tesla at 204 \ud83e\udee1 Spy at 470 \ud83d\udc8e Tesla at\u2026\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80 (buy fractional shares if you have to.

Traders expect the Fed fund rate to peak at about 4.4% next year, from the current range of 2.25% and 2.5%.\n\nDalio noted investors may still be too complacent about long-term inflation. While the bond market suggests traders are expecting an average annual inflation rate of 2.6% over the next decade, his \u201cguesstimate\u201d is that the increase will be around 4.5% to 5%. With economic shocks, it may be even \u201csignificantly higher,\u201d he added.\n\nDalio said the US yield curve will be \u201crelatively flat\u201d until there is an \u201cunacceptable negative effect\u201d on the economy.\n\nFull article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-14/ray-dalio-doing-the-math-rates-at-4-5-would-sink-stocks-by-20](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-14/ray-dalio-doing-the-math-rates-at-4-5-would-sink-stocks-by-20)\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio says a mere increase in rates to about 4.5% would lead to a nearly 20% plunge in stock prices.

{"title": "Policy bubble?", "selftext": "I've been revisiting the 1973 quarterly chart and can't help but see some similarities between the current trajectory. Inflation was little over 6% in '73. The following years inflation was about 11% in '74 and 9% in '75. The drastic changes that occurred during this period fundamentally changed the system which allowed us to incur this massive deficit. \n\nMy argument is that the current bubble might be a policy bubble. And I'm suspecting a big fundamental change to the system again.\n\nI know this might be a silly argument because I haven't fleshed out the entire mechanics of this so it seems straightforward. I acknowledge that it isn't this straightforward. Unpacking the totality of this would consume a full written series to explore. I wanted to get the gist of it out.  \n\nSo, I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on why this fundamental change could be possible, or why it wouldn't  be possible?\n\nPerhaps digitalization is the excuse for a substantial shift? \n\nHypothetically, if this were to happen, what would be the play?", "id": "xfavvk", "created_utc": 1663283379.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xfavvk)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xfavvk)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08954881131649017}, {"body": "The current bubble has lots of factors, and policy is among the causes. Policy doesn't happen in a vacuum, though. Other nations affect US banking policy, just as US banking policy affects other nations.\n\nRemember all that noise about China being a currency manipulator? Well they are. So is the US. So are the Brits, the French, Germans, Japanese, Russians, Saudi's, and just about every other significant economic player on the planet.\n\nWhen one nation raises interest rates, they are bidding against the world for money. Sometimes this causes a bidding war.\n\nDigital currency already exists, and for most people reading this it's been around, silently, your entire life. SWIFT is digital banking, and it moves billions of dollars per day around the globe without a paper note ever leaving a vault. Remember all the talk about cutting Russia off from the SWIFT payment system. It would be similar to cutting you off from the bank where your mortgage note is held and making you pay in silver or copper each month. Oh, and the people who cut you off get to determine how much an ounce of silver is worth.\n\nCitizens also have multiple methods for non-cash payments, including things like ApplePay (swipe your phone), credit cards, debit cards, and paper checks. When I was a kid lots of grocery stores carried personal accounts, which could be charged with groceries and billed. My mother had such an account and she would sometimes send me to the store on my bike to go get groceries, and \"tell them to charge it to the account\". This was another form of non-cash settlement.\n\nThe fundamental shift in the 1970's was the permanent severing of our dollar (and the British pound, etc) to the gold standard and the introduction of \"floating\" currencies. Governments were having a coming to Jesus moment, realizing that production was going to be constrained if credit was limited to how much precious metal we could pull out of the earth and stick in a vault. Gold is also very inconvenient to a war happy empire. Forex traders were also learning how to whipsaw the system to create profits for themselves and turmoil for central banks. Businesses hedging their foreign interests also inadvertently created a lot of difficulty when currencies were still \"pegged\".\n\nSo when it became politically inconvenient, the rules were rewritten.\n\nToday's society runs on GDP. Nobody asks how much gold is in your Fort Knox anymore. That's like going to a barn dance to find your next sweetheart. Old fashioned.\n\nToday countries ask each other *What is your total production?* Is it stable? How fast is it increasing? When was your last missed payment? These are the metrics by which we measure credit worthiness.\n\nThis and how big a stick are you carrying? Does it glow in the dark (nuclear)?\n\nToo many events being juggled are up in the air right now to make intelligent guesses.\n\nRussia is imploding - will it continue or stabilize? Maybe China somehow comes riding to the rescue. Seems unlikely, given China is having their own economic meltdown. All the same, can't be ruled out. A glut of gas and oil from a desperate Russia could do wonders for flagging business.\n\nWe're still feeling the *effects of two years worth of off and on lockdowns*, worldwide. It's not going to go away overnight, but don't judge the future as if all those disruptions are going to continue indefinitely. Shipping is working itself out. Production has learned how to work around the virus. Enormous numbers of people are vaccinated. Enormous numbers of vulnerable people have died. The situation is not what it was even a year ago.\n\nThe west is going through a 50 year reckoning about which things definitely need to be on-shored, and which things only sort of need to be on-shored. We have ceded an awful lot of our technology and critical industry to China. How it shakes out is beyond me, but its hard to believe we don't continue cutting them out of critical infrastructure and national security goods into the foreseeable future, bringing that stuff home or at least diversifying the work to other places.\n\nIt's not just complex things like solar panels or vehicles. Dow chemical was tasked with making polystyrene-butadiene (synthetic rubber), among other things, during WWII. Tired needed tread and men needed boots. Both required rubber, which the US didn't have, on account of we were fighting Japan.\n\nDuring WWI Dow was tasked with making tear gas and later mustard gas. They also made basic chemicals during the 1918 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking of pandemics, it's easy to forget most of the world's masks are produced in - you guessed it - China. We think masks, most of us think 3M. Nope. China.\n\nThis was painfully obvious when the pandemic was starting and the US had to dance around the fact the whole shebang took off because of China's negligence while simultaneously begging it for masks. Not a good position to be in.\n\nThe next decade, in my opinion, is going to be about on-shoring critical production and finding alternatives to China for necessary rare-earths.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You are too smart for wsb.
