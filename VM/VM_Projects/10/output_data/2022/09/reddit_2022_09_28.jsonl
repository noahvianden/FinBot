Been a long time. I have been a buyer recently,\" the DoubleLine Capital CEO told his nearly 250,000 followers on Twitter in an early Tuesday morning tweet. His \"Bond King\" nickname draws from his success in the fixed-income market.\n\nOn Tuesday, US bond yields were moving lower as prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 10 basis points to 3.813% after the yield on Monday rose above 3.9% for the first time since 2010. The two-year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 4.24%.\n\nTreasuries are undergoing their worst decline since 1949, according to Bank of America.

{"title": "Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Launches Venture Fund Open to Individual Investors", "selftext": "Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/cathie-woods-ark-launches-venture-fund-open-to-individual-investors-11664249048\n\nFund is set to invest in private, public firms similar to those held by ARK's high-growth, technology-focused ETFs\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management LLC on Tuesday debuted the ARK Venture Fund, the firm\u2019s first foray into private investments.\n\nThe venture fund intends to invest in early- to late-stage private companies and publicly traded businesses similar to those held by ARK\u2019s high-growth, technology-focused exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe ARK Venture Fund is available to U.S. investors, including individuals, for a minimum initial investment of $500 on the online investment platform of financial-technology startup Titan. Venture-capital funds traditionally limit access to accredited investors such as wealthy individuals or institutions.\n\n\u201cWe think retail investors should have the right to participate in the value creation of the most exciting and successful technology companies on the planet, even if they\u2019re private,\u201d Maximilian Friedrich, a member of the ARK Venture Investment Committee and an analyst at the firm, said in an interview. \u201cThat is a value add that sets us apart from traditional venture capitalists, which often do not have a broad reach and audience with retail investors.\u201d\n\nMs. Wood and ARK rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic when the firm\u2019s ETFs posted huge returns as low interest rates and stimulus boosted investor appetite for riskier assets. Those bets have struggled this year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates at an aggressive clip to try to curb persistent inflation, making unprofitable companies promising growth in the future a harder sell to investors. The flagship ARK Innovation ETF is down 61% in 2022, yet has seen steady inflows this year.\n\nARK plans to also offer access to the venture fund to registered investment advisers, family offices, high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors through other distributors down the line, according to Mr. Friedrich.\n\nThe fund has a target portfolio composition of 70% private companies and 30% public companies. Although traditional venture-capital funds often look for exit opportunities such as initial public offerings or acquisitions, ARK\u2019s fund aims to continue holding portfolio companies after they enter public markets. ARK declined to name its initial portfolio companies.\n\nThe ARK Venture Fund is an interval fund, a vehicle that restricts withdrawals, but gives investors access to more illiquid assets less likely to trade on financial markets. ARK\u2019s fund plans to offer quarterly redemptions capped at 5% of the fund\u2019s net asset value, according to Mr. Friedrich.\n\nThe fund has a 2.75% management fee and anticipates distribution and other fees to total 1.47% in its first year of operation, assuming average net assets of about $250 million during that period, according to ARK. Investors won\u2019t pay an additional platform fee to Titan for the fund. Interval funds in the U.S. have an average management fee of 1.4%, according to Morningstar Direct data tracking 72 funds.\n\nARK\u2019s venture fund doesn\u2019t have carried interest, a share of profits paid out to the fund\u2019s managers. Venture-capital funds traditionally have a fee structure of a 2% management fee and 20% carried interest.\n\nThe launch of the fund comes as venture-capital deals have slowed this year amid a broader market downturn. Still, venture funding and startup valuations remain at some of the highest levels on record. ARK first filed to launch the venture fund in February and filed a fund prospectus in August.\n\n\u201cNot only is the Ark team via Titan able to provide retail access to venture, we\u2019re doing it at a time where arguably the Ark team can go strike favorable deals from an investment standpoint,\u201d said Joe Percoco, co-founder and co-chief executive of Titan, in an interview.\n\nTitan earlier this month launched real-estate and private credit funds managed by Apollo Global Management Inc. and Carlyle Group for individual investors on its platform.

{"title": "Apple Ditches iPhone Production Increase After Demand Falters", "selftext": "Apple Inc. is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based electronics maker has told suppliers to pull back from efforts to increase assembly of the iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year, said the people, asking not to be named as the plans are not public. Instead, the company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple\u2019s original forecast this summer, the people said.\n\nDemand for higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions, according to some of the people. In at least one case, an Apple supplier is shifting production capacity from lower-priced iPhones to premium models, they added.\n\nApple shares fell about 3% in pre-market trading in New York on Wednesday. US stock-index futures were also lower.\n\nIn Taipei, key chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.2% and Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. was down 2.9%, amid a wide selloff of electronics suppliers. ASML Holding NV, maker of advanced chipmaking gear, dropped as much as 3.2% in Amsterdam.\n\nApple Suppliers Drop as Firm Said to Ditch IPhone Output Boost\n\nApple had upgraded its sales projections in the weeks leading up to the iPhone 14 release and some of its suppliers had started making preparations for a 7% boost in orders.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, is in an economic slump that\u2019s hit its domestic mobile device makers and also affected the iPhone\u2019s sales. Purchases of the iPhone 14 series over its first three days of availability in China were 11% down on its predecessor the previous year, according to a Jefferies note on Monday.\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ditches-iphone-production-increase-011918295.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ditches-iphone-production-increase-011918295.html)\n\nApple (AAPL) is down 3.71% premarket.

DO NOT try to replicate this. This is the riskiest most stupid thing you can do with your money and there's more than 99% chance you'll lose big time (literal chance is about 80% but your emotions will fuck it up big time).\n\n2.) My capital is inheritance money where I didn't have to work hard to achieve it like you probably have to. If I lose it I'm where I've been. If you lose it, it might have severe consequences. Again, please do not do this, you will lose your money.\n\n3.) Do not get inspired by regarded posts on WSB making it look easy, possible and achievable. It's nothing more than dumb luck, red in roulette, an expensive lottery ticket and it does fail significantly more than it doesn't.\n\n4.) If you're still dumb enough, do it only with money you can lose, won't make your life worse or ruined when you lose them.\n\n_Written on 9/27/22_\n\nLast win: $75k\nThese trades opened: 9/27/22\n\nTrade 1: AAPL 18 Nov 22 put, 140 strike, 350 contracts\n\nPremise: Market is bearish and AAPL is the last man standing. Betting it will tank as well, soon enough so theta is not giving it to me behind the Wendy's, from behind with no lube.\n\n\u2022 Taking max loss of 30% of the position ($50k)\n\u2022 Closing the trade when in profit 30-50% depending on the situation and time (i.e. theta giving it to me with no lube) ($50-84k).\n\n\nTrade 2: SPY 10 Oct 22 put, 355 strike, 300 contracts\n\nPremise: Rather confident belief SPY will tank rather fast. \n\u2022 Taking max loss of 50% of previous win ($37.5k)\n\u2022 Closing the trade when in profit 30% ($54k).\n\n\nDay 1 (9/27/22): SPY was slightly and shortly in green, then it went red and stayed there, at close nearly -20% of the position. AAPL was oscillating through the day, at times showing some nice green of about +$5000, day ended -$7000 on the position (over 4%)\n\n_Written on 9/28/22_\n\nDay 2: AAPL tanked and I closed at 9:44am in NYC time at +43%, over + $70k.\n\nConclusion for AAPL: I was lucky. My thesis was sort of right and AAPL tanked and I was lucky. It tanked the next day I bought the puts because of the news and not because of my premise which means I was really lucky. I'm still kind of glad for myself despite the fact I was really lucky. No need to say I was lucky, but I'm also glad and little bit proud I (luckily) timed what was most likely the bottom of the day and sold there. Also glad I managed to stick to the trading principle and rules I sat at the start with the strategy.\n\nThings to improve: With such long DTE maybe try and hold longer if I believe my premise/thesis is strong but then again no need to prove anything, here for a good time, not a long time so why not to lock the profit if it's there.\n\nSPY on day 2: Today my puts are an 8 year boy and SPY is a Catholic priest. It's ridiculous how SPY is going up in this environment and sentiment. My premise was completely stupid and weak, got greedy from the last time and probably needed the loss to be able to go further. Also haven't followed the rules I've given myself and at the time of writing this I'm sitting at nice unrealised loss of over - $80k.\n\nThings to improve: Just don't be a fucking idiot.\n\nPlan with the open position: it's not 0-2DTE YOLO, there's still a bit of time and I still think this (for me) nonsensical SPY run-up is just a dead cat bounce kind of anomaly and it will tank back soon enough for me to close the position with not so big loss. If not, well, except the loss porn soon enough.\n\nOverall conclusion: Really disappointed with the enormously stupid and foolsih SPY puts, moderately happy with the AAPL puts.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Ur entire family tree is rolling in their grave. \n\nImagine working ur ass off to pass things down to your kids just for them to YOLO it on options. \n\nYou definitely belong here.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15158617496490479}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "FML.
