{"title": "BBBY abituary", "selftext": "This is update IV. Follow the links for previous posts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x3ggfx/byeeebyemissbbby/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x3ggfx/byeeebyemissbbby/)\n\n**THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**\n\nBBBY is headed straight to bankruptcy, and there's nothing you and Sue can do about it. At this rate, BBBY holders are donating their money to the golden parachute showers for BBBY execs.\n\nLet's look at the facts as to why bulls are about to drown in cheap liquor:\n\n\\- THERE WILL BE NO SQUEEZE. Your last hope is that RegSHO will force a squeeze. That in itself is regarded and not how it works. Regardless, BBBY is confirmed to not be in RegSHO\n\n\\- Shorts made like 600% in the past two weeks; they are not pressed to cover. The only thing they're covering is your wife's face.\n\n**Here are the facts:**\n\n\\- BBBY has five months of runaway left thanks to an additional $375M FILO loan and an asset-backed $150M revolving debt raise. The company expects to spend in capital expenditures $250M a year, down from $400M, but not total expenses; that's much higher. It was spending about $100M a month in the past year. ALSO very important, a FILO loan is one of the most aggressive loan types, meaning BBBY is desperate. How desperate? Picture a man in the desert without water who starts to drink his urine.\n\n\\- At best, BBBY has bought itself another few months (this is a rough estimate, you nerd) with its latest moves. 150/1000 Store closing and layoffs are not moving the needle in a worsening market\n\n\\- When it comes to bankruptcy, stonk holders are like LifeCare patients at memorial hospital during hurricane Katrina (I've been watching Five Days at Memorial, IYKYK). It means you're fked.\n\n\\- In a time of liquidation, creditors, aka lenders, get priority. Once they receive all of their money back, the leftover is for equity holders. And before equity holders get their money back, you best believe executives will dip their toes.\n\n**So what's BBBY's doing?**\n\nWell, only the execs know, but this is my guess based on their actions. In summary, the company is in fundraising mode. They're trying to raise as much money as possible. They've exhausted their debt options, and they're coming for your piggy bank.\n\nLet's understand their equity structure:\n\n\\- 900M shares authorized, meaning they can issue up to this many shares or have done so historically\n\n\\- Of that, 688.767M were issued (meaning all shares the company ever created to sell for fundraising)\n\n\\- Of that, 161.937M are outstanding, the number of shares not owned by the company, and 76M of those shares are floated, meaning shares you and your wife's boyfriend trade in the open market without restrictions\n\n\\- Enter the big swinging trojan horse dick who will tear your bank account a new hole, the ATM offering, which adds 12M to the 76M shares outstanding, a 15% increase in shares. This would drop the current price of $8.71 to $7.52, AT LEAST. Given how shit volume is, it's going a lot lower.\n\n**So what's their plan really?**\n\nBBBY is pursuing two efforts, a) fundraising money to pay their debt and suppliers in hopes they don't stop servicing them (some already have since they're not paying), and b) pursuing 'growth' opportunities. What type of growth opportunities? Imagine your Boomer I, hot grandma trying to optimize her website and take traffic from Amazon. Good luck; you're a decade too late.\n\n**What will ultimately happen?**\n\nWe all know this is a simulation, so we know how this ends. Have you heard of Blockbuster? What about Toys-R-Us? Maybe Sears? What about RadioShack, the brand name Tai Lopez purchased in the discount bin?\n\nBBBY, the ripper, awaits.\n\n**Why am I being so aggressive on PUTS now?**\n\nBBBY is showing its hand. It's desperate, it's trying to raise money, FAST, it's on life support. And guess what, it needs to service its creditors before it does its equity holders. Much like Dante, BBBY has descended into the gates of hell and awaits the nine circles ahead. BBBY is the drowning swimmer grasping for anybody to hold onto, even if it means drowning them. And guess what, regard, you're the clueless tourist who can't swim spinning in circles on your float and you're about to be 12 feet underwater. BBBY will sell you all the shares it can at current prices because it knows its marketcap is so overvalued it'd be stupid not to dump on you ASAP.\n\nAnd don't get me started on volume. Do you notice pre and post-market there is no volume? Do you notice the only people buying are Reddit regards? And guess why the price isn't moving? Because BBBY is dumping shares on you. And guess what's going to happen next? You're all going to slowly walk to the exit, and when you realize everyone else is also leaving, you will run each other over.\n\nGood luck regards; I pray for you.\n\nAlso I'm a shrimp and idfk what I'm doing.

{"title": "My thoughts on the upcoming weeks", "selftext": "Let me start out I\u2019m regarded when it comes to stocks; however I have a highly coveted Poli Sci degree that I no longer use so let\u2019s see if I can put it to use. Tail or fade me how you will but I think reasoning is solid. Right now it seems like public sentiment is still fairly mixed on if things are going to get bad or smooth over. What I can tell you is if you\u2019re on the fence side towards bearish. Reasoning: people are psychologically predispositioned to underestimate the likelihood of bad things happening. So what we\u2019re seeing right now is that lower and some middle class families are getting hit fairly hard from inflation, as these are the groups most likely to have to take out loans for purchases/living paycheck to paycheck. They\u2019ve been feeling the hurt and can tell you most everything is not ok; however, the majority of these folks do not own stock or at least not enough to make a difference. We don\u2019t start seeing stock ownership go up until we get into higher areas of middle class families. If I\u2019m right these folks have noticed some inconveniences but nothing life changing. Because of this I don\u2019t think these upper tiers of average investors can quiet see how bad it is on the ground. Sure they read the news, but this group doesn\u2019t seem to fully take notice until it effects them. A lot of these folks will also fall under a more right leaning political ideology, which usually means more distrust in government. So when JPow comes out and says we have to get inflation under control at all cost and this will be bad if we don\u2019t, a lot of this group is blowing that off as propaganda. Because of this I think the markets are going to be delayed in how they react. So good luck to everyone trying to guess how delayed the are.\n\nAlso we are entering a major shift in global powers. China has yet to overtake the U.S., but they are getting closer. There is a reason you are starting to see the us more hostile to China from Taiwan to trade. If this continues global supply chains are going to be rendered useless as so many companies have not hedged production to factor in US Chinese relationships dissolving. This will also make inflation much stickier. As both nations look to be heading for sizeable recessions what could make US recovery harder is if China is able to rebound quicker. With China having central control of the economy this is very likely to happen. \n\nSo where does that leave the US? Well if China is able to recover quicker than the US, it does leave the possibility that American companies might not be the most attractive to investors. I believe this is part of what some of the perma bears are talking about when they discuss greatly inflated equities. A lot of these stocks have been valued so high on predictions of future growth. However, if the US markets start becoming not the best place to put your money going forward, those companies who are priced for future growth are screwed, because of global markets and debt being much more expensive which they will be forced to take on more and more.\n\nThis seems like a scenario where Bulls are going to have to get dragged facedown in the pavement along the way until we get through this.
