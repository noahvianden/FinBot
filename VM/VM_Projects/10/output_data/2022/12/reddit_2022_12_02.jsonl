I love boohoo clothing. Don't bet against them.\nBoohoo, isawitfirst, prettylittlething are doing well ihmo and aren't going anywhere.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Good to hear. I wasn't aware of those brands, are they more US focused? I guess my main concern for them is they've got a lot of clothing brands in the UK that aren't doing that well, haven't for some time, struggling to reinvent themselves and other usual ways brands try to reinvigorate sales before they inevitably call in the liquidators. Their high street sales don't seem to have recovered as quickly as expected and recession is looming, so in terms of business losses in the UK, it'll all start from the high street in terms of bankruptcies, they're the most vulnerable in post COVID retail. Once high street only businesses start going under, it'll be brands with both online and high street present that then start to close shops also, as it's more profitable.... however.....I believe there will be some form of financial crash in the next eight months or less. I do not believe online sales will keep up with current trends. I also believe just because retail sales collapse through branch closures, boarded up shops that that trade will automatically shift to online like in 2008. I have a feeling that with wages being suppressed, job losses to come, rising inflation, stagflation, higher interest rates, mortgages becoming unaffordable, real terms decreases in both cost of living but also standard of living, alongside mortgage foreclosures to come in the UK starting February that while highstreet retail may survive the Xmas period and sales, after that high street trade will almost evaporate. And while some of that will transfer online, in the UK anyway, I do not believe that will happen in a significant or helpful way to ensure that boohoo, who are exposed certainly from the brand's I'm aware of, to a drop in both high street retail and online retail. Other clothing brands conglomerates are vulnerable too, but boohoo really have done crappy and or expensive brands in the UK. Who's going to want to buy crap when you have no money? Who's going to buy expensive but fundamentally not high quality clothing in a recession....not many people, whether it's on the high street or online. I predict sales drops on at least 50% of their brands, probably more if I look more into it. They've purchased the companies in February 2021 that were basically bankrupt, hoping COVID sales would continue to rise and now Putin's invaded Russia and messed up the economy, alongside the crypto crisis with ftx etc....a global recession similar to 2008 had been brought forward significantly imo. What do you think?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The way I know about those brands is from a TV show called [love island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Island_(2015_TV_series)), the contestants tend to become promos of those companies. As far as I can tell, they are internationally popular and in no shortage of customers - nor have I seen any problems with their ability to fulfill orders.... so far.\n\nThey are definitely UK centric, but probably in the same way Anime is Japan centric but popular & sold in USA and other places as well. I don't consider the clothes from the three places mentioned as expensive. I think they're typically referred to as fast fashion - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion and I think I recognize the clothes in random people in public; teens and college age.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't watch love island \ud83d\ude48 but yes interesting. Hadn't thought of the centric issue before. Will ponder it. Thanks for the thoughts, really helpful. What do you think of their customer base though and their likelihood to have resources to buy clothes from them in a recession? I guess their core customers are rather oddly 16-28 (teeny brands, fast fashion etc) and then sort of aspirational upper middle class clothes, so on the higher end of generic brands, but certainly not part of the 'big' high street brands, i.e. Dorothy Perkins or Coast.... basically clothes for working class people or middle class people to feel like they've bought quality because of a label....I would have thought brands like that or things like Kath kidson etc would do well in a recession.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For me, clothes and food have high priority regardless of any recession.
