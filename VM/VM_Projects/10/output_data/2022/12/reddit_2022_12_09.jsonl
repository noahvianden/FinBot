{"title": "CarMax = MaxPuts", "selftext": "CarMax Q2 Earnings report was a complete disaster. The company was not even close to any analyst estimate. The report shows that both the consumer was weak, and the price of its vehicle sales were down. Any average person can drive by a CarMax lot and see their lots are overflowing with used cars. Which is weird because if you go by a Ford, Chevy, Audi, or GMC dealership they have enough room to park your wife\u2019s boyfriends meth RV. Their sales have been growing over time, but this is a heavily saturated market (pre Q2 and when Carvana was considered a good buy) with a consumer economy that was just on fire. Now, with rates on the rise again (potentially 50 point fed rate increase) to try and slow the economy, it is becoming more expensive to finance purchases. \n\nInflation in general is a damper on consumers' budgets. Then factor in a much higher monthly payment on any financed debt, and it is no surprise as to why sales are slowing. We are in a recession, in my opinion and according to GDP. The rate hikes are just taking effect. As we can see with Carvana, used car sales are one of the last things the average regards are setting out for when they just bought a house for three times they can afford. As we heard in the WSB morning chat, a regard would give up everything else on the planet (including his wife, food, and dignity) before giving up their house, so why risk it buying a used car?\n\nUsed auto demand is declining, so we expect some margin pressure. In short, they announce earnings 12/22 and I can see a 15% drop from the current market price to Covid pandemic levels. Now Carvana and Carmax have different business models but with the rise of interest rates, decline of consumer savings, potential for more fed increases, and concentration on more important items other than my wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s used Pontiac. They executed poorly and the consumer is clearly weak especially coming up on the Santa run. Avoid KMX calls and bet on puts.\n\nQ2 Summary:\n\n\u201cCarMax's just reported revenues were once again up from a year ago, but sales growth weakened tremendously. The top-line growth is now anemic, as the quarter saw slower sales each month that passed. Eye-popping slowdown, really. Prices are normalizing. Car sales are down. Keep in mind the used car market picked up quite a bit during COVID and really picked up as we emerged from the height of the crisis into 2021. Now, the Fed's actions have had their consequences. We are just starting to see it. Sales were up just 1.9% over last year.\n\nQ2 revenues were $8.14 billion, badly missing estimates by $0.410 billion. it gets worse. Margin pressure is creeping up and it is a big warning sign for the next few quarters. We are seeing, at best, mixed results in the critical metrics that we follow for CarMax, and this is something to consider going forward.\u201d\n\nSales were up very slightly. Just because the rates are higher and consumer is weakened to a degree, it does not mean sales will completely implode, but in this report, the critical metrics we follow for this company were again mixed. Total used vehicle unit sales fell 6.4% in the quarter and comparable store used unit sales cratered 8.3% versus the prior year's Q2. It was a horrible quarter for used vehicle sales, and way below expectations.\n\nHere is the key. Comparable store sales \"saw a low single-digit decline in June and then fell sharply through the end of the quarter.\" Further, wholesale units dropped 15.1% to 159,677 vehicles from the prior-year second quarter. Ouch.\n\nAs a whole, combined retail and wholesale used vehicle unit sales were 376,616, a decrease of 10.3% from Q2 2021.\u201d\n\nAnd that was Q2!!!!\n\nCarMax margins and profits:\n\n\u201cVolumes were anemic, and margins are starting to feel some pressure too. This is where the problem arises. We have revenues up from last year, but the company made far less money. This is because margins were weaker and there are massive charges for loan loss provisions that hurt earnings.\n\nTotal gross profit fell to $737.1 million in the quarter, declining 9.6%%. A massive fall despite a slight revenue increase. This was a result of some pressure on profit per vehicle.\n\nThis is the key metric we follow: used vehicle gross profit per unit. This actually held up to a small degree. While retail used profit was down 2.6% overall, it was a volume-driven result. The per-vehicle profit was better than a year ago, reflecting higher prices over the past year. But as the quarter went on, prices began to fall. The per vehicle profit was a slight bright spot, increasing $97 per vehicle from last year to $2,282.\n\nWe expect pressure here as used car pricing reductions continue as the market normalizes. This is a key point going forward. Wholesale vehicle gross profit plummeted 25.6%, driven by reduced volumes. However, the margin per vehicle was down. Wholesale per vehicle profit of $881 was down from $1,005 in the Q2 2021 period. It is worth noting margins in the other lines of sales were down 15.4% as well, as lower protection plans were sold, and service department margins were crimped.\n\nSo, you have some price per vehicle issues, yet to make matters worse on the profit side of things, selling, general and administrative expenses rose 16.0% to $686.0 million. Advertising expenses were up, as were technology costs (for the new online appraisal system). There were also more staffing costs as wages are higher. They also spent to ramp up their online presence, which paid off as 30% of sales were online, up from 28% a year ago. Perhaps not surprisingly, earnings power was way down.\n\nWith a slight increase in the top line but clearly reduced margin power and expenses that grew, the bottom line missed consensus expectations. It did not just miss, it was not even close. Earnings were $0.79 (way below last year's $1.72), badly missing consensus by $0.58 per share. Horrific.

{"title": "Fed Expected to Keep Peak Rates for Longer, Dashing Hopes for 2023 Cuts", "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve is set to disappoint Wall Street as it keeps rates at their peak throughout 2023, dashing hopes markets have priced in for rate cuts in the second half and making a recession very likely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s the forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of a decision and forecasts due from the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday. Policymakers will raise rates by 50 basis points next week, following four consecutive 75 basis-point hikes, and by quarter points at the following two meetings, the survey found. Policymakers will announce their decision and forecasts at 2 p.m. in Washington.\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s median projection is expected to show the policy benchmark peaking at 4.9% in 2023 \u2014 reflecting a 4.75%-5% target range \u2014 compared to 4.6% seen in September. That would deliver a hawkish surprise to investors, who currently bet that rates will be cut by a half percentage point in the second half of next year, though they too see rates peaking around 4.9%.\n\nThe survey saw the Fed cutting rates to 4% by June 2024 and to 3.5% by the end of that year.\n\nChair Jerome Powell has said he\u2019s willing for the economy to suffer some pain to lower inflation near 40-year highs and that should be a bit more visible in the new forecast.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s summary of economic projections are likely to show that policy makers are looking for weaker US growth and slightly higher unemployment than they were expecting in September. They may downgrade 2023 growth estimates to 0.8% compared to 1.2% in September while seeing unemployment rising to 4.6%. The US jobless rate stood at 3.7% last month.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says\n\n\u201cThe Fed has signaled the terminal rate will likely be around 5% \u2014 we think an upper bound of 5% \u2014 reached in early 2023. To get there, the central bank will likely raise rates by 50 basis points at its December 2022 meeting, followed by two more 25-bp hikes in 2023. We then see it holding at 5% throughout the year.\u201d", "id": "zgyjn0", "created_utc": 1670595593.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Fed to disappoint Wall Street at December meeting", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07713370770215988}, {"body": "Inflation is suppository", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Everything is pRiCeD IN ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "the MaRkEt iS fOrWarD L00k1ng", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3218355178833008}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04677746817469597}, {"body": "The Fed will pivot once there is a crash, just like they always do.
