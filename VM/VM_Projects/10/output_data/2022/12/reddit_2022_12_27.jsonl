A delta of 1 with no expiry and then sell OTM short puts to raise your entry basis.  Especially if you have a longer term outlook like a recession that can last months, if not years.  While you will pay a small % in short fees, you can let the stock do whatever, while you gather premium and artificially raise your basis, like an inverted covered call.  \n\nIf you are targeting short momentum bursts (i.e. doing short term swing trades for a few days), you need to map out your target areas.  You can do this with daily/weekly/monthly lows, Fibonacci targets, longer term moving averages, crosses of indicators to signal that momentum has shifted on a shorter time frame (say the 4hr vs. the daily).  Since options can and will go to zero, you need to pay a bit more attention to your entries.  Unlike stocks where, as long as you have sized appropriately, you can theoretically let the sit on the position forever until it turns green, options have a finite window to execute and this is why most people have a defined magnitude or a certain % gain they make on the trade where they close it and move onto the next setup.

This means they mush have a handle on monetary/fiscal policy,\" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said.\n\nAnd right now, investors are unsure about both factors. The Fed caught the market by surprise last week when it indicated that it will likely raise interest rates by another 75 basis points in 2023 and leave rates higher for longer. And the Fed's timeline could change on a dime if inflation remains persistently high.\u00a0", "id": "zw3v9b", "created_utc": 1672107273.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "But the Vix is like all time lo ?

But problem is we don't know how things will play out yet.\n\nWhat we do know is that this bear market has been caused largely by inflation and the Fed's reaction to it, so it seems likely to me that this bear-market bottom could be marked by investors broadly giving up on the transitory inflation narrative and the idea of the Fed pivoting. In the summer investors broadly still had hope that inflation will would come down and the Fed would pivot, but now after a few more months of bad news everyone is starting to become convinced we've entered a new regime of higher inflation and higher rates. That could be true, but it's interesting to me how much the narrative has shifted. And I'm even seeing people suggest a hard landing is all but guaranteed now, which again is a new development. It does feel like expectations for 2023 are turning extremely negative and that could give us a lot of potential for positive surprises.\n\nBut either way, by the time the Fed has stopped hiking rates and we have more certainty on earnings I assure you the markets will already be rallying higher.

Many expect tremendous relief due to \"housings\" total value in CPI, PCE.\n\nVariables:\n\n* The labor market continues. Has it slowed. Yes, but from a torrid pace. Surrounding data points (JOLTs, initial jobless claims, unemployment, jobs, wages) remain robust as measured against the most recent labor market cycles (2000s, 2010s).

While savings rate has gone low, it's still positive, and there remain excess savings from COVID (JPMorgan did a report that they expect that to run out in summer/fall of 2023)\n* [National Mortgage Database (NMDB) Aggregate Data | Federal Housing Finance Agency (fhfa.gov)](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/National-Mortgage-Database-Aggregate-Data.aspx)  According to FHFA 85% of homeowners with a mortgage have one at less than 3.5% interest.\n* [Microsoft PowerPoint - ReportData\\_template.pptx (newyorkfed.org)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2022Q3) People make a lot of the nominal amounts of household debt. But they don't seem to look at the status of the debt and households economic status. High credit scores, higher limits on credit cards vs total credit card (i.e. plenty of available credit), total balances of delinquencies rates which remain as low as they've been since the 90s, HELOCs were taken very low so homeowners have lots of equity, transition to delinquency remains at low levels going back to the 90s, and all categories (like mortgage deliquencies) remain below pre COVID levels (except HELOCs).\n* [Existing-Home Sales (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/existing-home-sales)   [United States - Existing Home Sales: Months Supply - 2022 Data 2023 Forecast 2013 Historical (tradingeconomics.com)](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/existing-home-sales-months-supply-fed-data.html)  Traditionally, 6 months of existing home supply represented a balanced market. We can see the current supply remains far below that.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMy opinion is still the same.\n\nInflation will prove stickier. Housing will remain high. People who build homes turned that off, existing home listings remain way down, the supply to the market is low. People do not have to sell their house because they are employed, gaining income, and have savings. Household debt is in fantastic shape and consumers can easily withstand increases in it. The labor market continues to favor employees to switch jobs, demand better wages.\n\nTherefor, the Fed will keep rates higher until it causes the labor market, consumer spending, housing, to turn appreciably negative (shallow recession). It won't cut the rate unless the recession turns ugly. The stock market will grind lower. \n\nBlack Swan:\n\nChina COVID. Who knows how the supply chain gets disrupted, the level of global infections could be higher than ever seen, it could spawn a new variant that is more deadly, more contagious, evades prior antibodies better.
