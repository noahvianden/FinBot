{"title": "Abnormal Volatility skew for options next week on SPY. (Dec 16th)", "selftext": "Im sure everyone here is aware of the market events next week, the biggest ones being FOMC and CPI both happening at the beginning of the week. I noticed a few days ago that there is a very considerable skew in option prices for that Friday that has puts trading at 10% more than calls. This makes sense because people are more willing to pay for downside protection. My confusion is why the skew is not AT ALL present in options expiring on the 13th(CPI) and 14th(FOMC) or even the 15th. To give some numbers lets track the price for ATM contracts expiring next week. \n\nLets look at 397$ calls expiring each day of the week.\n\nThey start at 2.38(monday)->4.7(cpi)->5.6(fomc)->5.95->5.97(Friday)\n\nNow lets take a look at 396$ puts.\n\nThey start at 2.63(monday)->4.85(cpi)->5.8(fomc)->5.97->7(Friday)\n\nAs u can see there is a pretty massive discrepancy on friday. \n\nTo me it seems like people are only worried about the downside of only Friday of next week but not the previous days with very volatile events, which makes little sense to me.

Yet, Tesla bulls who want Tesla to issue a sharebuybacks are the insane ones?\n\nLet's look at what REALLY happened.\n\nElon aligned Tesla with Twitter the moment he used Tesla shares as collateral for Twitter's failing business. He overpaid, tried to get out of it, knew he was just going to keep dragging on this case only to lose and have to burn lawyer fees so he fought it off as long as he could and then gave up when the court proceeding was close.\n\nDid Tesla investors want this to happen? Nope. But Tesla investors want a reasonable sharebuyback or declaration of such because of Tesla's low future P/E and huge cashflow coming in every year = Gary Black is an idiot? KoGuanLeo (who is the largest individual shareholder of Tesla by the price paid) has no say in any of this? But Elon Musk, who put Tesla shares at jeopardy because he wants 'free speech' on Twitter is somehow void of all criticism? Get your head outta your asses, people. Here is the fact and why investors are upset.\n\nWe know that Tesla is tied to Twitter and right now, negatively so. But what happens if Twitter succeeds? Do Tesla investors get anything out of this? So WE, investors, take the risk having to deal with this Twitter negativity but get NO REWARD from this if Twitter succeeds. So who does this help? It only helps Musk. That's why he's sleeping at Twitter's HQ. He can't let this $44 billion investment of his go to waste. IMO, that's why he's sending Tom Zhu to Austin. Austin is poised to have a huge year with the Cybertruck and ramping up quicker than Berlin as well as taking advantage of the IRA credits which I'm sure Tom Zhu will be responsible for in Austin. Musk is probably going to be hanging around California to mess around with Twitter some more so he can't travel to Austin as frequently as he would like, aka, Tom Zhu reports directly to him. Okay, that's fine and understandable, yet, the question is: How does Twitter serve Tesla? It doesn't. But Tesla serves Twitter...?\n\nMy point is: Elon is putting his own self-interest over the interest of Tesla shareholders and him as a CEO knows better. Admittedly, sleeping in Twitter's HQ is just a joke if you're a Tesla shareholder. Why the F do we want you to sleep at Twitter's HQ when you received tens of billions in stock options?\n\nAnd I say this as a staunch Elon defender. I think he has massively underperformed this year as a CEO of Tesla. While I agree on many of his stances on Twitter and free speech, that should never have been his responsibility to take on. He should have been better prepared to have someone in mind to take over Twitter and he'd just be the person who bought the business.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "He's been in charge of Twitter for a little over a month vs Tesla where he was in charge basically for the better part of the last decade.

{"title": "Analysis of Rackspace RXT - Easiest short in the market atm", "selftext": "Coming from someone in the industry, I wanted to give an overview of why Rackspace RXT is in meltdown mode and is an easy short right now. The street is now finally waking up to the events that started back on Dec. 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- On Dec. 2nd their hosted exchange service went offline. This is email service that runs many of their business customers. Nobody had access to their mail/contacts/calendars as well as incoming email. They finally recommended a solution to move your services to their biggest competitor, Microsoft 365. This got email flowing but is far from a solution. All historical email is not available so far\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Read their facebook page and all the comments. People that use this service are small micro companies with less than 10 employees. They are not technical people and relied on support to help them with this workaround. Support was so overwhelmed nobody responded to any tickets. \n\n\\- Its now a week after this incident, and while customers are getting new email, historical email is gone. Not a real solution\n\n\\- Earlier this week they announced it was a ransomware attack. Great the files are locked, restore historical email from backups. If there were any backups that would have been done by now so reading between the lines the only way to get this data back is to pay off the hackers. Backups, uptime, and top cyber security is what is in all their marketing and terms of service. Complete lie about this\n\n\\- They retained a cyber security firm to help deep dive into what happened. This will take weeks to complete so nobody is getting historical email during this time\n\n\\- 2 class action lawsuits have already been filed with more to come. They are going to have to answer why there was no business continuity or backups in place\n\n\\- I predict in the coming weeks we will get confirmation the data was ex filtrated aka in the hands of the hackers which will be sold on the dark web if they are not paid off. This is years and years of customer email data. Wonder why you get scam messages via email and text and wondering how they got your contact? its from incompetent companies like this that are not protecting your data. This will be the nail in the coffin\n\n\\- The service generates 30 mil in revenue. They do make a billion a year, so generally a smaller portion of their business. This goes way beyond that. The after math over the coming months of what just happened in the past week will come out and they will get punished.
