Powell will have to acknowledge the trend of inflation going down two months in a row. (Bullish)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 2. Flip side is Powell will probably say it is to early to clam victory which would be neutral/bearish depending on how he says it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Powell will also probably double down on job importance and how it gives them room to stay higher for longer. ( Also Bearish)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.

{"title": "Profit driven inflation, not wage inflation?", "selftext": "\nI came across this article (see below) highlighting why the author thinks the Fed's rate hikes have failed to control inflation. \nI'm no economist so looking for some THOUGHTFUL insight into this as its sort of anecdotal. If inflation is driven by profits then how to curb it?\n[*not sure what flair to choose]\n\n\nThe Fed Is Dead \u2013 OpEd\n December 14, 2022\nBy Robert Reich\n\nThe Fed is meeting Tuesday. Wednesday, presumably, it will raise interest rates again in its continuing attempt to stem inflation by slowing the economy.\n\nBut the Fed\u2019s rate hikes aren\u2019t working. Despite seven straight increases in just nine months, totaling a whopping 4.25 percentage points \u2014 a pace not seen since the Fed\u2019s inflation fight in the 1980s \u2014 price increases are still hovering near four-decade highs.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s rate hikes are slowing the economy, but not prices. Why not?\n\nThe Fed\u2019s failure to stem inflation is partly due to events outside the United States \u2014 Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, China\u2019s lockdown, and post-COVID demand worldwide exceeding worldwide supplies of all sorts of materials and components.\n\nBut it\u2019s also because domestic inflation is being driven by profits, not wages. And interest rate hikes don\u2019t reduce profit-driven inflation \u2014 at least not directly. Instead, workers and consumers take the hit.\n\nLabor costs increased 5.3 percent over the past year. But prices rose 7.3 percent. This means the real purchasing power of American workers continues to drop.\n\nForget the 1970s wage-price spiral when real average earnings continued to rise for much of the decade. Now, workers are taking it on the chin.\n\nProfits have grown faster than labor costs for seven of the past eight quarters. As Paul Donovan, chief economist for UBS\u2019s Global Wealth Management, wrote last week, \u201ctoday\u2019s price inflation is more a product of profits than wages.\u201d\n\nCorporate profits surged to a record high of $2.08 trillion in the third quarter of this year, even as inflation continued to squeeze workers and consumers. Over the last two years, quarterly profits have ballooned more than 80 percent, from around $1.2 trillion to more than $2 trillion.\n\nExecutives of big companies across America continue to tell Wall Street they can keep prices high or raise them even higher. As Pepsi Co. financial chief Hugh Johnston said on his company\u2019s third quarter earnings call, \u201c [we\u2019re] capable of taking whatever pricing we need.\u201d\n\nNot every business is raking it in, to be sure. Most small businesses aren\u2019t sharing in the profit bonanza because everything they need for putting stuff on the shelves has gone up in price.\n\nBut the big ones have never done as well. \n\nIn fact, rather than slowing corporate price increases, the Fed\u2019s rate hikes seem to be having the opposite effect.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. If I run a big corporation, I\u2019m not going to lower my prices and profits in the face of a pending economic slowdown. I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep them as high as possible for as long as I can.\n\nI\u2019ll reduce my prices and profits only when the Fed\u2019s higher rates begin hurting consumers enough that they stop buying stuff at my high prices because they can find better deals elsewhere.\n\nYet if I have a monopoly or near-monopoly \u2014 as is increasingly the case with big American corporations \u2014 my consumers won\u2019t have much choice. If they want and need my stuff, they\u2019ll continue to buy at the higher prices.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ll keep telling them I have no choice but to keep raising my prices because my costs keep increasing \u2014 even though that\u2019s bunk because I\u2019m increasing my profit margins.\n\nEventually, the Fed could raise interest rates so high that the cost of borrowing makes it impossible for consumers \u2014 whose wages, remember, are already dropping, adjusted for inflation \u2014 to afford what I\u2019m selling, thereby forcing me to stop raising my prices.\n\nBut by this time, people will be hurting. Many will have lost economic ground. Some will have become impoverished. A large number of jobs will have been lost.\n\nThe Fed should stop believing it can easily stop profit-price inflation by hiking interest rates. It should pause interest-rate hikes long enough to see \u2014 and allow the nation to see \u2014 they\u2019re harming workers and consumers more than corporations that continue to rake in record profits.  \n\nThe government should use other means to tame inflation. Like what?\n\nLike windfall profits taxes as California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom has proposed for oil companies there, and Representative Ro Khanna and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse have proposed nationally (taxing the difference between the current price of oil per barrel and the average cost between 2015 and 2019).\n\nLike tough antitrust enforcement aimed at reducing the pricing power of big corporations (as Lina Kahn is attempting at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter is trying at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department).\n\nLike a new antitrust law that allows enforcers to bust up big corporations (and prevent them from buying other businesses) when they\u2019re powerful enough to continue raising their prices higher than their costs are rising. (Could Republicans in Congress be coaxed into supporting this? I believe so.)\n\nIt\u2019s important that Americans know the truth. Seven Fed rate hikes in just nine months have barely dented corporate power to raise prices and profit margins. \n\nWhich is why the Fed is putting the onus of fighting inflation on workers and consumers rather than on the corporations responsible for it.\n\nThis is wrong. It\u2019s bad economics. It\u2019s insane politics. And it\u2019s profoundly unfair.", "id": "zlnqp1", "created_utc": 1671014393.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Biden has increased the amount of American $$ by printing and increasing the supply by 41%, the end result of this will be decreasing the buying power on the American dollar by 41%.  The world is dependent on diesel, and Russia produces a lot of it.  America has cut its production and has shut down 75% of its refineries over the past 50 years and with all the regulations no more will be built as more continue to close because of the cost to bring them up to current codes.  Shutting down the Keystone pipeline deprived us from Millions of barrels of Canadian oil.  So we grow more and more dependent on Foreign oil.  Raising wages results in employers having to raise prices to remain in Business or maintain profitability and they always round up to keep the %.  The Huge Political push for EV's and the constant promises to get us off our dependency on Fossil Fuels has removed any incentives for Oil Companies to spend huge amounts of $$ drilling new wells that may take 20 years to pay for themselves.  So the $$ they had set aside for exploration, drilling, putting in new pipelines, they are not spending so their profit margins appear much larger than normal.  This will result in them paying more taxes automatically.  (less write-offs).  Housing and rents have exploded over the past few years.  We will likely  see a slight dip over the next couple of years.  But it will be temporary.  It would not at all surprize me if housing priced double over the next 8 years.  For several reasons.  We are 2,000,000 short of the number of houses we should have.  Higher interest rates, materials costs and labor costs, will drive prices up, what contractor will build a house and sell it at a loss?  When the war in Ukraine ends, where will all the materials come from to rebuild their Country?  They will flood out of several Countries, but most likely we will supply more than our share (as we always do) and basic supply and demand will have our contractors competing for materials and costs will skyrocket.  Illegal immigration is costing us a lot.   Hurricanes and floods have destroyed a lot of buildings that demand a lot of materials to rebuild.  Jeep is now moving to Mexico to escape higher labor costs and stay competitive.  Homelessness is costing us a lot.

The median target is essentially what is penciled in for projections by the 7 board of governors and 12 district bank presidents. \n\nSo rightnow we're at about 4% fed funds rate so that implies a .5% rate hike this meeting. This is already widely expected. This does not matter at all\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll eyes are on the 2023 and 2024 projections\n\nfor 2023, they're looking at 4.6% as the median so likely they're thinking a .25 rate hike and then pause.\n\nnow in 2024  they want 3.9% so that's imply about a .75 rate cut. So they will essentially back track two rate hikes. The 25 bp in 2023 and the 50 bp that we get here in December 2022. \n\nSo here's the bad scenario..\n\nWe see the 2023 median projections going to 5% or higher and we see a smaller cut in 2024 or no cut at all.

My thoughts are that this will likely remain very close to what was projected in September. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps, and in the next hour and half, I'll try to get the new projections posted and give narrative to it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso note that 2023 rate hike cuts are largely unexpected.

{"title": "12-14-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis (FOMC review", "selftext": "Lets start with a quick recap of a few things from FOMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wawrv2hlrx5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=39238a222bb21d077d7404d02d19d78644816a38\n\nMarkets actually accepted this news as fairly bullish. The real question will be how the markets digest this news over night and tomorrow. We also have monthly OPEX to start thinking about Friday too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp81eoimrx5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9dd0be95e6f5c13b17502de5de3eec2e3ca662\n\nThis morning  we attempted to break back into that channel at 405.3, however, we had a real nice rejection there. We still are holding this larger red rising wedge though so as I mentioned before realistically until we break through that support I don\u2019t think any short position is worth it. \n\nThere is quite a case being made that we are stuck in this 390.1 to 405.3 range for the foreseeable future. Every day we get to a point where we think we might finally get some answers and a sense of direction for the future and every day we are just left with more questions. \n\nBull case is that we did hold daily 8ema and tomorrow we will attempt to retake the daily 200ema and close over 402.5 reisistance. If bulls can take out 405.3 resistance and close back in the grey channel we will have another attempt at 410 and eventually 419.5 would be the target.\n\nBear case is that we hard rejected 405.3 resistance after we lost it as support yesterday. That should confirm that as a resistance and therefore we should expect support at 390.1 to be tested first. With losing the daily 200em again the next step is for bears to bear through the red rising wedge support at 397 tomorrow. This should open up downside to retest 394 support and eventually 390.1 support. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szp86gjorx5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e511463f274ceebc7d91e5a7b30dbd8821dfed68\n\nFutures is still riding the rising wedge and also its daily 8, 20 and 200ema as support. We do have a nice hammer candle followed by doji double top at 4055 though. \n\nKey resistance- 4095 -> 4180\n\nKey support- 4020 -> 3965 -> 3935\n\nTaking a look at tesla it actually had a pretty small day movement wise only moving $6.31 total which is about 63% of its normal 10 day range. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n157 remains support here and for now we hold the red bear channel inside the falling wedge. \n\nSupport- 157 -> 151.8 -> 146.3  \n resistance- 160.7 -> 167.9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zientnaprx5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=685ae361118bdb3c15fd1eb118c684f37fea658b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cucda6uprx5a1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9a9877201dd946210d2b0c139b833e74a480589\n\nFactoring in the cycles we are not 3 days and 1.9% over the average sell off length and %.... we should be looking for about a 4 day 14.04% bounce which puts us right near $177 by December 20th. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8pulrlrrx5a1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=befbb2b3059fd1bfe889ed5a444bc1d42d201f37\n\nEveryday I think more and more that they should just delist the VIX\u2026 its so beyond detached from reality and how it used to behave its not funny. For instance today we actually saw the vix dumping into FOMC which is absolutely insane considering there was a lot of information markets knew they would get. I get market is on straight bull mode right now and seem to think that everything is good news\u2026 but it\u2019s a little ridiculous to not see any sort of move up on the VIX before FOMC\u2026 its also even more interesting the fact that the VIX continued to sell off EOD.\n\nI get that the information is now out there but there was a lot of non-dovish data released and JPOW was not nearly as dovish as he was back at that presser on November 30th. With the VIX dumping back under the daily 8ema it should be looking for that 19.7 range again. \n\nMarket technical and overall information received at FOMC and whats to come in 2023 makes me bearish, however, the VIX makes me cautiously bullish. \n\n**Daily ta-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8j1pi9urx5a1.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d5aaa312da8e2684827d766cac0d374331750e8\n\nI went into today with a plan based off the data of the FOMCs from 2022 and how markets moved going into FOMC and how it moved during FOMC. \n\nThe plan was overnight swing calls (would printed 30-50% if you held through open), I had planned to play calls at 145pm (however we got a huge 130pm pop and premiums were already insanely priced so I sat that play out), I mentioned puts at exactly 2pm which would have been a great play (if you could get a fill), I thought 235pm calls was still a high probability play (markets got a huge pop at 235pm) and then based off the last two meetings 3pm puts were a great play (however, this meeting they woulda been a bust).\n\nNo one has a magic crystal ball and no one can for sure predict exactly how market will react on a day like today. I researched previous FOMCs for the highest probability plays based on the past. The past does not always predict the future. Today was the first FOMC where we never even saw a 2pm spike and where we straight dropped as soon as 2pm hit.\n\nDays like FOMC are even more risky than CPI. CPI is essentially a 50/50 chance (unless you strangle and we get a huge move)\u2026 days like FOMC you are attempting to catch the move without wrecking yourself in the mean time. This FOMC had numerous opportunities to enter plays, however, unlike most FOMCs if you held through any substantial green you immediately regretted it. \n\nI look forward to the fact that CPI/ FOMC is over and that we have nothing significant intraday for a very long time\u2026 note- we do have monthly opex and quarterly option expiration coming up this week and end of December but those days while volatile are not anything like FOMC or CPI days. \n\nFinal note- on high volatility days and extremely risky days 99% of people are better off not trading at all. Most people cant stomach a lotto the way they need to be in order to succeed. If you aren\u2019t willing to sometimes watch your position go to -50% before it goes to 100% due to volatility then its not for you. Most people don\u2019t size appropriately for lottos either in a way that doesn\u2019t wreck their day or week or month. In the end $5k is a truck load of money to some and $5k isn\u2019t even a thought to others.
