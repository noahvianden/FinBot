{"title": "DOL Claims number coming out tomorrow at 1:30 PM, Unemployment Coming Out Friday, December 02 2022.", "selftext": "The initial jobless claims number from the Department of Labor will be coming out at 8:30 in the morning tomorrow, December 01 2022.\n\nFrom the Department of Labor's  November 23 2022 release of Initial Jobless Claims, Seasonally adjusted data, the 4-week moving average of jobless claims remains unchanged at 226,750. Because of this, the initial jobless claims is almost guaranteed to have a hard time beating expectations of 235,000. The news embargo usually prevents numbers from being leaked early,  but markets will make the move opposite of what is going to happen for the rest of the day 4-5 minutes before the numbers are released.\n\nUnemployment will also be released by the Department of Labor by 8:30 AM in the morning on Friday, December 02 2022. The news embargo usually prevents numbers from being leaked early, but 4-5 minutes before the news release, the market will move in a direction opposite to what is going to happen for the rest of the day. \n\nCredit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are both expecting inline reporting of the results, with actual 3.7% unemployment vs expected 3.7% unemployment. \n\nUnemployment % formula can be found below:\n\nUnemployment % = Expected deviation of Initial Jobless Claims + Prior Year's Insured Unemployment Rate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/event/9c689bbf-af2a-4f65-81a8-c5f5e2b78d70](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/event/9c689bbf-af2a-4f65-81a8-c5f5e2b78d70)\n\n\\-contains the deviation percentage between expected an actual jobless claims\n\n[https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf)\n\n\\-contains the Prior Year's Insured Unemployment rate\n\n[https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/initial-jobless-claims-294](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/initial-jobless-claims-294)\n\n\\-contains the expected jobless claims for tomorrow\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on the initial jobless claims number from November 23rd, we will be looking at around 3.52% - 3.6% expected unemployment. These estimates however can change when actual jobless claims come out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Thursday, obtaining cheap, out of the money put options first thing tomorrow morning would be an extremely good play regardless of how much overreaction has occurred during the data release.\n\nWhether the market continues to sell off into option expiry or not is dependent on Federal Reserve speaker Barr's prepared remarks. An off-topic speech would certainly result in a trend reversal, while an on-topic speech would result in a continuation of the trend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Friday,  the unemployment data would likely be slightly lower than expected.  It would be a very good idea to secure out of the money call options first thing in the morning, regardless of the overreaction that has already happened during the news release. \n\nAny price action after 1PM will be dependent on updates from President Biden on various issues like the gig economy, railway strike, prison terms for marijuana repeat offenders. However, by the time Biden issues an update on a key issue, there will likely already be a better play than just betting for the general market to gap up.\n\n[https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/?ruling=true](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/?ruling=true)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit\n\nSorry guys, I wrote that claims number would be coming out at 1:30 PM instead of 8:30 AM.

There's simply no way in hell that the good times are here to stay considering:\n\n1. We're reversing QE after a decade and a half of the economy relying on infinite money printing,\n\n2. We're raising interest rates to 5%+ after nearly two decades of almost 0% rates,\n\n3. Britain will be entering a severe economic depression soon due to the fact that the pound inflation is out of hand and they're fukt if they raise rates much further. They basically get to choose between inflation and not being able to import anything or crashing their economy,\n\n4. The Russian seaborne oil ban kicks in on Dec 5th which may have unintended economic and geopolitical consequences, \n\n5. Markets bottom after the Fed starts cutting, not while they're still raising rates with the pain yet to even be felt, and the list goes on and on.\n\nAny bulls that remain must reconcile the above and think to themselves, \"The good times are here to stay!\" Highly unlikely that we enter a new era of growth in the next year. \n\nMy recommendation?
