( Of course, pe does not tell you immediately that the something is cheap, so research has to be done) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi8b5sarz1h81.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=10466200c66ec9451267b12efe91b201ba820cbf\n\nFor long-term investing this can be interesting to research. What got me on the idea to research it ( I am not saying that I am going to buy) is an interesting case that can be found in the richer, wiser, happier book about Nomad investing. \n\n**Here is the interesting piece of text:**\n\nThe supply of bargains dwindled as fears receded and markets revived. So Sleep and Zakaria ventured to one of the few remaining pockets of despair. In 2004, they crossed the border from South Africa into Zimbabwe. Under Robert Mugabe\u2019s despotic rule, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy was paralyzed by corruption, a currency collapse, the nationalization of many privately owned farms, and mobs of looters. Undaunted, Sleep and Zakaria bought a basket of four Zimbabwean stocks\u2014virtual monopolies that traded as if they were almost worthless. Zimm, a cement producer, sold on the stock exchange in Harare for one-seventieth of the replacement cost of its assets. Writing to Nomad\u2019s investors about the perverse appeal of this detested market, Sleep remarked, \u201cThe clients will hate it. Compliance will hate it. The consultants will hate it. Marketing will hate it. The size of the investment opportunity is tiny. It is not part of the benchmark.\u2026 It\u2019s perfect.\u201d For a while, Nomad valued its basket of bargains at zero because trading on Zimbabwe\u2019s stock exchange ceased entirely. The economy remained a catastrophe. Still, by the time Nomad sold the last of its Zimbabwean stocks in 2013, they\u2019d risen between threefold and eightfold. As a souvenir, Sleep and Zakaria gave each Nomad shareholder a worthless banknote for 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, which the government had issued at the height of hyperinflation.\n\nNot as extreme as in Turkey, but I think it can be an interesting case to look for potential bargains ( which after the research has to be decided if there are some potential bargains) to research for long-term investing!\n\nWhat do you think?

You can look at the seventies but that was kind of an independent experience. Completely different demographic. Baby boomers were spitting out kids like bunnies. Today we still have virtually the same population trend as 2019 which is nowhere near as inflationary. Aging populations are even more of a thing in Europe and Japan. In the '80s we spent our way out of inflation which might be some of the strategy today. As much as price increases like this are shocking it's actually better to have some inflation and strong growth than low inflation and low growth at least from a market perspective. People who visit the gas station and grocery store frequently May disagree with me on that. There's one thing you really have to keep in mind. If the Fed makes a policy error and Tightens too much and GDP falls inflation will definitely come down but the problem is, what next? I'm sure there is a lot of talk on what the strategy is going to be because if they go too far they're going to have to quickly reverse course and start stimulating again. That's exactly what no one wants. Personally I'm hopeful they do something like tighten a quarter point. Wait, watch a few months of data and if necessary do one more all the while making sure not to flatten the yeild curve or especially invert it. If there is a policy error the trade that will likely work is long bonds. That's exactly the trade that won't work if things go as advertised. \n\nWhat would I do? What have I been recommending? Dollar cost average spy. Stay away from individual stocks until there is more clarity. If you want a little more risk start buying the Russell. Dollar cost average that. If things go south and we wind up in a 30% plus correction you shouldn't panic if you're holding one of those two. If you're holding some high PE stock, well in 2002 a lot of those were down over 90%. They never came back. I'm not saying that's going to happen this time but there is a possibility. Especially with companies that aren't profitable. Even sectors like energy which have been working really well lately. What do you think happens to that if growth falls from a policy error? That's the thing about all of the individual bets. You're pretty much betting one direction or the other on how the FED turns out. At least with the indexes right now if you're on the wrong side of it you're not going to panic. If things work out sure you left a little money on the table versus higher risk strategies. However if things go south you can comfortably dollar cost average. The last point I will make about energy is right before the financial crisis oil was over $100 a barrel and closing in on $150. It went negative in 2020. If you get any energy sector exposure you need to have very hard and fast rules for an exit if the position starts moving against you.

They have done this before so it's not a new thing. The big question is where will the money flow? Bonds have already adjusted to higher rates. The December fed funds futures, right now it's priced about like 1.5 to 1.75% on the Fed rate. Holding cash is a short-term thing. I mean if someone had been doing that look at what they lost just with inflation. So that's kind of the conundrum. You can buy stocks now. Maybe they go down. Maybe they don't. I mean businesses adjust prices higher to offset inflation. Where you can get into trouble with stocks is if GDP does come to a halt. That will be the real policy error this time if they tighten so much and then have to immediately backtrack. It's extremely unusual to have the FED tighten right after so much stimulus but then again it's unusual to have inflation right after a recession. One kind of loose rule with most markets is if it's trading above the 21 month moving average generally bullish. If it's trading below, generally bearish. All of the monthly moving averages on spy are still trending up. The 21 month is all the way down at 4000. You can look at the angle of Ascension from 2008 or actually 2009 onward and it's one slope. We have been traveling since March at a much more aggressive slope. There's also a lot more money in circulation chasing the same amount of assets. Part of the reason I'm just dollar cost averaging the index this year is because there is absolutely no clarity on what's going on. We have a situation with no historical similarity. A Fed that typically helps out the market. Midterms in November. Inflation is likely to come down as productivity picks back up without even hiking rates so the combination of the two is definitely going to do it. This is an uncertain Market. If the s&p goes down you can cost average into that without worrying. If you own an individual company. Your risk is greatly increased. You can have multiple compression. You can have earnings that never come back. The stock can fall out of favor. You can have all kinds of things happen so when things get rocky typically I index up and that's why.  The really crazy part is if this goes to hell in a handbasket and is a repeat of 2001 to 2002 with that run up we had since March 2020 very similar to the 1998 bottom to the 2000 top. If we are in a situation like that and I'm not saying we are but the funny thing is a full 50% retrace from our high puts us right back at the March 2020 low creating a long-term double bottom.

{"title": "Disney's Q1 earnings were better than expected, and the share price of chaonaifei, a new subscriber of Disney + Rose 8% after hours", "selftext": "Walt Disney Co., the world's largest entertainment company The first quarter results report released after hours on Wednesday showed that earnings per share and revenue exceeded expectations, and streaming media subscribers approached 130 million, reversing the downward trend. After the earnings announcement, Disney's share price soared 8% in after hours trading.\n\nThe quarterly financial report as of January 1, 2022 shows that Disney's adjusted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter is $1.06, and the market is expected to be 63 cents; The revenue was US $21.82 billion, compared with us $16.25 billion in the same period last year, and the market expectation was US $20.91 billion; The total subscribers of its streaming media service Disney + were 129.8 million, higher than 118.1 million in the previous fiscal quarter, and the market expectation was 125.75 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0zqo57e2zg81.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a3039b2a4193a3a79a32f94078db780511a510\n\nThe growth of streaming media subscribers remains strong\n\nIn the first fiscal quarter, the revenue of Disney's media and entertainment distribution business reached US $14.59 billion, a year-on-year increase of 15%; The operating profit reached US $808 million, a year-on-year decrease of 44%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dhgdhnat2zg81.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=44a4a778b4a22f8b535b2910ddca1af55d582a90\n\nThe number of subscribers to Disney + increased by nearly 12 million to 129.8 million in the first quarter. This means that in the last three months of 2021, Disney's user increment has exceeded that of streaming media giant Netflix. As Netflix admitted last month, competition may be eroding its user base. Netflix added 8.3 million new users in the last quarter, and its total number of global users reached 222 million.\n\nThe average revenue per user (ARPU) of Disney + in the United States and Canada also increased to $6.68 from $5.80 a year ago.\n\nDisney has invested billions of dollars in new programs, hoping to take a share in the online video market dominated by Netflix and bet its future on a direct to consumer strategy.\n\nDisney executives had expected Disney + to see stronger growth in subscriptions in the second half of this year than in the first half. More original content will be released on the platform in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nChristine McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, said on the earnings conference call that the company expected to invest a lot of money in streaming media in the second quarter. She said that the company's program and production costs for direct consumer business are expected to increase by about $800 million to $1 billion, including the program production costs of Hulu live broadcast.\n\nBob chapek, CEO of the company, said Disney was bidding for the broadcasting right of NFL Sunday tickets to further deepen streaming media.\n\nAlthough Netflix's latest financial report showed that the growth of users slowed down and led to a sharp drop in its share price, chapek reiterated the performance guidance that Disney + users will reach 230 million to 260 million by 2024.\n\nReturn of Paradise business\n\nAs concerns about Omicron subsided, the relaxation of government restrictions and the release of pent up demand brought strong traffic to Disney theme park.\n\nThe revenue of Disneyland, experience and consumer goods reached $7.2 billion in the quarter, twice that of $3.6 billion in the same period last year. The division's operating profit jumped to $2.5 billion, compared with a loss of $100 million in the same period last year.\n\nDisney said the revenue growth came from more guests visiting its theme park, staying in brand hotels and booking cruise ships.\n\nAfter closing most Disney branded retail stores in the second half of 2021, the company's consumer goods business revenue decreased by 8.5% to $1.5 billion.\n\n\"This year is the last year of Walt Disney's first 100 years. Such achievements, coupled with our unparalleled collection of assets and platforms, creative ability and unique position in culture, make me very confident that we will continue to define entertainment in the next 100 years.\" Chapek said.\n\nAfter the announcement of the financial report, Disney's share price soared 8% after trading on Wednesday. The stock closed up 3.33% at $147.23 in regular trading.

Welcome To The EV Revolution!!\n\nIn The Past - The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 ... HISTORY LESSON -  Industrial Revolution, in modern history, **the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing**. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society. ..... Today we are repeating the process with New Technology from A.I, MetaVerse to The EV Space and today I wanted to share those industries that will help support and grow That SPACE - Charging Stations....\n\nI like $EVGO for so many reasons...  formerly Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation, is a public fast charging network for electric vehicles (EVs). The Company's fast charging network is powered by renewable energy.  It Provides charging services close to where drivers live, work and play, whether for a daily commute or a commercial fleet.   Trading Up today and over the last Five Days from $7.40 on February the 4th - to $10.31 today!! with a 52 week High of 20.60 which occurred on February 12, 2021.... \n\nThe New Power is in those who control the source - Just Like Oil was King for The Past Industrial Resolution - Charging Stations - \"The New Standard Oils Of The World\" will help to control the \"The EV Revolution\"  $EVGO has a current Market Cap value of over 2 Billion and has started an infrastructure that partners with local and national businesses establishing over 800 Charging stations and growing - YES there are others out there - President Biden Mention One and the stock soared for that day over 100%... Many Retail investors will miss this portion of the EV Revolution... while we chase $LCD, $TSLA and $RVIN.... they all need Charging Stations - Just like our Past Billionaires Knew - The World would Need Fossil Fuels... Think On This - Our World will Need Charging Stations!!! $EVGO\n\n>Side Bar and Quick Note -   \"Subaru opens reservations for Solterra EV and announces a charging partnership with EVgo\" - there are rumors of Exxon liking the EVGO technology and putting them in an already established Massive Infrastructure of Fossil Fuel Stations that Exxon Controls\n\nEVgo\u2019s owned and operated charging network serves over 65 metropolitan areas across 34 states. EVgo offers its services to EV drivers, business owners, policymakers, fleets and automakers.  The EV Revolution Is Here -  Shell, BP, Chevron and others are starting to embrace the notion of offering customers other options besides gasoline fill-ups in an attempt to keep access to wallets and loyalty, regardless of which type of drivetrain rolls in. .... Not Just Me who likes $EVGO -  In the last 3 months, **5 ranked analysts** set 12-month price targets for **EVGO**. The average price target among the analysts is **$13.20**. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8ucxhyhz1h81.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da8ce3b76918d4ae85ef65a80a9e2708ed6bf5b1", "id": "spe2jw", "created_utc": 1644519581.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|42|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|323|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7197c/the_truth_of_how_a_penny_stock_made_a_recovery/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mia2sd/rton_realtime_penny_stock_worth_looking_at/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrrdh8/evgo_the_move_no_one_expected/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpetqq/icon_this_is_what_you_need/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvr1gh/wnbd_one_to_talk_about/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=spe2jw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=spe2jw)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3520824909210205}, {"body": "interesting that u didnt mention $chpt.
