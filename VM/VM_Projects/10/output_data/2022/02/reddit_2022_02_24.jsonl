{"title": "The second biggest opportunities in buying the dip in recent years", "selftext": "The first biggest opportunity was obliviously the starting period of pandemic. I believe a lot of savvy investors had seized that opportunity. Here, I believe, we are facing what could be the second biggest opportunity. \n\nThere are two big dark clouds hovering over the market, one of which is the high inflation and the other is this war panic regarding Ukraine. \n\nI\u2019d like to shed some light on both. Firstly, our currently high inflation, in my opinion, this is a classical macroeconomic event heavy involving misjudgment caused by Central banks worldwide (lead by US Fed) which has been repetitiously occurring for a number of times. \n\nOur currently high inflation situation resembles, in many ways, the Great Inflation happened in 1960-1980 which was originated from an excessive growth in the supply of money from US Fed accompanied by the by-then US President Johnson\u2019s Great Society Initiative. During that time, under the impact of energy crisis the US Fed still continued to assist the administration to achieve what called maximum employment initiative with issuing huge amount of debts and deliberately keeping low interest rates, which eventually lead to the 1960-1980 great inflation. \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jc66lijz5vj81.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=124a8b952a6564e8f136ef2f255a4253fd461b18\n\nA close study of that great inflation period would find us many similarities between that time and ours. What our time has experienced is almost the same thing except for the pandemic with trillions of dollars printed by central banks and the energy crisis caused by the sudden shift to renewable energy called by all the governments worldwide.\n\nA foreseeable consequence based on the experience in the 1960 Great Inflation would be a much higher interest rates compared with prior years, the important question is just by how much will the interest rates go. \n\nClearly, in both instances (ours and the 1960 Great Inflation) we could see the misjudgment of the US Feds. Reminder you that our current Fed chair only recently (in 2020) withdrawn his original idea about inflation was transitory and brought forward around 2 years in terms of hiking interest rate (only a year ago they expected the hiking would be in 2024 including Australian RBA). \n\nWith the expectations of higher interest rate, logically we are having a lower stock market. However, as a long-term investor who only invest in best quality stocks, I\u2019m not that concerned, more importantly we are not in 1980s because of many different changes nowadays. \n\nBut Let me show you the following stock trend after 1960 Great Inflation when the by-then US Fed Paul Volcker conquered the great inflation by hiking the interest rates to as high as 19%. Interestingly, when interest rates reached all time high at almost 19%, the stock market had actually bottomed. But it took a number of years until S&P500 recached the bottom, after which the market started 2 decades bull trend. Therefore, our biggest question would be how long would it take until our stock price reached the bottom (meaning when is the time to buy the dip), is our market going to be failing for around a decade until it reached its bottom like the Great Inflation period? I think the answer is no. \n\nA thorough thinking on 1960 Great Inflation and the 1982\u2019 beginning of bull market would give use some clues on how inflation has correlated with the interest rate and stock market. Based on various charts in this post, one would find the stock market eventually bottomed when the interest rate peaked with correspondingly lower inflation (also unemployment peaked at 11%) in 1982.  \n\nA deeper look at that time and background gives me the answer that our situation largely depends on how long it takes for the Fed to realize their misjudgment and revise their policies.\n\nIt took the former Fed and administration a decade to realize their misjudgment in 1960-1980 and remediated their policies. In contrast, it took 2 years for current US Fed revised their original thinking and now they are already for hiking. This is a good signal for us. \n\nAdditionally, employment goes very well and we have lots of new technologies to tackle energy crisis such as EVs and solar power when comparing with the 1960s-1980s. As a result, I\u2019m actually more optimistic than many peers about our current situation due to the above factors. As a matter of fact, this situation is the one I\u2019ve been waiting and prepared for a year as I\u2019ve been selling many high PE but low-quality stocks to accumulate cash for this big dip. But I\u2019m still holding my many-year low PE high cash flow holdings like Apple, Berkshire due to the reason that they are the best ones and most likely they would never drop to my purchase price when I made after the start of this pandemic. \n\n \n\n[\\<S&P500 in 1960-1980\\>](https://preview.redd.it/xze1xvc06vj81.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=560dbf9d72605d215f0c5b1425d484f88587ef29)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nbclpa716vj81.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=41d3778a6d98a688f6173b02f6e3087b8d0bee36\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond dark cloud we are facing is the war panic or concern, it\u2019s a sensitive topic but actually, it\u2019s what I want to discuss is very short. Yes, and there will be energy concern regarding this, and also there is potential risk of an expanding war.

Personally, I only invest in most called \"growth\" companies which in either S&P500 or Nasdaq because as a young investor I wound like to take the risk to get 10-20 times return otherwise what's the point of investing in share market. I bought Tesla when it was traded at very low price ($300 before 1-5 split) in 2019 and been holding for 2 years got 15 times return nowadays but the experience was torturing because right after I purchased it many Wall Street banks (including JP Morgan) was shorting it and the share was down 40% in 2019 at that time then I continued to purchase some as I just don't believe Wall street/market because I believe in Elon Mask, then  when things getting better the pandemic happened, Tesla again dropped to my purchase price I continued to hold because I purely believe in the management. Eventually it soured to $2500 before 1-5 split and good thing happened.

{"title": "Volatility - HODL", "selftext": "Companies are printing gangbusters and are undergoing massive growth especially in new industries.\n\nRegardless what you own now, you must understand that what\u2019s happening now will course correct very quickly. If Russia doesn\u2019t back off, energy prices will ski rocket, decreasing the demand of goods, causing inflation to decrease. Which means raising interest rates will be stopped. Which means the growth just like 2020 right after the great dip will occur again. \n\nOnly sector I\u2019ll buy is energy, defense won\u2019t move that much unless we have WW3 (unlikely) in the short term. I\u2019m HODLing everything else!\n\nSo what will happen until energy is figured out again? Interest rates plummet. Fed won\u2019t raise interest anymore. (Speculation on my end). Then Biden will legalize the Canadian pipe line and allow natural gas to flow to offset what Russia is doing. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/energy/us-natural-gas/index.html\n\nSo my move!?\n\nEV! Yes! Why? The world is waking up to how bad burning fossils fuels is from a geopolitical standpoint. Why is Russia having so much leverage on Europe? Oil and Gas!! Why did Saudi Arabia make Aramco public? To get money and run!  Plus world is legislating out of ICE vehicles: https://insideevs.com/news/534890/countries-states-gas-car-bans/\n\nTesla is my HODL because not only are they doing EV, they\u2019re doing battery storage, home solar and batteries. My next HODL NIO, LCID, GGPI.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, what\u2019s happening is exactly shows you why companies like Tesla will dominate. This is why Saudi Arabia et all is heavily focused now on green technology.\n\nAI - with the world where it is, AI will dominate. Palo Alto Networks, Palantir, Snowflake, C3, Tesla, Waymo, Nvidia are all companies that I want to own after this dip. Why? It\u2019ll be the software engine of the new world of green tech infrastructure, self driving cars, security, home automation. Again I like Tesla here due to self driving and what they\u2019re doing in the home. Palantir and Snowflake are my other HODLs. They\u2019re are starting to cure diseases, and every company in the future will run AI software for logistics or security.\n\nDefense &amp; AI - these 2 will be married soon. I\u2019m starting to research it, any ideas? If Lockheed and Palantir create a working relationship I\u2019d double down on both.\n\nApple - its own section.
