{"title": "Expected Moves this Week: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and more.", "selftext": "## Market View\n\n**Last Week \u2013**\u00a0SPY rose 4.7% last week, outpacing to the upside the 2.7% move options were pricing. With that move higher implied volatility of options compressed slightly with the VIX now under 30. This week sees some of the largest cap tech stocks report. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta lead a busy week of earnings, with those 5 companies alone representing about 25% of the S&P 500. The dollar strength factors that have affected some reports already will receive attention in Amazon\u2019s report.\n\nOn the economic calendar, we\u2019ll see GDP, Housing Prices and Consumer Confidence.\n\n**This Week \u2013**\u00a0SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week at 29.7, its lowest levels since the first week of October, but still historically high.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\u00a0(via Options AI)\n\n* SPY\u00a0**2.5%**\u00a0(+/- $10)\n* QQQ\u00a0**3.3%**\u00a0(+/- $9)\n* IWM\u00a0**3%**\u00a0(+/- $5)\n* DIA\u00a0**2.2%**\u00a0(+/- $7)\n\n**Economic Calendar**\n\n* **Tuesday** \u2013 Case Shiller Home Prices, Consumer Confidence\n* **Thursday** \u2013 US GDP\n\n## Selling the Move vs Selling IV\n\nWith implied volatility high the past few weeks we\u2019ve detailed some trade strategies that try to take advantage of, or at least mitigate the inflated cost of options in this environment. With some of the largest market cap companies in the stock market reporting this week, it\u2019s a good time to detail the difference between what high IV does to the expected move, and how much a stock needs to move in order for long premium trades to work, or for short premium trades to fail, versus selling high IV as a strategy in and of itself.\n\nUsing Apple (AAPL), which reports this week as an example, we\u2019ll look at the difference between selling the earnings moves, and selling high IV, by comparing two Iron Condors at different expiries. The first Condor, is set at the expected move for this week, with short strikes at 140, and 155, vs AAPL\u2019s Friday close near $147. The second Condor, expires Dec 18th, and the expected move short strikes set at 135, and 160.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygjv9ikgbov91.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=800fc09a4be5516397545c529faf02e015b75b80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onpd3dnkbov91.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=665a162d5db38eae1b097789293cb9f2b9a32363\n\nThe Condor expiring this week is a pure expected move strategy. If AAPL stays within the breakevens of 138.50, and 158.50, the trade makes money. Outside of that range, the strategy loses money. The level of IV is less important than the pure move AAPL makes this week on earnings. The trade is fairly binary.\n\nHowever, with the Dec 18th condor being $10 wider, it\u2019s less about the move and more about selling high IV in AAPL into earnings (as well as high IV overall in the market). The likelihood of AAPL moving beyond this trade\u2019s breakeven of 132.50 and 162.50 on earnings is not as likely, and therefore the trade is less binary about the move itself and is more a strategy to sell high IV into earnings, with the idea that the trade could be closed for less in the weeks after, with IV lower.\n\n## Earnings This Week\n\nExpected moves for companies reporting this week.

Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).\n\nAll is made to answer the following questions:\n\n* What is its position compared to competitors?\n* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n* INTC is not a dying company\n* INTC downtrend is following the sector and the market movement\n* INTC is a cyclical business, and we are in a down cycle\n* INTC investments will boost its revenues in the next five years\n* USA government will not allow one of its pivotal and strategic company to fail\n* INTC will face more stress as AMD is eating market share\n* INTC\u2019s new products are the top-notch of the sector\n\n# Methodology\n\nWhen the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.\n\n## Secondary Data\n\nSecondary data is the information that doesn\u2019t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:\n\n|Data|Number|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Levered Beta**|**0.71**|\n|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.54**|\n|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|\n|**WACC**|**6.45%**|\n|Hurdle Rate|11.64%|\n|**ROE**|**25.50%**|\n|**EPS**|**4.66**|\n|**P/E**|**5.65**|\n|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|\n|Corp Tax|8.46%|\n|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|\n|Analyst growth estimate|\\-0.16%|\n|Next 5y Analysts growth|12.80%|\n|Intel\u2019s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|\n|Outstanding Shares|4,106,000,000|\n|Earnings distributed|28.41%|\n|Earnings retained|71.59%|\n\n# Macro Economic Data\n\n|Data|Number|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Expected Return|9.40%|\n|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|\n|Risk Premium|5.19%|\n|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|\n|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|\n|Current Market P/E|18.58|\n\n# Evaluation Methods\n\nIn this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.\n\n## Growth Rate\n\n**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%.\n\n## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n\nThis simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of 30 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.45% and its Growth Rate of 18.26% to determine a fair value of **$23.57** per share.\n\n## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n\nThis model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.\n\n**Intrinsic value = EPS \u00d7 \\[(8.5 + (2 \u00d7 Expected annual growth rate, g)\\]**\n\nWhich 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.\n\nIn 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to\n\n**Intrinsic value = \\[EPS \u00d7 (8.5 + 2\\*g) \u00d7 4.4\\]/Y**\n\nIn this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.\n\nGraham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.\n\nIn this thesis we use an adjusted formula\n\n**Intrinsic value = \\[EPS \u00d7 (7 + 1\\*g) \u00d7 4.4\\]/Y**\n\nThe P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.\n\nThe used growth rate is the one calculated.\n\nThe '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.\n\nThe interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.\n\nData used for the calculation:\n\n|EPS|4.66|\n|:-|:-|\n|Growth Rate|18.26|\n|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|\n\nThe Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$97.53**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model\n\nA modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.\n\nUnlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable\n\nIn simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.\n\nIn this model, it is taken in mind the following data:\n\n|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Growth rate|18.26%|\n|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|\n|rage Shares outstanding|4,106,000,000|\n\n## Dividend Discount Model\n\nThe dividend discount model (DDM) is a quantitative method used for predicting the price of a company's stock based on the theory that its present-day price is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments when discounted back to their present value.\n\nThe model gives a negative number when companies have a lower rate of return compared to the dividend growth rate. This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings, as per Intel Case. This makes this model not good to be used alone when evaluating a business.\n\nKnowing this, the model is still used here, mainly because the final price tag is determined by the average of all the methods. This choice is made by the necessity of conservative estimates and cautious predictions. The discounted rating used here is the CAPM of 7.01%.\n\nThe model gives the following result:\n\n|Fair Value, taking in count a perpetual growth rate. Here we used the company growth rate of 18.26% and not the average growth rate of the dividends. This is due to the fact that the price given by the dividend growth is considered to be unrealistic for the next five years.|$-15.36|\n|:-|:-|\n|Fair Value assuming a zero growth in the dividends' growth. This price is not used to determine the final value due to the fact that the company has historically paid dividends with constant growth, and it is predicted to not stop this trend.|$24.62|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Total Payout Model\n\nIt is a variation of the DDF that takes in count shares repurchases. With 5.64 Billion paid in dividend in 2021, discount rate of 7.01% (CAPM) and growth rate of 18.26%, this model gives us a price tag of -**$12.22**\n\n## Final Fair Value\n\nThe Final price tag is determined as per following:\n\n|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$23.57|\n|:-|:-|\n|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$97.53|\n|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|$56.67|\n|Dividend Discount Model|$-15.36|\n|Total Payout Model|\\-$12.22|\n|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$30.04**|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Main Competitors\n\nIntel Corporation is in the Semiconductor\u2019s sector.\n\nAs the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.\n\nThe company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.\n\nDespite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.\n\n|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|\n|:-|\n|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|\n|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|\n|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|\n\n# The Products\n\n|**CGC \u2013 Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|\n|:-|\n|**NEX \u2013 Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|\n|**DCAI \u2013 Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|\n|**AXG \u2013 Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|\n|**IFS \u2013 Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|\n|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|\n\n# SWOT Analysis\n\n## Strengths\n\n* **Strong Industry position**: it has a strong market share in its major business segment.

It is trying to enter the mobile phone, tablet and TV segments.\n* **Limited Customer Care in Developing Countries**: the company\u2019s customer care is less active in developing countries, missing new potential customers\n* **Weak R&D**: the company research and development division as a small investment compared to its revenue\n\n## Opportunities\n\n* **High Growth**: its products are expected to be in high demand in the next growth cycle\n* **Increase in Demand:** expected increase in demands for personal computers and servers\n* **Automatic Cars**: this market requires high-tech processors\n* **Drones**: their usage is growing year after year and is a great opportunity for Intel\n* **Developing Countries**: are expected to grow and are an opportunity to acquire new customers and partners\n* **Defence sector:** institutional contractors might demand Intel high-tech processors for strategic tech and services\n\n## Treats\n\n* **Competition**: Intel is a leading leader in its industry and is facing high pressure from competitors such as: AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Samsung\n* **Competitors\u2019 New product launches**:Competitors products are threatening Intel leadership\n* **Price sensitivity**: semiconductor market is a highly price sensitive market and cheaper products from competitors might drastically eat away Intel\u2019s market share\n* **Fluctuating PC sales**: Intel is too dependent on this segment\n* **Harmful regulations**: the company is facing harmful regulations from countries that are trying to erode the sale of Intel\u2019s products\n* **Geopolitical Events**: Semiconductors is a strategic industry for many countries and international political events might impact the company\n* **Reliance on third party manufacturers**: Intel and Manufacturers are highly dependent from each others\n\n# Financials\n\n## Income Statement\n\nIn the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.\n\nIt is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%\n\nA point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nThe 2021 balance sheet shows us\n\n* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone\n* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone\n* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nIntel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.\n\nThe Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.\n\nINTC is investing heavily in PP&E\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTO SEE RATIOS ETC LOOK AT THE PDF [HERE](https://we.tl/t-GsEKQyPULM)\n\n# Revenue Forecast\n\nWith the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 18.26%\n\n## Analysts Price Target\n\n**$52 High**\n\n**$34 Average**\n\n**$18 Low**\n\n**$30 Author\u2019s**\n\nTO SEE OTHER PARTS CHECK OUT THE PDF REPORT [HERE](https://we.tl/t-GsEKQyPULM), I CAN UPLOAD PICS THAT IS WHY IT IS BETTER TO READ IT FROM THE MAIN PAPER\n\n# Final Considerations\n\n## What is its position compared to competitors?\n\nBy observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.\n\nINTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.\n\nWhile its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product\u2019s portfolio, where AMD doesn\u2019t have expertise nor is capable to compete.\n\nWith high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.\n\nIntel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival\u2019s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.\n\nWith US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.\n\nSWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.\n\nLack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.\n\n## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\nThe company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel\u2019s perception in the CPU segment.\n\nFundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.\n\nIntel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend\u2019s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.\n\nIn the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $30.**\n\n**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This is not a financial advice.***", "id": "ycpgvz", "created_utc": 1666652870.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "This is some next tier DD.

{"title": "IRS releases new federal tax brackets and standard deductions. Here\u2019s how they affect your family\u2019s tax bill.", "selftext": "America\u2019s high inflation rate will produce a 7% increase in the size of the standard deduction when workers file their taxes on their 2023 income, according to new inflation adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s also going to pump up tax brackets by 7% as well, according to the annual inflation adjustments the IRS announced this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany tax code provisions \u2014 but not all \u2014 are indexed for inflation, so the announcements are a recurring event. But when inflation is persistently clinging to four-decade highs, these annual adjustments carry extra significance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen inflation is persistently clinging to four-decade highs, these annual adjustments of approximately 7% for the standard deduction carry extra significance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStart with the standard deduction, which is what most people use instead of itemizing deductions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe standard deduction for individuals and married people filing separately will be $13,850 for the 2023 tax year. That\u2019s a $900 increase from the $12,950 standard deduction for the upcoming tax season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor married couples filing jointly, the payout climbs to $27,700 for the 2023 tax year. That\u2019s a $1,800 increase from the $25,900 standard deduction set for the upcoming tax year.\n\nThe increases in the marginal tax rates reflect the same 7% rise. For example, the 22% tax bracket for this year is over $41,775 for single filers and over $83,550 for married couples filing jointly. Next year, the same 22% bracket applies to incomes over $44,725 and over $89,450 for married couples filing jointly.\n\n\u201cThe changes seem to be much larger than previous years because inflation is running much higher than it has in previous decades,\u201d said Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax think tank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe IRS arrives at its inflation adjustments by averaging a slightly different inflation gauge, the so-called \u201cchained Consumer Price Index\u201d instead of the widely-watched Consumer Price Index, Durante noted. That\u2019s an outcome of the Trump-era Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, he added.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe reason they do this is because the regular CPI is thought to overstate inflation because it doesn\u2019t take into account the substitution that shoppers can make as cost rise,\u201d Durante said. Shoppers substitute when they swap a more expensive item for cheaper one, and research shows many Americans are using the tactic.\n\nThe IRS inflation adjustments come after September CPI data last week showed inflation of 8.2% year-over-year, slightly off from 8.3% in August. Also last week, the Social Security Administration said next year\u2019s payments would include an 8.7% cost of living adjustment.\n\nThe payout on the earned income tax credit \u2014 geared at low- and moderate-income working families who have been hit hard by red-hot inflation \u2014 is also increasing.\n\nThe payout on the earned income tax credit is also increasing. The maximum payout for a qualifying taxpayer with at least three qualifying children climbs to $7,430, up from $6,935 for this tax year. The longstanding credit is geared at low- and moderate-income working families who have been hit hard by red-hot inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore than 60 provisions are slated for an increase inline with inflation, but many portions of the tax code are not indexed for inflation. Depending on the circumstances, the taxes or the tax breaks kick in sooner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCapital gains tax rules one example. The IRS lets a taxpayer use capital losses to offset capital gains taxes. If losses exceed gains, the IRS allows a taxpayer to deduct up to $3,000 in excess loses. They can then carry the remainder of the capital loses to future tax years. It\u2019s been more than four decades since lawmakers last set the limit, according to Durante.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile more than 60 provisions are slated for an increase inline with inflation, many portions of the tax code are not indexed for inflation. They include capital gains tax.\n\nGiven the stock market\u2019s rocky downward slide this year, many investors might welcome a fast-approaching tax break \u2014 even if it only enables a $3,000 deduction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, a married couple selling their home can exclude the first $500,000 of the sale from capital gains taxation, and it\u2019s $250,000 for a single filer. It\u2019s been that way since the exclusion\u2019s 1997 establishment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe once white-hot housing market may be cooling, but many sellers may still be facing the point when taxes kick in. The median home listing was over $367,000 as of early October, according to Redfin RDFN, +2.29%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe child tax credit is another example. After the payout to parents last year jumped to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 per child age 6 to 17, it\u2019s back to a maximum $2,000. The credit\u2019s refundable portion climbs from $1,500 to $1,600 during tax year 2023, the IRS notes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProponents of the boosted payouts and some Congressional Democrats want to revive the larger payments in negotiations tied to corporate taxes. The high costs of living are a strong reason to bring back the boosted credit, they say.", "id": "ybz99i", "created_utc": 1666576861.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ybz99i)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ybz99i)\n    \n>TL;DR: The IRS announced that it will increase the standard deduction by 7% and tax brackets by 7% for the 2023 tax year.

And it will be about 2 months for the contraction to really be in effect(I think the market will rally for Christmas sales and believe the fed is propping this narrative up) after words: boom, big bada boom.\n\nBy the way.
