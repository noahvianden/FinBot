{"title": "Bill Ackman's Pershing Square spent $427mm hedging the pandemic crash and interest-rate hikes, and made $5 billion in profits on those trades", "selftext": "* Ackman's fund spent only $27 million to make $2.6 billion in early 2020, and paid under $400 million for hedges worth around $2.7 billion today.\n\nThe billionaire investor's hedge fund raked in $2.6 billion in the spring of 2020, by wagering pandemic fears would roil financial markets. It has made another $2.3 billion or so by betting on interest rates to rise over the past two years. \n\nThe shrewd trades have helped to offset declines in Pershing's stock portfolio, and generated cash the fund has used to make fresh investments and bolster its existing holdings.\u00a0\n\n\"We've had some very significant profits from hedges, a decent percentage of which we've realized,\" Ackman told Interactive Investor in a recent interview. Pershing \"made a fortune\" with its pandemic play, and spent less than $400 million to erect rate hedges worth around $2.7 billion today, he said.\n\nAckman and his team anticipated the COVID crash in March 2020, and rushed to protect Pershing's portfolio by purchasing credit-default swaps for investment-grade and high-yield bonds \u2014 essentially insurance against a wave of corporate defaults.\u00a0They spent only $27 million on premiums before selling the derivatives for $2.6 billion in late March.\n\nThe proceeds from the pandemic hedge roughly offset the decline in Pershing's stock portfolio. Moreover, the fund used the cash to bolster its stakes in Hilton, Lowe's, and other companies. They were rewarded with a strong rebound in stocks over the next few months, resulting in Ackman's fund notching a 70% return in 2020.\n\nAckman and his team also predicted inflation would rear its head after the global economy reopened from the pandemic, and pent-up demand ran into supply constraints. They began hedging against higher interest rates in November 2020, as they believed the Federal Reserve was underreacting to the inflation threat, and would have to hike rates more aggressively than the market expected at the time.\n\nPershing built a \"very large notional short position\" against both shorter-dated and longer-term bonds, Ackman said on an earnings call last November, as the fund wagered rising rates would reduce bond prices.\n\nAckman and his team unwound some of that hedge at the start of this year, after it soared in value to over $1 billion, to fund their short-lived Netflix wager. Yet they quickly rebuilt it in anticipation of more rate hikes, and have watched it appreciate further since then.\n\nPershing has been hit hard by the stock-market downturn this year, but its return of -20.9% for the year to October 11 has outpaced the benchmark S&P 500's 25% decline over the same period. Moreover, the sell-off could provide Ackman with another opportunity to cash out his hedges, reinvest the proceeds in stocks, and ride the market back up.\n\nSource:  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bill-ackman-pershing-square-portfolio-hedges-pandemic-crash-interest-rates-hikes-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bill-ackman-pershing-square-portfolio-hedges-pandemic-crash-interest-rates-hikes-10)", "id": "y7b0qn", "created_utc": 1666108944.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "If i turned 5k into 25k nobody would care.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I'd care.

They cancelled their wearable watch project, the new headsets are too expensive and when people get to the metaverse (horizon) it's glitchy and there's really not much to do. Tiktok continues to eat Meta's lunch in terms of users/uploads/driving content and....given the overall downturn who really cares about FB anymore? \n\n\n\nMeanwhile Zuckerberg continues to pour about 10b a year into Facebook Reality Labs. To state the obvious: in light of how much they've spent and continue to spend, Zuckerberg has bet the future of the company on his vision of the Metaverse. Given his hubris and blind spots it was always going to be a long shot. Apple and Sony are putting out their VR headsets soon, it's not going to get any easier for the Facebook Reality Labs business.\n\n\nLong-short is that I think it's ripe for a short.
