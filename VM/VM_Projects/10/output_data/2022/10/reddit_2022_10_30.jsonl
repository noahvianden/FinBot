{"title": "Diamond Back Energy for the win (FANG)", "selftext": "So let me teach you degenerates a little about the oil and gas industry. They have a P/E ratio of 7.45 their EV/EBITDA is steadily decreasing its currently at around a 10.0. Debt to equity ratio is around .41 and continues to decline over the past five years. When looking into oil companies you need to understand something called proven reserves. These are the oil/gas reserves the company has access to but doesn\u2019t utilize all at one time. They have it under lease (mineral lease) per acre of land. Almost all their reserves are in Texas which isn\u2019t a bad things. Often oil companies list these reserves on their balance sheet or especially their income statements. Be very wary of companies that do this. Diamond Back isn\u2019t one of them. \n\nThey have 1.8 billion barrels of oil under their control. They deal primarily in unconventional shale horizontal drilling operations. That basically means they drill down into a porous oil rich shale rock turn the drill head into the oil producing zone and go horizontally for a couple miles. They then put a perforator with explosive charges on it and send it down into the hole. They then blow up the shale allowing the oil and gas to flow smoothly. They have multiple years of drilling possibilities and peak production in the Permian basin isn\u2019t expected until 2028. Plenty of time for profit to be made. I wouldn\u2019t hold this company for more then two years because their business model isn\u2019t going to last forever, just long enough for the stock price to move up as the continue to increase their cash flow. Their operating cash flow jumped to 3.5 billion last quarter. These wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale can be redrilled in multiple directions and multiple depths. All you need to know is Permian Basin/Eagle Ford/west Texas/Eastern New Mexico is all very prime drilling opportunities rich with oil and accessible drilling formations. It\u2019s cheap to drill in Texas. The average break even price for the Eagle Ford is actually 49$ per barrel for a new well. These shale wells won\u2019t produce for more then four years so these companies will eventually be in trouble but that prediction is far from the 10ks they\u2019ll produce over the next five years. \n\nBut talking about oil companies we also need to talk about the price of oil. Most of these oil companies in west Texas produce profit at 53$ a barrel for new wells. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made. OPEC+ supply cuts seem like they\u2019re here to stay.

{"title": "Bullish case for growth stocks", "selftext": "Growth stocks have been hammered this year because of the prospect of higher interest rates. \nUsing the future discounted cashflows valuation, higher interest rates mean higher discount rates in the denominator of the cashflows and lower valuations.\nHowever, higher inflation increases the multiplers of the cashflows and the valuations. \n\nWhat matters is the annual difference between inflation and interest rates. The higher the difference, the higher the valuation. \n\nAnother factor is that companies may have lower returns in the next couple of years due to a recession, which lowers their valuation. \n\nMy point is: \n\nGrowth stocks don't need to worry as much about lower short term returns. Their short term returns were going to be small anyways compared to their long term returns. \n\nNo need to worry about interest rates much either. They are still well below the inflation rate and the FED can't increase rates too much for too long because that will crash the economy and make national debt unsustainable. If they crash the economy they will have to lower rates again and keep doing more QE lol \n\nOn the other hand, we can't control inflation as much. There's currently a trend towards reversing globalization, which will increase prices no matter what interest rates are. This will decrease the revenue of many companies buying/selling goods internationally.

Now, one of the big drivers of inflation costs roughly the same as it did a year ago.\u00a0\n\nAnalysts warn that unusually cold weather could send prices soaring anew this winter, [especially in the Northeast](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-england-risks-winter-blackouts-as-gas-supplies-tighten-11665999002?mod=article_inline) where maxed out pipelines have effectively capped output from Appalachia\u2019s prolific producers.\n\nYet many are forecasting that prices will be lower on average in 2023 than they were this year. They expect rising supply from increasingly efficient North American drillers along with slower-growing demand from an economy throttled back by central bankers trying to [slow inflation with higher borrowing costs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-raise-rates-by-0-75-point-and-debate-size-of-future-hikes-11666356757?mod=article_inline).\u00a0\n\nNatural-gas futures priceSource: Dow Jones Market DataNote: Front-month contractsNov. 2020'21'2212345678$9per million British thermal units\n\nNatural-gas futures for December delivery ended Friday at $5.684 per million British thermal units, just 4.75% higher than a year ago. Early last week, futures slipped below $5 for the first time since March, when energy markets were jolted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPermian Basin producers in recent days swamped the Waha trading hub in West Texas, pushing prices into negative territory. In some cash trades, sellers paid buyers more than $1 per million British thermal units to take away gas that was fetching more than $8 at the start of September, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n \n\nAnalysts say futures prices are likely to rise a bit once furnaces fire up and a big liquefied-natural-gas export terminal in Texas resumes operations following [a fire this summer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-plunge-after-extended-outage-at-texas-lng-facility-11655235895?mod=article_inline). But they expect prices to decline next year.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast that benchmark U.S. prices would average $5 per million British thermal units in 2023. BofA Securities anticipates $4.50. Through Friday, natural-gas futures this year have averaged about $6.60 per million British thermal units, straining not just household budgets but also the gas-consuming makers of materials ranging from steel and cement to plastic and [fertilizer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chemicals-giant-to-cut-production-of-key-fertilizer-ingredient-amid-russian-gas-crisis-11658918219?mod=article_inline).\n\nInvestors are betting on cheaper gas, too. Hedge funds and other speculators in recent weeks have built up their biggest collective wager that prices will fall since the panic selloff during the Covid lockdown in early 2020, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.\n\nRising natural-gas prices have been a safe bet since the early days of the pandemic. Some of the hottest weather on record stretched supplies at home and abroad, while the closure of [coal-fired power plants](https://www.wsj.com/articles/red-hot-coal-prices-threaten-more-increases-in-power-bills-11654167025?mod=article_inline) left electricity producers without an alternative to natural gas.

Another steamy summer, strong exports and restraint among North American drillers [focused on shoveling cash to their shareholders](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-surging-natural-gas-prices-havent-sparked-a-drilling-boom-11651623490?mod=article_inline) kept domestic storage facilities from filling up much. By August, stockpiles were still nearly 13% below normal and [prices pushed above $10](https://www.wsj.com/articles/endless-demand-spurs-u-s-natural-gas-prices-to-shale-era-highs-11661245053?mod=article_inline) for the first time since 2008,\u00a0when\u00a0the shale-drilling boom\u00a0was\u00a0[just getting\u00a0started](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-texas-well-that-started-a-revolution-1530270010?mod=article_inline).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMild weather in September meant a lot less gas burned to power air conditioners. Meanwhile, U.S. production [rose to a record](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-09-19-2022/card/u-s-natural-gas-output-hit-a-record-high-inJ6nHpFHfQkMNYSXVo5?mod=article_inline) of more than 100 billion cubic feet a day and the prolonged outage at Freeport LNG\u2019s Texas export terminal made available a lot of gas that otherwise would have been sold overseas.\u00a0\n\nTraders began pumping more gas into storage tanks and caverns, socking it away for winter when demand is greatest.\n\nBetween Sept. 9 and Oct. 14, 571 billion cubic feet of gas were added to stockpiles, the biggest build ever over five weeks. The deficit to normal levels shrank by more than half. As of a week ago, the volume of gas in storage was within 5.5% of normal levels for this time of year, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\n \n\nMatthew Palmer, executive director of Global Gas at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said the firm expects U.S. inventories to fill even more and begin winter in line with recent years, at around 3.6 trillion cubic feet.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat should be ample for most weather scenarios,\u201d he said. A really cold winter, however, like the frigid season of 2013-14, which sucked nearly 3 trillion cubic feet from storage, could push prices north of $10, he said.\u00a0", "id": "yhsg96", "created_utc": 1667169692.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yhsg96)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yhsg96)\n    \n>TL;DR: Natural gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months, due to warm weather and high production levels.
