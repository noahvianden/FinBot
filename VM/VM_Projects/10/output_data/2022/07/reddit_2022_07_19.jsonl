{"title": "Netflix is testing a new feature in Latin America to charge users an extra $3 per month if they share passwords.", "selftext": " Netflix announced today that it will begin testing a new \"add a home\" feature to charge users who share their account with others in select countries. The test marks the streaming giant's latest effort toward cracking down on password sharing. The test will prompt users to pay an additional fee if they use an account outside their household. Netflix will begin testing the feature in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras next month.\n\nIn these test regions, each Netflix account will include one home where you can access Netflix on any of your devices. If you want to allow someone to use your Netflix account in an additional home, the company will ask you to pay a fee. You can add a home to your account by paying an extra 219 pesos in Argentina and $2.99 in the other test regions. Members on a Basic Netflix plan can add one extra home, Standard users can add up to two extra homes and Premium users can add up to three extra homes. Users in these test areas will have the option to control where their account is being used and remove homes from their account settings page.\n\n\"It\u2019s great that our members love Netflix movies and TV shows so much they want to share them more broadly,\" said Netflix's director of product innovation, Chengyi Long, in a statement. \"But today\u2019s widespread account sharing between households undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve our service.\"\n\nNetflix says this test expands on a similar feature it launched in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru earlier this year called \"add extra member.\" As part of this test, subscribers are asked to pay extra if they are sharing the service with people outside their own household. The feature allows households to add up to two \u201csub accounts\u201d for a fee that\u2019s less than the cost of the full-priced Netflix service.\n\nNetflix had said this solution doesn\u2019t rely on location-based data, like GPS. Instead, it\u2019s leveraging the same information it uses to provide its service today to its end users, including an IP address, device IDs and other information about devices signed into the Netflix account across the household. Through this method, Netflix can identify when there\u2019s persistent sharing taking place outside a household.\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-test-add-home-option-213412776.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-test-add-home-option-213412776.html)\n\n**Netflix NFLX is testing a new feature in Latin America to charge users an extra $3/month if they share passwords.
