{"title": "Fed\u2019s Bostic thinks recession can be avoided even with further interest-rate hikes", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve can keep raising its benchmark rate this year at the fastest pace in nearly 30 years without causing a recession, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Monday.cIn a roundtable with reporters, Bostic noted the labor market added 372,000 jobs in June.c\u201cWhat that tells me is there is enough momentum in the economy and enough ability for us to see a slowdown where we still wind up with positive job creation,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel like a recession,\u201d he added.\n\nSince March, the Fed\u2019s benchmark policy rate has increased by 150 basis points from the emergency-low level close to zero put in place when the pandemic started. Bostic said he supports raising it another 150 basis points this year, including another ultra-large, 75-basis-point hike at the next FOMC meeting in two weeks. That would be the fastest pace of interest-rate hikes since 1994 into early 1995. \n\nBostic said even with the moves to date, the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate \u2014 in the range of 1.5% to 1.75% \u2014 is still boosting growth. This is not applying \u201chard brakes\u201d to the economy, he said. Bostic said he has been encouraged with signs that the Fed\u2019s moves have already started to slow the economy \u201cin a fairly orderly way.\u201d \u201cThere haven\u2019t been dramatic jumps that suggest we\u2019re on the cusp of something pretty significant,\u201d Bostic said. So the Fed can keep moving rates up to a 3% rate, which Bostic said is \u201cneutral,\u201d neither boosting or slowing growth. At that point, if the inflation numbers don\u2019t improve, Bostic said he would be comfortable moving interest rates higher into \u201crestrictive\u201d territory, meaning that would put the brakes on growth.\n\n***Asked if he might ever support a full percentage-point rate hike \u2014 a popular discussion on Wall Street \u2014 Bostic didn\u2019t rule it out.***\n\nBecoming more aggressive would be an option, Bostic said, if the data comes in \u201ca lot worse than what we expected\u201d \u2014 for instance if inflation moved higher or there was evidence that longer-run inflation expectations started to move up. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting we\u2019ll have to do\u201d such a large move, he added.\n\nEarlier Monday, Kansas City Fed President Esther George suggested the pace of rate hikes might be too aggressive. There has been a \u201cgrowing discussion of recession risk, and some forecasts are predicting interest-rate cuts as soon as next year,\u201d George said in a speech to the Mid-America Labor/Management Conference. \u201cSuch projections suggest to me that a rapid pace of rate increases brings about the risk of tightening policy more quickly than the economy and markets can adjust,\u201d she said.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-bostic-thinks-recession-can-be-avoided-even-with-further-interest-rate-hikes-11657573017?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-bostic-thinks-recession-can-be-avoided-even-with-further-interest-rate-hikes-11657573017?mod=home-page)", "id": "vx4cx1", "created_utc": 1657607084.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "I bet he wouldn't get fired if he's wrong.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14739136397838593}, {"body": "Bostic is an idiot.

That\u2019s a huge huge plus.\n\nAlso it just astonishes me that they still think Tesla needs to compete against LICE.

{"title": "CHina Fud Plagues the Markets Yet Again", "selftext": " \n\nTAIPEI\u2014China\u2019s Covid-19 cases are rising at the fastest pace since late May, unnerving investors wary of a repeat of Shanghai\u2019s two-month lockdown, which snarled global supply chains and sank hopes that the country would reach Beijing\u2019s economic-growth targets.\n\nMore than 2,300 locally transmitted cases have been reported nationwide in the past seven days, with infections again on the rise in the commercial and manufacturing powerhouse of Shanghai, albeit from a low base. The central province of Anhui, a producer of steel, autos and computers, is the worst-affected, though new daily cases appear to be falling with just 39 on Monday, down from a peak of 292 more than a week ago. Cases have also surged in neighboring Jiangsu and Shandong provinces.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping had lauded the effectiveness of the nation\u2019s zero-Covid policies in containing outbreaks driven by the highly infectious Omicron variants, which other countries have failed to keep in check. But given that only five of the 31 provincial-level regions have reported zero cases since Shanghai\u2019s lockdown officially ended June 1, preventing another outbreak without severe damage to the economy will be a daunting challenge.\n\n**On Sunday, authorities in Shanghai said the city found its first locally transmitted infection of the Omicron subvariant BA.5,** which had been traced to an earlier imported case. Now the dominant strain in the U.S., it is considered the most infective version yet of Omicron because of its ability to evade immunity built up by previous infections and vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe potential risk of community transmission remains very high,\u201d Zhao Dandan, a Shanghai health official, said at a press conference Sunday, adding that two more rounds of mass testing in more than nine districts over three days will start Tuesday.\n\nMass testing last month in Macau, which Monday began its first citywide lockdown in more than two years.\n\nThe uptick in cases is fueling concern about the return of sweeping and stringent pandemic restrictions\u2014particularly in view of the spread of BA.5. China-related stock indexes fell Monday as investors weighed the likely risk to the country\u2019s already weak economy and consumer confidence.\n\nThe CSI 300 Index, which tracks the largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell 1.7% on Monday, while Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index slid 2.8%. The selloff was broad, affecting energy and raw-materials producers, retailers and internet-platform companies.\n\n\u201cInvestors still have the muscle memory of the dark days of the monthslong Shanghai lockdown earlier this year and worry that we might be going back,\u201d said Qi Wang, chief executive of MegaTrust Investment , a Hong Kong-based fund manager that focuses on stocks listed in mainland China.\n\n**The market was also unnerved by a seven-day lockdown announced by Macau, which shut the casinos in the world\u2019s biggest gambling hub.

{"title": "Historic inflation DD", "selftext": "Long time listener, first time caller. All the discussion on here has been very interesting, so thank you for that. I love numbers and I\u2019m good with excel, so I got curious about historical periods of high inflation (which I am defining as over 8%). I created a table that cross-references monthly inflation with a 20-day average of the DJIA spanning the first of every month.\n\nThere have been 6 prior periods (going back to 1914) where inflation has held above 8%: the longest was in 1916 at 49 months, the shortest in 1951 at 5 months, and the average is 26 months. We are presently at 2 going on 3 months (on 7/13).\n\nI next looked for the highest index value in the 12 months preceding 8% inflation, and the lowest index value in the period after crossing 8% threshold, capped at 12 months following inflation dropping back below 8%. The time period from peak to trough (as outlined) was shortest in 1951 at 3 months, longest at 23 months, and averages 15 months. We are presently at 6 months.\n\nI also computed the returns over the peak to trough period which were highest in 1951 at 5%, lowest in 1973 at -41%, and averaged -20%. We are presently at -14%.\n\nThe attached shows the data time normalized on the first month where inflation rises above 8% (\u201c0\u201d row) with the preceding highs and following lows flagged. I chose to adjust occurrences 1 and 6 to the earlier flag to compute the above metrics.\n\nI have a long history of being retarded, and I\u2019m literally a gay bear.

{"title": "Home Sale Cancellations Hit Highest Rate Since Start of Pandemic: 15% of Would-Be Homebuyers Backed Out in June", "selftext": "Facing red-hot inflation and higher mortgage rates, some homebuyers are now backing out of deals \u2014 either to renegotiate them or because they can\u2019t afford the mortgage anymore. In June, nationwide, 60,000 home-purchase agreements fell through, or \\~15% of homes that went under contract that month, according to new data.\n\nThe data, released by Redfin, indicates that figure (14.9%, to be precise) as the highest percentage of home sale cancellations on record excepting March and April 2020, when the housing market halted due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It is also a significant increase compared to the 11.2% of canceled deals in June of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in housing-market competition is giving homebuyers room to negotiate, which is one reason more of them are backing out of deals,\u201d Redfin deputy chief economist Taylor Marr said in a press release. \u201cBuyers are increasingly keeping rather than waiving inspection and appraisal contingencies. That gives them the flexibility to call the deal off if issues arise during the homebuying process.\u201d\n\nLast week, mortgage rates decreased for the second consecutive week. However, perhaps given fears of an economic slowdown, mortgage applications decreased as well \u2014 5.4% from one week earlier \u2014 according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending July 1. Mortgage rates have increased sharply in 2022, but have also fallen over the past two weeks, with the 30-year fixed-rate currently resting around 5.75%, per CNBC.\n\n\u201cRising mortgage rates are also forcing some buyers to cancel home purchases. If rates were at 5% when you made an offer, but reached 5.8% by the time the deal was set to close, you may no longer be able to afford that home or you may no longer qualify for a loan,\u201d Marr added.\n\nCNBC reports that homebuilders are also seeing higher cancellation rates. In May, cancellation rates concerning the building of new homes soared to 9.3% in a survey of builders conducted by John Burns Real Estate Consulting (JBREC). This figure can be compared to a cancellation rate (pertaining to new builds) of 6.6% in May of 2021.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-sale-cancellations-hit-highest-175801439.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-sale-cancellations-hit-highest-175801439.html)\n\n**Redfin RDFN has reported that June home sale cancellations have hit the highest rate since March and April 2020.

{"title": "$1 = 1\u20ac? Euro-exports are on discount right now!", "selftext": "Hello my special friends,\n\ny'all making fun of us europoors right now with Euro/USD ratio hitting the 1. But y'all missing the opportunity here: Exports are on discount!\n\nI won't share some fancy graphs since I've eaten all those crayons already, but look at this link:\n\n[https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/geo?year=2019&country=61&productClass=HS&product=undefined&target=Product&partner=undefined&startYear=undefined](https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/geo?year=2019&country=61&productClass=HS&product=undefined&target=Product&partner=undefined&startYear=undefined)\n\nIf you look closely, it has \"Harvard\" in the URL. So this must be top notch and super smart data. Germany is the greatest exporter of goods in Europe. Who is the biggest importer of German goods? Oh yes! USA! With the Euro dropping 20% this past year, it means, that German products are basically on discount right now. Fancy a German car? Or some other machinery-contraption for your wifes boyfriend? Or some special medmeds? How about a 20% discount? Sounds good?\n\nGerman sales teams have it really easy to sell those products right now. Look at this:\n\n[https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Foreign-Trade/Tables/overall-development-foreign-trade.pdf?\\_\\_blob=publicationFile](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Foreign-Trade/Tables/overall-development-foreign-trade.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)\n\nIt has a lot of numbers! But don't look at the numbers! Look at the plus signs in column 4. Do you see a pattern? Yes, there is a clear pattern of straight plusses. Exports only go up! Now you might say: with all that shit going down in Euroland, this might be risky. But here is the deal though: all that oil that is imported and needed for production is already priced in. And if it isn't, it doesn't matter: There is no Wendys in Germany. Germans just will keep on engineering, producing and exporting like it always had.\n\nGermany always has been the strongest economy in Europe and even though it is just the size of Montana so that y'all who never left your basement have a frame of reference. Germany has the second biggest foreign trade surplus in the whole world, right after China (which is the size of China). Now that the Euro is down, German manufacturers drool over all those products they can sell to US companies.\n\nHere you can see the current account balances compared to other countries:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_current\\_account\\_balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_current_account_balance)\n\nOh, Germany has the greatest surplus? And what? US has the biggest deficit? I start to see a pattern! I need some crayons to investigate this. The thing is: The Eurozone has a flaw. The monetary union is a one-size-fits all policy. Yes, fellow smoothbrainers, I chose examples that even you can understand. Just like there are t-shirts that are supposedly \"one-size-fits-all\", have you ever encountered that one of those shirts perfectly fit you? No. Cause there are no real average people. In the same way there are no perfectly average economies and especially not in Europe. Still they all adopted the same currency and are object to the same monetary policies. Germany with the highest GDP in the EU is laughing its ass off because of that. It profits of the fact, that the other Europoor countries kept the Euro comparatively low and export all those goods to non-Euro-countries and create this huge foreign trade surplus year after year. Now with the Euro down even more!\n\nSo how do we make money with this? Just go long Germany: Tickers EWG, EWGS (there is another similar ticker with an H in the beginning - DONT BUY IT though, since it is hedged). EWGS is especially interesting since Germany has a lot of \"mittelst\u00e4ndische Unternehmen\".\n\nI don't want to make your heads explode so I'll stop here. But if you have some wrinkles in your brain, google theory of optimum currency areas, distribution of value added shares in GVCs, global value chain networks and so on.

VWAP current at around 392. We\u2019ve been consolidating around VWAP since May. If this resistance holds we could hit lower band #1 at 336 - 330 in the next few months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aitrzx82n7b91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf80c92948d65e2117e62fe3352cbaf2b8b7facd\n\n## Anchored VWAP - 1 Day\n\n* *Anchored VWAP from March 2022 high.*\n\nSPY has found resistance near the lower #1 band at around 391 with eyes on 372 (June 30 - July 5 bottom). We are near the middle of a parallel downtrend from ATH. Weak uptrend volume from June 17 indicates that we may test 372 and, possibly, lower band #2 at around 362.37 soon.\n\nHere are some levels to keep an eye on.\n\n* Resistance: 391.36\n* Support: 372.56\n* Downside target: 362.37\n* Upside targets: 406.93; 412.79\n* VWAP: 412.64\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6z69mmbp7b91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfd7b087d132d6554dfa9163b76f416a5000ad62\n\n## Symmetrical Triangle - Bearish Bias - July 22 Exp.\n\nSPY is at support of a symmetrical triangle from late June. Generally, a symmetrical triangle in a downtrend is a continuation pattern. If we lose 379 ish, I believe that we retest June 17 low (363) BUT we will have a retest at 372 first. Be mindful because this is where we may find some buyers.\n\nIf we bounce at 379 keep an eye on 391 as resistance. If we break 391 then eye 396.
