Wasn't it supposed to come last yr. But then I realised the 2008 housing crash when Jared Vennett ( from Deutche Bank ) helped Steve Eismen in buying BBB Garibaldi Swaps in 2007. They were right to short after that stripper had 6 or 8 something houses on ARM's ( the infamous Ninja loans ) but they were one year early. Now think about that situation in China. We were all convinced that the housing crash would happen in 2021 but I think it has been delayed to 2022 or 2023. Now you need to think more that when a housing crash happens a bank crisis could happen. Now I am hearing my birdies telling me that one of the largest banks in china is about to have lehman brother moment. So what does this even mean? It means a global financial crisis tsunami will start from China and whosoever banks outside of China is exposed to either Chinese equities ( apparently no one is exposed to Chinese real estate or they say not a huge portfolio ) or these Chinese banks directly or indirectly will have trouble maintaining their margins. Guys did you get it ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My birdies xD](https://preview.redd.it/ehfblhfb7bc91.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d72dff4639f7f94789b9de3566ede71e4a3fbc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour reaction : Mf stop BS us. We know all this sh9t already. What are you even trying to say? I'm not reading further below. Where the hell is even that Tl;dr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuys just please bear with me for 10 stanza more okay. What if the Chinese government wants this to happen this year or next.( Attacking at the classic double peak double digit inflation ) They didn't want it to happen last year. Do you know why? Because the inflation was just 5%. The Chinese want to hit the USA when the inflation is fuckin 9% or when it goes double digit. That means you got no room, no f room to escape from this sh9t. This will then trouble the bank margins coz we all know when to hit somebody and cause max pain. When the guy is f down with one leg already broken. ( double digit inflation will squeeze banks hence Fed has ordered and be focused on maintaining reserve balance ) This is the perfect recipe for the perfect storm to hit. Now these all secret service is busy do you know where ? They are busy thinking oh when is this nuclear bomb to drop and then we will counter it with our expensive missiles that can destroy these bombs mid air. Or lets catch some secret officers of Putin and interrogate. Guys that's not the battlefield. The battlefield is in the charts of stock market and housing market data. This stock market world is ruthless. Everybody here just thinks about making lambo profits. No one i mean literally no one including have some sense of morality while making a trade. So its kinda like a war where our own soldiers starts a \u201ccoup de etat\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue : USA inflation yoy , Orange : Chinese inflation yoy](https://preview.redd.it/yc4qz3yn7bc91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9dae71c7ce26755bd01ee0a19286773f1803498)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow China as you know is well positioned to counter it but Usa cannot do it. What is the counter called? It's called QE. Usa people bad news we cannot do it. If we do it we kickstart hyperinflation. We're not necessarily may have or may not have inflation ( like japan today inflation is close to 1 or 0 ) but we will see our currency devaluation and losing global reserve currency least in next give or take 5yrs. I mean it's the least. The amount you would need to save this crisis would be 4 sigma times the 2008. Your balance sheet has to moon. Now let's say we do it after 2 or 3 yrs after the crisis when inflation settles down to like 4%. Now whenever this debasement happens the Voldemort asset class cannot do jacksh9t. Do you know why there is a condition attached to it. They are debasement hedge in a positive feedback loop environment. The ultimate debasement hedge for this negative type of environment is gold. You need this ultimate debasement mf to make it out alive. No stocks can help you sorry. Look at Japan when they did debasement in a negative feedback loop environment. Their stock market went to sleep for 30yrs+. Now i'm not saying we are gonna go to 30yr but yah like 15yrs. Like the great depression era. Also you must have heard of this news that some country found \\_\\_\\_ T of gold. Yah you know what the billionaires of the world control media. I aint biting whatever they are selling. So sorry. I have been told by my birdies that a late rally this year will come in gold.
