This column instead digs into the auto market, where there is an underappreciated ticking time bomb.\n\nLucky Lopez is a car dealer who has been in the business for about 20 years. In recent meetings with bankers, where he bids on repossessed vehicles before they go to auction, he has noticed some common characteristics of the defaulted loans. Most of the loans on recently repossessed cars originated during 2020 and 2021, whereas origination dates are normally scattered because people fall on hard times at different times; loan-to-value ratios, or the amount financed relative to the value of the vehicle, are around 140%, versus a more normal 80%; and many of the loans were extended to buyers who had temporary pops in income during the pandemic. Those monthly incomes fell\u2014sometimes by half\u2014as pandemic stimulus programs stopped, and now they look even worse on an inflation-adjusted basis and as the prices of basics in particular are climbing.\n\nPart of the problem is that some consumers\u2019 incomes were temporarily high as the pandemic brought about debt forbearance, pandemic stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits, and, in some cases, forgiven loans from the Paycheck Protection Program. Lopez says he recently bought a Bentley, McLaren and two Aston Martins\u2014all purchased by buyers using PPP money as down payments, and all repossessed after few or no monthly payments.Another recent acquisition: a Silverado repossessed from a borrower with a solid 700 credit score who made two payments.\n\nBanks\u2019 auto lending standards, meanwhile, went out the window, and then lenders jumped on the bandwagon of overpaying for cars, Lopez says. \u201cEverybody thought the free gravy train would never end,\u201d Lopez says.\n\nNow, he says he has never seen so many people making $2,500 a month owing $1,000 a month in car payments. That\u2019s about double the maximum portion of income many financial advisors recommend allocating toward a car payment. \u201cThe idea that the economy is strong? Anyone who is actually doing business sees things are not strong,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cWe had a housing bubble in 2008, and now we have an auto bubble.\u201d\n\nConsider data from car-shopping app CoPilot, which monitors daily online inventory across dealers nationwide to track what they say is the difference between a car\u2019s listed price and what it would be worth if not for extraordinary pandemic dynamics. In June, used-car prices were up 43%, or $10,046 above projected \u201cnormal\u201d levels, the company says.\n\nAs Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO of Quill Intelligence puts it, companies in the business of repossessing autos are among the first to know when economic trouble is brewing. And now those companies are buying car lots to handle the flood of repossessed, used cars coming to the market because what they are seeing is a longer and harder recession, she says. Lopez says banks are in turn leasing more land to handle an expected car-repossession surge.\n\nSome auto executives have hinted of turbulence. Earlier this year, Vickie Judy, CFO of America\u2019s Car-Mart (ticker: CRMT), discussed rising car repossession rates on an earnings call. In June, Ford (F) CFO John Lawler said the company had started to see delinquencies increase.\n\nLopez says it is hard to track vehicle repossession rates because banks are loath to talk about them. But based on what he says he has seen from banks, subprime repos have nearly doubled since 2020, to around 11% on average. The bigger red flag is in prime repos, where borrowers have higher credit scores. Lopez says usually about 2% of prime loans wind up repossessed. Now, that rate is at about 4%. Some of that can be explained by pandemic support temporarily making some consumers look like better borrowers. But it probably doesn\u2019t fully explain the jump in prime defaults, thus suggesting a wider swath of consumers are struggling despite narratives around large cash cushions and a strong job market buffering households as inflation bites, interest rates rise, and financial markets melt.\n\nPamela Foohey, law professor at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, warned in 2021 of an auto-loan crisis. She wrote then that heading into the pandemic, auto loans outstanding were at record levels and auto-loan delinquencies were hitting new highs almost every quarter. The bubble was about to burst, it seemed, but government pandemic responses meant the bottom didn\u2019t fall out of the auto-loan market. The measures were temporary, she warned then, and the bubble has since only grown.\n\nBarron\u2019s checked in with Foohey this past week. \u201cThe bubble is beginning to show signs of bursting soon,\u201d she says, pointing to the overall spike in car prices that has led to larger loans and to rising repossession rates.\n\nWhat is bubbling in the auto market reflects broader economic problems. The question: How might a bursting of an auto bubble affect the broader U.S. economy? Data published in May by the New York Fed shows Americans\u2019 auto debt rose $87 billion for the year ended in March, to $1.47 trillion. That represents about a 10th of total consumer debt, which rose 8.2% over the same period.\n\nOne place the trouble is starting to show up, Lopez says, is on banks\u2019 balance sheets. He says banks that were giving auto loans with LTVs of around 140 are now getting around 70 at auction\u2014meaning they are losing substantial money. Foohey says the increase in auto loans and the increase in delinquencies and defaults track an increase in defaults on personal loans and credit cards.\n\nThere is a silver lining in that the weaker economy the auto trouble both reflects and portends should cool inflation. But it might not be that simple, at least not right away. \u201cA lot of the banks\u2014they\u2019re smart. They control the market, like diamonds,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cAs repos pour in, they only release them so often,\u201d he says, meaning auto prices will probably remain stubborn even as economic growth wanes and more repos mean more used-car inventory.\n\nThat will also remain the case for inflation broadly, with stagflation the only alternative to a deeper-than-expected recession.\n\nhttps://archive.ph/13pYR", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "It amazed me driving around seeing the large number of cars with in-transit/dealer plates over the last year or so.

If we hit the upper or lower risk ranges at the start of the week it could set up nicely for a good risk to reward trade for the opposite direction. When important macro news occurs like Wed CPI print you can see very big deviations from the upper and lower so do keep that in mind. Also this really only works on stocks with alot of volume.\r  \n\r  \nI explain the risk range in this manner because it's much easier to understand. What is actually going on here is that there is a complex calculation using implied volatility to find the \"expected move\" for each options contract. Each contract has it's own unique implied volatility and many brokerage platform will provide to you the \"expected move\" based off the implied volatility. ThinkorSwim has this and will look like this : 24% (+/- 9.23) which basically tells you that for that expiration next week, the stock will likely move up $9.23 from where it is currently to the upside or downside. This is essentially 1 deviation which on a bell curve can mean that it will fall within that price range 68% of the time.

{"title": "Thoughts on my Strategy?", "selftext": "Ok here is some background information about my investing experience. Started in high school with 2k I got from interning at Intel. Made some money, lost some money, etc.(Did not trade options, I should've) I got hit by a truck when I was 15 and the settlement was 30k(Fucker had poor insurance) that I would get when I turned 18. When I turned 18 I was scared to lose this money so I ended up buying and holding. This was right around when the pandemic hit. So stocks were at an all-time low. This made me about 10K. I also got my license to broker mortgages when I turned 18 and this is when rates were at an all-time low so I made about 30k refinancing houses in my neighborhood. All in all, I ended up with about 70k. 20K is in my bank and 50K is in my brokerage account(TD Ameritrade)\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nMy strategy is to take 30K of the 50k and run the Wheel(fuck you Theta Gang for life). The stocks I am currently running this on are as follows:\n\nAEO, F, INTC,  GM ,KHC, T, AAL,DIS,SHOP. \n\nThe stock market is down and it will probably keep going down but it is definitely a good time to buy. I sold 7/22/2022 puts against all of these stocks at 25-30 delta. The premium collected is 340$ every 2 weeks or 680$ each month. When I get exercised I will Hold the shares and sell covered calls at a slightly lower delta lowering my monthly premium to about 500$ a month. This is an annualized return of 20% on my stocks. If I get exercised on the call then I sell puts and the cycle continues. That is the wheel. \n\n**\"Go Post On** r/ThetaGang **Dumbass\":**\n\nTwenty Percent Annualized returns are good but I am trying to make BANK. The next part of my strategy is to take the premium that I receive every 2 weeks, roughly 250-300$, and to buy debit spreads and call/puts options 1-2 weeks out. Basically at the end of 2 weeks, I get 275$ and 275$ goes out. At the end of the next 2 weeks, I double, triple, or quadruple my premium or lose it all and then get another 275$ to place my next trades on debit spreads, calls, and puts. \n\nThe profits from these debit spreads, calls, and puts will then be rolled over into Leap Options. Leap Options are Deep ITM calls or puts with a far-out expiration date. They effectively mimic owning 100 shares of a stock for a fraction of the cost because a majority of its value is intrinsic and not extrinsic. Its leverage without the interest rate. The idea is to be able to collect leap options like pokemon cards using profits with the underlying principle of this decision being that stocks only go up over time. (You are generally looking at 50%-150% returns on leaps over the course of 12 months)\n\nThe profits of these leap options will then be rolled over into buying more stocks to sell puts and covered calls against and the cycle goes on. \n\nTLDR: Protect initial capital by running a safe theta gang strategy. Use premiums to place risky high reward trades. Take profits from said trades and roll them into leap options. Use profits to increase initial capital.

Everyone has their own strategy that they swear by and they will tell you about all the money they make. They will gloss over their losses, or not mention them at all.\n\npersonally, I don't look at companies when i invest, i look at what is occurring in the world and in the news (present day) and how those macro trends will effect companies. Smart money always moves first, dumb money waits for news reports that call out specific tickers.\n\nHere is a example:\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukrainian triggered a lot of sanctions and \"the key part\" shipping companies self sanctioned Russia. Also Europe closed their airspace to Russian aircraft... that included cargo aircraft. What that meant is that manufacturing stuff in Russia that are exported just got more expensive. So at that time i would look for companies that have exposure there.\n\nAlcoa is a good example: They produce a lot of metal across the world. They are mostly known for Aluminum, but they produce a lot of titanium in Russia, its actually one of the things that Europe had to specifically exclude because their aerospace companies buy a ton of it and there are no other sources.\n\nin mid march Alcoa stock was in the 90s (looks to be a 3 month spike caused by inflation fears), its now in the low 40s because recession fears and worries about increased costs. \n\nIt halved in 4 months. If you bought 6 month out puts you would have made a fortune.\n\nIf you bought calls you would be wiped out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey report earning in two weeks... I have no idea if it will go up or down on their earning. Either is likely, they may generate record profits and shoot up back to 90, or they may report higher costs and tank to 20 bucks... They may also report meh results and go sideways. \n\nIt doesn't matter, nothing material from this company has come out but the world economic trends have changed and that drove the changes in its stock price drastically over the last 8 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is don't gamble your money, or look for someone to tell you the next hot buy...
