{"title": "Tesla\u2019s Bumpy Quarter Might Be About More Than Lockdowns in China", "selftext": "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-bumpy-quarter-might-be-about-more-than-lockdowns-in-china-11656856728?mod=markets\\_lead\\_pos13](https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-bumpy-quarter-might-be-about-more-than-lockdowns-in-china-11656856728?mod=markets_lead_pos13)\n\n **On Saturday, Tesla reported quarterly deliveries of 254,695, down from 310,048** in the first three months of the year. The news came as no great surprise given the pandemic-related **shutdowns that affected its Shanghai factory in April and May.** The final tally was slightly below consensus **expectations of 264,000**, according to FactSet. \n\n**A bad quarter for sales will be a worse one for earnings, which Tesla reports on July 20**. Given China\u2019s lower labor costs and established battery supply chain, it is widely assumed that the company\u2019s Shanghai operation is more profitable than its other established factory in Fremont, Calif. On top of that, the company is ramping up its new factories in Germany and Texas, which Mr. Musk described as \u201cmoney furnaces.\u201d\n\nSo it was an ugly quarter all round operationally, but does that matter? **Tesla said June was its best month for vehicle production to date**, implying that it is accelerating hard out of the problems in April and May. The production ramp-up process in its new plants was always going to be expensive. Analysts have been cutting their forecasts for 2022 deliveries, but the **consensus of almost 1.39 million vehicles would still amount to an increase of almost 50% over last year\u2019s number**.\n\nTesla isn\u2019t the only car maker experiencing problems. **General Motors on Friday warned that its second-quarter profit would be lower than expected due to a large batch of unfinished vehicles that it is holding in inventory for want of specific parts.**\n\nThe other news emanating from Tesla and its boss lately is arguably more concerning than the step down in deliveries. Tesla is cutting white-collar jobs, with Mr. Musk having warned last month that the car maker became \u201coverstaffed in many areas.\u201d This past week it closed one of its Silicon Valley offices.\n\nThese aren\u2019t the kind of actions companies undertake due to temporary challenges. Is Tesla overstaffed because the global economy is cooling\u2014Mr. Musk has been vocal on the risk of a recession\u2014or because supply-chain problems have slowed its longer-term plan? Are the cuts related to the CEO\u2019s concerns about staff laxity, as revealed in company emails about working from home, or to those money furnaces, which might be burning hotter than hoped? These are questions to dig into during the coming earnings call.", "id": "vrqejy", "created_utc": 1656998525.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|83|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|151|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vas0sp/why_i_simply_dont_ever_want_to_touch_netflix_stock/) [x](https://i.redd.it/r7gqtrjv79591.png) \n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vrqejy)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vrqejy)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16766269505023956}, {"body": "Yea sure\u2026 I can\u2019t even get my next car until next year.

When the Fed hiked rates previously, Jay Powell cited data showing a strong labor market and made comments about how he had not seen any reason for a decline in the economy (even though there were plenty of data points at the time pointing to this).  Now, it is much more clear we are heading to an economic slowdown, and even the Atlanta Fed is admitting a recession is to be announced imminently (we won't get the first Q2 GDP data release until July 29).\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/m49oqnn0vq991.gif\n\nBelow is the May 25th Red Line (changes) in the Meeting Minutes, comparing FOMC Meeting from May 3-4 to March 15-16.

Jay Powell will come out, give a statement, and answer questions from the press.  In nearly every 2pm to 2:30pm section of him speaking on these FOMC days, the market whipsaws from one direction to the other.  The trend that usually forms is the market will be up steadily before he speaks, will crash to negative territory, and then rebound and run through the end of the day.  There have been instances of multi-percent swings on these days from negative to positive.  \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nTomorrow's rally is sponsored by the Federal Reserve.
