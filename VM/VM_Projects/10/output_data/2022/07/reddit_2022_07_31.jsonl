We are all trying to predict what the Fed does based upon our own personal biases, of which we all have many.  Our forecasts probably say way more about our positions than they do the future.  And while these biases are impossible to remove entirely, I believe that on the balance, the current Fed fundamentally leans dovish.\n\nThey like growing the economy.  And they really don't like job losses or economic slack.  When making a decision, they rather err by making too many jobs than too little.\n\nWhile it's obvious now that price stability is their top priority, I believe they still care a lot about unemployment and will genuinely do the absolute best they can to achieve a soft-landing.\n\nWhether they can successfully do that is very much up for debate but past actions continually support that they tilt dovish.\n\n* 2016 rate hike cycle was very gentle.  Extremely well-telegraphed, minimal surprises.\n* Paused QT without making a significant dent in the balance sheet.\n* Currently behind schedule on MBS runoff.\n* Clear willingness to take dramatic and unprecedented steps when presented with a crisis, like in Covid.\n* Inflation evidence was building fairly strongly way before the commodities crisis spurred by the Ukraine war.  CPI was almost 8% without the invasion.\n* They probably could have started to unwind sooner, many were calling for it but they were quite resolute despite pressure.\n* They believe 2.5% FFR is neutral which appears to definitely be on the lower end of the range, compared to most economists.\n* **They seem to be pivoting already.  The market is pricing in rate cuts as early as March and a full point by EOY 2023**.\n\nAll in all, it seems that while reflexivity and uncertainty can make it close to extremely difficult to predict the future, I believe a sober look at the Fed's actual actions indicate that generally they tilt towards easy money.", "id": "wcdmw9", "created_utc": 1659233530.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Opinion: The Fed can't predict the future\n\nIf you watched the full press conference Jerome Powell explicitly stated that he will continue to raise rates if inflation remained elevated in the future.
