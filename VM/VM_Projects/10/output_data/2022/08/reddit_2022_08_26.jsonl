S&P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.\n*****\n> The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.\n*****\n> \u201cOverall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That\u2019s the setup every long-term investor looks for,\u201d Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.\n*****\n> Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.\n*****\n> All eyes are on Powell\u2019s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank\u2019s annual symposium in Wyoming.\n*****\n> Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed\u2019s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion\u2019s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.\n*****\n> The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell\u2019s speech Friday morning.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,\u201d Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell: Overtime.\u201d \u201cOne thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall\u2026 implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we\u2019re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/XVrK2d5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Wrkoqsa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kHgNZmZ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/4A3P5G5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/MWcE546.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/efBCDdJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/N0JFnkj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fF3DJd1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0CsFSJc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/FTnFQjA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/cvZtqI0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/26/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-electronic-arts-gap-ulta-beauty-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Electronic Arts (EA)** \u2013 The video game company\u2019s stock jumped 6.2% in the premarket on a Swedish media report that Amazon.com (AMZN) will announce an offer today to buy EA.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** EA\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=EA&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/EA)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Gap (GPS)** \u2013 Gap rallied 6% in premarket trading after the clothing retailer reported an unexpected quarterly profit.

This year has left nothing safe with both stocks and bonds hit hard. Both are in the red by 10%+ on a year to date basis headed into the final week of August. In the charts below, we show the year to date total returns of the S&P 500 (y-axis) and the year to date total returns of various ICE Bank of America bond indices (x-axis) through August for each year going back to their respective inceptions (each index began in 1973 except for high yield which began in 1987). No matter which way you cut it, 2022 has been the worst year of the past half century for stocks and bonds combined.\n\n> With the S&P 500 down a little over 12% YTD, aggregate bonds (government and corporate bonds combined) are only around one percentage point better. For the comparable time of the year, the only years that also have seen both bonds and stocks sitting on a loss through August were 1973, 1974, and 1981. The same applies for government bonds. The corporate investment grade bond index has a bit more variety of years with stocks and bonds falling in 1974, 1981, 2008, and 2015. Again though, none of those other years have seen as sharp of a decline as 2022, and the S&P 500's drop in the same time also ranks as one of the worst. 2022 is the only year that the high yield bond index has fallen simultaneously with stocks, however as we noted earlier, it does not have as long of a history as those other categories.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082422-Bonds-vs-stocks2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Democrats Expected to Keep Senate Control\n\n> President Joe Biden currently has the worst pre-mid-term approval rating since President Truman in 1950. A multitude of factors, including inflation, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, weakening economic data, age, and a lack of definitive action on campaign promises have all contributed to the President's unpopularity. Although Americans are generally dissatisfied with the President, betting markets still project a nearly two-thirds chance that Democrats retain control of the Senate (chart below from electionbettingodds.com). The only two previous Presidents that saw approval ratings lower than Biden's heading into mid-terms (since the start of WWII), Roosevelt in 1942 (third term) and Truman (first term) in 1946, ended up in the mid-terms losing twelve and five senate seats, respectively. In fact, only five Presidents have seen their party's position in the Senate improve or remain flat since the start of WWII in a mid-term election cycle. In these five cycles, the sitting President averaged an approval rating of 57.2%, which is 19.2 percentage points higher than that of Biden.\n\n> Although only 20% of Presidential terms since the start of WWII have seen their party gain Senate seats during mid-terms, subsequent sessions of congress following these election cycles passed some significant legislation. The 88th Congress (under the Kennedy/Johnson administration) passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, ethnicity, or national origin. In addition, that session of congress banned the discrimination of pay in regards to sex, and the 24th amendment was passed (which banned states from making the right to vote in federal elections conditional). The 92nd Congress (under Nixon) removed the dollar from the gold standard and established Title IX. The 116th Congress under Trump passed the CARES act, which helped the country recover from the pandemic and funded vaccination initiatives.\n\n> Regarding equity market returns, in the five mid-terms where the sitting President's party gained Senate seats in a mid-term election year, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 3.1% between the election date and year-end, posting gains three out of five times.

In terms of economic data, we also included a look at the y/y change in CPI and the Unemployment Rate (through September), and then finally Gallup's Presidential Approval Rating. Although one might assume that a strong stock market boosts the President's party in the Senate for the mid-terms, the equity market was down on a YTD basis heading into mid-terms in three of the five years highlighted above. However, the average y/y change in CPI was just 2.7% and only above 5% once. For the sake of comparison, y/y headline CPI as of the end of July currently stands at 8.5%. In terms of approval ratings, every other President who saw a gain in Senate seats in a mid-term election year had the approval of a majority of Americans, whereas nearly two-thirds of Americans currently disapprove of the President. Given this backdrop, the possibility of Democrats keeping their effective majority in the Senate would seem unlikely, but with less than three months until Election Day, the betting markets say otherwise.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Midterm-Elections-Table-082222.png))**\n\n***** \n\n> # Dividend Breakout Despite Declines\n\n> In last Thursday's Chart of the Day, we highlighted how important dividends are for long-term investment performance. While dividends do help to boost investment returns over the long term, in the short term there is often an ebb and flow of dividend-focused ETFs under and outperforming in terms of price moves. For example, up until June, the S&P 500's highest yielders measured by the SPDR S&P 500 High Dividend Yield ETF (SPYD) had mostly been trading in the green whereas the S&P 500 (SPY) was deep in the red.\n\n> With equities broadly taking a turn lower over the past week, SPYD has held up relatively well when compared to the S&P 500 (SPY). Even though SPYD has not avoided declines (as we also showed in our decile analysis, the highest dividend payers have only slightly better performance than non-dividend payers), the relative strength line of SPYD versus SPY has broken out of the past couple of months' downtrend. That being said, it has not been a sharp move higher like what was observed in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter. In other words, the highest yielders are back to outperforming the broader market but not to the same extent as earlier in the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082322-Dividends-2.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082322-Dividends.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Two Month Rally Rotation\n\n> Using the Russell 3,000 as a benchmark, US equities peaked exactly a week ago and have traded lower in all but one session since. In all, the Russell 3000 has fallen 4.33% in that time on weak breadth, albeit certain stocks have been hit far harder than others. Breaking the index down into deciles ranked by a variety of factors, performance has generally been the reverse of what we highlighted earlier this month in regards to the rally off of the June 16th low.\n\n> Over the past week, stocks with higher multiples and smaller market caps have fallen the most. Those are also the ones that had become the most elevated above their moving averages after outperforming during the two-month rally from mid-June to mid-August. Conversely, those stocks with more attractive valuations have tended to perform better, although, here too there have been low single-digit percentage declines across deciles. One other interesting point worth noting is how the highest dividend payers have been hit just as hard as other deciles for that category which is a big difference when compared to the spring when the highest dividend payers were the only pocket of positive performance.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082322-Decile2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # One Big Clue The Lows For The Year Could Be In\n\n> Are we having fun yet? The rollercoaster ride of 2022 continues, as the furious rally off the June 16 lows has taken a breather, with the S&P 500 Index finding resistance right at its 200-day moving average, a logical place for a break after a big bounce. Worries over a hawkish turn from the Fed at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week, housing suggesting the economy is falling quicker than expected, the war in Eastern Europe, and stubborn inflation have all been listed as reasons for the recent weakness. But after a 17.4% rally off the lows, maybe it was just time for a break.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-1-082522.png))**\n\n> We aren\u2019t surprised stocks have to take a breather after the bounce since mid-June, but we continue to think that stocks have likely made their low for the year, and higher prices before year-end are quite possible. In fact, we discussed two reasons we feel this way in Two Reasons the Bulls Should Be Smiling.\n\n> Will it be easy? Probably not (It never is). One of the bigger near-term worries is simply the calendar. Historically, August and September are two of the weakest months of the year. Buckle up, as we could see some usual seasonal volatility once again, but the good news is later in the year stocks tend to do well, something we anticipate to play out again.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-2-082522.png))**\n\n> Now for some good news! The S&P 500 made up more than half of the bear market losses, something that indeed should have bulls smiling. As we show below, since 1950, stocks have never gone on to make new lows after this happened. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean they will go straight up from here, but the past 15 bear markets never moved back to new lows once this feat took place. Even more incredible is the S&P 500 was never lower a year later either, up 19.3% on average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-3-082522.png))**\n\n> So there you have it, yet another clue that June 16 was likely the lows, and stocks potentially could be a good deal higher this time next year. The Carson Investment Research team continues to overweight stocks here, anticipating continued strength.\n\n*****\n\n> # Sentiment Slide*\n\n> With the S&P 500 pivoting lower in the past week, sentiment has reflected the move as the AAII sentiment survey showed bullish sentiment drop from 33.3% last week down to 27.7%. That marked the first time bullish sentiment fell in three weeks, and it was the largest single-week decline since an eleven percentage point drop the week of June 9th.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> Bearish sentiment picked up the bulk of that decline as the reading topped 40% for the first time since the last week of July. At 42.4%, it is at the highest level since July 14th. Although that marks a shift toward more pessimistic sentiment, reversing a trend of improvement from the past few weeks, the current reading on bearish sentiment is well below the highs from throughout the spring and early summer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n> Nonetheless, after coming within only a few points of a positive reading in the past month, the bull-bear spread took a sharp turn lower as a result of this week's results. The spread fell to -14.7 which is the lowest reading since July 14th. That was also the first double-digit week-over-week drop in the reading since June. Additionally, with a move deeper into negative territory, the spread is a week away from becoming tied for the second-longest streak of negative readings on record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Spread.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Spread-Streak.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 8.29.22 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YE3c3hJ.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 8.29.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/76vl5oI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 8.30.22 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aAcdJXk.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 8.30.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wzBwKta.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 8.31.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kBhRlw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 8.31.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w2ZGaOv.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.1.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/trmR0Vw.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.1.22 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6FiuRWg.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.2.22 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.2.22 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)", "id": "wymjho", "created_utc": 1661553917.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "market is coming toward its ichimocko conversion and base line", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "At which level?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "apply ichimoku on chart", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "3935 and 12546", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, do this means that this is the support level?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think he is implying it's about to hit bottom.\nSure hope so, liquidated my SQQQ for TQQQ end of day myself, probably should have waited till mid morning Monday.

So, while the stock is mathematicaly loosing 4.75 as it goes as cash to the investor, the investor only gets 3.60 or so.\n\nSo the best strategy seems to be to sell on the day of record or before (while the stock is up) and buy back the next day.\n\n**All great and smart but now BOTH - shorties and long term tax avoiding investors have to compete for the same stock untill it gets higher.**\n\n**The also need to do it fast - before September 8 when the cash is actually sent to investors' accounts. Long term investors often reinvest the dividends, so after Sep. 8 another boost in price is expected.**\n\n**Shorties have an even bigger problem here: Those 10% loss on paying the dividend is not like having ZIM with 10% higher in exchange. Nope, not by far.**\n\nMath again: The dividend is paid in cash and so is the account penalty for having ZIM borrowed after the day of record. The margin of shorties accounts is 50% at borrowing the stock and 20-30 on mantainance. While a 10% spike in stock would require some 3% up in maintenance margin, a cash dividend payout requires the full ammount - that is some 30% out the 30%. Or 50% if the margin is acepted at 20. Some brokers might accept that as ZIM is not AMC or GME.\n\nIn short:\n\n**ZIM shorties have much vulnerable accounts after yesterday, stronger competition on covering back their position and a short window of opportunity to do so.**\n\n*Late edit - $ZIM was trading higher in pre market, at the time of writing the post. At this moment is slightly lower.*\n\n***This is not DD but discussion. What do you think will happen next?***\n\nIf you are new to $ZIM you might wanna read forward.\n\n**Why $ZIM has a lot of long term investors**\n\nIt is the biggest ocean shipping company listed at stock exchange (NYSE).\n\nIt sells at P/E of 0.90 - meaning that it can buy it self up from profits in just one year.\n\nThe 4.75 USD dividend (10% at current price) is for q2 and 10% boost for q1. By the end of the year they estimate to give out some 20$ in dividends.\n\n**The risk/rewardabout $ZIM**\n\n**Some say they can't boost earnings and dividends because the shipping rates were falling in q2. That is true - shipping rates have fallen during q2. This is the risk.**\n\n**Some say they will make even more money and boost the dividend. Here is why:**\n\n**Every year in this planet, the peak time in shiping is just starting in August and ussually shipping rate are growing until winter. The next 2 quarters a full of shopping seasons like back to school, black friday, Christmas etc. All is generating more demand for shipping so better rates for shipping cargo.**\n\nThey bosted their fleet capacity in the last 2 years and they also have 50% exposure to spot shipping rates.\n\nThat is the biggest exposure in the industry - meaning most of their big cash made last year and this year is generated by the spike in shipping rates.\n\n**The growth story**\n\n$ZIM has aslo invested in AI, GPS tracking technology and something better than QR code, anew scanning tech that will be used in cargo shipping - Look up: DSG, Sodyo and Hoopo. All are start ups with strong international finance backing, with clients and revenue.\n\nI**mportant: ZIM has invested in high growth technology while being a cash cow for investors. Any of those start ups if they hit gold - they bring that gold back to ZIM.**\n\nBut you don't have to wait for tiny revenue every new quarter. They've already earned half of their market value in net profits this year only. **Earning  their own market cap every year.**\n\n**Why I am in**\n\n1.Accountability: Israeli Government owns a key stake in $ZIM. I like that about value stocks. Some supervision never hurts.\n\n2. Hedging: I noticed that every time the growth/tech stocks and the market were doing reall really bad (May, June for example) ZIM was high. It offers also little bit of hedging for all that amazing tech stocksthat I like to think I own.\n\n3. I like to see some profitable earnings for a change :D after this 2 crazy years.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "wy852b", "created_utc": 1661517547.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|28|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|66|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzqbz2/goev_how_apple_car_and_ev_incentives_could_make/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzuirg/goev_how_apple_car_and_ev_incentives_could_make/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rhybix/abcl_a_long_term_winning_gem_inside_a_crowd_of/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rikkws/updated_why_abcl_is_a_multi_bagger_in_this/) \n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wy852b)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wy852b)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3034669756889343}, {"body": "Thank you for the read, already ballz deep in ZIM.

{"title": "JPow annual Jackson Hole speech: Powell warns of \u2018some pain\u2019 ahead as the Fed fights to bring down inflation", "selftext": " Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday pledged that the central bank will \u201cuse our tools forcefully\u201d to attack inflation that is still running near its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nIn his annual Jackson Hole policy speech, Powell added that higher interest rates likely will persist \u201cfor some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.\u201d\n\nThe remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline. Powell said the Fed will not be swayed by a month or two of data.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a stern commitment Friday to halting inflation, warning that he expects the central bank to continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause \u201csome pain\u201d to the U.S. economy.\n\nIn his much-anticipated annual policy speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell affirmed that the Fed will \u201cuse our tools forcefully\u201d to attack inflation that is still running near its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nEven with a series of four consecutive interest rate increases totaling 2.25 percentage points, Powell said this is \u201cno place to stop or pause\u201d even though benchmark rates are probably around an area considered neither stimulative nor restrictive on growth.\n\n\u201cWhile higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,\u201d he said in prepared remarks. \u201cThese are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.\u201d\n\nStocks briefly extended losses as Powell began his speech, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 200 points. The market later steadied, with the Dow off narrowly. Treasury yields were off their highs of the session.\n\nThe remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline.\n\nTwo closely watched gauges, the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed prices little changed in July, owing largely to a steep drop in energy costs.\n\nAt the same time, other areas of the economy are slowing. Housing in particular is falling off rapidly, and economists expect that the huge surge in hiring over the past year and a half is likely to cool.\n\nHowever, Powell cautioned that the Fed\u2019s focus is broader than a month or two of data, and it will continue pushing ahead until inflation moves down closer to its 2% long-range goal.\n\n\u201cWe are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%,\u201d he said. Looking into the future, the central bank leader added that \u201crestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.\u201d\n\nThe economy is coming off consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, a commonly held definition of recession. However, Powell and most other economists see the underlying economy as strong if slowing.\n\nTo the point\n\nThe speech was unusually brief.\n\nWhereas Fed leaders, including Powell, often have used the Jackson Hole symposium as an opportunity to outline broad policy shifts, Powell\u2019s remarks Friday clocked in at just six pages. He introduced the speech by noting that his \u201cremarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrice stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.\u201d\n\nMarkets are awaiting the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September to see if the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to see if it will enact a third consecutive 0.75percentage point increase. Powell said the decision \u201cwill depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.\u201d\n\nTraders are currently pricing a close call between a half-point and three-quarter-point increase. As of Friday morning just after Powell\u2019s speech, the probability for a half-point move was at 51.5%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch measure.\n\nLooking to history\n\nThe Fed is using a lesson from the past as its guidepost for current policy.\n\nSpecifically, Powell said the inflation of 40 years ago provides the current Fed with three lessons: That central banks like the Fed are responsible for managing inflation, that expectations are critical, and that \u201cwe must keep at it until the job is done.\u201d\n\nPowell noted that the Fed\u2019s failure to act forcefully in the 1970s caused a perpetuation of high inflation expectations that led to the draconian rate hikes of the early 1980s. In that case, then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker pulled the economy into recession to tame inflation.\n\nWhile stating repeatedly that he doesn\u2019t think recession is an inevitable outcome for the U.S. economy, Powell noted that managing expectations is critical if the Fed is going to avoid a Volcker-like outcome.\n\nIn the early 1980s, \u201ca lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year,\u201d Powell said. \u201cOur aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.\u201d\n\nOne concept molding Powell\u2019s thinking is the concept of \u201crational inattention.\u201d Essentially, that means people pay less attention to inflation when it is low and more when it is high.\n\n\u201cOf course, inflation has just about everyone\u2019s attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/26/powell-warns-of-some-pain-ahead-as-fed-fights-to-lower-inflation.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/26/powell-warns-of-some-pain-ahead-as-fed-fights-to-lower-inflation.html)", "id": "wyajkx", "created_utc": 1661523839.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|202|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|87|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wyajkx)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wyajkx)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06884145736694336}, {"body": "\n\nIn the UK the government seem absolutely set to keep introducting policy's and give cash hand outs that keep fueling inflation and we're going to be looking at potentially 13% inflation soon \n\nWe're already at 9-10% \n\nThe government are thinking of cutting income taxes, giving out relief payments and energy bills are skyrocketing 80% in price.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "The UK going to hit 18% in Feb/ march but America has there own supply of energy unlike the UK so there in a much better position.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5453997850418091}, {"body": "These politicians\u2026 I will be moving to the UK and was shocked when I checked my energy bill estimation online after the new caps to-be-implemented in October.\n\nDo British companies give raises at the end of year to match inflation?
