You sell a put credit spread 12 months out at the .10 delta 5 strikes wide (let's call it the 120/115 spread) and you collect $30 in credit.\n\nThat is BEYOND terrible.  \n\n1) your max profit is $30 and it takes A YEAR to get it.  \n\n2)  the price can change ALOT in a year.  If the price closes under $118 then you experience a max loss.\n\n3)  you tied up $500 to earn $30.   That isn't bad, except you tied that money up for a YEAR.  AND you can lose $470 on the trade.\n\n\nIf you want to sell \"safe\" spreads, selling the .20 delta at 1-3 strikes wide 21 days out can usually get you 15-25% profit based on buying power required.  That's an 80% win chance, the theta burns off fast (i.e. you can buy it back 12 days later at 50% of what you sold it for) and you get back much more money for what you risked.\n\n\nThe goal of playing put credit spreads isn't to throw your entire account at one spread - it's to find stocks you're confident about the direction they will trade in the near future, and open multiple spreads that each have a win chance of 70% or higher.\n\n(\"Higher\" because in practice you will never let a position that's losing close at a max loss - you'll close it when it starts turning against you so that you only realize a 10-20% loss at the most, AND theta decay helps mitigate the damage done by the price challenging your short leg)", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your insight!

Because the price almost doubled this morning, at 10AM the spread was only worth $10 (the delta move wiped out most of the value) so I bought it back for $10, which is 71% of max profit.    I made $25 at the risk of losing a maximum of $65, which is a GREAT return on investment.\n\n\nMost of the theta decay on an option's value happens in the last 2-3 weeks before expiration.  I like selling 14 DTE because I can generally capture 50% max profit within 5-6 business days.   \n\nMany people like selling the 30DTE or 45DTE because the .30 delta strike is further OTM (which allows more cushion for the price to fall before it challenges the short leg) AND half of the time value has decayed by day 21.   \n\n\nRemember, the goal isn't making MAXIMUM profit, the goal is making SOME profit.  \n\nIf your max profit is $50 in 45 days, but you decide to capture $25 of profit in 20 days, you've still won.

{"title": "NOK (Nokia) DD", "selftext": "tHe oLd pHoNe cOmPaNy??  \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee  \ud83d\udcf1 \n\n\tNokia, a Finnish International Telecomm company. First point, Finnish, as in FINLAND. One of the more trustworthy and competent countries on earth. 10000X better than investing in CCP dick sucking commie Chinese piece of shit \u201ccompanies\u201d. Nokia, founded in 1865, yes you read that right! Is a global giant and is only getting stronger.\n\nSome stats:\n\nRevenue\t\u20ac22.202 billion(2021)\n\nOperating income\t \u20ac2.775 billion (2021)\n\nNet income\t \u20ac330 million (2021)\n\nTotal assets\t\u20ac40.049 billion(2021)\n\nTotal equity\t \u20ac17.462 billion (2021)\n\nNumber of employee     87,927 (2021)\n\nNot only has NOK been making the most solid phones to ever exist but they are the world's third-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. In the USA it only has ONE competitor for building 5G networks for operators, that is Ericsson(not a bad company either). NOK is one of the world leaders in 5G and its infrastructure grows worldwide every day. Such as in Indonesia, one of the most populated and important countries in the future. Its foothold there will insure profit for decades to come. Since infrastructure is the only thing holding some companies up at all (AT&T is a piece of shit and its existing cables are the only thing saving it from its own incompetence) NOK on the other hand is run by actual business people who actually want to run one of the largest companies in Finland, a source of national pride even.\n\nCurrently NOK has been SMASHING earnings and its stock has gone down with others recently but it is already making most of that back up. Real target for me is $6 shares EOY if the economy keeps this recovery, otherwise the lowest I ever expect it to be is $4.20 (legalize). Its price has been steady for years and is a slow mover. No wild days, no crazy jumps, a rock, slow and steady. The options chain is great. With a low price the options are affordable for even the poorest regard here. Price is less unpredictable than many other stocks but that does not mean options can not yield big. Sure NOK likes to sit level for days on end, but it always eventually changes. This is not a stock you buy weeklies on, buy a few months out.  \n\nSince options are sop cheap that is more doable than SPY puts that expire in jan 23 (take out a loan for those). Currently I have a nice little strangle around $5.00 which I bought when NOK was $4.70. In fact I bought more puts after the increase as prices fell. Jan 23 $6 calls are very affordable but $5.50 might be safer.  \n\nThis is also a stock to BUY AND HOLD. Not some pump and dump rug pull. This is a solid company with solid fundamentals.  If you buy the stock anywhere bellow $6.00 in the next 3 years it is a steal!. Ii know its not a risky or absolutely stupid as the fun MEME stonks that we like to get left holding the bags on. This is an actual company that is set for powerful and lasting growth.  \n\nRegards, Moonordie69420", "id": "wjadk4", "created_utc": 1659969216.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|876|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w2x3yd/why_you_cant_lose_buy_stocks_right_now/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wjadk4)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wjadk4)\n    \nHey /u/moonordie69420, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2490907609462738}, {"body": "It's January 2021 again.
