GEICO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway", "selftext": "[deleted]", "id": "wdlk6x", "created_utc": 1659370939.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "GEICO has closed all of its 38 California agent offices that sell auto and homeowners policies and other lines and has also ended the practice of selling insurance through telephone agents in the state.\n\nThree offices in Sacramento, one in Roseville, three in Fresno and one in Modesto were among offices that have closed in the last few days. The closures are resulting in more than 35 layoffs in the Sacramento area and hundreds statewide.\n\nThe GEICO office in Roseville only opened in July 2021. GEICO put out a press release at the time saying it would meet the insurance needs of all Placer County residents.\n\nThe California Department of Insurance is following GEICO\u2019s actions, said California Deputy Insurance Commissioner Michael Soller.\n\n\u201cWe are monitoring to make sure consumers are protected,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nA GEICO spokesperson would not comment on the new changes but said the company was not leaving California.\n\n\u201cWe continue to write policies in California, and we remain available through our direct channels for the more than 2.18 million California customers presently insured with us,\u201d the company said in an unsigned emailed statement to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nThe changes leave online options through a computer or a mobile device as the only way to obtain a GEICO policy in California\n\nGEICO is one of the largest property and casualty insurers in California but Soller said consumers have options. He said more than 130 companies compete for private passenger auto business and more than 70 companies write homeowners insurance.\n\nGEICO\u2019s actions in California come as company commissioned Walk-In agents and phone sales remain open in other western states. GEICO is also advertising on its website for a new sales agent at an office in Naples, Florida.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if GEICO is losing money in California and the moves are part of a strategy to reduce business.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s actions will make it harder for consumers to buy GEICO policies, particularly those who are computer challenged or prefer to meet an agent in person\u201d, said former California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones in an interview.\n\nJones, who served as Insurance Commissioner from 2011 to 2019, said the reason GEICO has local offices is for consumers who want to meet their insurance agent in person.\n\nOr GEICO put it this way on their website about the local agents: \u201cTheir primary role is to prospect and generate insurance leads and policies that GEICO would otherwise not capture.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, several GEICO customers who attempted to meet with local agents at the GEICO office at 5211 Madison Ave. in Sacramento were turned away.\n\nThey were told to call a 800 number.\n\n\u201cWe are permanently shut down and can\u2019t write new policies,\u201d said an agent on Thursday to a reporter.\n\nThe doors to the office were locked and multiple signs were posted on the agency windows, saying it was temporarily closed today. The signs have hung on the windows since last week when policy sales were stopped.\n\nThe agent, who opened the door for less than a minute, stated that the closure was permanent and due to corporate decisions by GEICO, not the local agency, which is independently owned.\n\nGEICO hires local agents, according to its website, who must spend between $100,000 and $250,000 to open an office. The agents make their money on commissions and can only sell GEICO products.\n\nThe insurer stopped new policy phone sales in California several months ago.\n\nGEICO is part of Berkshire Hathaway, the publicly traded company run by famed investor Warren Buffett.\n\nhttps://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/geico-closes-california-insurance-offices-lays-off-hundreds-state-is-monitoring-situation-the-sacramento-bee", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8175601959228516}, {"body": "Upvote for photo.", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.004524819552898407}, {"body": "Separately, I've heard Munger and Weston Hicks (Alleghany's last CEO before Joe Brandon) mention how California has a terrible regulatory environment for Worker's Comp. insurance so maybe that has started to bleed into other lines of insurance as well.\n\n>GEICO hires local agents, according to its website, who must spend between $100,000 and $250,000 to open an office.

It's not hard to conclude that Geico is pulling out simply because they can't make a profit operating in this environment of spiraling payouts and inability to make up for them with appropriate rate increases. If California government got some sanity back and started to prosecute and deter criminals, crime would start to go down, and insurance companies could make a profit and continue to provide service. Californians have only themselves to blame for the pullout by company after company who isn't willing to sacrifice its business on the irrational altar of wokeness and imaginary racial justice. Companies exist to make a profit, not to demonstrate fealty to a cause. If they don't make a profit, they don't pay salaries. Now California's insane attitudes about crime are resulting in more unemployment and negative impact to the economy. The homeowners insurance industry is already in an upward cost spiral as a result of California's inability to manage its annual conflagrations that will soon wipe out the entire redwood forest along with increasing numbers of homes and communities.

{"title": "The Stock Market Is Rallying. Here\u2019s What Could Make it Tumble Again...", "selftext": "While the stock market has enjoyed an impressive run of late, the party could end when the next inflation result comes out in early August. The S&P 500 has gained 13% since hitting its lowest close of the year in mid-June, mounting a broad rally that features more than just a handful of stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 16% from its mid-June low, and the Russell 2000 index of stocks with smaller market capitalizations has risen 14%. \n\nThe main force behind that has been investors\u2019 view that the Federal Reserve will begin to slow down the sharp increases in interest rates it has been rolling out as it seeks to lower the rate of inflation by curbing economic demand. While the Fed will likely raise its target for the benchmark lending rate at its next few policy-setting meetings, the probability that it lifts the rate to above 3.5% by February has gone down to 17% from a 44% chance a month ago, according to CME Group data. The bank now aims to keep the benchmark, the fed-funds rate, at 2.25%-2.5%, up from near zero at the start of the year.\n\nContributing to that more optimistic view about rates are signs in two key places that the rate of inflation has already peaked. Commodity prices are now way down, with West Texas Intermediate crude off about 14% since the start of June, and copper down about 16%. Not only is oil part of the consumer price index basket, but it is possible that falling commodity prices reflect a decline in demand across the economy. Another indication that prices could be cooling off appeared in the S&P Global U.S. Services Purchasing Managers Index, a measure of activity in the services sector. That fell to 47 in July, while anything below 50 represents a contraction in activity. If activity is diminishing, demand would fall as well, bringing prices down. \n\nMarkets will get to see whether that optimistic thesis holds water when the consumer price index is released on Aug. 10. Economists are looking for the CPI to have gained 8.8% year over year in July, which would be below the 9.1% seen for June. For stocks to keep rising, the market needs to see that inflation is in fact cooling down. If the result is worse than expected, expectations that the Fed will slow down its rate increases could fade away, sending the stock market tumbling. \n\n\u201cThe Fed has to be concerned that inflation is becoming more entrenched and they are going to need to remain aggressive in raising interest rates,\u201d wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cWe believe the rally will last until later in the summer. Markets will again have another selloff.\u201d Others agree. \u201c\\[Stock\\] gains are now data dependent,\u201d wrote Julian Emanuel, equity strategist at Evercore. \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-fed-inflation-cpi-rates-51659129515?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-fed-inflation-cpi-rates-51659129515?mod=mw_latestnews)", "id": "wdb2nj", "created_utc": 1659338337.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I just don't think the fed will reduce interest rates if inflation gets stuck at 4-5%.

{"title": "*A surprise, really?* \u2022\u2022 China\u2019s Manufacturing Sector Unexpectedly Contracts Amid Weak Demand, Covid Lockdowns", "selftext": "Just 10 of the 21 sectors tracked by China\u2019s statistics bureau expanded in July, versus 13 in June.\n\n[Full Article](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/chinas-manufacturing-sector-unexpectedly-contracts-amid-weak-demand-covid-lockdowns-11659240067)\n\nChinese manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in July, official surveys showed on Sunday, as Beijing\u2019s stringent Covid-19 restrictions and weak demand undercut hopes for a more robust economic revival, underscoring how far the country remains from any semblance of postpandemic normalcy.\n\nThe official manufacturing purchasing managers index pulled back to 49.0 in July from 50.2 in June, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday. The result pointed to a surprise contraction in economic activity, dropping below the 50 line that separates expansion from contraction and falling short of the median forecast of 50.3 among economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlthough local governments across China have grown more adept at controlling Covid-19 outbreaks swiftly and with fewer disruptions than in previous months, the PMI reading is likely to underscore concerns among economists and investors about the path ahead for the world\u2019s second-largest economy as Beijing reaffirms its commitment to strict zero-Covid policies.\n\nOn Thursday, the Politburo, the top policy-making body of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, toughened its language on the importance of containing Covid and explicitly cited political considerations in balancing pandemic controls and economic growth. It also offered little sign that it would relent from its regulatory campaign to rein in the property sector, a historically reliable growth engine that by some measures accounts for roughly one-third of the overall economy.\n\nIn mid-July, China reported gross domestic product expanded at a meager 0.4% annual rate in the second quarter of the year compared with a year earlier, its weakest growth rate in more than two years, highlighting the depth of the damage caused by stringent lockdowns. The poor showing has prompted top leaders to effectively acknowledge that the government\u2019s official GDP target of around 5.5% growth in 2022 is now out of reach, barring a big stimulus push that Beijing has all but ruled out.\n\nChinese officials, speaking Sunday, nodded to the challenges ahead for the economy. \u201cThe foundation of economic recovery still needs to be consolidated,\u201d said Zhao Qinghe, a senior official at the statistics bureau, citing insufficient market demand and weakness among energy-intensive industries as particular sources of concern.\n\nOnly 10 out of the 21 industries surveyed by the statistics bureau showed expansion in July, versus 13 in June. June\u2019s PMI reading of 50.2 had been the expansionary reading after three straight months in which the strict lockdown of Shanghai, China\u2019s most prosperous city and a key manufacturing hub, had kept the gauge below the 50 mark.\n\nChina\u2019s export sector, a key growth engine for the country\u2019s initial postpandemic recovery, continued to disappoint, serving as a headwind for the overall manufacturing industry. In July, the PMI subindex tracking export orders remained in contractionary territory for a 15th consecutive month.\n\nMore downside risks remain after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark lending rate by another 0.75 percentage points in late July, its second such move this summer, in a bid to combat inflation. Tightening rates in the U.S. and other major economies threaten to stifle overseas demand for Chinese-made goods, economists say.\n\nSeparately on Sunday, China\u2019s official nonmanufacturing PMI eased to 53.8 in July, compared with a reading of 54.7 in June, the statistics bureau said. The subindex measuring service-sector activity pulled back to 52.8 in July, compared with 54.3 in June, while the subindex tracking construction activity rose to 59.2, from 56.6 in June.\n\nWhile both subindexes remain in expansionary territory, suggesting the modest recovery in the nonmanufacturing sector remains largely on track, the strict social restrictions\u2014requiring, for instance, PCR testing results to board public transit or enter restaurants in many cities, as well as quarantines for those traveling from one city to another\u2014continue to cast a shadow over consumer demand, especially for restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues.\n\nThe weaker PMI readings took place against the backdrop of continued sporadic Covid outbreaks in July, though the lockdowns were largely confined to less-developed regions of the country, including landlocked Gansu province in China\u2019s arid northwest and poor, mountainous Guangxi in the southwest.", "id": "wd49rd", "created_utc": 1659316161.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|58|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2972|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wd49rd)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wd49rd)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1269921362400055}, {"body": "But there they go with the BRICS economies reserve currency, sounds a bit like putting the horse ahead of the cart.\n\nChina\u2019s refusal to use vaccines from other countries have and will co to use to cost the dearly.
