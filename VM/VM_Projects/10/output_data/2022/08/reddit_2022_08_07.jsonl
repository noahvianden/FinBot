Going up an inverter size, for example installing an SE-10,000 inverter with a 7,500-watt system, would make the system less efficient. The lost production in that scenario would be more than the little bit of production lost from occasional clipping.\n\n  \n\n\nThe above is from https://newenglandcleanenergy.com/energymiser/2017/11/02/what-does-solar-inverter-clipping-mean/ also https://unboundsolar.com/blog/oversizing-pv-arrays has good info as well, where it talks about how clipping can actually be a good thing, in certain solar system designs.\n\nYou are getting worked up about it, but again what Tesla did is typical in the industry, and many installers won't go out of their way to explain it to the customer unless the customer asks.\n\nYes, buying solar without being well informed may mean something isn't quite what you thought it should be. But in the end, you got what you paid for, and in many of those cases, the customer won't ever realize/know something is unexpected. But in other situations, the customer may notice and be upset. That is just the way it is today... I'm not saying it should be that easy, but there is a balance that must be found, some customers will either get lost if the installer houses into too much detail (possibly costing a sale when a basic customer says screw it, I'll go with the the less confusing/more straightforward installer), or could end up sucking up a lot of time as the installer teaches the customer all these details. Time is money and some business will choose to not spend that time on one same when they could instead get 2 sales with that same time/effort.\n\n  \n\n\nFor instance I have a 12.64kW system, but my max generation is 9.8kW (something just under 10). I thought this would be due to clipping, but it was actually due to orientation of some panels, not so my panels face the same way and thus they aren't all capturing pay solar at the same time of day. But while it sounds like you would see that as a negative and be upset, ultimately the system produced roughly what the installer estimated annually (actually a bit over the estimate which is great) and while I don't ever get over 19kW, I do get more kW Earley in the day due to those panels that gave a different direction, so I still come out 'ahead' (or actually, where I should be, on an overall basis).\n\nSolar is simply a complex system, and installers can't realistically teach every customer all aspects - if you want to know it all, go to 'school' just like the installer did lol.

{"title": "Big Lots: Potential On Sale", "selftext": "Below is some quick DD on Big Lots (NYSE:BIG), the home retailer that I believe maybe overlooked and ripe with potential for a big move.\n\n# Relative Valuation:\n\nIn order to uncover value in this all-knowing market, one must be willing to sift through the mud to find CHEAP companies. And Big Lots is CHEAP. Metrics like P/B at 0.61 and P/E at 9.08 point fervently to negative investor sentiment. But check out some of their competitors to get a relative idea.  \n\n[Retailers P\\/B & P\\/E](https://preview.redd.it/gn9bnw8bx4g91.png?width=236&format=png&auto=webp&s=55cfea4a95704e631a665334ba6c7b937849a31a)\n\nAs you can see, Big Lots blows away the peers in terms of relative valuation, trading for the cheapest earnings and almost half the value of their assets.\n\n# Tailwinds Coming:\n\nAt this point, I don't think anyone questions the near-term direction of the economy. Stagflation will lead to tighter consumer budgets, forcing people to shop at discount retailers like Big Lots. Like everyone else, Big Lots will surely feel pressure from rising interest rates and other effects tied to economic pullback. But as store traffic and sales increase, this should outweigh the effects. They have also been increasing inventories significantly over the past year, getting out ahead of supply chain disruptions and rising shipping costs. Inventories have increased 42% since January of last year, which they prudently funded much of through capital efficient sale-leasebacks on four of their distribution centers. Through loading up for oncoming forecasted demand, as summer cyclicality swinging in their favor, Q2 will likely be a move in the right direction.\n\n# Impressive Dividends:\n\nNot only does Big Lots offer positive free cash flow at a ridiculously cheap price, but they also pay shareholders outsized dividends for holding their stock. Big Lots' [5.73% annual yield](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/big/dividend-history) bests the competition by a long shot. Take a look at the below.\n\n[Retailers Dividend Yield](https://preview.redd.it/y23kd7k8d8g91.png?width=210&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5991daea3cacc9887aa767869d7e44cab72efee)\n\nFor context, dividend yield for the S&P 500 index was 1.69% in Q2 2022 and has hovered around this level for years. Big Lots' market-beating dividends make this cheap stock even more attractive to hold long term, something many of the company insiders are doing through the form of stock grants.\n\nBig Lots leadership has been [loading up](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=BIG&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&xa=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1) on shares recently. Over the last six months, 465,446 restricted shares have been granted to insiders, valued around $16M. Conversely, only 178,498 have been sold. Granted, these newly awarded shares have a vesting period, incentivizing insider ownership. \n\n# Short Squeeze Potential:\n\nGiven the right catalyst and publicity, Big Lots could present an interesting short squeeze opportunity. The WSB veterans will know the ins and outs of a short squeeze, but as a refresher, some typical indicators that a company could possibly undergo one in the near future are:\n\n1. High short volume (>5x average daily volume)\n2. High number of shares short as a percentage of float (>10% of float)\n3. Increasing shares short\n\n[Big Lots' short volume](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BIG/short-interest/) was 9.9MM shares as of 7/15. This is 7.45x average daily trading volume of 1.3MM shares. *Check*.\n\nBig Lots shares short as a percentage of float was 37.4%, signaling a significant portion of tradable shares is being shorted. *Check*.\n\nAnd with 7.45 days to cover (or short interest ratio), it would take over a week for short sellers to cover their positions given a sizeable uptick in the share price. However, it is interesting to note that volume has been trending down in recent months. This past month saw a reduction to around 975,000 average daily volume, which extends days to cover to 10.15 days; *over two full trading weeks*. This lengthy amount of time could prove a burdensome liquidation risk for short sellers, causing them to close their positions, in turn driving Big Lots' price higher.\n\nThe one portion of this three-pronged approach that Big Lots might be missing is the increasing number of shares short. As the share price has declined heavily, so has the short interest, dropping 5.9% from 6/30. This is not a great sign for the short squeeze opportunity, as it means short sellers are exiting their positions in the green and relieving sell pressure from the stock. However, share prices have been increasing over the past week faster than the shorts have been exiting, which is a good sign for this strategy. A large catalyst, like Q2 earnings outperformance (which should be in [a couple of weeks](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/big/earnings)), could be enough to tip the scale and set off a short squeeze.\n\n# Valuation:\n\nWith conservative assumptions in a basic dividend discount model, Big Lots looks undervalued. See my DDM valuation assumptions below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Big Lots DDM Valuation](https://preview.redd.it/ke32uppyg8g91.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15608d007a268f729fed8395eed0c5941ce94a4)\n\nTo come up with a conservative Cost of Equity I used the Capital Asset Pricing Model, where the risk-free rate is equal to the current 10-year treasury rate, Beta is a composite average from five separate sources, and market rate of return is equal to the 30-year Inflation Adjusted Market Return. This boils down to a CAPM Cost of Equity of 10.7%. Big Lots is expected to pay another $1.20 annual dividend per share next year, and have experienced an impressive five-year dividend growth rate of [6.9%](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/dividend_growth_5y/BIG/5Y-Average-Dividend-Growth-Rate/Big-Lots-Inc). Combining these figures results in a target share price of $31.59, a 53% premium over 8/4/22 closing price. This does not include the effects of a potential short squeeze.\n\nIn my opinion, it is not entirely useful to use a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") Model for Big Lots because there are so many factors that could impact future cash flows, and cost of capital assumptions are rapidly changing due to macro trends. I also believe that comparable performance will be a huge key to Big Lots' value creation in the near term, and the DCF model does not consider this.\n\n# Summary:\n\nI'm not going to ignore the many risks associated with Big Lots' less than desirable financials, questionable growth prospects, and recent earnings miss. And I would normally caution against a relatively small retail chain going up against giants during a time of economic strife. But like WSB legend DFV said:\n\n>\u201cIf none of the companies you invest in go bankrupt, you aren\u2019t taking enough risk.\u201d - DFV\n\nThe way I see it, the pros outweigh the cons. Big Lots trades *extremely* cheap, they are Free Cash Flow positive, they pay an incredible dividend yield, they have serious oncoming macro tailwinds, and they are one headline away from a massive short squeeze.

{"title": "Cellebrite (CLBT) \u2013 Low Float, Severely Undervalued, Earnings This Week (They\u2019re gonna be good)", "selftext": "It\u2019s the favorite digital intelligence company that you didn\u2019t even know about. Based in Israel and used by pretty much every economically relevant government in the world (especially the FBI and US military), they provide the tools for accessing digitally encrypted information. While they started with smartphones, they recently added the Blockchain to their offerings:\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cellebrite-adds-cryptocurrency--blockchain-investigations-solution-to-industry-leading-digital-intelligence-platform-301099234.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cellebrite-adds-cryptocurrency--blockchain-investigations-solution-to-industry-leading-digital-intelligence-platform-301099234.html)\n\nGlobal conflict is good business for those with military grade tech and there\u2019s currently plenty of that to go around. CLBT has been transitioning from hardware to a SAAS model over the last couple of years to minimize costs and build margin stability. Over 75-80% of their revenue is subscription based, meaning inflation is not going to be an issue. \n\nFrom their last earnings:\n\n\u00b7  Revenue of $62.4 million, up 17% year-over-year, of which subscription revenue was $48.2 million, up 19% year-over-year \n\n\u00b7  Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $201 million, up 33% year-over-year \n\n\u00b7  Recurring revenue dollar-based net retention rate of 128% \n\n\u00b7  GAAP gross profit and gross margin of $51.4 million and 82.4%, respectively \n\n\u00b7  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin of $4.1 million and 7%, respectively \n\n2022 Guidance:\n\n\u00b7  Full year 2022 revenue is expected to be between $285 and $300 million, representing 16-22% year on year growth. \n\n\u00b7  December 2022 ARR is expected to be between $250 and $265 million, representing 34-42% year on year growth. \n\n\u00b7  Full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $39.0 and $44.0 million, representing a 13-15% margin. \n\nNearly 80% of shares are held by institutional investors and typically trades under very low volume. When volume picks up (around earnings) 10-15% moves happen regularly. Now I\u2019m going to do a little bit of math but just grab a beer and stay with me because you\u2019re not as dumb as you look:\n\nCurrent market cap is $1.08B @ $5.70 per share. This means if CLBT hits the low end of their 2022 projections ($285M) we\u2019re sitting at 3.79 times CURRENT year sales. \n\nAfter the brutal first half of 2022, current SAAS averages for P/S are about 6.5 times NEXT year sales. CLBT is projecting 18-20% yoy growth for the next five years. \n\n1.18 x 285M = $336M (next years sales)\n\n336M x 6.5 = $2.18B (next years sales at current average market multiple)\n\n2.18B/1.08B = 2.02 (fair value market cap to current market cap)\n\n2.02 x $5.70 = $11.51 per share (fair per share value) \n\nFor those who weren\u2019t paying attention, that would be a gain of around 102%\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take into account pricing power or recent business expansions, given they\u2019re position as the top provider for DI in the market. \n\nIf you need any more convincing of how undervalued CLBT is, look at their closest competitor. It\u2019s Magnet Forensics (MAGT.TO). They project $91.5M in 2022 Sales, which means they\u2019re currently trading at 10.22 times current year\u2019s sales. \n\nEarnings are Thursday (11 Aug) before open. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\\-  **CLBT is the market leader in Digital Intelligence, profitable and not going to be affected by inflation.** \n\n\\-  **They\u2019re currently valued at least 50% below similar companies.** \n\n\\-  **Given their low float, a good earnings report will lead to that value gap closing fast.**\n\nPositions: 7c 8/19 and tens of thousands of warrants", "id": "winpwf", "created_utc": 1659900165.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|52|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=winpwf)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=winpwf)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19324347376823425}, {"body": "How not uncertain are you?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07019655406475067}, {"body": "BDS", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your contribution", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2214730679988861}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20020218193531036}, {"body": "OP left out a banned word that they used in another sub.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yea, it was a copy and paste, but the other sub bans it for some reason", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5050042271614075}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0034465640783309937}, {"body": "But how do you know they will severely surpass expectations otherwise waste of time", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The thesis is that they are severely undervalued relative to the accepted average market multiple and that simply meeting their projections will lead to price discovery in line with the broader market.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It could double pretty easily.
