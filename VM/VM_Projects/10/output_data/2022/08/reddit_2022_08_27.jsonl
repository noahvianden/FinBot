Cyclical factors that help.", "selftext": " \n\nTLDR at end.  \nWhile  everything looks like doom and gloom out there, there are cyclical  factors at play RIGHT NOW that will continue to  improve the economy by  December:\n\n  \n\\#1) School is back in session :  there will be an innate  boost in job growth as teachers, TA's and student asst's get back to  college and grade schools.  School back  has built in growth of consumer  staples like school supplies, lunches, books   etc.  The college  economy boosts bars and restaurants as kids eat out and party in college  towns.  And the biggest factor for schools is , FOOTBALL IS BACK,  the  NCAA college football season is one of the biggest boosters of the US  economy on a cyclical basis, stadiums take hundreds of people to run on a  weekly basis in every state, this will also boost jobs and sales of  said stadiums.\n\n\\#2)  NFL Football  is back, for the same reasons stated above, the NFL employs a lot of  people and boosts all types of consumer staples  on a cyclical basis.    Beer, meat, campers and related accessories are gonna be boosted at this  time of year.\n\nSO While daddy Jpow  has promised to crash the economy fear not, as job numbers continue to  improve and year end earnings continue to rise  a sense of normalcy will  soon take hold by thanksgiving the FEAR will die after sept. and the  'soft landing' he seeks may be in sight.  I believe this is planned, the  fed knows this is the best time of year for the country and they expect  things to improve through end of year which will allow them to  'tighten' less by Dec.\n\nInflation  will continue to drop Month Over month as oil stays lower for longer,  the 'current thing' in europe will continue to drag on but seems to  already be 'baked into' the cake at this point.\n\nA  bear is just a bull that wants to buy lower, i will be loading the boat  once we break below 4k S&P. Full disclosure i am only holding  S&P puts at this time that printed well friday. i will close puts  and be going full bore bull  into calls below 4K\n\nTLDR:   School is back, Football is back, Economy gonna be boosted cause of  this.  expect rate hikes to slow come NOV.

The retailer has been struggling in recent years, but they are hoping that a new credit line of $2.5 billion will help them get back on track. The company plans to use the money to improve its online presence, invest in stores, and offer more discounts. Some experts believe that this may not be enough to save Bed Bath & Beyond, however, as it continues to face competition from Amazon and Walmart. Only time will tell if this new financing will be enough for the retailer to rebound.\n\nThe shares of Bed Bath & Beyond appreciated 18% on Wednesday after the news broke that it was in talks to receive funding. But after investors inquired whether the cash infusion would be sufficient to help the firm achieve its long-awaited turnaround, some of the air was let out of that rally. The company's shares were trading at $10.62 on Friday, down 4.7 percent for the week, a particularly volatile one that included Ryan Cohen's exit from his position in the firm.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has been trying to turn things around for a while now, but it has been difficult. The company has been facing competition from Amazon and Walmart, two of the biggest retailers in the world. This new financing will help the company improve its online presence and invest in stores, but some experts are skeptical that it will be enough to save the company in the long run. Only time will tell if this new financing will be enough to help Bed Bath & Beyond get back on track.

This adjustment number is calculated based of Q3 inflation as portrayed by the CPI-W which is a CPI of a specific demographic (clerical/urban workers).
