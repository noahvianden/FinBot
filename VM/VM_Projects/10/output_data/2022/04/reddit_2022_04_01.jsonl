Others that may not be considered \u201ctech companies\u201d were still harmed by some of the same dynamics that damaged those stocks, however \u2014 Xylem, which sells controls technology and other supplies to the water industry, saw its margins slammed by increasing costs of components for those systems.\n\nThe 12 stocks combined to lose nearly half a trillion dollars in market cap on their own, a total of $494.19 billion.

After a decade or so you will probably be able to DCA $1~2k per month. Buying $10 per day on the other hand is a lot of wasted time over time, not to mention depending on your broker you may even need to pay some fee per transaction. Lump sum VS DCA is only relevant when you have like 10k or way more in cash.\n\nAnother thing is the fear of a bear market. Do you intend to invest in an index fund and tend to hold for a long, long time like 10+ years or even longer? Then there is nothing to fear. You should never try to predict the market. The only thing you need to know is that vast majority of humans, corporations, and nations are always trying to make money, so the total economic value should always go up. It could be slowed down by the occasional crashes, but in the end it should always go up. IF the world, especially the US, goes to irrecoverable shit, then even your cash won't worth much anyway (look at the ruble).\n\nFinally, can you survive for a few months without this $2k? Have you paid all your debts? IMO you should only invest if you have (depending on your job and lifestyle) 3 to 6 months of emergency fund (to pay your rent, food, etc.) in your bank. I suspect that if you do worry about losing this $2k in the market, then you may not want to invest it.\n\nIn conclusion assuming that this 2k of cash is something you can spare to invest, and what you intend to invest in is relatively safe (VOO, VTI, VT, etc.), then go ahead and lump sum into it. Do not sell even if it drops by 10% or even 30%.

I think since Im new to investing, Im more concerned about the opportunity costs of a lump sum especially at times as uncertain as this.

However this only holds true when you have enough cash on your hands to buy more.\n\nAs a 19 yo student, I still do not have a stable source of income outside part time jobs I take during semester breaks. So I worry if I were to lump sum all my savings in now, then I would essentially lose my opportunity to buy more in case of a bear market since I probably wont have any available balance to invest anymore.\n\nDo you think I should be concerned about these potential opportunity costs or is it just in my head?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> I fear losing an opportunity to buy at cheaper prices IF there is a bear market.\n\nHahaha, that is one of the most common yet unreasonable fear that all newbie investors would have. Remember: you won't know when there will be a bear market, you also won't know when it will be at the \"bottom\", and even if you buy at let's say -10%, you won't know if that's the dip, or if it'll actually dip even further.\n\nThis is ESPECIALLY true if you really DCA. +5% this month? Buy. -3%? Buy. -10%? Buy. +15%? Buy. But if your rationality got muddled by fear of things like \"waiting for a dip\", \"waiting for a bear market\", \"don't know if it's low enough\", then you WILL ruin your DCA strategy completely, as you will just keep missing opportunities, buy high, chasing after FOMO, sell low, etc. \n\nJust think of it this way: today's ATH is tomorrow's (or in a decade's) all-time-low and bear time. If you don't buy it today, then you are missing THE bear market of tomorrow.\n\nHowever putting these things aside, if you are just a student then I would recommend you not spend all these 2k into the market. If you want to get a taste of how investing feels, then invest 100 per week would be a good start. And to be honest at your age, lump sum putting in all $2k could be quite stressful.
