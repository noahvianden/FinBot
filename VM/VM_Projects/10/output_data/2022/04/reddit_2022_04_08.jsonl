According to Thiel, these large institutional investors \"need to be allocating some of their money to bitcoin,\" and they are holding it back.\n\n**Pick a side**\n\nWhich side are you and your money on? On one side, Berkshire Hathaway did dismiss bitcoin as \"rat poison\" and may have missed out on incredible gains. On the other, are eternal cheerleaders like Block and Twitter founder, Jack Dorsey, who says crypto \u201cchanges everything\u201d for him and \u201cI don't think there's anything more important in my lifetime to work on, and I don't think there's anything more enabling for people around the world.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of us plebs, most only recently considered investing in cryptocurrency and cannot afford to buy into bitcoin now.\n\n**The conservative middle road?**\n\nBerkshire ended up investing in NuBank, a popular online bank for crypto investors. If crypto feels too risky, but you also don't want to just wait and see, take a page from the Buffett playbook and look at services growing around cryptocurrency.\n\nFor example, Silvergate Bank is positioning itself to be the leading blockchain bank providing crucial behind-the-scenes services to cryptocurrency investors.
