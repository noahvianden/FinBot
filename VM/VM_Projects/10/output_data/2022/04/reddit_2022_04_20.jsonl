We're still giving out the flu vaccines every year and practically everyone has gotten the flu many times in their lifetimes.\n\nIt seems more likely that we're going to need covid vaccines for many years to come.

They make more than just Covid vaccines so if vaccines aren't in huge demand in the future, they still have other revenue sources and won't crash.

{"title": "How do I best profit from the incoming implosion, which is (Transfer)Wise?", "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is no DD. I am no Financial Advisor. I just like to make money, especially on asshole companies, which rip me off.\n\nSituation: (Transfer)Wise (WISE.LSE, yes stupid dinosaur London stock market) is in for a MASSIVE dip, probably significant customer loss, too.  [WISE PLC WISE Stock | London Stock Exchange](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/WISE/wise-plc/company-page) Yes, they have been dipping like mad already. But this goes further.\n\nReason: They have ended up holding customers' money hostage - probably involuntarily. (They are still sitting on shitloads of cash from that overvalued IPO.)\n\nFlags: All our accounts (and unfortunately, our customers' whom we recommended working with Wise) have outgoing transfers blocked for 4-8 business days. Wise is citing verification processes in delay, I had once a \"ongoing technical issue\" mentioned by a frustrated support rep (You do not have ongoing technical issues as a bank.), and hotline enquiries have a waiting queue of 45+ minutes. Oh, ex Netflix CFO is now on Wise. David Wells is great, huh?\n\nCauses: This company started out in Estonia, at the border to Russia. They must have tons of transfers in and out of Russia and a lot of their operations intertwined, too, I bet. I noticed support reps with little background, probably swapped recently.\n\nConclusion: They are fucked. You don't wait 4-8 business days to have your money leave your bank accounts.\n\nIssue: They went for London Stock Exchange, idiots for valuation or maybe outsmarting everyone.

{"title": "Netflix's Poor Business Fundamentals Finally Catch Up With It", "selftext": "[Article Source](https://drcryptofinance.substack.com/p/netflix-poor-business-fundamentals)\n\nNetflix has always had bad fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, the only things it really ever had going for it were a first mover advantage and the typical fanfare/hype that follows.\n\nOn Tuesday, the stock price dropped by as much as 26% on the news that Netflix\u2019s subscriber count dropped for the first time in the company\u2019s history.\n\nThis is particularly disastrous for a company like Netflix because it\u2019s mantra has always been:\n\nmore subscribers = higher margins = more profits\n\nIn other words, the Netflix Plan\u2122\ufe0f was for them to arrive at a point, where the revenue generated by their millions of subscribers would far dwarf the production costs of creating their original films and shows because there wouldn\u2019t be any significant costs to acquiring new subscribers when they already have and produce their dozens of shows.\n\nThis isn\u2019t going to happen. Here\u2019s why.\n\nTo Grow It\u2019s Revenue, Netflix Must Now Spend So Much More = Declining Profits\n\nNetflix will only face increasing competition in the coming years. Largely because:\n\nOther streaming services will begin to cannibalise its market share\nLicensing agreements for much of Netflix\u2019s back catalogue will be terminated by the copyright holders so that the shows can be returned to their original homes whether that home is Disney, Tubi (FOX) or HBO Max.\nNetflix is left with no other choice but to spend significantly more on creating their own original shows, but how exactly does it plan to finance these rising production costs?\n\nIt can\u2019t exactly raise subscription prices because it already recently did that and a further price hike will only alienate more of its customer base.\n\nThe CEO tell us he plans to crackdown on users/households who share passwords but I doubt they\u2019ll be able to extract much value from people who aren\u2019t willing to pay for their own subscription in the first place.\n\nIn other words, Netflix is damned if it does and it\u2019s damned if it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s really not a place any business wants to be in.\n\nConclusion: Subscription Streaming Services Are A Terrible Business Model\n\nSubscription streaming services have always been a terrible business model.\n\nThe only way they work is if they function purely as a middle man and don\u2019t get involved in producing their own content \u2014 similar to how Spotify and Apple Music license music from record labels and pay the companies/artists a set amount per 1,000 streams.\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, spends billions every year creating its own original shows.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work for it because Netflix cannot provide customers with:\n\nHigh Production Value Content (similar to what is produced by Hollywood film studios and US TV networks) and\n\nLarge Volumes Of Content & High Turnaround (similar to the \u201cendless\u201d entertainment that both TikTok and YouTube provide)\u2026\n\n\u2026all while charging a subscription price that starts at $9.99/mo. You can\u2019t possibly maintain both quantity and quality at this price point.\n\nOne will undoubtedly have to suffer.\n\nIf quality suffers (as it unfortunately has in recent years), viewers will feel they\u2019re not getting good value for money.\n\nIf quantity suffers, viewers will feel they\u2019re not getting enough for their buck.\n\nIn other words, (once again) Netflix is damned if it does and it\u2019s damned if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nFor reference, $9.99/mo is less than what YouTube charges for YouTube Premium ($11.99/mo), which allows viewers to watch videos both offline and ad-free from their favourite content creators as well as granting them access to some exclusive YouTube Originals.\n\nAm I Saying Netflix Is Too CHEAP?!\n\nI guess in a way, yes\u2026 because for Netflix to succeed and overcome the competition (the big Hollywood Studios and TV networks) it will need to deliver \u201cHigh Quality Content In Large Volumes.\u201d\n\nTo do that, however, it needs to start charging its subscribers much more than it currently does. Probably closer to the $40/mo mark.\n\nBut will anyone pay that?

But when, in mid-April, an exploration geologist announced on LinkedIn that he\u2019d left Rio Tinto to join Tesla, it sparked speculation. Why a geologist? Why Tesla? What kooky plans did Elon Musk have in store now?\n\nOn Apr. 8, having complained about the skyrocketing price of lithium\u2014an indispensable element in Tesla\u2019s batteries\u2014Musk suggested that his company might have to mine the metal itself. Tesla may have other plans for its new geologist, of course, but Musk isn\u2019t the only one in his industry trying to secure supplies of metals that are essential to storage batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nThe prices of many of these metals are soaring. Lithium prices have risen nearly 500% over the past year, from $17,000 per ton to almost $80,000 per ton. Cobalt is in the same price vicinity; the cost of nickel briefly exceeded $100,000 a ton in early March. The reasons for these surges are manifold: a steep boom in demand for electric vehicles; covid-related supply chain disruptions; sanctions on Russia, which produces 15% of the purest grade of nickel.\n\nElectric car companies want to get into the mining business\n\nElectric batteries are material-intensive. Lithium, for instance, is not scarce, but the average electric vehicle battery requires around 10 kg of the metal. In turn, 5.3 tons of lithium carbonate ore yield one ton of lithium. Cobalt and nickel ores, similarly, have to be clawed out of the earth and then processed heavily to achieve the requisite purity levels. The mining industry isn\u2019t ready yet to deliver supplies of these metals in the kind of vast, purified quantities that battery manufacturers need\u2014which means, as RJ Scaringe, the CEO of Rivian Automotive, told the Wall Street Journal, that \u201c90% to 95% of the supply chain does not exist.\u201d", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As a result, manufacturers of electric vehicles are trying to abbreviate the supply chains of these metals by bringing their sources closer to them. Last year, General Motors invested in a lithium extraction project in California, and BMW did the same in Argentina. Volkswagen signed a binding purchase agreement for lithium from a German mine. Tesla already owns the rights to a lithium claim deposit spread over 10,000 acres of Nevada. CATL, the Chinese battery manufacturer, bought a Canadian lithium mining company for nearly $300 million. And, in a reversal of roles, the mining giant Glencore bought a British battery maker last year.\n\nMost of these moves were made over the last year as metal prices rose, but new projects will take time to come on stream. Analysts worry that the transition to low-carbon vehicles will stall if metal prices remain high. More people will buy EVs if the cost of their batteries declines, as they did between 2014 and 2020, from $290 per kilowatt-hour to $110. Persuading people to buy EVs instead of gas-powered cars to save the planet is hard enough.

[CVNA **-9.11%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CVNA?mod=chiclets), a pandemic star that has suffered during the recovery, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly sales and said it would raise capital as the online used-car dealer struggled with disruptions in its operations and tougher economic conditions.\n\nCarvana shares fell more than 20% after-hours Wednesday following a 9% decline in regular trading. Netflix, another pandemic star, fell 35% on Wednesday. **Carvana said it plans to sell $2 billion in common and preferred stock, in part to fund the planned acquisition of ADESA U.S.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjcjcq1xeru81.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a705608589095484c1dcb2dc08996ced45bc69\n\nCarvana said it sold 105,185 cars during the first quarter, or about **7,800 fewer** than the prior quarter, though up from a year earlier. Its net loss widened to $260 million, compared with $36 million a year earlier. **Gross profit per unit\u2014one of the company\u2019s preferred earnings metrics\u2014fell to $2,833 from $3,656 a year earlier.**\n\nIn the past six months, the tailwinds that propelled the company to rapid growth have turned to headwinds. Rising interest rates, falling used-car prices, inflation-wary consumers and a declining appetite for its debt have upended Carvana\u2019s ambitious growth targets.\n\nThe retailer, which has just over $3 billion in long-term debt, said it\u2019s **no longer providing financial guidance for the year due to rising interest rates, rising fuel prices and macroeconomic uncertainty\u2014all affecting the used-car market**. It said in February that it expected retail sales of over 550,000 cars for the full year.\n\n\u201cOver the next several quarters, we expect to better align sales with expense levels through a combination of higher sales and expense efficiencies,\u201d the company said.\n\nAnalysts had cast doubt on whether the company could still meet its sales targets. Missing them could further squeeze Carvana\u2019s cash position. **The company is** [**still burning cash**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/carvana-under-pressure-as-pandemic-surge-slows-11645624087?mod=article_inline) **after about 10 years in business.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpectuezeru81.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdee586bcdd1cb3f15804ed7683af680ced4353d\n\nTempe, Ariz.-based Carvana has expanded rapidly over the past two years, roughly doubling its quarterly sales volume since the spring of 2020 as more consumers shopped online. But the company in recent months has struggled with backlogs in its logistics network and reconditioning centers, due in part to labor shortages stemming from the Covid-19 wave caused by the Omicron variant. In response, it cut purchases of vehicles from consumers and limited the availability inventory on its website.\n\nInflationary pressures put a damper on sales industrywide during the quarter, analysts said. [Rising car prices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-brand-of-sticker-shock-hits-the-car-market-11645851648?mod=article_inline), which over the past year have bolstered used-car dealer profits, have become a burden for some consumers who are also spending more on gas and other household items.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a supply situation for these guys that\u2019s hampering their growth. It\u2019s also the demand situation, and that\u2019s not something that every investor appreciates at this point,\u201d Seth Basham, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.\n\nThe Manheim index of used-car prices pulled back 3.3% in March from February, adjusted for seasonality, but was still 24.8% higher than it was a year earlier. Vehicle prices are expected to remain elevated throughout 2022, as the industry works through inventory constraints including a semiconductor shortage.\n\nPotential customers seeking to sell their cars to Carvana told The Wall Street Journal that the company had recently reneged on offers they had already accepted for their cars, in several cases lowering them by several thousand dollars while citing a glitch in their pricing algorithm. The company said it remains committed to \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d and to enhancing customer experience.\n\nCarvana typically reports later in the earnings season, but said last week it had decided to report on Wednesday to facilitate the closing of its planned $2.2 billion acquisition of used-car auction business ADESA U.S. The deal is expected to close in May, the company said.\n\nOne reason Carvana is getting hit is the way it accounts for sales of the auto loans that it packages into securities. Carvana books immediate gains, unlike competitors that book them over time. Such accounting has helped the company turbocharge its revenue when consumer credit\u2014and investor demand for securities backed by auto loans\u2014was particularly strong.\n\nBut conditions in the securitization market have recently shifted. Investors are demanding higher yields for securities backed by riskier consumer loans. They are beginning to worry that rising rates and inflation will affect borrowers\u2019 ability to make their payments.\n\nCarvana in March issued two securitizations\u2014one backed by prime auto loans, the other backed by subprime loans\u2014with a combined value of about $1.49 billion, according to Finsight, a financial data provider. In both cases, Carvana booked less profit on the deals than in the past because investors demanded higher yields compared with deals Carvana did in the fourth quarter, according to data provided by Wedbush.\n\nClayton Triick, senior portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, said his firm has grown more cautious on subprime auto securitizations in recent months, requiring higher yields and assuming higher delinquencies. Angel Oak invested in one of Carvana\u2019s securitizations during the first quarter, he said.\n\nOverall, Angel Oak has focused more on buying asset-backed securities in the secondary market, rather than directly from issuers, Mr. Triick said. That\u2019s because the auto loans that underpin those bonds are older, meaning they were issued when car prices were lower and also have an established record of repayment, he said.\n\nRising investor caution in the securitization market weighed on Carvana\u2019s revenue during the quarter. [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JPM) & Co. analyst Rajat Gupta estimated in March that the company\u2019s gain-on-sale margin from loan securitizations\u2014a metric that compares proceeds received to the total value of loans sold\u2014declined to 4.4% in the first quarter from 9.1% in the prior quarter.\n\nThe offering of stock was a surprise to investors because Carvana had said it had received financing for the ADESA deal. Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III and his father, Ernie Garcia II, said they would buy some of the newly issued stock.\n\nThe acquisition of ADESA, a used-car auction company that is an industry stalwart, was a surprise for Carvana, which has said it aims to upend auto sales. Carvana executives said in February that the deal would increase its capacity to process vehicles and expand its logistics network, in addition to adding auction capabilities.", "id": "u888b0", "created_utc": 1650493497.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|11 months ago\n**Total Comments**|161|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rax0rz/draftkings_dkng_dd_bullish_case_for_explosive/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/raxdh1/draftkings_dkng_dd_bullish_case_for_explosive/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rayjzq/draftkings_dkng_dd_bullish_case_for_explosive/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qcuuwh/dkng_donkey_kong_king_of_apes_dd_uncovered/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qcvqdn/donkey_kong_king_of_apes_dd_uncovered_potential/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qcu756/dkng_donkey_kong_king_of_apes_dd_uncovered/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u5om70/black_rifle_coffee_post_squeeze_analysis_brcc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u5wks5/black_rifle_coffee_post_squeeze_analysis_brcc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u5y67g/black_rifle_coffee_post_squeeze_analysis_brcc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rb1gbd/draftkings_dkng_dd_bullish_case_for_explosive/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhq238/btbt_dd_all_criteria_met_for_short_and_potential/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkflh9/building_a_moat_in_online_gambling_dkng/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u888b0)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u888b0)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4547857344150543}, {"body": "Miss earnings and announce dilution yet it goes up?
