Almost half of the small firms are planning increases of 4% to 9%.\n\nThe report suggests that many businesses are planning increases that are above the current rate of national inflation -- the consumer-price index rose 8.5% in March, the most since 1981. \n\nNearly nine in ten employers in the NFIB survey said they\u2019ve had to raise prices to absorb some of the costs.\n\nInflation started to show up as an issue in the survey in the summer of 2021, the NFIB said, and it\u2019s a novel challenge to entrepreneurs who started a business after the 1990s. The NFIB found that price increases are having a \u201csubstantial\u201d impact on 62% of the respondents and a \u201cmoderate\u201d impact on almost a third of them. No one said inflation had no impact on their business.\n\nSmall employers have few options at their disposal other than passing higher input costs on to customers, according to the NFIB, a trade association that defends the interests of small businesses. In the survey, the main drivers of higher expenses cited by owners were the cost of inventory, supplies and material, as well as fuel.", "id": "uc1js3", "created_utc": 1650938220.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Thats all? 40%?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I heard it was 2 out 5", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Numbers lie and lies use numbers.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05991821736097336}, {"body": "Great point.

Sure, things can go wrong with any deal, but $3.5 billion is a pretty big gap...\n\nWhy is this happening?

Point is, I think the market is selling Twitter knowing the max gains they can make there are 9% in favor of other equities that could yield even bigger gains in the near term.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else is looking at the share price for Twitter @ $50 and thinking \"man, I could easily pocket a 9%+ almost risk free gain in a few short weeks when the deal closes\", but deciding not to do this simply because there are better opportunities on your buy list...

{"title": "Microsoft Stock Rallies on Strong Earnings and Outlook", "selftext": "[https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-price-earnings-51650921904](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-price-earnings-51650921904?mod=hp_LEAD_1_B_3)\n\n[Microsoft ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/msft)is providing tech investors with some badly needed good news, reporting better-than-expected results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31.\n\nAfter some initial volatility, the stock is trading higher after hours. It\u2019s being boosted by a strong outlook for the June quarter, despite Microsoft expressing some concerns about Covid shutdowns in Chinese factories affecting hardware.\n\nFor the March quarter, Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) posted revenue of $49.4 billion, up 18% from a year ago, and well above the Wall Street consensus forecast of $47.5 billion. The company earned $2.22 a share in the quarter, beating the Wall Street consensus by three cents a share.\n\nMicrosoft noted that results were reduced by about three cents a share by unfavorable exchange rates, while the recent acquisition of Nuance Communications trimmed profits by about a penny a share. Neither of those factors was reflected in previous company guidance. Microsoft has suspended new sales in Russia, but the company previously said that sales in the country are well under 1% of total company revenue. \n\nMicrosoft said commercial bookings in the quarter were better-than-expected, up 28% from a year ago, or 35% adjusted for currency. The company\u2019s commercial cloud business, which includes Azure, Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn\u2019s commercial business and Dynamics 365, had combined revenue of $23.4 billion, up 32%.\n\nMicrosoft had solid results in all three of its business segments.\n\nRevenue in the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office and other applications, was $15.8 billion, up 17%, toward the top of the company\u2019s guidance range of $15.6 billion to $15.85 billion, and just ahead of the Wall Street consensus for $15.75 billion.\n\nFor the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes the company\u2019s Azure cloud business, revenues were $19.1 billion, up 26%, ahead of both the company\u2019s guidance range of $18.75 billion and $19 billion, and the Wall Street consensus at $18.89 billion. The company\u2019s Azure cloud computing business grew 46% in the quarter, or 49% in constant currency.\n\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, Surface and Xbox, revenue was $14.5, likewise ahead of both the company\u2019s guidance range of $14.15 billion to $14.45 billion, and the Wall Street forecast of $14.3 billion.\n\nRevenue was up 34% at LinkedIn, while search and new ad revenue ex-traffic acquisition costs was up 23%. Microsoft doesn\u2019t routinely disclose the size of its overall ad business; last quarter the company noted that on a trailing 12 months basis, the combined ad business had topped $10 billion.\n\nSurface hardware revenue was up 13%, while Xbox hardware revenue was up 14%. Windows Commercial products revenue was up 14%, while Windows OEM revenue, from sales to PCs sold at retail was up 11%. Office commercial products were up 12%, while Office consumer revenue was up 11%.\n\nOn a conference call with investors, CFO Amy Hood projected better-than-expected results for the June quarter.\n\nShe sees revenue for the company\u2019s Productivity and Business Processes segment of between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion, at the midpoint of the range ahead of the Street consensus at $16.68 billion. For Intelligent Cloud, she projects revenue of between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion, ahead of consensus at $20.9 billion.\n\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, she\u2019s projecting a range of $14.65 billion to $14.95 billion, a little below the Street consensus at $14.96 billion, reflecting current Covid-related manufacturing shutdowns in China, which affects both Surface and Xbox hardware, and software sales to PC manufacturers.\n\nOverall, the segment guidance implies a total revenue range of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion, at the midpoint about in line with Street estimates.\n\nHood said that currency headwinds would reduce revenue in the quarter by about 2 percentage points. She also noted that the June results will include a full quarter of Nuance results. Hood added that results would be reduced by about $110 million from suspending sales in Russia.\n\nMicrosoft said it repurchased $7.8 billion of its common stock in the quarter.\n\nIn volatile after hours trading, Microsoft shares were up 6%, after they fell 3.7% in Tuesday\u2019s regular session.\n\nHeading into the earnings report tonight, Microsoft shares had been down about 20% year to date.", "id": "ucp3i9", "created_utc": 1651013761.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Both previous quarters had beaten expectations with positive guidance going forward from each quarterly report and it went from 350 to 275 in 6 months lol the stock market is such an overreactive irrational mess of a system", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "Time to buy a little bit at a time.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated chances of a contraction at about 35% over the next two years. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it\u2019ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.\nIn the Deutsche economists\u2019 view, the FOMC\u2019s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won\u2019t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That\u2019s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. \nDeutsche estimated a neutral rate that\u2019s much higher than the Fed\u2019s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash", "recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Are you for real?

As with many commodity producers, TECK was pounded in March of 2020 when commodity prices collapsed at the beginning of the COVID epidemic.  It's low in March 2020 was below $7/share.

Much of its revenues stems from production of metallurgical coal, which should benefit from infrastructure projects, especially those associated with \"resiliency\" as accelerated sea level rise becomes ever more pronounced in this decade.  It also is a bitumen producer benefiting from currently high oil prices; I suspect TECK is interested in selling its bitumen operations if can receive a good price.\n\nWhat stocks do you own with buyback provisions in place and prospects for material buybacks in the future?", "id": "uca3vf", "created_utc": 1650971627.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|10 hours ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uc086w/omeros_up_5_percent_monday/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uca3vf/stock_buybacks_teck/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uca3vf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uca3vf)\n    \nHey /u/BuckeyeReason, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30322009325027466}, {"body": "$UA / $UAA Under Armour is under going a $500 million stock buyback with $300 million being accelerated.\n\nCompany sitting on 1.5B in cash reserves.

Several of my mining investments are up hundreds of percent since March of 2020, as are several of my tech, financial, biotech, and industrial investments.  I refuse to be wedded to one sector, and for reasons that I explained I have high expectation of minerals essential to decarbonization.\n\nDid you even bother to investigate Teck's quarterly financial reports released today, or to ponder its greatly increased share buyback announcement or its 11 percent stock price jump today?\n\n[https://www.teck.com/media/Q1-2022-Financial-Report-April.pdf](https://www.teck.com/media/Q1-2022-Financial-Report-April.pdf)\n\nGiven Teck's magnificent earnings and cash flow this quarter, most especially in relation to Teck's arguably ridiculously low share price, it's obvious to me that fear actually is suppressing Teck's share price, not elevating it!!!\n\nI provided a great stock tip and you missed it due to your unjustified hubris and faulty reasoning.\n\nUnlike you apparently, I've experienced several booms and busts, including in the tech sector, and I've learned to distinguish long-term value in stocks from dangerous hype.  I wish I could link a chart of the price action in Yahoo's stock before the Verizon purchase.  My memory is it soared to over $400 before collapsing to under $10.

Your efforts to pigeon hole by comparing the S&P 500 and Dow are a meaningless straw man argument.\n\nYou've said you would rather own NFLX than TECK, essentially because NFLX is a tech stock, an argument that is somewhat suspect as I don't believe streaming is very high tech.  At any rate, choosing NFLX over TECK has been a costly position during the life of this thread.\n\nAs I've explained repeatedly, your condemnation of \"holes in the ground\" when it applies to miners of minerals essential to decarbonization is faulty for reasons given.  \n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens over the coming year, but through the remainder of this year, especially through the October when the mutual fund tax loss selling season ends, NFLX will be under great selling pressure as persons capture their losses on their NFLX investments.
