{"title": "Krispy Kreme (DNUT): The Legendary Glazing and Compounding Cash Flows", "selftext": "The days are dark and full of terror, like if the Night King from Game of Thrones raised interest rates instead of raise undead armies, fears and rumors of increased inflation and interest rates have largely snuffed any green crayon drawing from your account.\n\nGather round, here is my thesis on why DNUT will make you Kreme being the beacon of green through the red days ahead.\n\n**Thesis Summary**\n\nKrispy Kreme, ticker $DNUT (commonly referred to as DeezNutz throughout this DD because even though I\u2019m getting old the ticker is still funny to me) will strongly appreciate in share price through its business model shift to more capital efficient hub and spoke model leading to increased sales at higher margins. Operating cash flows are substantial and will be the primary funding method of future growth, with that CAPEX becoming incrementally less as a % of revenue leading to both top and bottom line improving in a compounding manner. The company has strong pricing power due to the brand strength and price inelastic demand of the product allowing them to prosper through inflation. The company\u2019s leverage is decreasing and current portions of debt are easily payable through cash flows from operations while the outstanding portion is largely hedged via interest rate swaps. This thesis is evidenced by recent strong insider buying and institutional investments from firms that specialize in the industry.\n\n**Why buy now?**\n\nComing off of consecutive years of strong sales growth and conversion of franchise to owner operator model the market appears to be discounting the speed of revenue and margin expansion. Because of the high inventory turnover, and minimal working capital requirements, cash from operating activities are able to be quickly redeployed to those areas that further drive revenue growth, margin expansion. and reduce leverage at a compounding rate.\n\nAside from the impacts of changing the business model there has been a large volume of insider buying by the CEO, Director, and largest investor Jab, with JAB entering a large leveraged 3 year bet in December, indicates near term catalyst.\n\n**Major Holders/Insider Transactions**\n\n*\u201cInsiders have many reasons to sell, but only one reason to buy\u201d \u2013 Gourd-Futures69*\n\nInsider buying is a core criteria I look for, in March the CEO open market purchased a seriously krispy number of shares and is a major holder in the company.\n\n*Recent CEO Insider buying*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9l41qalu0w81.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6b5a274745ef7d4e3b536dacccd679e34589303\n\nAnother insider which is important to dive into a little is a fund called JAB holdings, the majority holder of DeezNUTz and firm that took the company private in 2016. The company invests solely in consumer brands (notably Panera Bread, Keurig Dr.Pepper, and Pret), focuses on long term value creation and compounding returns. The company has depth and breadth of experience in the sector, taking majority positions to influence the business. JAB has continued to take on additional positions around the same time frame as the CEO buying and additional made a YUGE leveraged short term bet on the upside via a 3 year total return swap with BNP Paribas. Given JAB is the majority owner and are the primary beneficiaries of DeezNUTz glazing the world with profits, what are their thoughts on the company?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtt7girmu0w81.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=472e6b1ee11ce7c04a31e250013f2a9f12b0727d\n\n\u00b7 *JAB Holdings owns 44% of all shares, has a track record of delivering value in the food industry and recently increased exposure to DNUT via leveraged investment in a Total return swap on Dec. 2 equating to 6.5m additional shares*\n\nThe last interesting investor in my opinion is Continental Grain Company, who owns around 1% of outstanding shares which isn\u2019t much relative to others but only has 10 positions in other food related businesses, of which almost all except DNUT and a few others where reduced or sold out of. I didn\u2019t dig into this company much but given the name and the key raw ingredient for DeezNUTz being flour I think its fair to say they have a vested interest and ability to secure solid commodities pricing.\n\n**Business Model Shift: Where the Glaze Hits the Bank**\n\nThe above section shows that people close to the business and far more knowledgeable about the sector than any of us are highly confident in Krispy Kreme\u2019s ability and opportunity to glaze their pocketbooks with cash in the short and long term, next I will explain how they plan to get this \u2018*Dough Nut\u2019*.\n\nDNUT is transitioning from a primarily franchise to company controlled stores by acquiring franchise locations. Why? Control over store operations and consistency, higher revenue from store sales vs royalties (example: net revenues from product sales increased $264m YOY vs a decrease of $6m in royalties over the same period from acquisitions), economies of scale for supplies and labor, capital efficiency via **Hub and Spoke Model**.\n\nThe business model shift is relatively simple but the levers being pulled have powerful effects on the top and bottom lines as well as substantial cash generation. Investing in owned stores (\u201cHubs\u201d \u2013 the place that makes and covers your nuts of dough in fresh hot glaze) and expanding access points (\u201cSpokes\u201d \u2013 branded access points fed by the daddy hubs to sell you more doughynuts in nearby existing stores) cause overall sales to increase while expenses decrease as a % of revenue since a large portion of expenses are fixed to the costs of the store/labor which doesn\u2019t increase if each store ran at higher DoughNuttery capacity. If my words don\u2019t suffice, below are some colorful screenshots from their various investor presentations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqczsroou0w81.png?width=1525&format=png&auto=webp&s=f38c9879c130aa280e1a69df09dcd9d7c954512a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i70udtmpu0w81.png?width=1501&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe30b9298a8cb6992d43d3bb5acbf64c3936dc84\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txw077nqu0w81.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=70b4cb7fa509f78870d746a1136c146d1dca6c80\n\n**Hub and Spoke Strategy Execution**\n\n\u00b7 Buying out franchise locations to control quality and leverage storefronts to provide more product to additional access points with minimal increase in fixed costs\n\n\u00b7 Increase access points via installations in existing retail outlets with doughnuts delivered fresh from stores (Hub) \u2013 increases capital efficiency, margins, and sales\n\n\u00b7 +2000 DFD Doors added in 2021, largest source of organic growth and margin improvement (sales per hub up to $4m vs $3.5m PY)\n\n**Operating Cash Flows and Working Capital Improvements (Where the Real Magic Happens** *\\*NSFW \u2013 Kremey Money Shot Below\\****)**\n\nThis next piece is what I think is Kreme-da-la-Kreme of why this company has massive and rapid glazing potential and why the big swinging dong of the food investing world, JAB, is so jacked on this company.\n\n*\u201cThat\u2019s the power of compounding baby\u201d \u2013 The Pinesol Lady*\n\nDNUT produces substantial cash from operations, and through their efforts in improving working capital through their \u201cSupply Chain Financing Programs\u201d they essentially receive cash from sales first before their payments are due to their suppliers, so they get cash upfront with their margins before paying their costs of goods. With their turnover ratio being in the low double digits this gives them recurring cashflows to invest in the business, repay debt, or pay dividends (recently initiated a small dividend directly after JAB entered the Total Return Swap \u2013 big dong slap to BNP). This sounds basic and simple but the power behind this in combination with their growth strategy is that each sale incrementally allows DNUT to grow their ability to sell more while increasing the margins on each sale. What I mean is since their sales generate immediate usable cash they can acquire more franchises and install more access points which in turn grow top line sales which generate more cash and as the sales are growing their margins get better (via capital efficient hub and spoke, economies of scale). This effect is compounding and extremely powerful. Below is an excerpt from the most recent 10-k\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yp7617xru0w81.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=28774437d7ca48d416627c5f72db6d425b2c8d2b\n\nThis year DeezNUTz capex is expected to be $115m-$120m, delivering on sales growth would allow DNUT to entirely fund expansion through cash from operations and paydown of debt. As their growth continues to materialize the capex as a % of revenue will become smaller and smaller, upon completion the business will be a **Free Cash Flow Printing Press,** literally conjuring up cash by glazing every consenting American face and the faces of those lucky enough to be in select international segments graced by the Kreminess of Krispy in an incredibly capital efficient manner.\n\n**Capital Structure and Recent Performance (*****More Pictures explaining visually what to expect from their Nut*****)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0egg43tu0w81.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b6c61a17a71c8258a9d6118951a4e36e215a91\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryee6o8uu0w81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=8db595129869a7b20b59d24c1bcc5fb6d403ca9f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pnc65svu0w81.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b99a90ee7d6a58f0b5eb57a60813beb67f31623\n\n**The Big Bad Bi-Curious Bears: Inflation and Interest Rates**\n\nDon\u2019t even trip dog, DeezNUTz can glaze these too. The company is highly leveraged which high interest rates would impact and are not immune to inflation of key ingredients like flour and labor. However they do have a few nifty tricks tucked into their waistband like you in middle school trying to hide your hard on\n\n\u00b7 Their Debt: A significant portion of their debt is hedged with interest rate swaps and their cash generation is more than enough to cover current and future current debt payments\n\n\u00b7 Inflation: While they do hedge some items like raw ingredients through futures contracts a big facet of their resilience is from price inelastic demand, their customers aren\u2019t buying doughnuts every day but rather when their mood strikes after seeing that hot and ready sign and subsequently decide to indulge in a hot glazed nut, if DNUT raises prices by 50% that\u2019s less than a dollar a nut and the dirty dog that is already in the mood will hardly flinch. Their pricing power can more than offset inflation increases in COGS\n\n**Short Positions**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9xn2dwwu0w81.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1d5ebcc4d5af8140d5f5bf75e462560ea3c2b99\n\nThere has been a large increasing in short sale of the stock, now being on the hard to borrow list with high borrow fees. I believe DNUT has been unfairly grouped into a basket of companies with high leverage given interest rate fears and impact on cost of debt.\n\nWhat is missed here is the company\u2019s ability to quickly repay debt through operating cash flow and their interest rate hedging activity protects them from interest rate hikes. As debt is repaid and effects of the business model show through shorts will cover since being short will no longer be justified.\n\n**Near Term Catalysts and Drivers**\n\n\u00b7 Strong earnings beat for margin, sales growth, increased access points, and/or reduced leverage\n\n\u00b7 Another increase in FY guidance\n\n\u00b7 Shorts closing positions\n\n\u00b7 Well over half of all shares outstanding are owned by 1 long term investor and insiders \u2013 they likely won\u2019t sell\n\n\u00b7 Analyst Upgrades following earnings\n\n**On to the Degeneracy**\n\nWhile I am a strong proponent of the long term prospects of the company and currently hold shares and ITM leaps there is some interesting action on the post-earnings options. Both Call and Put Open interest for the $20 strike is over 30,000 with strong OI on the 15 and 17.5 strike calls. Do what you will with this information\u2026I for one bought some lotto tickets on the 17.5 strike but overall am balanced out on shares/leaps\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vakwyouxu0w81.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6af51bcf37cdcbd0bf94498ae0e91c263e5\n\nI honestly believe in the underlying fundamentals and model of the company leading to long term value but I also really hope this becomes Meme because the jokes write themselves.\n\n*This is not financial advice and happy nutting!*\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\n*Gourd-Futures69*\n\nEDIT: Current Position\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0hiwihk43w81.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=9956ccf1fe17787ba0bdd308a95f3057c0549657", "id": "ucxose", "created_utc": 1651043340.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|85|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ucxose)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ucxose)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1200001984834671}, {"body": "$DEEZNUTS", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3895585238933563}, {"body": "u/Gourd-Futures69 please share screenshot of position in Dnut.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Added at the bottom", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34172293543815613}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3112066388130188}, {"body": "great analysis but i have a local donut shop that has real yummy custard filled donuts that put krispy kreme to shame. loadin up on puts with a strike price of $1", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6194422245025635}, {"body": "Krispy Kreme donuts are overrated and for that reason I'm out.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5287228226661682}, {"body": "i bought a box of crisp creme at shoprite the other day\n\nit was fucking terrible\n\ni still finished the box though", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23035460710525513}, {"body": "They entered my market in Chicago and failed after several years.\n\nMaybe Chris Christie Cream can help them?

But one issue I have with both financial managers and intellectuals alike is that they're too cold. There's a human side to economics that I think they are abstractly aware of, but since most of them are kind of living in a bubble, they never totally grasp.\n\nI think we are seeing the issues that an extremely tight labor market has. Rampant shortages, unreliable systems, very quickly rising prices. But, how many people would prefer this to how life was in, say, 2018? How about 2015?\n\nI think a lot of people would take that trade. The trade of higher prices and shortages for the ability to give your boss the middle finger at any moment. For the cultural shift of \"sure, I may not have my G.E.D., but you still need to treat me with dignity\". I worked many years of retail post Great Recession and the indignity that managers treat you with, the inhumanity, was way worse than the low wage. The ruthless less with which they'll just casually give you zero hours. Their ability to change policies arbitrarily just tobtake away an iota of joy in your workday. Plus, the customers don't respect you. Im the same guy I was back then, except now people hear my current job and suddenly they want to get to know me and care what I have to say. 5 years ago they'd be the people talking down to me while I helped them shop.\n\nThe main roadblock right now, I think, for most people is housing costs. Housing costs are skyrocketing so fast that even with very quickly increasing wages, life is precarious. But, and I know reddit hates this, a LOT of the issue with housing costs is almost entirely to blame on terrible policies in a single place: California. California's housing shortage is so extreme, and their artificial inflation of property values is so out of control that migrants from Cali cause this cascading affect nationwide. \n\nIf San Francisco looked like Manhattan (which it should) instead of like Indianapolis, we'd probably see at least a 10% decrease in nationwide rents. But the worst of it all is that its completely policy driven. These areas talk about homelessness, gentrification, and racism out of one side of their mouth and then put lobby to prevent any non millionaire from being able to afford shelter out of the other.\n\nThats a hot take.

And we don't have enough construction because certain locales (namely, the bay, LA, and a few others) have an *enormous* amount of red tape preventing construction.

You literally are foolish not to. The tax code literally wants you to buy properties to shelter your wages. And then it allows you to take as many loans as you want and never realize taxable gain on the appreciation as long as you never sell. \n\nIt literally (the tax code) is designed to support the housing market. And it\u2019s intentional and it makes sense why the government would want to incentivize home ownership as a wealth creator. But it\u2019s reached the point where the wealth is just buying and holding all the property and the regular American can\u2019t get in on the \u201cwealth creation\u201d because they are the teet being sucked dry for that wealth creation.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Again, that doesn't add up.

So they are forced to find a rental. \n\nHigh rental prices obviously attracts more demand to buy properties. \n\nHigh rental demand, record inflation, and currently low-ish interest rates and especially in the last few years low rates, led to a lot of investment dollars to buying properties. People are renting those properties and have been. They are ready to buy places of their own but are stuck because supply does not exist. \n\nIt\u2019s a feedback loop going the opposite direction of the way you see it. It\u2019s not high rent demand leading the way. It\u2019s high demand for housing to buy leading a shortage in properties and leading to forcing people into renting.\n\nThe reason rents can go up indefinitely while housing prices won\u2019t is because housing prices are rate sensitive. At higher rates, prices fall because financing purchasing power is affected by the rates. At 8% you can\u2019t afford a 500k mortgage. At 3% maybe you can. Etc. \n\nSo as rates go up, you Should see housing prices stall and rent prices may continue to soar because demand is unchanged overall. But as rates go up buyers simply can\u2019t afford to finance the higher purchase prices. However a landlord can still justify it.

{"title": "Navigating The FED MEETING Next Week", "selftext": "**TL;DR - READ BULLET POINTS AND FUNNY NUMBERS**\n\nIf you are a trader - this is probably the most important calendar you should be keeping track right now: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)\n\nIf you have been living under a fucking rock, the FOMC Meetings are basically when the Fed meets and makes major monetary policy decisions. Namely, what the hell to do with interest rates. All eyes have been on these decisions ever since the Fed became far more hawkish late last year (although people are always watching the Fed...) in an \"effort to fight inflation\".\n\nSince then, pretty much every other god damn day we have seen Brainard or BullTARD or Meister or whoever the fuck releasing little statements like: \"MEISTER SEES 25BPS HIKE AS APPROPRIATE\" or \"BULLTARD SEES TEN 50BPS HIKES AS A GOOD IDEA\" or more recently \"FED SEES FIFTEEN 75BPS HIKE NECESSARY\" basically just increasing as time continues (and inflation).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/emcphqsf64w81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29285fc7ff66f2eeb7fb13392d21fdcd64b6530\n\nThe market has slowly attempted to price in many of these statements (as seen by the fact that we haven't made all time highs in about 4 months and are shitting the bed). To easily see what rates are currently being assumed just use this tool: [https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor](https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor)  If you struggle with reading numbers, this thing is saying the market has **already priced in a 50bps hike.**\n\nHowever, it isn't that simple. If the market is already pricing in what is 99% going to happen, then why is the meeting even a big deal? This is because **the FOMC Meeting isn't just about the rate decision, it's about the outlook for future decisions.** This is just like how when a company reports earnings, the guidance is often more important than the actual report (unless they wildly miss/beat expectations). That's why it isn't as simple as \"Oh, the market is pricing in a 50bps hike.\" In other words, what is said at the Meeting will have huge implications for **how the market prices in the next meeting,** which will no doubt be the source of the largest moves coming out of next week.\n\nAnyway, I could go on, but let me get to the point, the actual shit you can take from this since I know reading is your guys weakest subject - I'll even use bullet points to keep it one line at a time:\n\n* Fed Do Meeting On May 3-4th\n* Fed Talk Big About Bad Interest Rate Things For Months\n* Mr. Market Dump Ahead Of Time To Price Bad Thing In\n* Mr. Market Will Do Uppies If Decisions/Expectations Are Less Than Or Equal To What Is Priced In\n* Mr. Market Will Do Dumpies If Decisions/Expectations Are More Than What Is Priced In\n\nSo, to sum it all up, we don't really know what the fuck is or isn't currently priced in, but we can assume that if the market is shitting itself continuously going into the meeting, it's probably pricing in something *extra* bad. The fact of the matter is, the Fed can't magically fix inflation by hiking interest rates. Don't get me wrong, it will help, but it won't fix things alone. Inflation isn't just about rates. In our current situation, it's also largely about **the supply chain. Rate hikes won't fix the supply chain. The Fed knows this.** So, although they are teasing going to extremes to \"fight inflation\" it's unlikely it gets to that point, and it's more likely they are bullshitting to stave off the pitchforks and torches.\n\nLastly - let's talk about how to play this. I'll be waiting until later in the week to make a decision on this, or even early next week, since I really would like to see where the market is just beforehand. There's a couple ways to go:\n\n1. If Mr. Market Is Down Bad Still - VIX Puts (ITM, July/Later) or Call Credits\n2. If Mr. Market Bounces Hard Before Hand - Stay The Fuck Away\n\nEdit: I say VIX Puts because people like to hedge a shit ton going into FOMC and VIX is running super high. If we bounce, that shit will crash hard and fast. These will profit even if the market is flat, so long as putholders give up. It's basically the highest probability way to play a \"less than or equal to\" result.\n\nthanks for coming to my ted talk", "id": "udarlm", "created_utc": 1651085316.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|53|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|567|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=udarlm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=udarlm)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.041000090539455414}, {"body": "Bring on 75 basis points or 100 and crash it already.

Mix that with questionable earnings among the biggest tech companies and approaching May with a critical fomc meeting half way through May, that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nI honestly believe we see 400 before fomc as the sell-off continues into May.\n\nRight now, the market has already priced in a rate hike greater than .5 so as long as .5 is what we get, I'm expecting an out of the ordinary mid may rally, even bigger if the rate hike is only .25 but I see that as very unlikely unless they take the current market sentiment into strong consideration. And on the unlikely chance we get a .75 rate hike, I think the sell-off will continue \n\nI follow you by comment and have used some of your support and resistance levels to make some extra cash, and generally I agree with you, but I think we differ a little here. \n\nAlso, if Apple and Amazon both produce good earnings tomorrow, I think the rally will extend through Friday and proceed to sell off again Monday or Tuesday because I believe tesla will continue to sell off and the broader market will do so as well with May being just days away.\n\nAgain, this is just my POV, not financial advice in anyway.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "PUT YOUR HANDS UP eyecasper!!!

The price rocketed yes, but the report was not stellar. Also the daily user number is absolutely cooked. The price likely jumped because people were on edge and expected worse. This market wants to rally and say bottom found at any indication. So the dip was bought.\nTomorrow we will see where we really stand. I expect the market to try to rally and meet some resistance and selling on highs in preparation and anticipation of Amazon and Apple earnings. If Amazon or Apple or both miss, that's when things get bad. If the both meet expectations or beat, we rally until fed talks.  \nTLDR market rally will be muffled until after tomorrow night earnings.
