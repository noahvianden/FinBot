{"title": "$T AT&T LEAP Option", "selftext": "$T AT&T Leap Option\n\nYesterday I bought a LEAP Option when the price of $T was trading at around $19.80. I bought the LEAP Option Expiring 1/19/2024 (A little less than 2 years from now) through Robinhood for $478. My break-even price is $19.85 and the stock is currently trading at $19.40. The implied volatility is also relatively low at 10.97%\n\nI bought the LEAP because of two main factors.\n\nAT&T just sold off most of their Warner Media division and merged it with Discovery Stock. As of April 5th AT&T received $40.4 billion in cash while retaining about $15 billion of Discovery Debt.\n\nThis devestiture including cutting back their dividend (even though it is still at a massive 5.67% allows it to pay down a lot of their debt and put their money to better investments.\n\nNeil Macker, an analyist over at Morning Star says the following about what this means for AT&T post devestiture:\n\n>As for AT&T, we believe the firm is in a much stronger place, with renewed management focus and a stronger financial position. We remain optimistic about the wireless business and expect that AT&T and its rivals will compete rationally, allowing for steady, albeit slow, growth and solid cash flow. We also like the firm\u2019s investment plans, which call for aggressive investment in wireless network capacity and the fiber network over the next several years. We expect AT&T will emerge from this period of investment in a unique place within the telecom industry, with the ability to use its combined wireless and fixed-line capabilities to grab market share across a large and growing portion of the U.S.\n\nI believe that AT&T like Verizon are good inflation hedges as they provide services that are relatively inelastic, namely, cell phone service, as well as the internet.\n\nMorning Star gives $T a fair market value of $25 while Value Line gives it a 3-5 year range of anywhere from $45-60.\n\nA few other LEAPS Options I am eying are BTI and HPQ which is currently trading for $43 and $37.90 respectively. They both have relatively low IV and I believe are both undervalued.", "id": "u2ytg9", "created_utc": 1649879701.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.38, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I used to have huge T bags.. but man, when you drop 50 billion in debt and still have 50 billion more debt than your entire market cap (with EPS dropping), huge yikes to me.\n\nEdit: T has a market cap of ~135 billion, and a debt of ~180 billion.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4263887405395508}, {"body": "AT&T does not own any WBD stock.

Going straight up long volatility is an expensive, negative-EV play. It sucks, I know.\n\nSeveral routes you can take:    \n- Buy OTM calls on VIX futures. Two unattractive choices: 1.) do this all the time (mildly -EV play but you're doing a lot of it), or 2.) wait until VIX pushes above a threshold and only do it then (*highly* -EV play but ~80% of trades you won't need to do it at all).    \n- [Call backspread](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/call-backspread/) on VIX futures. Can be established for 0 cost or small net credit. Sell 1 ATM call and buy 2 OTM calls. This combined with #2 above (waiting for some VIX rise) isn't a terrible idea.    \n- Buy \"units\": this is what we call very far OTM puts on your stocks that will protect you in a crash scenario when IV spikes. Very unlikely to ever go ITM but can go 5x-10x in a crash. Probably very negative EV.    \n- Buy SPY units. See above.    \n- Come up with a long volatility system. +EV would be good but probably impossible, so shoot for breakeven. Can you go long straddles before earnings and ride the rising IV? (Sell before announcement). This would hedge your thetagang positions.    \n- There's a stock market saying, \"all correlations go to 1 in a crash.\"  Expand into something like commodities where correlations aren't so high. Gold and soybeans are unlikely to screw you on the same day.    \n- Delta-hedge your stock to 0 or even slightly negative delta.

{"title": "Morgan Stanley Turns Cautious on Tech Hardware Stocks", "selftext": "Citing concerns about a potential slowdown in corporate IT spending, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall has turned wary on telecom and networking stocks.

Her target price for F5 is now $250, down from $280 but still well above its Monday closing level of $207.49. Marshall no longer designates the company a \u201ctop pick.\u201d\n\nFor NetApp, her new target is $91, down from $102, while the stock ended Monday at $77.12. She also reiterated her Underweight rating on Juniper Networks (JNPR).\n\nHP Enterprise declined to comment. F5 and NetApp didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMarshall says that supply-chain problems\u2014and the higher prices that come as a result\u2014could buoy earnings for the IT hardware companies in the short run. But she sees softening orders in the 2022 second half as a result of inflation, Covid-19, and geopolitical uncertainty. The analyst said she is starting to see \u201csigns of weakness accumulate,\u201d citing cautious results from a new survey of chief information officers about their hardware spending plans. She adds that in recent channel checks, resellers cited multiple reasons for caution about spending, including the Russian war on Ukraine, inflation and strong IT spending over the past year.\n\nIt may prove difficult for some vendors to have their customers fully absorb higher costs for components and logistics, she said. On HP Enterprise in particular, she noted that while the stock\u2019s valuation isn\u2019t demanding\u2014it trades for less than 8 times forward earnings\u2014she is wary about the company\u2019s high exposure to storage and servers in a tightening environment for IT spending.

This was about a month or two after the fallout with Neumann became public, and, since I had been following the company closely for a few years, I was pretty excited to talk with them. \n\nAt first, when asked about their experience working at the company, the guest seemed pretty standoffish and gave an answer that was...guarded at best. Very boilerplate and rehearsed. I figured they probably got asked about the job all the time, so I let it go and had fun talking about other things. But, after a few bottles of wine, the guest began to open up to me and started volunteering more info about their time there.\n\nI was honestly shocked by what I was told. This person, who was a *C-Level Exec* at the company, was being treated horribly and that seemed to be the norm. A lot of what I was told was and still is sensitive info, so I won't go into much detail, but I got the sense that the company had a cult-like work culture that demanded insane hours to meet weird arbitrary goals. \n\nThe stories about Neumann and his wife were, if anything, underreported by the media. Neumann was described as weird and creepy towards women (he would surround himself with young women and then fire them randomly), and the guest implied that Neumann was mostly just making stuff up all the time - company goals, personal accomplishments, you name it - to the point where they believed he was a pathological liar. I got the sense there was little strategic direction, purely because Adam was constantly pulling his executive team in new, unexpected directions.\n\nAs it was told to me, the company was drowning in an effort to keep pace with the rising valuations. They only had a handful of successful workplace models that took countless hours of work by a dedicated design team, with most decisions needing to be approved by creative leads and eventually Neumann or his wife. For every successful workspace, there were multiple failed projects with sunken costs - but leadership was already discussing scaling the practice to unreasonable levels. *Success* was a term used liberally, as even successful projects failed to be profitable because execs were willing to blindly throw money at a project if it also meant making Adam happy - or more commonly, avoiding his involvement altogether. \n\nBurnout was intense. They were expected to follow a long day of work by going to weird corporate raves, cult-like yogi retreats or really intense feedback sessions with random groups of people. The guest explained that the company felt like it was set up in a way as to slowly take over your life, all under the guise of the \"new workplace\" being a place where work and life converge, to the point of being inseparable (rewatch any interview with Adam and you'll see the connection).\n\nThere's more, but this is already long. Basically I wouldn't touch this company with a 10-foot pole. They never had a profitable model or concrete proof of concept, leadership was a revolving door, the culture has been tainted by this weird misunderstanding of workplace living and now there are legitimate concerns about the need for corporate real estate anyways.

{"title": "Is the U.S. stock and bond valuation bubble comparable to a bull market? The sell-off may be far from over", "selftext": "Since April, stocks and bonds in the U.S. market have experienced a rare coordinated decline, and this situation of double-killing stocks and bonds is still fermenting. The economic cycle is moving forward for stock and bond investors amid the hawks of the Fed, and valuations may finally come into play again.\n\nThe S&P 500 has fallen in five of the past six sessions, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen for seven straight days.\n\nWhile rate hikes are on the market's radar, an equally big issue for bulls is valuation, with years of price appreciation leaving stocks and bonds at very high levels relative to cash.\n\nFirst, the sum of asset returns is lower than the inflation rate for the first time in 60 years\n\nJones strading proposes a new way to measure the valuation bubble in stocks and bonds in a report that adds the yield on the S&P 500 and the rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to arrive at the total yield -- which is called the total yield. Called the \"reverse Fed model\". Overall, even with higher bond rates, the current total yield is 7.2%, which is lower than 93% of the time since 1962.\n\nTo make matters worse, asset returns themselves are shrinking due to inflation. With the U.S. CPI rising by 8.5% in March, the return on these assets was even lower than the inflation rate for the first time in 60 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0oypoc5hat81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56bf21a2a712b28a468038717e57221d514aca8e\n\n\"Historically, investors have worked harder to reprice stocks and bonds to ensure that taking extra risk pays off,\" Michael O'rourke, chief market strategist at Jones strading, said in an interview. \"The market believes the Fed will back down at the first signs of weakness in asset prices.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 is currently yielding 4.4%, one of the lowest in decades. It is worth noting that the yield is just the opposite of the price-earnings ratio, and the higher the yield, the cheaper the stock price. Also, while interest rates on 10-year Treasuries hit a three-year high of 2.78% on Monday, they are currently less than half their historical levels.\n\nSecond, the stock and bond valuation bubble is comparable to a bull market\n\nIn the \"Inverse Fed Model,\" Jones strading's O'rourke uses a framework based on a July 1997 central bank report that compares the relative values \u200b\u200bof stocks and bonds to determine which is more attractive assets.\n\nTo O'rourke, both assets appear to be priced in a bubble, inflated by years of easy monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. To prove his point, he summarizes the yields on U.S. Treasuries and stocks to show how little investors are getting today compared to history.\n\nEd Yardeni, CEO of Yardeni Research Inc., said the approach is a clever way to present cross-asset valuations. Yardeni said: \"I think this model is a neat interpretation of the valuation of stocks and bonds in the capital markets. It is a useful addition to the ensemble of valuation models.\"\n\nOf course, inflation isn't a clear negative for stock investors. U.S. companies have been posting record profits, led by rising stock prices, and if the trend persists, profits could grow to exorbitant multiples. The problem with bubble valuations can be resolved over time.\n\nHowever, the market may not have the patience to wait. Financial conditions have eased since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March as stocks rebounded. In O'rourke's view, this is a signal that central bankers need to get tough. \"As soon as the market believes the Fed won't budge, assets will likely return to undervalued valuations. The Fed needs to recognize that reality,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nAlso, stocks are currently expensive by other metrics. According to data compiled by Strategas Securities, about 17% of Russell 3000 stocks trade at more than 10 times earnings, a ratio even higher than in the dot-com bubble era.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp3r2ugfhat81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3b5cdbd12b132e162f1a4e26bf243426a66f9dc\n\nRyan Grabinski, strategist at Strategas, said: \"While it is true that many high-value stocks have fallen sharply, they may have more downside. When the cost of capital is no longer free, how much investors are willing to pay for these speculative stocks. What about money? Not to mention that many of these companies are zero-profit and often need additional capital to support their operations.\u201d\n\nThird, many well-known investors also \"call out\" that the valuation of US stocks is too high\n\nMany well-known investors have also issued warnings that U.S. stocks are currently overvalued and the sell-off may not be over yet.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Mike Wilson said yesterday that the Fed could hit economic growth and stock market valuations appear overvalued. \"The S&P 500 continues to trade at valuations that we have struggled to justify, even though the index is down around 6% this year.\"\n\nIn addition, \"big bear\" Michael Burry also warned that U.S. stocks are significantly overvalued and prices could plummet.\n\n\"It's pretty much a multiplex question,\" Bury tweeted, including a chart that tracks price-to-earnings ratios for the S&P 500 equal-weight index. The chart shows that in the 1990s and most of the 2000s, the ratio was below 1.0, but it has nearly doubled in the past 10 years and is now above 1.9.\n\nPresumably, Burry wants to show that the index is trading at nearly twice its constituents' earnings, suggesting that the valuation multiples of these larger U.S. public companies have reached unsustainable heights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opdcbhurhat81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e42400f8928ca4bd83a98b90bd06f70edb86993", "id": "u2p5iw", "created_utc": 1649852762.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|6 days ago\n**Total Comments**|6|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u2p5iw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u2p5iw)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12537086009979248}, {"body": "Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. \"$30 is $30\", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard.

Investors also considered the start of the earnings season in light of geopolitical risks.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended a three-day decline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed. Another drop in treasury two-year yields, which are more sensitive to upcoming monetary-policy decisions, brought this week's drop to around 15 basis points.\n\nOil was trading for more than $100 per barrel.\n\nTraders also kept an eye on the latest geopolitical developments, such as Biden's announcement that the United States will expand the size and scope of weapons provided to Ukraine in a new $800 million military aid package. This includes heavy artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers, indicating a more serious commitment than the country has already made, as well as artillery rounds and additional helicopters\n\n# SPY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfghuj4ckdt81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5b456b69e0f941ca82239933cc83b5a3ed7a093\n\n[15 min.](https://preview.redd.it/29vzeyfdkdt81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=9508af60d6d0101393548995254ac3d836914d2b)\n\n## Wedge - Bullish Bias\n\n* Bullish \ud83c\udfaf: 445.88 - 450.27 ( needs to break 442.42)\n* Lose 433.79 and the pattern is null\n* Still playing out but near resistance IMO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofds7n6ikdt81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=234019f7521b36f4f86bb8675fbe1457eed403f0\n\n# TSLA\n\n\ud83d\udc02 nearly hit the half measure!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7p3jvgqpkdt81.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=39f20f22fa2687071139687ae40cabb69e522d1f\n\n# Economic Calendar - April 14, 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qf7kmbjxkdt81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f01be8ee4dd2b0fcd02e1a89c5d2e15f6f583b\n\n>**Don\u2019t forget the market is closed on Friday!**\n\n# SPY - April 14 - Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wes983n1ldt81.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=9354d4d60973b96c4f708ee4886386c370d3a7dc\n\n* Break 444.58 - 445.87 and look for 447.58\n* Break 447.58 and look for 449.14 - 450.62\n* Break 450.62 and look for 452.68\n* Lose 442.58 - 441.71 and look for 440.12\n* Break 440.12 and look for 437.73 - 436.63 - 435.53\n* Break 435.53 and look for 433.86\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thfy0ye3ldt81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=20a606fb406f28afaf8c0e6575722c742f3418a9\n\n# Rectangle Breakout - Exp. 4/18 EOD\n\n* Break 444.22 - 445.00 - 445.81 and look for \ud83d\udc02 \ud83d\udccf \ud83c\udfaf : 449.21 - 453.32\n* Lose 442.57 and look for 441.00\n* Lose 441.00 and look for 438.60 - 437.06\n* \ud83d\udc3b \ud83d\udccf \ud83c\udfaf : 432.88 - 428.78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qttaq58ldt81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=7498d63b16f449eccae48e561dbe5377699ea69f\n\n* Neutral 440-449.
