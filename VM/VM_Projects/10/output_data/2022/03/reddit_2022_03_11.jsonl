{"title": "Do you think a short term investment in Micron may be worth the risk?", "selftext": "Against my better judgement I bought some Micron shares today. Do you think it's justifyable or a stupid gamble?\n\nMy reasoning for doing this is I hope they will report a positive earnings surprise on the 29th of March caused by buyers hoarding inventory due to uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine and higher than expected DRAM and NAND prices. EPS should rise to around 7.50 which would push the PE ratio below 10 (at its current share price).\n\nPotential catalyst: improvements in Ukraine, unrest in South Korea, escalations between North and South Korea, problems at Samsungs new EUV fab for ddr5 planned to open 2H 2022, COVID outbreak affecting competitors, cloud gaming news, AMD announcing new CPUs, rebound of tech stocks. The main risk I'm afraid of is Russia targetting US semis with sanctions and ristricting their access to inert gasses giving Samsung.\n\nAt this point I think it's a pretty risky short term strategy. I'll probably cut my losses at around $60. But Micron is becoming less cyclical and I think it's well managed, so if the price drops further I might triple or quadruple my stake in steps and make it part of my portfolio with a long term horizon.

But with that being said most nuke plants buy uranium in bulk and they have came out and said that there is no shortage in the US for a while to begin with.

Good for some but a lot of ppl will get burned and its getting kinda old in my opinion as its getting more common here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few other things to note.. Kazakhstan supplies 42% of the worlds Uranium and have been going through serious protest after the gov pulled the cap off of a special type of gas there resulting in massive protest and over 2500 ppl killed, tortured, or missing in January... however they did \"calm it down\" and re instated the cap on the gas for 6 month but the country is in complete media black out also Russia stepped in and helped stop the violent protests. Kazakhstan is a NATO country so there is also that but is very strategic for both China and Russia as well as the West so i personally dont see any supply interruption from sanctions as all the attention is on Ukraine from the world and most dont know wtf a Kazakhstan is or even where its located. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other news Iran is sitting on a massive stock pile of Uranium in violation of the JCOA agreement but US does not allow them to export so with the announcement today that the Iran peace talks today are falling apart i have no idea if this will be of any help just like the oil supply dilemma that our senior citizen elect is trying to un fuck atm...\n\n [Increase in uranium stockpile due to US ban on exports \u2013 SightLine | U308 (sightlineu3o8.com)](https://sightlineu3o8.com/2019/07/increase-in-uranium-stockpile-due-to-us-ban-on-exports/) \n\nTLDR: I have no idea if Biden will sanction the largest Russia company that refines and sells over 20% of the uranium that we consume and doesn't seem very likely as we are already hurting pretty badly and no one in congress is pushing for a ban on Russian Uranium and Kazakhstan to a pretty firm stance and seem like they have the situation under control so at the moment i dont foresee any major interruptions in the near future but that could easily change if the fighting gets worse or if chemical weapons are used with that being said the price of Uranium will continue to climb with the overall commodities market as we are going through inflation but i firmly believe it will come in waves and will have periods of cooling and is really a long term investment rather then a short squeeze. \n\nI hope this helps some i spent all day digging into this and didnt really find anything that really jumped out at me as a pressing issue with supply currently, however the wild card here is Russia and we dont know what Putin will ban the export of in the future so far grain and sugar was on the list but not the main exports as they are hurting for cash.", "id": "tby5gr", "created_utc": 1647027257.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|377|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tby5gr)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tby5gr)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1462254822254181}, {"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
