{"title": "Effortpost: Concerns about Tesla and Elon's security amidst the situation in Ukraine", "selftext": "Hey people, I had a few semi-rambling thoughts on this and wanted to write everything down, and even propose something for my fellow Tesla stockholders to promote a solution. I, like many of you all, spend a lot of time thinking about Tesla the company and am extremely excited for the future of so many of its projects, so I figured I would at least post it here - if you agree or disagree (or think I'm blowing this way out of proportion or that they've already got it covered) I would really appreciate comments, since to be honest I'm a little bit worried, for reasons I'll now get into. This is a pretty long winded post but concretely I was thinking that if we all supported a question on [Say.com](https://Say.com) for the next conference call to make a non-binding request  to Tesla and Elon to investigate and purchase a solution for defense against drone attacks to cover its major facilities, especially those where Elon spends his time. I will explain the rationale for this below.\n\nI have been sitting here like the rest of the world watching Putin do the unthinkable, invading Ukraine. As we all know Musk has been taking a stand on Ukraine's side, and even going back and forth with Rogozin on twitter in some funny exchanges. As we've all seen the war is going terribly for Putin and, although most analysts think he will probably capture Kyiv at some point, let's just say the Russian army has had its reputation.... reassessed for its performance so far.\n\n[I think this sums things up pretty well](https://preview.redd.it/ztnqbd28ygl81.jpg?width=1594&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=432711dee58264fa2f36674bd68af775b4b80909)\n\nThe West has just hit Russia with some unprecedent sanctions so things are going extremely badly for Putin. Given how he's losing a lot of cards by the day, Europe's dependence on Putin for oil and gas is one of the only legitimate pieces of leverage he has left. And guess who is just opening a new factory that is going to replace millions of gas cars in Europe that rely on Russia fuel, and even starting to build a manufacturing system that will eventually produce unprecedented amounts of batteries from Germany that could power stationary storage that could eventually completely displace his leverage over Europe (oh yeah and Elon is tweeting about deploying them along with solar in Ukraine)\n\nI am honestly getting increasingly concerned about the risk of forces loyal to Putin attempting to attack Elon, hoping to \"decapitate\" the head of the hated SpaceX and Tesla in one fell swoop. [Today I suddenly thought back to Eric Berger's article on Rogozin constant invitations for Elon to come to Russia](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/why-is-dmitry-rogozin-so-thirsty-for-elon-musk-to-visit-russia/):\n\n>One might even read an ominous intent in Rogozin's invitation. The  \"teakettle\" comment recalls\u00a0the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a  former KGB officer who in 2000 fled to the United Kingdom after becoming  critical of Vladimir Putin's rise to power. Six years after leaving  Russia,\u00a0Litvinenko was poisoned by drinking tea laced with\u00a0polonium. He  died three weeks later, and [Western intelligence services eventually concluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko#Illness_and_poisoning) that the poisoning was conducted by Russian agents acting under the approval of Putin.\n\nPutin and his cronies may see an attack against Elon as a good opportunity to destabilize the West, and get back against what may be a hated enemy. Now, the question is, is it possible to do attack Elon given his security team?\n\nOne possibility that we've seen more and more of in recent conflicts is the possibility of a drone attack. Today, we all know the community of live streamers and youtubers that zip drones back and forth over Tesla and SpaceX factories constantly. In fact, [MKBHD made a good video talking about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OOiuaZSKc), and explaining why it serve a marketing purpose for Tesla. I agree and like I imagine the rest of you all I like watching the Giga Texas flyovers with all the Teslas in the parking lot. Now, I'm pretty Tesla security teams have some type of relationship with the drone flying community, at least insofar as recognizing certain people filming and the drones they fly around. These days though, anybody can buy a drone, and I feel like there is a risk that somebody could basically plot out Elon's route, maybe from a flight tracker or however else, and prepare a cheap, commercial drone bomb attack against him.\n\nNow, this is a very scary thought, but if you want to judge the risk of such a thing happening, multiply what you gauge the probability of such an attack happening against the impact it would have on Tesla the company if the worst came to pass:\n\n* The probability of it happening? Probably low. But how low? We have all seen Putin's security services brazenly invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine, if I ever had any doubt about Putin's willingness to use violence, bombs, killings across all modes to achieve his objectives and gain leverage, I have no more.\n* The impact? I don't even want to think about it honestly. But if we just put on our cold capitalist glasses for a second we can assign some significant amount of Tesla's capitalization to Elon's presence and contribution, and I think most people here would agree that's a very big number.\n\nThe good news is that one company, Anduril, actually has what's now apparently a commercially available system that can stop these attacks. Not only to establish a complete awareness of the environment with sentry towers and AI, to understand the difference between our Giga Texas youtuber producer and a KGB agent flying a cheap drone with a bomb attached, can actually automatically disrupt the drones communication system and even, if the operator approves it, [send out other purpose-built drones to fly over and smash them to bits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX0ji1sAXl8). Oh yeah. U.S. Special Operations Command has just recently paid them a billion for this system to \"deliver, advance, and to sustain CUxS capabilities for special operations forces wherever they operate.\" Anduril is a little different to the large military contractors in that it builds out its products before it sells them and [in somewhat Tesla style it's listed as a solution on their website](https://www.anduril.com/capability/counter-uas/). Given the risk calculation in dollar value (which is at least on the order of billions IMO) Tesla could buy this system and deploy it at its major sites where Elon spends his time for honestly a not too high price compared to the risk. In fact, although others may not agree with this, I would argue that Tesla shareholders should actually seek to employ this system at SpaceX's facilities as well, and once again, given the risk that we're talking about, I think if the SpaceX people didn't want to pay up, Tesla as the company that we have a (small but loyal) stake in should step up to the plate and provide that system to ie. Starbase Texas.\n\nI know that the system has a very low manpower requirement, to the point where I'm pretty sure it would not significantly burden the security teams at Tesla or SpaceX's different sites. I'm not saying that Tesla has to buy the anti-drone capability from this company specifically, and I have no ties to, or any investments related to Anduril, but I had just been in an internet rabbit hole researching Anduril recently and had concluded that system actually exists and it could secure these facilities from the possibility of a drone attack. I am open to hearing about any other assessments of the risk of something like this happening because I am getting a little bit worried, and there is a unique opportunity here for Tesla to implement safety from these attacks, and let's be honest that shit looks cool as fuck.\n\nElon has shown willingness to purchase other advanced technology when it can provide value (they operate a couple of Boston Dynamics robo-dogs in Boca Chica) and I know Elon has a security team that is in charge of this, and trust that that's something for him to manage, but at the same time these are completely extraordinary times and given that so much is at stake I think it's worth pushing this message up if it can make a difference. Even aside from Elon personally, there are a lot of key people across Tesla and I want them all to be safe!
