Just to recap, you want to buy one ~55-70 delta call and the equivalent delta put, making you delta neutral, long gamma and theta. The reason for this instead of the more popular ATM straddle is that theta is highest ATM and you don't want to pay it.\n\nWill you re-balance or re-delta hedge as the stock makes small moves (gamma scalp)? Or just close/roll when one of the positions becomes OTM?\n\nThe gist of this whole thing, as with all long-gamma systems, is that you'll make money if realized vol is above implied, and lose money otherwise. It's just a dampened / lower-risk ATM straddle with fewer medium wins but bigger rare wins.\n\nSometimes it helps to think about extremes. What if you bought a 99-delta call and a 99-delta put with virtually 0 extrinsic value? Well, you'd be delta-neutral and VERY VERY small long gamma and theta. And you would almost always just lose that small theta, minus slippage, but very rarely you would have an enormous win (stock goes from $100 to $1,000, way above your put strike, or to $10, way below your call strike). \n\nNow start reducing that 99 number towards 50 (ATM straddle), you get a more bell-curvey, normal distribution of profits (but still positive skew of course).\n\nNow keep going the other way, until you're buying a 1-delta call and put. Distribution of profits would be similar to the 99, right? Most of the time you would just pay small theta, very rarely you would have a humongous win.\n\nSo by this logic, your long 70-delta system here would be similar to a long 30-delta strangle.\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood something; my coffee is only slowly kicking in.

I believe 1.65Million is certainly possible this year and mainly hinges on how fast Berlin and Austin can ramp. That would be about 600k from Fremont, 900k from Shanghai, and 75k each from Berlin and Austin. Y\u2019all can go back to Elon's tweets and guidance from Tesla's earnings calls if you disagree.\n\nAssuming the average selling price for a Tesla is about 55k. that means Tesla would rake in 90.75B dollars in revenue. Last year from Q4 2020 to Q4 2021 Tesla grew their operating margin from 5.4 to 14.7%. However, their operating margin growth will probably be suppressed a little this year from ramping up their two new factories so I am going to put their operating margin at 18% this year even though it will probably be higher in Q4 and lower in Q1. With 90.75B in revenue and an 18% operating margin this leaves Tesla with a profit of 16.34B. At Tesla's current market cap of 926B that leaves them with a forward PE of 56.68 if you use these projected 22 full year numbers. Down from the 182 they are at right now.\n\nLet\u2019s project what their PE ratio might be at the end of Q4 22 though. I believe Tesla has a reasonable chance at producing 500k vehicles in Q4 22 alone. Once more at an avg 55K price tag per car thats 27.5B in earnings and 5.5B in profit if you use an operating margin of 20%. If you annualize that you would get a PE ratio of 42. While that certainly still isn't a low PE ratio, when was the last time other notable companies that people love had these PE ratios? Amazon currently has a PE ratio of 49. Apple had a PE ratio of 40 during the end of 2020. Google had a PE ratio above 40 back in 2017-18. What a mistake it would have been owning those companies back then...\n\nTesla will continue to execute and will strengthen their lead in the short term. They continue to show they can raise prices and margins while still selling every vehicle they make, and before too long Tesla will be known for their manufacturing prowess. Tesla will deepen its existing moats this year and run circles around everything else. Go ahead give me the downvotes, this is practically community service at this point.\n\nPositions since y\u2019all seem to love those here: Tesla obv\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g87n5bcq6o81.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf2e805479aa5a4711d5d5604c0011d0acab8750", "id": "th5ie7", "created_utc": 1647621426.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Where\u2019s the tldr, I got distracted by the \ud83e\udd84", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I did too now my screens white.
