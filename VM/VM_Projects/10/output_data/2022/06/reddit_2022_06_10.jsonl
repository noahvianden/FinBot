{"title": "Protective Put: Long Position Insurance", "selftext": "Inexperienced put seller here trying to learn more about using them to insure my long positions. How often/and in what scenarios do you use protective puts to protect long positions? With how crazy the market has been, it makes sense to use them during upcoming economic catalyst weeks when inflation data and FED interest hikes are released. Alot of feedback has been to use them short term 30-45 days out, but what I would like to know is how close the strike should be to the current SP or to your cost-basis that makes sense meeting both getting strong protection and cost-effective overall. I am typically just selling calls but because I don\u2019t sell puts often, what are the best ways to set up married puts.", "id": "v8zu4x", "created_utc": 1654836770.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\rLong puts bought to protect appreciated stock is like car, home, health insurance. It's a total waste of money until you need it.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want to lock in that stock gain but you don't want to sell your stock, then buy the puts. The cost is the premium and the loss from current stock price down to the strike price of the put is like the deductible. As with insurance, if you want a lower deductible, you buy a higher strike price which means a higher premium cost.\r  \n\r  \nAs for efficiency, that's not an easy answer. Premium decay is non linear so the premium paid per day is higher for near term options than long term. So you want to buy further out in time. However, if the stock moves up, the stock gets further away from the put\u2019s strike price and the amount of protection diminishes (the put does not protect the appreciated amount). So buying too far out in time can also be counter productive.\r  \n\r  \nThen there\u2019s the cost. Buying ATM index puts will cost you about 6\u20138% per year. That\u2019s a lot of drag on your portfolio and which will have to appreciate that much in order to break even.\r  \n\r  \nA more efficient way to protect the stock is to collar it but that involves a willingness to sell the stock at a higher price. In a collar, for every 100 shares that you own, you sell an OTM call and use the proceeds to buy an OTM put. This defines a floor beneath which you cannot lose as well as a ceiling, beyond which you do not profit (unless you can roll the calls up and/or out later).\r  \n\r  \nCollared long stock is equal to a covered call and a long put. A covered call is synthetically equal to a short put so if you make the substitutions, a collar is synthetically equal to a long vertical spread (Google \"Synthetic Option Positions\" if you doubt this). That\u2019s your risk graph.\r  \n\r  \nCollars can be structured for no cost. That is efficient. If you want to skew the risk graph to having more upside than downside, the call will be further OTM and the collar will have a net cost. Skew it in the opposite manner and it can be for a credit.\r  \n\r  \nIf you do collars 2\u20133 months out with a short call strike that is reasonably far enough OTM, there's a chance that the stock will appreciate and not be taken away by assignment by expiry. Then, add the next month's collar at higher strikes. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nFWIW, I also buy inexpensive OTM put LEAP spreads for protection and did that when they first mentioned inflation late last year, For the past 5 months, I've been booking gains by rolling them down - not a perfect hedge but they've diminished the losses on my long holdings.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Incredibly informative brother.

Sometimes I diagonalize the collar in order to capitalize on the faster decay of the nearer expiration.

IOW, own 5 $200 puts and roll down to 6 $195 puts. If you get to do that several times, more puts offsets more loss in the underlying and can even exceed it.

{"title": "Maybe Jaime Dimon is Correct? An Economic Hurricane is Coming! Just Look at $JPM.", "selftext": "Recently, JPMorgan's CEO, Jaime Dimon, warned of a coming economic hurricane. He did not say what magnitude it would be. It could be a Super Storm Sandy, or just a temporary shakeup of the markets.\n\nNevertheless, $JPM has yet to emerge from the technical \"Death Cross\" it entered on 1/27/22. As of today's close, $JPM is down more than 26% YTD, and 31% from its all-time high of $172.96 that it hit on 10/25/21. In reality, the storm has already hit $JPM. But is there thunder to come?\n\nSuggestion: Jaime Dimon should lobby in favor of the SAFE Banking Act. This could be a good start to turnaround this sinking bank.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdxnh45rsu491.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2df26da38ab97605746744bed412d545e5eb5a1", "id": "v9gs6l", "created_utc": 1654892916.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|90|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|47|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uy7dtu/this_weeks_top_10_stocks_on_short_squeeze_leader/) [x](https://banyanhill.com/i-think-pot-stocks-will-rise-1000-in-2022/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tkfw2i/top_3_cannabis_stocks_rallying_in_aftermarkets/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uou0b7/morgan_stanley_reports_acb_beat_consensus_by_cad/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sd9k59/vampire_fangs_next_target_are_fat_juicy_faang/) [x](https://i.redd.it/8yywpknpcmu71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rwoq61/cwbhf_insiders_issued_125000_shares/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q3wmii/whales_are_buying_cwbhf_what_is_your_opinion/) [x](https://stockscan.io/100-popular-stocks-robinhood) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q6lg2q/stocks_short_squeeze_rating_jumps_to_983/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwu3f/its_time_to_look_at_cannabis_stocks/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdz9g2/the_following_10_stocks_have_short_sale_borrow/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v9gs6l)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v9gs6l)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29765957593917847}, {"body": "Falling JPM stock tells you everything about the market?
