Because what you are missing are two crucial, very crucial parts.\n\n1. The risk-adjusted return aka the yield on FDIC-insured bank accounts and/or US-gov. bonds. They were for the most part since 1971 positive. Meaning that all savings have been **more than compensated** for the loss of buying-power depreciation. In other words, the currency everyone seems to dispise today has made you a couple % on a yearly basis, inflation-adjusted and risk-free. At least for the most part since 1971.\n2. Real wages - same thing as above just for wages. Did wage increases since 1971 account for debasement of the currency? Find out for yourself but the short answer is: not quite.\n\nThis emphasises savings from the past even more, because they have held up very well while wages have not. The big problem is that since '08 the inflation-adjusted risk-free return is negative. This is very, very different from what we saw beforehand. Since '08 the dollar is actually a non-functioning construct and needs to be replaced asap or - this would also work - we need positive real-rates back. Which cannot happen because of the indebtedness of the country. And here we arrive at Ray Dalio's big debt cycle.\n\nThe only thing the USD has going for it is that it's less trash than most of the other paper currencies. So one would assume that equities with a mostly USD-based cashflow reign supreme. The big problem is that the US and its money the dollar sit on a very tall horse and a fall would wreck them. If the dollar is not used anymore as the settlement for global trade, it is going to depreciate very rapidly because the US-trade balance is trash (very high imports vs low exports). The only demand for USD on forex is because its used as settlement for global trade, especially for trading oil. If two countries that do business with each other and one wants to buy oil from the other, they have to use US. How do they get it? They buy it on the open market = this creates massive demand. If that part is missing, the demand will be so low that the value will plummit. This + inflation would get me worried about US equities in general. Tech and high growth that have an income-stream internationally - so in different currencies - yes. US-based REITs or infrastructure plays idk man. If you are an US citizen you wouldnt care. But as foreign investor I would keep an eye on currency exposure. Its anyway not a scenario that will play out instantly. But with what BRIC countries are doing, the world has already began to unwind dollar positions and especially dollar demand globally. Ofc right now, the dollar is the safest haven hence demand is huge. But inflation will pass, recession will pass, war will pass.
