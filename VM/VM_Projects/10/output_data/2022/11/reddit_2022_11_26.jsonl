{"title": "How do you use Implied Volatility when selling options?", "selftext": "I've been running backtests on some popular stocks (TSLA, HOOD, COIN, DIS) selling calls and puts over the past few years.  It's been a strange time full of volatility with the pandemic, the stimulus, and now the bear market.  Anyway, my backtests have shown that selling options on these stocks with the lowest relative IV done really terrible. But selling options with the highest IV have done really great.  \n\nI'm justifying that to myself like so...  When its happening, you don't know if you're in the lowest or highest IV range.  When you run a backtest grouping all legs by IV, you're seeing a part of the future.  When you sell options with the highest IV in a timeframe, you're setting up a situation where the IV is almost certainly going to stay about where it is, or go down during the lifetime of that contract.  So in general that would be a good thing for a seller since the underlying stock would have the tendency to move less.  An example is selling puts close to the bottom of the pandemic crash when IV was maxed out.  You have no idea that will be the max IV at the time, but the backtest has grouped them all nicely for you.\n\nYou'd just reverse that logic when selling options at the lowest IV of a timeframe.  IV can only be the same or higher during the options lifetime, which is generally bad for sellers.\n\nBut I'm just not sure if this is enough to make me think I should look to sell options with really high IVs relative to their norms.  Thoughts?\n\nHere's an extreme example with HOOD where selling low IV put options lost tons of $$ and high IV actually made a little during an extremely bad time to be selling puts on HOOD...\n\n[https://backtester.pythonanywhere.com/images/HOODPutsP\\_LbyIV.png](https://backtester.pythonanywhere.com/images/HOODPutsP_LbyIV.png)", "id": "z53y4a", "created_utc": 1669456964.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": ">  Anyway, my backtests have shown that selling options on these stocks with the lowest relative IV done really terrible. But selling options with the highest IV have done really great.\n\nAs expected. Actually, what you really want is to sell high IV when realized volatility ends up being lower than expected. That means buyers overpaid for vol and you pocket that overpayment as a seller.\n\n> When its happening, you don't know if you're in the lowest or highest IV range.\n\nTrue, but you don't have to do something as complicated as backtest. You can just compare to the trailing average, which is what [IV Rank and IV Percentile](https://www.projectfinance.com/iv-rank-percentile/\n) give you.

I was thinking of other factors that would indicate a margin of safety while selling puts.  Things like book value or MktCap/EnterpiseVal ratio.  But backtesting gets ridiculously complicated to comprehend and present once you go beyond 3 dimensions IMO.\n\nIt's fascinating to me how the P/L per leg of these backtests seem to follow a nice smooth linear or polynomial curve when grouped by IV.
