{"title": "Trading \"Level to Level\" with Options", "selftext": "**How to Trade Level to Level**\n\nThis is a question I must get at least 10 times a day. So I am going to indepth do my best to explain to you guys what a Level to Level or L2L play is for me. \n\nThe whole reason I started including more of these is that despite this being a scalpers market I realize its nearly impossible for someone to mirror a scalp. While it can be done the reward generally will never be as great as mine for the mirror. These plays are more of a set it and forget it sort of play and a play that due to the longer DTE and longer time held everyone can play them while still having a great risk to reward play. \n\n**Picking a DTE**\n\nFirst off this is NOT a scalp this is a play that will usually take a while to develop and very well could develop overnight too. With that in mind that immediately means we need a slightly longer DTE to utilize. For SPY I prefer a 3-5dte, however, this also greatly varies on the actual way premiums and theta are hitting. When I play a Tesla or Apple L2L I prefer at least 3dte or longer. Since general stocks only expire on Fridays that means pretty much after Tuesday I will refer to the next weeks DTE. The issue especially with a stock like Tesla is that it moves like Wildfire so if you are wrong or the play does move against you then you will need to your way you will get wrecked before its ever worth it. \n\nYou have to weigh a short enough DTE that the move nets you profits quickly but not so short that if the play takes time to develop as it usually does that you don\u2019t end up missing out hugely. \n\n**Choosing the correct position size** \n\nThis is the one tricky thing about the L2L plays. We have to chose a size big enough that the risk to reward is there and that we get a nice pay out. However, we can not immediately open such a large position size that we end up with a big loss if it goes against us. \n\nThe way I enter my position sizes is of a normal scalp size (which is about $2000-$2500 for me). I like to open at least 50-75% immediately depending on how strongly I feel about the play. If I feel its going to be a pretty aggressive move and that im timing pretty much right before the bounce then I will open closer to 75% if not more and end up near $2000 for the trade. However, if like Friday I expect it to consolidate first possibly then I will usually start with about $1000-$1500 initially opened. This allows me to average down if I feel the play is valid and it holds my stop loss. \n\nBut wait! DD you say averaging down a loser is just making a loser a bigger loser!? Correct! I did say that\u2026 however, that applies mostly for a scalp. I NEVER add to my scalps because those are 0dte\u2026 And those are pretty much hit or miss. I either immediately hit profits and close or im pretty much immediately wrong too. So averaging that down is not smart. However, this play factors in an average down on purpose and also uses clear support/ resistance levels to average down. \n\n**When to stop loss out**\n\nThe thing about these level to level plays that I enjoy is that they have a built in stop. So let me post an example of that from Friday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gyxlirrs5dy91.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c334066f4339df0ea6f1b3621210da0c8aed6c2a\n\nSo here you can see I already KNEW that my stop loss was going to be if a candle closes below 370.6. Now you gotta be forgiving with this too. So within reason because we did have a candle close near 370.5. So if we had closed under 370 I would have closed this play. The important thing I factor into this also is that I want my stop loss to be somewhere around 20% still. That\u2019s just how my risk to reward and win rate works. I don\u2019t want one L2L loss to wipe out numerous L2L wins. \n\n**When to average down?** \n\nLets take a look at a Tesla L2L I took on Friday also and this will be a great example of a time where averaging down works. Friday when tesla on the daily had appeared to be holding 210 support and forming a nice double bottom I entered a 7dte ATM Call. My take profit target was near 215 to 219.3. Looking back at the daily and weekly charts I know that Tesla for the last 2 weeks has broken through 205.6 support numerous times but everytime it has popped back up and refused to close below it. So what I did was purposefully make my stop loss closing UNDER 205.6 EOD. This gave me enough room where at the LOD I still only saw about -30% \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke1qvu9t5dy91.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2afd0346939b4b734eba1c269086788d3729de0\n\nOkay above you can see my call out on the play. Now lets look at how it actually played out intraday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ud60poqt5dy91.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d77f12eb18e0ec03fda6482dfa1f8baa974a58\n\nSo with this Tesla L2L you REALLY had to trust the levels. You had to trust that even though we broke key support that we were going to see a recovery by EOD which has historically happened time and time again. This was a great Risk to reward play as this is probably one of the strongest levels tesla has. \n\nNow looking back I could have absolutely waited for 205.6 support test before initially entering the play, but on Friday you can see we had that massive sell off after a strong morning and we had bounced off that key 210 support are intraday and was appearing to recover. The one thing looking back that I DID misplay on this was not waiting for the candle to break back over the 5ema before entering this play. However, leaving room to average down and knowing the key levels we can be a little aggressive and sometimes snag a more reward in doing so if we recognize the risk. \n\nSo here once EOD we broke back over that 205.6 level and closed back over the 5ema I was able to average down on my call. I did end up hitting exactly break even at one point EOD before the choppiness hit. With this support level being so strong I felt comfortable swinging this over the weekend. Knowing that we could retest 205.6 but most likely would bounce but after that EOD recovery I expect to see a bigger push up at open Monday to look for an exit. \n\n**How I choose the play**\n\nThe way I choose my level to level plays is based off daily price action along with current intraday price action. What I am looking for is when we find a key support area on the daily chart that the intraday 15min chart is then finding support at. \n\nLets take a look at another example from Friday 11/4/22 on SPY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l8hhl9u5dy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=989b59106a6c151a892065b2d55b64a1066306cd\n\nTaking a look at Friday here is a L2L play that I made on Friday. So you can see I clearly have highlighted in purpose 370.6 as a key support. This is one of my levels established from my TA on the SPY daily chart. What I saw here is that after the massive morning sell off we bounced hard off 370.6 and continued to hold all candles closing over this level. We had about 10 candles bounce off this level total. When I saw this extremely strong support establishing around this level I knew it was time to enter a LEVEL TO LEVEL play. \n\nThe first thing and most important thing is we have to chose a DTE. For me I chose a 5DTE. Why did I choose a 5DTE? When we first bounced and double bottomed off the 370.6 level at noon I Did expect a big bounce back up near that 374.9 resistance, however, I knew it could consolidate there first (which is exactly what ended up happening). Had I taken a 0dte play here by time EOD that move up finally happened I would have been. \n\nNow that I chose the correct DTE we have to set our TP target and our Stop loss target. \n\nTake profit will for a call play be the next resistance which in this case is 374.9. \n\nStop loss target as I mentioned was a FULL candle closed below 370.6. As breaking that key support would signal a bigger downside to come on SPY. On the daily 370.6 is actually a huge level support that separates periods of price action. \n\nOnce we enter the play do we diamond hand it or do we take profits when we can? Well this is where things get tricky. In the end PROFITS are KING.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4f2i8xru5dy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c11ab6d8601a1e50a9822ba71a35e2b76169eb16\n\nHere is what it looks like for me at least on a few different L2L plays from earlier Friday morning. As you can see for these I actually entered a 3dte and 5dte on SPY (I actually usually do this to show you guys the difference in pay out not so much because I wanna play it both ways) but for tesla I did enter the 0dte because in the morning that\u2019s how strongly I felt about the play and knew it would hit quick but would let the 7dte tesla play out longer.\n\nUsually I look for at least 10% but if I recognize that things have turned against me then I will exit for a much smaller gain. There is no reason to let a play go red\u2026 3% green is better then -20% red. \n\nGenerally I will just add some stop limit orders as you can see and I will continue to increase that level as price moves in my direction. And if it stops me out green well it\u2019s a win either way! Now the issue here is that many many times I stop out way before the actual L2L ever fully plays out. Which means I miss out on a HUGE win, however, if you look at the first stop limits here I was playing the 374.9 support to 378 breakout and got a nice win. I really thought we were going to see a huge green day and very well could have let those run think we see 380-385. However, had I done that on Friday I would have taken a massive loss on that sell off. \n\nI would say the biggest risk on these L2L plays is that we can not use a hard fast and set stop loss. If we do at say -20% like we usually do then we may stop out before key support actually holds and the play develops. However, when the key support or resistance against us breaks we have to exit and be okay accepting the loss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvzvvgcv5dy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd185965e1d499dd583550d28838e566ef2b9eb8\n\nHere is an example of when I actually followed my own stop loss and had I actually diamond handed it this play the very next candle would have been back to profits. However, we HAVE to be mechanical in trading. We cant be smarter then the candles or the charts. IF the play fails it fails. If it comes back to life after we close it\u2026 then that\u2019s something we can consider and something to take into play about perhaps using a looser stop loss next time but in my opinion for every play that came back from the dead there are 10 that never came back.

Thursday I predicted a volatile day on friday, so had plenty of dry powder.

Within just a few minutes, it dumped to below 373, and I sold the puts and again bought 367c. SPY stayed pretty much sideways for a couple hours at this point, on low volume. By EOD, it had gotten back up to 375, eventually closing over 376, and I sold off all but one of the calls by 4:15.\n\nI considered reloading puts at that point, plus buying ITM calls, but decided instead to just hold cash over the weekend. My profit Friday (all accounts) was $12,242.\n\nVolatility is good. Hard to make money when things are flat. And one of the key things is recognizing where the support and resistance levels are.
