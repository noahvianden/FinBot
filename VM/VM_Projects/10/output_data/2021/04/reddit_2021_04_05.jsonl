{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**\n\nStocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden\u2019s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. \n\nThe March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, \u201cIt \\[the jobs report\\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). \n\nLooking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, \u201c \"While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be \u201ctransitory,\u201d yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. \n* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn\u2019t rise nearly as much.\n* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.\"We\u2019re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,\" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n* South Korea's LG Electronics Inc said on Monday it will end production and sales of its loss-making smartphone division.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with two target raises.

{"title": "Is The U.S. Finally Embracing Tidal Energy?", "selftext": "SOURCE: https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Is-The-US-Finally-Embracing-Tidal-Energy.html\n\nBy\u00a0Tsvetana Paraskova\u00a0- Apr 05, 2021, 12:00 PM CDT\n\nThe United States has made the first step toward harnessing the potential of wave energy, a powerful source of renewable energy which researchers have been studying for decades. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)\u00a0issued\u00a0last month a license for what would be the first commercial-scale, utility grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States.\nOregon State University received that license to build and operate the\u00a0PacWave South\u00a0testing facility as the industry is developing technology and devices potentially capable of harnessing the power of ocean waves.\nDespite decades of studies, wave energy is still little developed\u2014both in the U.S. and elsewhere\u2014because researchers are still looking at ways to reconcile feasibility and costs in a complex marine environment.\nIn theory, the potential is enormous. In practice, wave energy will need a lot more testing and technology development if it hopes to become a viable renewable energy source.\nNevertheless, a testing facility operational by the middle of this decade could give the impetus the U.S. industry needs to test various technologies for generating electricity from waves and attract investors in the most promising technology. The Biden Administration\u2019s support of renewable energy could also help with industry innovation.\nThe U.S. is one of the best places in the world for ocean wave energy generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ocean waves have tremendous energy, and the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh). This equals around 64 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, the EIA\u00a0says.Related: U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb\nThe potential is there, and it is tremendous. Still, the industry now needs to test and possibly show that wave energy can make a difference with viable solutions in the drive for boosting renewable energy generation.\nOregon State University\u2019s project leaders hope to obtain from FERC construction authorization for the PacWave South testing facility later this spring. Current timelines suggest that construction could begin this summer, and the facility could be operational by 2023, OSU says.\n\u201cWe know there is still work to do to make this project a reality, but this is a huge moment for this project and for the industry as a whole,\u201d Burke Hales, chief scientist for PacWave, said in a statement.\nThe World Energy Council estimates that 10 percent of the worldwide electricity demand could be met by harvesting ocean energy, OSU said.\nThe PacWave test facility could be the companies\u2019 place to showcase technology in order to attract investors in their proposed developments, according to Hales.\n\u201cEven somebody like Bill Gates isn\u2019t going to pay somebody millions of dollars to do tests that they think will fail,\u201d Hales told\u00a0Grist\u2019s Ysabelle Kempe.\nInnovation and testing of devices could unlock the tremendous energy potential of ocean waves, which is highest along the Pacific shorelines: California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded by the Department of Energy. The study focuses on the technical resource\u2014the proportion of the theoretical resource that can be captured using existing technology options.\nThe study found that utilizing just one-tenth of the technically available marine energy resources in the 50 states would equate to 5.7 percent of the current U.S. electricity generation, or enough energy to power 22 million homes.\u00a0\nDOE\u2019s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\u00a0has identified\u00a0\u201cenergy hotspots\u201d of wave power along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.\n\u201cWave power is a significant, sizeable resource,\u201d marine coastal science advisor Simon Geerlofs says. Yet, he noted that wave energy still has challenges to overcome, including big hurdles like ensuring durability and efficiency of wave energy converters and cost-competitiveness with other energy resources.\u00a0", "id": "mkqbu9", "created_utc": 1617644524.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Answering the question I wouldn't say so, there's not been much talk at all about tidal energy.   \n The article itself talks about work that is probably very far off from being impactful in any way, if at all.

Stock price is typically estimated by looking at earnings, and multiplying by a \"multiple\" (ie, a price to earnings ratio). Analysts commonly estimate what P/E multiple to assign to a stock using the formula: P/E = 1/(r-g), where r=cost of equity and g=nominal GDP growth. Part of what constitutes cost of equity is something called the \"risk-free rate of return\". This is the rate of return you get from a very safe investment like bonds. So when the risk free rate goes up because of rising bond yields, it increases the denominator, causing the estimate for the P/E multiple to go down.\n\nThat's a purely mathematical way of looking at it. However, a more intuitive way of looking at it is that professional investors don't only think about return. They frame it as \"risk adjusted return\". If a risk-free investment is getting better return, they will rebalance more in favor of lower risk.  \n\n\nAgain, I'm not an expert.
