Weschler has been managing partner of Charlottesville, VA-based value-oriented hedge fund Peninsula Capital Advisors.\n\nHere is a look at Weschler's long equity holdings at the end of Q2. Of note is the high concentration of the $2 billion stock portfolio, with one-half of the disclosed portfolio invested in just two companies -- DirecTV\u00a0(NYSE:DTV)\u00a0and W.R. Grace\u00a0(NYSE:GRA). Both companies' stock prices advanced during the second quarter.\n\nWe also present a snapshot of key trading, valuation and performance metrics of the companies in Peninsula's long portfolio. Of note is that most of the companies have negative tangible book value, a sign that Weschler may be more of a Buffett-style \"quality-at-a-reasonable-price\" investor than a Graham-style deep value investor.\n\nFinally, we note that it is highly unusual for a die-hard value investor and Buffett follower such as Weschler to remain nearly anonymous within the value investment community, especially considering Peninsula's fairly large assets under management ($2+ billion). The fact that Weschler insisted on being an anonymous bidder for the charity lunch with Buffett in 2010 and 2011 only underscores the degree to which Weschler has preferred anonymity within the fairly tight-knit value community. This non-promotional attitude must have appealed to Buffett.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6349488496780396}, {"body": "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/interview-with-warren-buffetts-investment-manager-ted-weschler-the-recipe-for-financial-success-2016-7\n\nTed Weschler (55), alongside Todd Combs, is one of the two\u00a0investment managers that Buffett (85) hired to help oversee Berkshire\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThe\u00a0former hedge fund manager Weschler, who joined\u00a0Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in 2012,\u00a0sat down with BI Germany\u2019s editor-in-chief Christin Martens for an interview.\n\nBusiness Insider:\u00a0By auctioning for a private lunch with Warren Buffett in two consecutive years you basically paid $5,252,722 to get a job. What is the interest rate on that investment?\n\nTed Weschler:\u00a0People love that story. Let me get this clear though. It was on my bucket list that I always wanted to meet Warren Buffett. I happened to be in San Francisco for a board meeting of a foundation I am affiliated with. And I knew that I wanted to visit Glide, a San Francisco church and mission, whose foundation is the charity that benefits from this lunch.\n\nAnd basically you make a donation for this charity. And if you make the biggest one you also get the \u2018free\u2018 lunch. And I ended up winning that lunch. We actually did it as a dinner in Omaha. And we had a terrific time. And the following year I did not intend to do it again. But I did not want the value of the lunch to drop. So I bid 100 $ more than the year before and I ended up winning it again.\n\nAt the end of the lunch and a very interesting conversation he, out of nowhere, said: \u2018Is there any way I can encourage you to come to Berkshire Hathaway?\u2019 And that was the last thing I ever expected. I was running a 2 billion-dollar hedge-fund, just myself, my secretary and a research assistant. I lived in Charlottesville, Virginia. I had a nice set up. And then I had the opportunity to work with somebody I had a great deal of respect for. I wrestled through it, talked to my family and ultimately thought it was the right combination. Now, I still live in Charlottesville, Virginia, that is where my family is, and I commute on a regular base every week to Omaha for a couple of days a week.\n\nBI: It takes a lot to impress the of Oracle Omaha. How did you do it?\n\nTW:\u00a0I don\u2019t know. We hit if off and talked about so many different subjects. I am obsessed with stocks and investing \u2014 I read everything. And it was one of these things. The conversation was very fast and for whatever reason, we had a lot of in common, for example the structure we think about investing and that was it. For whatever reason he thought I would be a good fit. It has been terrific. It has been almost five years and I really enjoy the place.\n\nBI: As you have been a very successful investor for years: Is there a recipe to it?\n\nTW:\u00a0There is one, but I am not telling you\u00a0[laughing]. Investing is kind of a game of connecting the dots. The nice thing about it is the longer you are in the business, as long as you are intellectually curious, your collection of data points of dots gets bigger and bigger. That is where someone like Warren is just incredible. He has had a passion for investing for well over 70 years. He started by the age of 10 or 12. He keeps building that library of data, the ability to recognize patterns in data. Being a successful investor you need to be hungry, intellectually curious, interested, read all the time. Read a lot of newspapers. You need a certain level of randomness in order to connect things that might give you an insight into where a business is going in five years that somebody else might not see.\n\nWhen it comes to wholly owned businesses among other factors it is about pricing power. You have something that is so attractive to the consumer that they pay a premium to walk into your store and do something. There is a number of attributes like that. But you can never just point to one thing. It is a mosaic of all sort of different things. If then you read the book of a business you can pretty quickly find out if that is a good business or not.\n\nBI: You said you read a lot. What do you recommend?\n\nTW:\u00a0I am a big fan of newspapers. I read at least one or two in paper form, the other ones on my iPad. We own a lot of newspaper at Berkshire Hathaway. I am always intrigued by who is doing what in the online business. Because everybody is coming up with presenting things in a better format. I read at least five newspapers a day.\n\nBI: And which newspapers do you read on a regular basis?\n\nTW:\u00a0I have a tradition. I always start each day with reading the local paper of the town I wake up in. Then next one would be USA Today. That gets you a general feeling for the Zeitgeist. They package the news for the entire population. From an investing standpoint it is relevant to understand what everybody is thinking. Then I generally move up to the New York Times, then the Wall Street Journal and then I end with the Financial Times. And actually I recently just started reading the Handelsblatt global edition.\n\nBI: And what about books? Is there a favorite one?\n\nTW:\u00a0Really no. There is a lot I read over the years. But there is not one I would say which made the difference in investing.\n\nBI: If I had 5000 Euros. Where should I invest?\n\nTW:\u00a0In a perfect world you could buy a good business with long term prospects at that price. I am a big fan of investing in what people do from day to day. But there are only little enterprises for that amount of money. With interest rates being historically low right now I would not want to invest in bonds. Also a bond is a contract and you can\u2019t do anything with that. The appeal businesses is that they have the ability to change and frequently do just fine because of this. To be more specific. If I was living in Europe I would probably put that 5000 Euro in a European based index fund to keep transaction costs very low and then I forget about it for a long time.\n\nBI: And if you were situated in the States?\n\nTW:\u00a0I would do the similar thing and probably put it in something like the Vanguard index fund. The expense on that is very, very low and it is tax efficient. And personally I buy Berkshire stocks.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48648905754089355}, {"body": "https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2017/02/06/berkshires-airline-bet-said-to-stem-from-faith-in-american-airlines-ceo-doug-parkers-call/\n\nWarren Buffett once quipped that a \"farsighted capitalist\" should have shot down Orville Wright at Kitty Hawk to spare investors all the losses they would suffer on airlines in the decades after the birth of flight.\n\nThat's why it was a surprise when, in November, the billionaire's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed investments in the four largest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Continental Holdings Inc.\n\nSo why the change of heart? It stemmed, in part, from a presentation that American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker gave at an investor conference in March, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing Berkshire's strategy.\n\nParker told attendees that he was urging his team to take a \"leap of faith\" on the airline business. Consolidation, he argued, had ended the boom-and-bust cycle that had plagued his company and competitors for decades, and it was time to manage the business for that new reality.\n\n\"The industry has been restructured. It was fragmented. It was inefficient. It was unfocused,\" he said during the presentation. \"Now, it's efficient. It's focused on demand. We have networks that can actually deliver what people want.\"\n\nWeschler's Ties\n\nThe analysis prompted Ted Weschler, one of Buffett's investing deputies, to take a closer look at airlines, the people said. Before joining Berkshire, Weschler's hedge fund had backed Parker in his successful 2005 bid to combine America West with US Airways. Through that process, the two men built a rapport.\n\nBack then, Parker was an early proponent of consolidation to heal an industry plagued by bankruptcies, thousands of employee furloughs and compensation cuts. He went on to play a key role in an era of mergers, ultimately engineering the combination of US Airways with the much-larger American to create the world's biggest carrier.\n\nIn his presentation, Parker put labor relations at the center of his strategy, saying that happy employees take care of passengers, turning them into loyal customers who are best for shareholders. American has promised to pay more than rivals during contract negotiations and begin sharing profits with employees to help stay competitive.\n\nPricing Power\n\nThose efforts have put pressure on American's bottom line and been stymied by disputes with unions. But the airline was able to reverse a slide in unit revenue, a key metric that investors use to gauge pricing power, in the fourth quarter. It was the first major U.S. carrier to do so since a price war erupted in early 2015. Other airlines have also said fares are firming. Buffett has often talked about the importance of pricing power in evaluating a business.\n\nThe billionaire didn't respond to a message seeking comment. American said it was working hard to deliver value to all shareholders including Berkshire.\n\n\"The Berkshire investment is strong evidence that our company and industry have fundamentally and structurally changed in a profound and lasting way,\" said Matt Miller, a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier. \"Delivering long-term financial success will provide continued evidence of this fact.\"\n\nBuffett declined to discuss the rationale for the airline investments during an interview with Charlie Rose on Jan. 27, but he did say that the decision to buy was \"in large part\" his.\n\nThat was a more equivocal answer than he's typically given when asked whether he or one of his deputies made a particular investment. After Berkshire added a stake in General Motors Co., for instance, the billionaire said it wasn't his pick. And he took ownership immediately of the decision to invest in International Business Machines Corp.\n\nWeschler and his counterpart, Todd Combs, each oversee a fraction of Berkshire's roughly $100 billion in equities. While the two work autonomously from Buffett, they sometimes collaborate or have overlaps in strategy. Both deputies had stakes in DirecTV before the company agreed in 2014 to be purchased by AT&T Inc.\n\nInfluencing Buffett\n\nThe deputies have also influenced Buffett. In 2015, the billionaire agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp. for about $37 billion, after Combs put the company on his radar screen by taking an equity stake.\n\nIn general, Weschler and Combs make smaller investments than their boss. Buffett's portfolio includes more than $26 billion of Wells Fargo & Co. stock and about $17 billion of Coca-Cola Co.\n\nThe stake in American, by contrast, was valued at about $800 million at the end of September, while the holdings in United and Delta were worth less than $250 million each, according to a November regulatory filing. The Southwest investment was made subsequent to Sept. 30, Buffett told CNBC, without specifying the size.\n\nU.S. airlines have rallied since Berkshire made its investments, but the industry hasn't proven to be immune from market swings. Just last month, President Donald Trump's ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations caused the largest U.S. airlines to lose $4.9 billion in market value over two days.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3953035771846771}, {"body": "Wikipedia:\n\nAfter graduating from Wharton, Weschler worked for six years at\u00a0W.

{"title": "Smart home appliances going to head of class This article mentions the evolving role $JD is playing in the supply chain", "selftext": "Source: \nhttp://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202104/07/WS606d1384a31024ad0bab3ef7.html\n\nChina's home appliance market is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year as high-end and smart products grow in popularity, according to a report from the China Center for Information Industry Development, a Beijing-based think tank.\n\nThe report showed that the retail sales in China's household appliance market reached 833.3 billion yuan (127.4 billion) in 2020, marking a year-on-year decline of 6.5 percent.\n\nBut such figures still showcased strong resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said. Affected by the contagion, the first quarter of 2020 saw large-scale contraction with a year-on-year decrease of 35.8 percent in sales of home appliances, but then performance gradually improved. In the fourth quarter, online and offline markets fully recovered, and retail sales reached the highest annual level at 294.1 billion yuan.\n\nIt is also worth noting that last year, e-commerce channels accounted for more than 50 percent of retail sales of home appliances for the first time in China. In 2020, online retail sales of home appliances stood at 419.9 billion yuan, marking a year-on-year increase of 14.48 percent and an increase of 3 percentage points over the previous year. By comparison, retail sales of home appliances via offline channels were 413.4 billion yuan\uff0da year-on-year decrease of 21.13 percent.\n\nRupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun Report, said earlier that 5G, internet of things and big data have huge development prospects for the home appliance industry.\n\nThe effect of online channels on the home appliance industry is growing. E-commerce platforms Tmall and JD have become major selling platforms, and the industry is no longer dominated by offline retailing channels such as Gome and Suning, Hoogewerf said.\n\nThe report from the China Center for Information Industry Development also showed that the pandemic has reshaped consumer lifestyles, thus promoting changes in the types of home appliances available.\n\nIn 2020, the main 4K/8K smart TVs, which feature large screens, ultra-high definition and artificial intelligence, are becoming increasingly popular, as are healthy high-end air conditioners, premium refrigerators with large capacity and disinfection capabilities, and high-end washing machines. Such a shift in preferences has led to changes in the product structure of China's home appliance market and raised average prices.\n\nData from JD showed that in 2020, sales volume of TVs priced above 10,000 yuan on its platform increased by more than 70 percent year-on-year, and the market penetration rate of WiFi-enabled smart air conditioners increased from 49 percent in the previous year to 63 percent.\n\nRetail sales of refrigerators priced above 20,000 yuan on JD also soared 132 percent last year. Dryers have become the biggest dark horse in white goods market, with market demand expanding significantly and retail sales increasing by 87.4 percent year-on-year.\n\nLi Wenjie, who analyzes the home appliance market for JD, said the outbreak has changed consumer preferences and shopping habits. Chinese manufacturers have to allocate more resources to better exploit emerging opportunities to increase sales and market share, he said.\n\nAt the same time, household appliances, such as dishwashers, handheld vacuum cleaners, hairdressing and beauty products and massage chairs also recorded strong sales, which activated the otherwise sluggish home appliance market and also strengthened the role of home appliances in improving people's sense of satisfaction, the report from the China Center for Information Industry Development added.\n\nExperts said the growing desire for smarter and high-end products is expected to continue in 2021, and it is bringing significant opportunities for Chinese and foreign home appliance makers alike.\nGerman home appliance manufacturer BSH Hausgeraete, known for brands such as Siemens and Bosch, said it saw a \"significantly growing demand\" for dishwashers and dryers in China last year, growing 34 and 59 percent, respectively, as the company was the \"strongest non-Chinese home appliance manufacturer in China\".\n\nIn China, a \"significant business recovery\" with high growth rates started in last May, more than compensating for turnover losses during the first three months of 2020, BSH said in a statement.\nTo meet growing demand for its products, Galanz, a Chinese home appliance maker, also built a new plant in 50 days last year in Foshan, Guangdong province. With four new smart manufacturing lines, the base\uff0dwhich is capable of producing a microwave oven each 6.7 seconds\uff0dwill have a production capacity of 11 million units annually, Galanz said.\n\nTo better pounce on the opportunities, Chinese home appliance maker Haier last month also unveiled a roadmap for the next phase of smart home development.\n\nDemonstrating its leadership in smart home scenarios, solutions and technologies, Haier said it aims to deliver a better experience for users across clothing, food, housing, entertainment and transportation.\n\nFor example, Haier's air conditioners will automatically activate a sterilizing function based on detected levels of air pollution to remove seven types of common air pollutants, while releasing negative ions to provide a healthy and comfortable air environment for the family.\n\n\"At Haier, we have amassed over 36 years of knowledge from serving more than 180 million households, and gathered observations from tens of millions of connected devices. Our roadmap draws upon this insight and experience into the needs of household users, in order to usher in the future of connected smart home appliances,\" said Wang Ye, vice-president of smart home business at the Haier Home Appliance Industry Group.", "id": "moi6dm", "created_utc": 1618107037.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Oh yeah, so now my toaster can spy on me too...", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I pity the average consumer that can\u2019t isolate devices to private networks...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Private network hw made in China.

That caps part there is important.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is zero research when it comes to the profitability of managing before expiration.\n\nThere pretty much can't be such research.  Everything is anecdotal and it's near impossible to backtest in any meaningful way.  Since researchers typically start by backtesting X and Y, they would just have to find a bunch of people and teach them roll skills and study the results going forward best effort.\n\nConsidering researchers are, generally speaking, on clocks, that is hard to do.  They need to turn in a thesis by date X and not being able to get a bunch of backtest data on day 1 makes their job a lot harder.\n\nThat, however, is all meaningless to me who has a size 1 case study to worry about and for whom managing the positions before expiration is what is going to happen 100% of the time.\n\nIn that sense, I think the management of the positions allows one to blow far past any number like 6.5% that you get only from holding until expiration regardless of what happens in the interim.\n\nI am sure I would have kept well less than 37% of premiums if I had no ability to manage my own positions.
