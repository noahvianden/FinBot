I hope you have a profitable, safe, and enjoyable week ahead! Good luck!\n\n\\-Davin\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**$CCL:** requested by TVRepairManMan\n\nNear a key support level (fib fan and fib retracement) as well as the 200 EMA. Also trading within a bull flag, an inverse head and shoulders, as well as a cup and handle chart pattern. ALL BULLISH SIGNALS! If CCL does fall to the support levels drawn on the chart, that could be a great entry for a potential swing trade/bounce to the upside.\n\nGap Up Targets: low $27 > high $27 > $28 > mid $28\n\nGap Down targets: high $26 > mid $26 > low $26\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$AAPL:** requested by TVRepairManMan\n\nTrading within a rising wedge (bullish chart pattern) on the daily and 4hr chart. Already in AAPL calls for the run up to their earnings and a breakout and continuation of this pattern it\u2019s trading in right now. Needs to break the resistance of 134-135 first though.\n\nGap Up Targets: $135 > $136.50 > $138\n\nGap Down Targets: high $133 > low $133 > high $132\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$PBI:** requested by Liam Jones\n\nTrading within a channel with decent looking indicators. Looks to be holding support around $8.16 so it could be a good entry at its current price point, however, I\u2019d be careful of the break to the downside. Consolidation/Accumulation looks pretty good though.\n\nGap Up Targets: $8.55 > $8.64 > $8.85\n\nGap Down Targets: $8.15 > $8.00 > $7.80\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$SNOW:** brought up by Shinmoon for potential put/short play\n\nTrading within a channel with resistance around $243-242 with support around $230-229. Could be a good opportunity to scalp or swing trade depending on which level hits first (support or resistance). HOWEVER, need to be cautious of the inverse head and shoulders on the daily/4hr if you\u2019re going to get puts or short the stock. Once that resistance breaks and becomes support, RIP bears.\n\nGap Up Targets: $236 > $240 > $244\n\nGap Down Targets: $228 > $224 > $219 > $216 > $212 > $204\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$MARA:** requested by DarkVoid\n\nCurrently at $38.52 as of Friday AH, may dip during PM due to how much Bitcoin dropped over the weekend, but could also be a good time to average down or get in if you\u2019re not in already if it finds support around the $36.50-35.50 area.\n\nGap Up Targets: $40 > $42 > $44\n\nGap Down Targets: high $37 > mid $36 > $35 > $34 > $32 > $30\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$VBIV:** requested by Adam Harlow\n\nLooks to be on an overall steady uptrend based on the daily, however it\u2019s forming a pretty conspicuous head and shoulders (bearish) pattern. Need to pay special attention to the $2.60 uptrend support area as that is the \u201cneckline\u201d of the head and shoulders pattern. If that level breaks, it\u2019ll fall down from that point at which I would say it\u2019s better to go with puts or wait for a good key support level to hold before going long or buying calls. The 4hr chart looks a lot better as far as the indicators go, so there is a small opportunity to make money on the shares/call options. Again, just be careful of that neckline break to the downside.\n\nGap Up Targets: $2.83 > $2.93 > $3.00\n\nGap Down Targets: $2.67 > $2.60 > $2.42 > $2.30\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$TIRX:** requested by DarkVoid\n\nHuge selloff that we couldn\u2019t find the reason for at the time, but it looks like it\u2019s bouncing from the very bottom at $11.17. It\u2019s currently heading up towards the first resistance of $17. This could be a massive gap fill play if the resistances become support. I\u2019m looking for a potential gap fill back to the $53 area, but that\u2019s a long stretch...ie the \u201cbest case scenario\u201d. Please do your research on this company as they just IPO\u2019d back in January and it is a Chinese company. Not many people trust Chinese companies these days so in general this is a very risky position to take, even if you go long term or give yourself lots of time with your options.\n\n**THERE ARE NO OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THIS TICKER**\n\nGap Up Targets: $17 > $20 > $23 > $31\n\nGap Down Targets: $11 > the deep dark abyss\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$CLOV:** requested by Atrix C\n\nHad a HUGE breakout this past Friday and runup towards the $9-10 resistance area. It pulled all the way back below the $9.00 level, but looks great on the 4hr chart as far as price action and indicators go. Looking really bullish as far as I can tell at least for the short term. The daily chart looks alarming because we\u2019re back below a key resistance level so we could fall a bit if we\u2019re going off the daily chart. I wouldn;t be surprised if we gap up during PM though. Lots of chatter over social media and all the Discords I\u2019m in, everyone was watching it last Friday, and then we\u2019ll likely have some FOMO and continuation hopes to drive it higher.\n\nGap Up Targets: low to mid $9 > high $9 > $10 > $10.50\n\nGap Down Targets: $8.83 > $8.60 > $8.25 > $8.00\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**$OPEN:** requested by DarkVoid\n\nIn a constant downtrend since March 23, 2021, right now I\u2019m bearish at least until it hits support at $17, then I\u2019d look for a potential bounce to the upside there.\n\nGap Up Targets: $19 > $19.30 > $19.60 > $20\n\nGap Down Targets: $18.22 > $18.06 > $17.00\n\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nDisclaimer: This information is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

This trade would profit if SPY ended, or was at any point within the next 3 months, above 426.18. It could even profit it it simply went up 1% the next day and you decide to close your position for a small profit.

I am fully aware that these crashes and bear markets do happen and are a real possibility, however the max loss in this trade is $618 while max profit is $882, meaning this trade would have to lose at nearly a 4:3 ratio long term for this strategy to lose money, which, judging off of historical data, is just not probable and as everyone knows the market goes up 3x as much as it goes down. \n\nI'd like to obtain historical data of SPY for the past few years and personally backtest this strategy but I'm curious on others' perspective on this trade.

{"title": "Do Retail Traders Have an Edge? How to Trade When You are the Small Fish in a Big Ocean.", "selftext": "#  Let's frame this conversation.\n\nAn easy way to think of trading is that you are placing bets against other people. It\u2019s a competition!\n\nFor the most part, when you make a dollar, someone loses a dollar, and no one here is running a charity. So how do you ensure victory in a competition? You find an edge. That\u2019s what good trading is all about.\n\n# What is an example of an edge?\n\nImagine you are competing in a weight lifting competition. The person who is on steroids has an edge over everyone else.\n\n**As you can see, edge is simply an advantage over the competition.**\n\nWhen most of us think about retail vs institutional, we think we are at a severe disadvantage. And in some aspects, we are.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s hard for us to compete against institutional traders from a technological perspective. They have better infrastructure and teams to improve them.\n\nAnother example is that they usually have better access to data. A simple example is a Bloomberg terminal. Very few retail traders have one, but over 350,000 people own one. There\u2019s obviously a reason, and its access to information.\n\n# After reading those points.. Trading can really start to feel like an uphill battle..\n\n# But all hope is not lost.\n\nAs retail, we actually have some inherent edges over the big guys.\n\n# Here are a couple of inherent edges that retail traders have:\n\n1. **Size:** Since we have smaller accounts, we can trade in areas of the market that are more \u201ccapacity constrained\u201d. Warren Buffett said that if he had a million dollar account, he could do 100% a year. This is because he would be able to trade in smaller, potentially less efficient names. Think about it like this. Warren has to look for food in the ocean; we can go fishing in the pond.\n2. **Risk Tolerance**: If you work as a PM at a fund and take a 5% drawdown, you are going to have your capital under management cut. In the hedge fund space, PnL variance is important. Everyone cheers when you are up 5%, investors start to pull capital when you are down 5%. One is clearly more important than the other. As retail traders, we don\u2019t have this. We can take on the risk of a bigger drawdown. We don\u2019t have a risk manager breathing down our necks. This opens up some doors, and gives us an advantage over the big funds.\n\nWe may be a small fish compared to hedge funds, but we aren\u2019t always obligated to play their game. And sometimes, we can even take advantage of characteristics of funds to have the upper hand.\n\n# Here\u2019s 2 examples of how we can use these edges:\n\n1. Big firms aren\u2019t looking at small companies, or illiquid chains. This means there are less eyes on it, and more chance of something to be poorly priced. By brushing up our own skills and targeting these areas, perhaps we can find some golden nuggets.\n2. Large firms (example, pension funds) have an obligation to hedge positions around major events like earnings if the company in question represents a large portion of their holdings. The key word here is *obligation*. When you must buy something, you become price insensitive. If a Put option is going for $4, or $5, it doesn\u2019t matter to you. So maybe we can come in here, price it out, and sell \u201coverpriced\u201d coverage to these funds.\n\n# Some Motivation\n\nI know this post started out pretty bleak. But if you take some time to digest the points above, it\u2019s actually exciting. There\u2019s money to be earned, it just takes a bit of creativity and some time spent developing our skills in order to make it happen.\n\nNow turning these edges into strategies is not always easy (It shouldn\u2019t be). And then monetizing these edges is also difficult (as it should be).\n\n**But the rewards are worth it.**\n\nI\u2019ll make another post this week about how to think about strategy, building off the base outlined in this post.\n\nI hope this post put some wrinkles on that smooth brain!\n\nHappy trading everyone!!", "id": "mu8zrq", "created_utc": 1618862068.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Interesting take and a few thoughts:\n\nHigher risk tolerance isn\u2019t an edge on a risk/reward basis which is how you should view every investment.

{"title": "Consistent Gains With Spreads? Should I Take Control of College Fund?", "selftext": "I've found trading spreads, usually put credit spreads fairly far OTM with like around -0.2 delta, I can get anywhere from 10-15%, if not more, on a monthly basis. I've been trading options for a little while now, and I continue to read and educated myself on options trading in general. I'm young, and have a college fund that is managed through Fidelity and yields average results annually. Now, I'm not a complete idiot, but I have been thinking about the possibility of withdrawing around half of it and diversifying it among a handful of lower risk 30-45 DTE spreads, managing them as I need to. No YOLO FD's or anything of the sort. I understand the risk and the way spreads work.\n\n But for example, I have 2x AAPL 126/124 put credit spreads open, expiring on 5/21. In a very oversimplified way, I have essentially put up $400 saying that AAPL will be above 126 on 5/21. If it is, I would walk away with $400 and the $82 in credit, or a 20.5% gain. Of course, I may need to manage this position, perhaps walking away with less than that $82, or in a very unfortunate case, losing all my collateral to begin with. I don't by any means consider myself an expert either, nor am I over confident in my abilities and think that I can trade $500 to $10,000 in a week.\n\nAnyways, I feel as though it is a rather safe bet to say that AAPL will be above 126 on 5/21, or that MSFT will be above 245 by 5/28 (this is a bit riskier to be fair), or that QQQ will stay above 318 by 5/28.

{"title": "$DGX Quest Diagnostics IV - Earnings Extravaganza", "selftext": "This is the last DD before **earnings this Thursday (pre-market).**\n\nPrevious DDs so you can disregard them one more time:\n\n1. [DGX (Quest Diagnostics) is Free Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n2.

Open calls, heavily weighted towards safer strikes because I'm a pansy. Position is understated both in total and net return by about $20k because Ally is hot garbage.\n\n[Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160 ](https://preview.redd.it/xcprmy2ub7u61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=975fbcfbc92569cdc660d471ad5f391ce39a236d)\n\n**TL;DR yet again** \\- Quest performed over 10.4 million COVID tests during Q1 and base case testing has rebounded. They are still executing over $900 million in share repurchases over the next 3 months, which equates to a buyback of roughly 5% of their float. Then they have another $ BILLION of repurchases authorized for the back half of 2021 as well. Additionally, the technicals are some of the most bullish I've ever seen. And yet, the company still trades well behind their top competitor, Labcorp $LH. **I'll say it until I'm blue in the face from wearing these 6 masks, $DGX remains the safest trade in this market.**\n\n**$DGX vs $LH** \\- Look, I think I've beaten this comparison to death over the previous DDs, so I'll just add this quick table reflecting DGX share price as a % of LH. Note that prices are somewhat smoothed within each month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnve5wp4h7u61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8af65266c0df12e9022e4ba9b2c93cb04e4a6b\n\nThat's a pretty damn consistent trend isn't it? And don't worry, I know you aren't here to do math. If $DGX was trading at a conservative 60% of LH, it would be $156. Right now. Now, people can argue the LH Covance acquisition makes their growth prospects better than Quest. Maybe. But it certainly shouldn't drive this large of a variance.\n\n**Charting / Technicals** \\- Virtually all technicals are neutral or **VERY bullish** at this point. I also encourage those who like charting to checkout the 1-2 year trend. Then for more fun, take a look at the intraday trading over the last 60ish days. Look, I think charting is worthless 95% of the time as are technicals without a lot of context, but there are some obvious patterns in trading over the last couple months specifically. To me, it's clear institutions have been deliberately chasing out retail and consistently repurchasing at a lower price. On-balance Volume is soaring, which when combined with other metrics, is a great indicator of large \"smart money\" bets. This happens all the time. It's why stocks like Apple unexpectedly flatline for substantial periods of time, then make a huge move upward on \"info\" or \"results\" that you thought were easily foreseeable long ago.\n\n**Institutions** and other big boys (or, conversely, dbag hedgefunds) - **13F filings** in Q1 and Q2 (so far) were absurdly bullish on $DGX, buying the stock at nearly a $4 to $1 rate. This is a much higher rate than usual for $DGX and VASTLY higher than the ratio of $$$ intuitions are putting into $LH.\n\n**Shorts/shorting because this is WSB after all -** The amount of shares short is surprisingly interesting right now. Sure, an increase in shares short to nearly 4m doesn't seem like a lot on a float of 132m at face value. But $DGX has 90% institutional ownership, the majority of which isn't being moved (Vanguard is largest owner and Quest has a solid dividend). So the public/retail is really playing with 16m shares or so. Then factor in $DGX is repurchasing around 14 million shares this year, depending on buyback price. **Now that 4 million shares short becomes VERY material.**\n\n**$DGX Q1 Performance -** I still expect a big beat, projecting over $4 EPS on a lower than expected drop off in COVID testing, substantial increases in base testing (core business), increasing acquisition revenue, and additional COVID research projects. Quest continues to flat out tell you they are still crushing COVID testing. Sure, it's down slightly from Q4, but remains much higher than 2020 Q2 and Q3. Adjusted run rate for April remains high as well. And now they will have base testing back again.
