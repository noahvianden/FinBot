{"title": "Actively trading a $160K account, posting daily updates", "selftext": "Hello, world!\n\nA number of my trader friends have encouraged me for years to post my daily trading strategies and actions but I\u2019ve never gotten around to doing it.  It's something I've been doing in a small circle, but I'm taking the leap to share it with this sub, which I value greatly.\n\nSo, post #1:\n\nI\u2019ll talk more about my trade strategies and mechanics in subsequent posts, but this is my basic strategy:\n\n* For tracking purposes, I began with a $161K balance in a \u201cfutures/options-specific\u201d trading account on January 27th.\n* I\u2019m executing a premium-selling strategy that looks for underlying with IV Percentile (NOT rank, for you Tastytraders) above 50% ideally but with a 35% floor.  These are primarily naked option positions.\n* When IVP is sub-20%, I\u2019m using debit spreads to capitalize on a directional assumption.  I\u2019ll occasionally use calendar spreads and double-diagonals to stay engaged in prolonged periods of low IV (like now!)\n* In the futures market, I\u2019m using futures options as my primary trading vehicle, along with trading pairs.  \n* Positions are entered at between 1-3% of total BPE.  My max BPE deployment on a single trade is 8%.  I trade small and across multiple asset classes, the less correlated the better.\n* Max BPE deployment is 70% of availability, or around \\~$120,000 at current balances.  My comfort zone in a low IV environment at lifetime highs everywhere is 50%. I have a few bigger trades on now and am looking to pare back in the next week.\n\nWith keen awareness that this sub's mods have strict guidelines about posts like this, I will do my absolute best to talk about the thought process behind the moves I'm making while also including the trade specifics.\n\nWith that, here\u2019s today\u2019s activity (4/29):\n\nEBAY - Three earnings trades were on the books heading into the day. After EBAY dropped at the open, I moved the 30 APR strangle to the 57/55 with 1 DTE for .23cr I also moved the 21 MAY strangle to 18 JUN 60/55 for .94cr. Looking to close these trades out as soon as I scratch green.\n\nCCS - On today's move up, I opened a combo (synthetic long position) 18 JUN 75/70 for .99db.  This is a low IV underlying with strong upside momentum. With my combo trades, I'm looking at a hold period of 1-2 weeks.\n\nGNRC - On today's move up I opened a combo 18 JUN 340/330 for 1.95cr. The stock then plummeted and doinked me for a paper loss of about $400 and I was not happy.  GNRC has been a real PITA to trade this year as markets are wide and the fills are hard to peg.  GNRC then proceeded to rally back to the highs of the day, putting me up $478 but below the buy point of 342.38. With nearly $8K of BPE on the line I sold this thing 15 minutes before the close and moved on with my gains.\n\nDXC - On today's move up I opened a combo 18 JUN 33/32 for .75db. Similar setup: upside momentum, low IV.\n\nCLOV - Opened a naked put 21 MAY 9 for .39cr.  IV in this underlying is crazy elevated at 125% and the markets are surprisingly good.  Target return is 50% of credit received.\n\nAMZN - Opened a 21 MAY 2950/2800 put credit spread for 2.36cr, expecting AMZN to crush earnings like everyone else has.  I sold a 3 delta put - certainly not pushing a lot of risk - but going short in this stock, even with defined risk, put me right at my BPE max.\n\nPTON - I closed a put spread I had on that had 1 DTE, and was solidly profitable (this was a three day trade, sold this spread into a down move expecting a pause in the move).  Was looking aces until today's big down move.  I bought the spread back for a $6 green scratch and opened a put debit spread 21 MAY 100/98 for 1.11db as PTON broke through the 100 level on 54% above-average volume. This thing will hit 94 before it gets above 100.\n\nFDX - I was in this underlying trying to ride UPS coattails. Low IV stock with momentum. Closed 1 lot of an open put vertical on a 10% 1-day gain. Letting the second lot ride\n\nTWTR - Playing TWTR earnings with stangles and planning to close with the IV crush, assuming the stock behaves within the expected move. Rolled an existing strangle in May to 18 JUN 75/55 for an additional .40cr.  Opened a 21 MAY 75/55 strangle for 1.80cr.  Opened a 30 APR 78/55 strangle for .57cr.  Obviously looking slightly bullish here.  \n\nMVIS - Opened a strangle 21 MAY 35/13 for 1.98cr to play earnings.  \n\nThanks for reading! Feedback welcome.  Go easy on the new guy. :)\n\nImages are for context/proof.  Right now, my biggest potential exposure is that I'm short -1300 Vega and IV is bouncing off of lows.  I need to prune Vega ASAP, and keep it under 1000 or so.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily trades and realized P&L](https://preview.redd.it/3vomkwgiwcw61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=74f8a4bbf3105f2a730b852c8e70f0ca854b3489)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Positions \\(1 of 2\\) with Greeks and current P&Ls](https://preview.redd.it/xsoh22slwcw61.png?width=3150&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c4d3294b8db3d0fbd2b224c231ba5c4152224f1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Positions \\(2 of 2\\) with totals](https://preview.redd.it/ip7em6epwcw61.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ae8005b4ba61635e9758244f516a65725c6d7a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Trading performance](https://preview.redd.it/7pr8o25swcw61.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5b007ae94fd21aff01609816f4be1be5a4bc55)\n\nUPDATE: This post is getting edited late and we have nearly a full Friday behind us.

{"title": "Anticipating a Deeep Correction - Moving From Holding Stocks to Straddle-Only Strategy?", "selftext": "Options n00b here with paper hands. Feel free to roast me: I just started trading options this week.\n\nTrigger warning: *I mention crypto below, but I'm really seeking advice on options trading for US stocks.*\n\n**Background:**\n\nFor the past few years, I have only bought and sold stocks, mostly in tech. I'm starting to feel extremely paranoid about inflated prices, but I don't feel like there's a smart alternative investment to the stock market for me.\n\nCurrently my largest holdings are: QQQ, AMZN, FB (I've already sold all mid and small caps)\n\nMy first real trading experience was investing in cryptocurrencies in early 2016. I had 8x returns at the 2017 peak, and then basically lost everything, panic selling during the onset of the crypto winter in 2018. That experience left me with PTSD, which triggers my intense fear after a significant run-up, like we've now seen in both crypto and the US stock market this year.\n\nHere's my paranoid thesis: *Within the next 4 months the price of BTC will decline >60%, given there's a much stronger correlation between crypto and US stocks than in 2017 (especially in tech and financials) I think this crash will trigger a >20% correction in my tech-heavy portfolio. So I want to get out.* \n\nI've already sold many of my holdings from the past year: AAPL, GE, SPOT, LMND, ETSY, YAYO, ABML, TSLA, MESA, ABNB, MMEDF, Z, ZBRA, MTCH, UBER, ARKG, SFT, VYGVF, CRLBF, EBAY, URTY\n\nI sold all my crypto on 4/20, which was 10% of my portfolio, so I am over-allocated to cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Recent Intro to Options:**\n\nI got into options with the objective of just setting up an \"insurance strategy\" by buying very cheap puts on QQQ as a safety net if we experience a major correction. While learning how to buy puts and calls, I discovered straddles and it feels like the perfect investment strategy for me at this point in time, given my inescapable paranoia.\n\n**For stocks I am bullish on** (ABNB, MESA, DD, TNK, XOM, ESS, F, XPEV, TM, MGM, TAP) **does it make sense to buy 6-month at-the-money straddles to limit my exposure while still maintaining a position to profit if the stocks go up or if everything crashes?**\n\n**Does anyone else use this strategy?**\n\n**What type of fundamental rules do I need to remember for locking in gains and cutting losses, while playing both directions?**\n\n*I welcome all/any advice or criticism because I currently know jack shit, and would much rather get bullied on the internet than lose all my money.*", "id": "n1ydqt", "created_utc": 1619802386.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "IMO, trying to call a top or bottom in the market is a losing game.

(There\u2019s a fine line between buying dips and trying to catch a falling knife). This is in terms of holding the stock, NOT options. If you want to mix in options, you can always hedge with SPY or QQQ puts...but again, I would wait for a confirmed correction.

The 2000 dot com meltdown which actually led to a significant bear market. The 2008 credit meltdown which was actually the second crash from the dot com bubble because the SPX was still below the 2000 high.

Pick the movers and you'll do fine, even more so if everything crashes.\n\nWhat's also needed is a plan for managing your positions should they become profitable.

As I mentioned in yesterday's post, I'm way feeling uncomfortable at 30% cash to start today's session, about 300 short delta, 1000 short vega and theta at +1200.\n\nBiggest winner was my crude oil put debit spread, which performed nicely as /CL gave up $1.40 today.  Biggest loser by far was my call debit spread in /6E (the EUR:USD future); the dollar rallied big today and this position hit me for $1200.  I'm staying in this position with 35 DTE because I believe we're going to see a bounce next week.\n\nNotable moves today:\n\nTWTR - With three strangles on with a 55 put, I was nervous at the open as the stock opened at 56, down 14%.  The IV crush outperformed the down move and my 10am CST I was +$200 on these position and skated on out.\n\nThis prolonged low VIX environment has me worried about a big down move (80% of my positions are naked) so I pulled off about $40K of buying power and moved myself to 50% cash.  \n\nI looked to roll where applicable, but the low IV means that rolling out isn't giving me the premium. So, I closed a ton of positions today.  Exceptions were FTCH, QS and TIGR.\n\nI also closed a 21 MAY 415/395 SPY put debit on today's weakness that was 21 DTE.  I've been waiting for the market \"top\" for three weeks and I need to reset my shorts. Closed my /NQ 14300/14000 call credit spread on today's NASDAQ move down to cut my losses in half before the weekend on a position I've had on since this was a 30 delta position, which feels like a LONG time ago watching this position get walloped day after day.\n\nThe only opening trade today was a naked put position in CRSR, which reports next week and has shown resilience at the 30 level; this is my third bite at this apple, and I'd be glad to own more Corsair at 30.\n\nFor next week, I'm thinking it's a down week across the equity indexes and will be looking to capitalize.  I'll be looking for new short delta exposure.  Dropped 700 theta today (now at 550) and reduced vega to -900.

{"title": "Learnings from 10 yrs. Wall St. Experience - Understanding Shareholder Behavior", "selftext": "Hey all!! There's interest so I'm moving to share the knowledge and tactics I've learned 10 years of Wall St. starting with a simple step-by-step book!\n\nMy plan is to share as much as possible. Here's a fun one to start.\n\n**Shareholder ownership as a tool. TLDR:** Shareholder lists help you anticipate how stock moves, the quality of the business, and ideas potential \"catalysts.\" And be valuation flexible!\n\nIf you are interested, I'd love to hear your [feedback here](https://forms.gle/RyycWAxNRsGZSxwTA) (2 minutes!). Here is the [outline of the book.](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) (or leave a comment!). Or get in on the [pre-sale!](https://gum.co/czkJr)\n\nThere are three major institutional groups in the markets.\n\n**1 - Passive funds.** ETFs and funds that invest based on indexes (like $SPY). They are over 50% over equity assets and likely account for most buying / selling volume day to day. They buy with inflows (people buying the fund) and buy more when stocks goes higher (market-cap weighted).\n\nSo how do you use this insight?\n\nOne is pick stocks in macro / sector flow ($XLE, $XLF, $XLRE, $XLC - top returns YTD - oil prices, rates, real estate, retail - all higher), and style flows ($IJR and $IWD - top returns YTD - small-caps, value).\n\nThe more % shares are ETF (i.e. passive), the more the stock will move with the factor / sector.\n\nSecond and very importantly, ***you must be flexible on valuation.*** When company's growth improves, the value of the company increases, so passive funds will ***buy more*** of the stock.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with $TSLA. ETFs will buy MORE as it gets bigger.\n\nUse valuation to understand the business and its upside but know that valuation is NOT a reason (alone) to buy or sell something - the majority of funds don't even look at it.\n\n**2 - Hedge funds (HF)** These funds that invest with specialized strategies (provide \"alpha\"). Well-respected names like Lone Pine / WhaleRock for growth, or value HFs like Scion (Burry), Miller, Nuance.\n\nWhen you see a HF they are stock for a reason. There could be a catalyst (\"event\") or strategic business change, or some emerging \"secular\" trend.\n\nUse them source of interesting ideas. And check 13Fs for new positions.\n\nFor example, Lone Pine is playing the new growth of $SNAP and continuous glucose monitors $DXCM. Whale Rock is is in auto travel ($UBER, $CVNA). Pura Vida is in $INOV for its strategic pivot.\n\nNow the downside is HF activity can make the stock more *volatile.* A stock like $MSCI bounced around a lot last year as HFs came in and out.\n\nThe long/short (LS) funds Citadel, Point72 and Millennium don't show up on 13Fs - but they are also very active since they crowd in and out of names with leverage (i.e borrowed money). When volatility picks up like in February / March these funds all \"de-gross\" or reduce exposure and that can be an opportunity to pick up shares sold-off hard.\n\n**3 - Long only investors (LO)** \\- These are the mutual funds that manage retail retirement assets. Companies also love them as shareholders because they usually hold for many years.\n\nRespected names are Capital, Fidelity, TRowe, JP Morgan, American.\n\nHow is this useful?\n\nUse them to help assess the business. These funds are in high-quality companies (like $SPGI) where there is less risk of blowups like fraud. Fidelity and TRowe have management teams rotating in and out to see them -where they are grilled by specialized sector research teams. They do their diligence.\n\nThe stock will likely be less volatile since LO's don't trade and may buy dips to accumulate shares.\n\nNames like Baron, Ballie Gifford, Jennison are very respected at identifying growth / innovative companies. Use them as a vote of confidence in a new company. For example, Baron and Ballie were both early to invest in $TLSA and Jennison in $ADYEN, and have both done very well.\n\n**Happy investing!!**\n\n(You can see this information in Atom Finance ownership lists. And WhaleWisdom for 13Fs.)\n\n**Link to first post (what makes stocks move, how to value a stock, factors)**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/mwvp1d/learnings\\_from\\_10\\_yrs\\_of\\_wall\\_st\\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/mwvp1d/learnings_from_10_yrs_of_wall_st_experience/)", "id": "n1im7n", "created_utc": 1619743598.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Super helpful breakdown thanks.
