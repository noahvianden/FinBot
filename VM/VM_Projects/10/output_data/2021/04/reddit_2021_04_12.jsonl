{"title": "Plays For The Upcoming Week (Apr 12-16)", "selftext": "Happy Sunday r/options!\n\nHere's another one of my posts that some of you enjoy. I've been busy the past two weeks so there wasn't a livestream to do and people to join and give me tickers to analyze, but I was finally able to go live earlier today and we had a lot of participation. So with that, here are the plays for the upcoming week that we went over.\n\nThe tickers below don't include the charts with my levels, drawings, and indicators, but if you want to go over the text with the charts you can find them in my Google Drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing). I also started incorporating gap down targets for those that want to play the downside. I hope these give you some insight into some potential plays going into this week!\n\nThis trading week should be interesting! Will we continue this momentum we've had and make new ATH's? Do you expect a pullback to cool off a bit before another run? Or maybe trade sideways? Hmmmm....\n\nRegardless, I hope you have a profitable, safe, and enjoyable week ahead! Good luck!\n\n\\-Davin\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**$MARA:** could see a good push during PM due to Bitcoin hitting new ATH over the weekend. Watch for resistance at $51 as that is the uptrend resistance (fibonacci fan). If that resistance breaks and becomes support, should be good to go for the bulls.\n\nGap Up Targets: high $52\u2019s > $53 > $55 > $57 (near ATH)\n\nGap Down targets: $48.50 > $47.50 > $46 > 44.50 (23.6% fib level)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$SQ:** Looks bearish going off Friday\u2019s AH price action on the 4 hr and looking at the daily candles price rejection from the uptrend resistance, but could potentially reverse around $260.50. Need to see price action going into Monday and the start of the week. I\u2019d pay special attention to the high $256 area as that\u2019s the resistance that we bounced down from three times in the past. Could be a strong support bounce off that if we don\u2019t lose it and have it become resistance.\n\nGap Up Targets: $262 > $264 > $266 > $268 > $273 > $276 > $284\n\nGap Down Targets: $260 > $259 > $258 > $257 > $255 (a little below the 50% fib retracement level)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$PLTR:** Looking really great after Friday. Keeping a special eye on these as I have $30 strike calls since a week or two ago and they have their Demo day coming up this Wednesday. Needs to hold the level we\u2019re at now to push off from it in the upwards direction.\n\nGap Up Targets: $24.50 > $25 (200 ema) > $25.50 > $26 > $27\n\nGap Down Targets: $23 > $22.50 area\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$AAPL:** Made really good money on these recently. Got out on Thursday to secure profit for fear of rejection at the $130-131 resistance level, low volume/profit taking on Friday and the start of the handle formation on the cup and handle pattern it\u2019s forming on the daily. That $130-131 level, however, was blown right through on Friday (lol). Kinda skeptical as to how it will play out this week, but if the momentum is there the continuation will follow. Just be careful with your entries and set your stops. It needs to hold this $132.80 area for continuation.\n\nGap Up Targets: $134 > $138\n\nGap Down Targets: $131 > $129 > $128 > $126 > $125\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$TSLA:** Really bummed about how this traded this past week. With all the news, catalysts, and price upgrades that came out recently there was no reason this shouldn\u2019t have broken above $700 and stayed above it. I think it was manipulation for big money to accumulate...Anyway, it\u2019s trading within a bull flag on the daily and 4hr chart, volume is diverging, indicators look decent, and also has earnings on the 26th so if this bull pattern plays out and we see a run up to earnings the bulls can rejoice.\n\nGap Up Targets: $688 > $700 (psych level) > $710 > $720\n\nGap Down Targets: $670 > $655 > $645 > $640 > $625\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$SNAP:** Strong trading the past week and holding above key support level at $61.63. Indicators look like they\u2019re getting towards overbought so it\u2019s a little risky, but profit is still there to be made if this momentum continues. This also has earnings coming up next week on the 22nd so there could also be a run up on this as well. Also trading within a bull flag on the 4hr chart. Decent setup to ride the momentum of continuation, but be careful of that potential handle formation if this turns out to be a cup and handle pattern it\u2019s forming (bearish after cup forms, bullish after handle forms).\n\nGap Up Targets: $64 > $65 > $66 > $67.50\n\nGap Down Targets: $61 > $60.50 > $58.60 area\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$SOS:** Saw a huge spike on this this past week, but quickly gave back those gains. Needs to hold $5.10 level to continue pushing upwards. Will continue watching this as we have July calls for $10.\n\nGap Up Targets (short term): $5.67 > $6.00 > $6.20\n\nGap Down Targets (short term): $5.10 > $4.90 > $ 4.63 > $4.22\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$T:** Bouncing off 200 EMA and uptrend/horizontal support of fibonacci levels. Indicators look AMAZING, perfect setup for a long position. The exact same setup it\u2019s at right now is my favorite setup to come across when looking for plays. We\u2019ve made over 100% gains on this setup multiple times in the Discord. Might actually look to enter these this week. If you\u2019re only looking to enter for shares, they pay good dividends as well.\n\n**AT&T IS A SLOW MOVER SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU\u2019RE PICKING STRIKES AND EXP DATES**\n\nGap Up Targets: $30.19 > $30.27 (should be close to 13 EMA at that point) > $30.36\n\nGap Down Targets: $29.95 > $29.88 (fib level) > $29.80 > $29.61\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$ABNB:** Was more than happy to go over this as I\u2019m bullish on leisure companies/plays as the economy starts to get back to normal. However, the chart looked bearish on the daily and 4hr chart. However, however, the level we\u2019re at right now we\u2019ve reversed from 4-5 times in the past already so it could be a quick scalp to the upside before seeing rejection at a resistance again and coming back down. Indicators are also starting to signal a push upwards, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do push up from this level like in the past. I wouldn\u2019t be bullish on it until we break the $182-183 area and hold it as support.\n\nGap Up Targets: $182-183 > $190-194 (where we started to reject and come down in the past)\n\nGap Down Targets: $178.40 > $175 > $171\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nDisclaimer: This information is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

{"title": "$JPM - Earnings Season Bank Robbery - Financial Sector Options Analysis & Trade Thesis", "selftext": "**$JPM - Earnings Season Bank Robbery - Financial Sector Options Analysis & Trade Thesis**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo kick off earnings season, we\u2019ve got seven of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. This week provides us with an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move extremely predictably post-earnings, allowing us to make some easy dough.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Implied Volatility during Earnings Season\n\nBecause it is earnings week, the IV on our options will be jacked to the tits as the option needs to price in any given \u201cmove\u201d that the underlying may make. In practice, this is *extremely* hard to do right, and often results in an *extremely* inflated guess, as it\u2019s calculated in relation to a whole fuckload of ever changing variables. The implied move that an option prices in around earnings is very rarely met, so if you buy options, understand that they will expire OTM 95% of the time. The other 5% of the time, you\u2019ll get IV crushed so badly that you might not even walk away with any profits, even though you called the correct move.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nArmed with this knowledge, we know that if we wish to \u201cgamble\u201d on earnings, we\u2019re best off selling the options. We may not hit any insane 10 baggers, but we\u2019re extremely likely to pocket some free money, even if the underlying doesn\u2019t move as planned.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# The Play\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t made obvious from the rundown above, we\u2019re going to be selling options going into the financial sectors\u2019 earnings season. The easiest and most consistent way to win during earnings season is to sell short strangles, and iron condors. With these strategies, we don\u2019t need to be right about the directional movement of the underlying whatsoever. We simply collect a fat upfront premium, and then buy back the spread the day after earnings have been reported at an insane discount (often 60-80% cheaper) because of IV crush.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven though the options always price in a crazy move, historically, the stocks within the financial sector tend to *move very little* after they report earnings. This makes this play extremely safe in my eyes, as there is very little risk we get blown out by an unexpected move. Furthermore, the companies in this sector are very old, consistent, and established. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that they would release something totally unexpected within their reports which would warrant a wild move, though the options still price it in anyways.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo aid us in our play, [**I\u2019ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of the Post-Earnings Moves that every single reporting bank has made for the past 20 earnings cycles**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16b_OLj9fDEyKlanro3qSeeSeNaD9XxMeyPv4NkclMN4/edit?usp=sharing). Using the spreadsheet, we can determine which options to sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for every single bank. For example, we can see that historically, on average, $JPM moves less than 2% following an earnings report, and that the largest move that $JPM has ever made post earnings was 5% to the upside. As a result, we know what if we sell a call credit spread that\u2019s 5% out of the money, we can be almost certain that it will expire out of the money by the end of the week, allowing us to pocket most, if not all of the premium. For those traders who can stomach more risk, we can look to sell short straddles on $JPM that are 2% out of the money on both ends to pocket an even larger premium, while still having a favourable risk profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it\u2019s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as *these banks report across different days*. Since 4 of the 7 banks report on Wednesday, we can use their results to \u201cpredict\u201d the direction of their peers who haven\u2019t reported yet. If the four banks are green after reporting earnings on Wednesday, the ones who report Thursday and Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.\n\n\n- As touched upon above, **$JPM moves very little after earnings**. You can likely get away with placing extremely tight strangles as a result, since you run little risk of getting blown out on either side.\n\n- **$WFC is allergic to delivering a good earnings report**. After its past 22 reports, Wells Fargo has tanked **18** times (82%). If you\u2019re going to play this ticker, you can easily get away with selling credit spreads ATM or slightly OTM, as this shit is incapable of going up.\n\n- Similar to Wells Fargo, **Citigroup either makes a small move to the upside, or gets blown out to the downside**. Slightly OTM credit spreads are the way to go if you\u2019re playing this one.\n\n- **If you\u2019re playing Blackrock, make sure your strikes are far OTM**. It\u2019s not uncommon for them to put up a 4% move post earnings. The moves are big, but the premiums are juicy. IF you plan on playing, I would look to play an iron condor, so I can have the protection if needed.\n\n- In general, if you\u2019re playing any sort of a strangle, you can safely sell any of the strikes which are outside of the highlighted maximum moves within the spreadsheet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you use the spreadsheet to choose the safest strikes, these plays are incredibly hard to fuck up. You simply sell a short strangle / iron condor / credit spread, wait for earnings to be released, and then buy it back for significantly cheaper than what you sold it for.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Gamblers Crutch\n\nSelling options is boring, because you know exactly how much money you\u2019re gonna make beforehand. If you wish to spice this play up with a little bit of *uncertainty*, consider picking up some **$XLF** Calls or Puts. XLF is made up of every single bank which is reporting earnings this week, yet since it\u2019s an ETF, it has an extremely low IV, regardless of the fact that it\u2019s gonna make some fucking *HUGE* moves since **all of it\u2019s holding report earnings this week**. The implied volatility of each bank who reports earnings this week is around 50 or 60, yet XLF, who is made up of each reporting bank, has an IV of around 20%. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAccording to historical data, around earnings season, most banks move in tandem with one another ; they\u2019re often all red, or all green. We can use this to our advantage, since half of the banks report earnings on Wednesday. Once a trend is established, we can grab some 2DTE XLF calls and bag some free gains once the rest of the banks report earnings the day after. You can also just be a degenerate and try calling a direction before the banks report all together, though this would literally be a crapshoot. Regardless, the rewards you can make by playing XLF this week are spectacular, and those who don\u2019t want to sell the options should definitely capitalize on this opportunity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nSeven of America's largest banks report earnings this week. I\u2019ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. It should be impossible to lose any of the trades you make on them, unless JPM announces that they\u2019ve invented a time machine or someshit. For those who want to slam a 10 bagger instead of securing guaranteed premium gains, consider buying calls / puts on $XLF. All of it\u2019s holding report earnings this week, yet it still only has an IV of 20%. Since banks tend to move in tandem with one another, it\u2019s either gonna pop or plunge.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 12, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 12, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mostly even on Monday, with the market taking a breather after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recorded several fresh highs last week. Looking ahead, market participants will focus on the upcoming Quarter 1 earnings report slated to be released in the next weeks. Big banks are kicking off the earnings season starting Wednesday premarket. \n\nAs earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.\n\nYear-to-date, the cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening sectors have broadly outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher last year. The first quarter of 2021 was defined by the rotation out of high-flying tech stocks and into companies poised to directly benefit from the reopening of the economy. However, now that Quarter 2 started, we are seeing the rotation back into growth and tech stocks, with mega-cap companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) driving the market to record levels. In our view, while we expect tech stocks to continue performing well, it is highly unlikely they replicate the outsized performance from 2020 and continue to look for opportunities in companies that were most affected by COVID and that are poised to benefit from the reopening of the economy. Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note \u201cThe initial reopening of the economy will trigger a huge rebound in margins across sectors which have been hit hardest by the COVID crisis. The unprecedented surge in households' cash balances over the past year \u2013 mostly due to the enforced drop in spending on services, augmented by stimulus payments \u2013 represents a potential wave of demand, while supply is constrained by business failures.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US government posted a March budget deficit of $660 billion amid the recent wave of fiscal spending, a record high for the month.\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) jumped after the company paid a record anti-trust fine, with analysts calling the fine removal of overhang. \"Positively, Alibaba does not expect further investigations on this matter, and we believe the removal of this overhang could be a positive for shares,\" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler, who rates shares of Alibaba as a strong buy, wrote in a note Monday morning. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced Monday morning that it agreed to purchase artificial intelligence speech recognition company Nuance Communications (NUAN) in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, including Nuance's debt. The announcement confirmed earlier reporting of the deal over the weekend by Bloomberg. \n* Shares of United Airlines sank after the company provided a worse-than-expected outlook for upcoming Quarter 1 earnings.\n* Gamestop (GME) is reportedly searching for a new CEO. \n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) surged more than 5% after the company raised revenue outlook for the upcoming earnings report.  \n* The virtual summit in the White House focusing on the global semiconductor shortage began today\n* Electric vehicle startup Rivian, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motor (F) said on Monday that South Korean manufacturer Samsung SDI Co Limited would supply battery cells for its vehicles.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\\*\\***\n* Alaska Air (ALK) target raised by Raymond James from $65 to $85 at Strong-Buy.

Ideally, for me, I want to roll before ITM, it gives me more options for my exit strategy. It would be hard to do this close to expiry because there is not much time to correct my postion. Ideally, you want to roll to the next expiry date for a credit. You don't want to roll too far into the future because that gives you less opportunities to correct your position. Every situation is different. This is why I only trade weeklies with good vol/OI. Liquidity matters and if there is none you might not be able to roll or correct your position.
