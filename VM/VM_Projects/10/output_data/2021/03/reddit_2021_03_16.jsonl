{"title": "Optimizing a put ratio spread as a tail hedge", "selftext": "There are a few good threads on this sub about Spitznegal/Taleb at Univera and links like [http://greyenlightenment.com/tail-hedging-part-2/](http://greyenlightenment.com/tail-hedging-part-2/) and [https://blog.thinknewfound.com/2020/06/tail-hedging/](https://blog.thinknewfound.com/2020/06/tail-hedging/)\n\nI have a few ideas on optimizing a put ratio backspread as a portfolio tail hedge and wanted to ask more experienced people here their opinions on how I could improve this or if another approach makes more sense.\n\nI'm currently planning on buying 30% OTM puts with a ratio of 3:1 and selling a higher strike put so that I'm at breakeven or a slight credit if the market grinds upwards. An example of what I currently have on Long 3x ES Jun18 2700p, and Short 1 ES Jun18 3310p you can see the P&L in the chart below, along with vega and theta. X axis is SPX, dotted line is current day, solid line is at expiration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipfe7pgnhcn61.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8b8a5484e40cd40dd9467059c95267f92b1082\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na3ipsgnhcn61.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd8b712fb8e3d32d2e6abc1806c4d61b74c2318\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9s02tgnhcn61.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=70864f7412fd8d4e88b19a5cf45de0c4e72a3021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis basically means I'm super long volatility with SPX at 2,700, but the entire vol surface should lift if we get down to that price in a quick manner (a slow grind would be one way to lose money on this strategy). My platform doesn't model P&L at different IV, but I've used another calculator to double-check increased IV across the vol surface brings profitability up as the vega chart above would suggest.\n\nInitially I was going with buying -.01 Deltas and Selling -.1 Deltas at a similar 3:1 ratio but with 90DTE and rolling at 30DTE, but decided to try a little longer expiration for my current hedge (120DTE)\n\n1) Does the term structure of ES being in contango or backwardization have a meaningful effect on ES options vs SPX options as a hedge? Seems like that slight drag downward would best be avoided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlj72jluhcn61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd3ff8109637cfde0bcf0a9a649c6a56ef4d54e\n\n2) Since the idea is to essentially get very long vega at these low strikes, I've been looking at 1:3 ratios instead of the classic 1:2 for this ratio spread. Any suggestions on other ratios, or are there any drawbacks for using 1:3?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) In terms of expirations, I've seen people mention anywhere from initiations from 120-90DTE, and rolling anywhere from 30-15DTE. Given the included chart of time value below, I would think shorter expirations and more frequent rolling would have less time value decay on the long leg. Calendars come to mind as a possibility as well to get the short leg decaying faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmofuakxhcn61.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb54b7c31cb189949e6910132d12661a2c2300f3\n\n4) Tax implications. ES and SPX are both 1256 so I'm not worried about that, but it does seem like it would be better if I could run this strategy in an IRA (which I believe should be possible since its not unlimited loss if I run it as a small debit) in which case SPY options would be the way to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) I've heard of people using ES options for spreads since the margin requirements are based on futures and end up being lower than they would for SPX options. Any thoughts on this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) Since people buy protective puts on indices and tend to write covered calls on single stocks, the skew is quite different. I was wondering about taking a flatter vol smile stock which is highly correlated (HON for example, although you could use AAPL because its so liquid) and running the strategy there instead of the index. Obviously the risks are there it might not properly hedge my long portfolio, but seems the less skew would make it cheaper to put on. I'm not sure if this is a dead end idea, or an optimization which isn't really worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21bckiuzhcn61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=22245112e4a0c14db9b58be56c362379ef16b161\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6li9luzhcn61.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc7b6e9dedd45dccdbce4101bba7e74e3cc8a5d0", "id": "m63sa9", "created_utc": 1615880919.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "What I do is buy LEAPs instead of medium-term puts, and sell medium-term spread to fund that.

On second thought, your setup works vs. the latter two as well, so yes, compared to your setup, protects against Japan-style collapse.\n\nIn March 2020 selloff, the long term portion of the hedge is up a lot (volatility is through the roof), but drops back as market recovers. I had a somewhat different setup back then much fewer LEAPS, as I had bonds at that time (about 20% of my portfolio) as a hedge. I decided to go to 0% bonds late last year since I didn't think they were good to hold in new environment, which means I had to vastly increase my put LEAP hedge to stay protected against long term downturn, otherwise going all equities would've been too scary for me, even with the good expected value vs. bonds.\n\nYou are right regarding assumption. One addition is that like with bonds, I'll likely sell a part (not majority though) of my hedge if market drops to keep \"allocation\" healthy (think stock-bond balance in traditional portfolio, but instead of 20% bonds I have \\~2% put LEAPs) and benefit in recovery if any (in March 2020 I did it with bonds, did not touch the few LEAPs I had. Maybe I should've but probably not, who could be sure it'd recover completely?). But mostly my LEAPs will keep losing value as long as the market recovers.\n\nI don't roll LEAPs (in up trending market as we had, we had no other), as I buy them at 50-70% strike price to begin with, so they become pretty worthless when they get to medium duration, not worth the commission to sell. They've let me be more aggressive elsewhere though, they've done their job. I just buy new ones to have the amount of protection I want, 1.5-3 years out so I don't pay much theta. They lose value if market moves up, but that's OK, everything else is green then, so I can throw a bit more money into the LEAP hedge, I'm making more on just the spreads.\n\nMy credit spreads I do roll to keep my duration and delta distribution near enough to the target. Those have higher strike price than LEAPs, so get affect by market movement more. And more theta decay due to shorter duration.

You might consider staggering the strikes to keep the spread a little narrower. Look at the P&L graph for a 1x3 where you (and I'm making up numbers) sell the 3310P for $5, buy 2 2760P for $2 each, and then buy 1 2650P for $1.

Also, I felt that was a sweet spot for balancing theta decay against the risk.\n\nBe really careful about calendarizing this. The delta and gamma differences of the out months where you are long are tricky to get right. I never could. It's too easy for your short to swamp the longs if there's too much time spread between them, so then you narrow it. Then it's so narrow it doesn't make sense to keep because you can only roll it once or twice. Again, I couldn't ever get this right.\n\n6. Use high beta stock instead of index?\n\nAAPL is probably the only real choice for you. I bet it would work nicely. Liquidity and spreads are pretty tight too.

Your point about not pinning strikes is a good one, thanks.  I'm going to look into spreading them out a bit per your suggestion since the general idea is to get super long volatility at lower strikes but obviously I can't be too specific to where that is.  Since the gamble is a lift of the entire volatility surface in the event of a significant selloff, it makes more sense to be spread out a bit more than my current setup.\n\n3.  Yeah I was a bit worried about calendarizing this.  I was thinking since volatility is generally mean reverting I might lose more on the short side and not make up for it enough on the long side since the further out longs wouldn't be as sensitive.  It seemed like making it a calendar was shuffling around risk to places I didn't necessarily want (volatility correlating highly between expirations) instead of reducing it. I haven't actually looked into it yet though, but I definitely will in order to better understand what you mean about the delta/gamma differences since this seems important.\n\n6. I agree AAPL is probably the only real choice. HON has a high correlation but is too thin really.  The main issue with AAPL is not getting 1256 contract tax treatment.  Calculating the post-tax net outcome between a flatter volatility skew hedge with higher taxes, and a lower tax higher skew index hedge in the event of a tail event seems like comparing apples to oranges and would require so many assumptions to be baked in I could easily fool myself.

Here is my .02. If you are trying to implement a Talebian style trade here you are on well your way. The key to this is to begin to put these positions on when you feel skew is flatter than it should be. For example, if you are selling 20% otm and buying ratio 30% out of the money what is the normal skew differential between those two levels at differing underlying prices and diff dte\u2019s.  The flatter the skew the cheaper tighter ratio put spreads become. \n\nIdeally this trade benefits from vol spikes on market drops and if the market craters you benefit from from being long the extra ratio puts. \n\nAs for time frames to put this on in- sweep the entire curve if you can whenever you see skew is too flat vs what your analysis or guy says it should be.  In any time frame, if that looks like 90dte execute some portion there if it\u2019s longer consider deploying some % of the portfolio there.  \n\nThis style of trading as a money making venture or portfolio hedge is like insurance: it give up many, many small premiums for a while in return for those shock down moves that spike vol. \n\nFor sure roll out of positions as they near expiry to remove pin risk unless you feel it\u2019s so far OTM or ITM it doesn\u2019t matter.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That's a really good point about monitoring skew to opportunistically put this hedge on, thank you for the suggestion, it makes a ton of sense to do it that way.\n\nCounter intuitively to that, I've seen a fair bit of research suggesting steeper skew is predictive of price, although I believe the research is regarding individual equities and due to predicting earnings surprises so probably doesn't apply to indices.  I should look at some historical data for flat skew periods in addition to skew prior to market declines, although I haven't noticed anything obvious using CBOE's SKEW Index.\n\nSo from a practical perspective of monitoring skew, it seems like the simplest implementation would be eyeballing the volatility surface and seeing what's flat.  Of course implementing actual measurements of skew and alerts at certain standard deviations would be much better.  The skew idea seems kind of related to my idea above of putting the trade on AAPL just because its liquid, correlates roughly to the SP500 and has a much flatter skew, although of course you're losing a lot of correlation compared to index options.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on the approximate frequently flatter periods of skew exist where you would look to put this on?  I know I could adjust to my own preference, but I'm curious how often flat periods of skew exist where you would personally look to put this kind of hedge on.

About 3 years in I started splitting my time between home and Starbucks's.\n* However, SBUX sucks for extended WFH and the vibe sucks. Traditional offices are gross and stuffy.\n* Coworking spaces are generally better and WeWork is easily the best, albeit expensive. Proof? Go to Santa Monica. I toured 10 coworking spaces in SM a few years ago and they all were TERRIBLE except for 3- WeWork, ROC, and this spot Obama spoke at once. I chose ROC. They evicted all their tenants after not paying their sublease bill.\n* Most WFHers have started to experience this kind of fatigue, but I think they're still early on the fatigue and we'll see that more.\n* If post-pandemic, we see a net bump in permanent WFH and remote workers, there will be a greater need for good coworking spaces. And WeWork wins. Especially if most of these permanent WFHers are not in the same city as their employer, where WeWork gets their customers in company hubs in multiple cities.\n* If post-pandemic, we instead see any net increase WFH coming from people living in the city, aka partial WFH, they'll probably just come into the office to get out of the house instead of a coworking space.\n\nSo (more responsible WeWork + to-be-seen WFH fatigue) \\* (probability of post-pandemic WFH) = buy\n\nNo clue about the specifics of these numbers or evidence that WeWork got their head out their ass.\n\nLooking for discussion.", "id": "m6g92e", "created_utc": 1615920506.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Model Y Pricing in Canada Makes Absolutely No Sense", "selftext": "A week or two ago there was some discussion amongst Canadians on the r/teslamotors subreddit about how Tesla's pricing really didn't add up in the great white north. The general consensus was that Tesla simply hadn't adjusted their Canadian pricing for so long that the currency difference had made it quite a bit more expensive for us igloo-dwellers to get our hands on a Tesla compared to the US.\n\nSo today I decided to dig in to it all a little bit more and also reach out to Tesla to see what they had to say about it. Unfortunately for myself and my fellow Canadians, the outlook doesn't seem too bright.\n\nSo let's start off with some base starting MSRPs for the Model Y and other vehicles in the segment (I have excluded the Volkswagen ID.4 since it has no announced Canadian pricing):\n\n|Vehicle|Starting MSRP in the USA (USD)|Starting MSRP in the USA (converted to CAD)|Starting MSRP in Canada (CAD)|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021 Mustang Mach-E|$42,895|\\~$53,509|$50,459|**- $3,050 (\\~6%)**|\n|2021 Hyundai Kona electric|$37,390|\\~$46,639|$44,999|**- $1,640 (\\~4%)**|\n|2021 Kia Niro EV|$39,090|\\~$48,759|$44,955|**- $3,804 (\\~8%)**|\n|2021 Jaguar I-PACE|$69,850|\\~$87,174|$91,000|**+ $3,826 (\\~4%)**|\n|2021 Audi e-tron|$65,900|\\~$82,244|$85,600|**+ $3,356 (\\~4%)**|\n|2021 Tesla Model Y|$49,990|\\~$62,356|$69,990|**+ $7,634 (\\~12%)**|\n\nNotice anything a little off there? Yeah, the Model Y is quite far off even from the luxury brands' offerings. So let's get an answer straight from the horse's mouth (metaphorically, of course) on why this is! This was the response directly from an \"Inside Tesla Advisor\" that I was emailing today.\n\n>The markets in Canada are indeed different from the markets in the US and Tesla has different prices for different products all around the world. This is a common theme among multinational companies.\n\nSo there you have it. Charging a 12% premium to Canadians is a \"common theme\"... wait a minute, no it isn't.\n\nBut wait! None of the vehicles I listed are really direct competitors, right? I mean I picked the cheapest Mustang Mach-E, the Kona/Niro are much slower with less range, and the I-PACE/e-tron are quite a bit more expensive. So let's look at a more apples-to-apples comparison, shall we?\n\n|Vehicle|Starting MSRP in the USA (USD)|Starting MSRP in the USA (converted to CAD)|Starting MSRP in Canada (CAD)|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021 Mustang Mach-E Premium, Extended Range AWD|$54,700|\\~$68,267|$69,245|**+ $978 (\\~1%)**|\n|2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD|$49,990|\\~$62,356|$69,990|**+ $7,634 (\\~12%)**|\n\nWell... looks like it isn't quite as \"common\" of a theme as Tesla seems to think. Now don't get me wrong, the Model Y still has a lot to offer at that price point compared to the Mach-E. If you'll entertain me, join me for a moment of daydreaming and thinking of Tesla selling the Model Y at almost $7,000 less than a comparable Mach-E. Yeah, that would be nice.\n\nAnyways, that was my fun for today. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.\n\nEDIT - In response to some comments mentioning regulatory credits, dealership involvement, Canada being too small a market, and/or Tesla just outright not doing price corrections in Canada I present the following:\n\n|Date|Vehicle|Starting MSRP in the USA (USD)|Starting MSRP in the USA (converted to CAD with exchange rate for given date)|Starting MSRP in Canada (CAD)|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|July 10, 2020|2020 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD|$52,990|\\~$72,040 (1.3595)|$75,990|**+ $3,950 (\\~5%)**|\n|July 11, 2020 (big price drop when SR was \"cancelled\")|2020 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD|$49,990|\\~$67,926 (1.3588)|$69,990|**+ $2,064 (\\~3%)**|\n|January 7, 2021 (when the SR was un-cancelled)|2021 Tesla Model Y Standard Range RWD|$41,990|\\~$53,260 (1.2684)|$56,290|**+ $3,030 (\\~5%)**|\n|March 15, 2021|2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD|$49,990|\\~$62,356 (1.2473)|$69,990|**+ $7,634 (\\~12%)**|\n\nRegulatory credits have been a thing during the entire time period shown, I am comparing MSRP of only Tesla vehicles (so no dealer playing around with prices), Canada is a larger market today than it was at the beginning of the time period shown, and Tesla has been supply constrained this whole time as well.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Model Y Long Range AWD in Canada hasn't had a price update since July 11, 2020 and, as you can see, the exchange rate has changed drastically during that time.

While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.\n\nShares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock\u2019s one-year low of $2.57.\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron\u2019s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.\n\nDusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.\n\n\u201cGME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,\u201d Dusaniwsky added.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop\u2019s parabolic ascent.\nGameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.\n\nI would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future.

{"title": "DD on Vonage Holding Corp (VG)", "selftext": "*Intro:*\nVonage is a communications company offering voice, messaging, video and data capabilities across unified communications, contact centers and API\u2019s.    The company was started in 1998 with a focus in VoIP,  and IPO\u2019d in 2006.     \n\nCurrently, VG is in the process of transforming from the legacy consumer communications business to a CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service) company. \n \nPrior to 2020 CPaaS sector was growing as companies focused on digital transformation and omni-channel customer engagement.   The pandemic further accelerated this trend with the need for enterprise communication tools to manage remote work. \n \nVG is not best of breed in its industry and does not have any unique functionality that leads me to believe it will substantially eat into the market share of the industry leaders.  However, the CPaaS total addressable market is growing rapidly so there is room for VG to grow, nonetheless.  \n \nAvg daily volume 3.68m on 249 million shares outstanding with 97% owned by institutions.\n \n*Competitors:*\nTicker/Market Cap/FY20 Rev/FY20 Grwth/ P/S\n\nTWLO / 65b / 1.76b / 55% / 31.2\n\nRNG   / 31b / 1.1b    / 31%./ 26.1\n\nBAND / 3.2b /343m / 49% /  9.1\n\nVG     /3.1b /1.25b.  / 6%  /   2.4\n\n*I only picked standalone competitors but it is worth noting Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and other big players have offerings or are working on offerings in this space.\n \n*The case for VG:*\nAs you can see above, the headline growth number for VG is ugly compared to other CPaaS players and the valuation on a P/S basis reflects that fact.   VG revenue compares favorably to Ring Central but has just one tenth the market cap at present.   Simply put, VG is not valued as a growth CPaaS company at present, but when you break down the earnings report, I believe there is a case to be made that it should.  VG has two main segments the legacy consumer segment and the VCP (communications platform). \n \nLegacy consumer segment revenues were 333 million for FY20, a decrease of 14% yoy and is expected to continue decline over the next few years.   VG thoroughly investigated selling this segment but has opted against it.  This business is profitable, and the cash generation will help to fund continued investment into their new offerings.  Nonetheless, the decline in this segment is a drag on earnings.\n \nLooking at the VCP segment is a different picture altogether.   FY2020 for VCP revenues were 856m, a 19% increase.  Further, the VCP API segment, the highest value segment grew at 33% and is expected to grow 34-36% in 1Q21.   Overall VCP segment revenue grew to 76% of total revenue from 70% prior year.   The CPaaS business is clearly becoming the dominant business within VG and is much healthier than the headline numbers would indicate.   Additionally, VG has been working on operational efficiencies to reduce expenses while investing in their new offerings.  \n \nI believe VG is due to be revalued as a CPaaS company,  with a higher P/S multiple than it currently has.   VG management agrees, and this quarter they have started to report earnings in a way that highlights the strength of the VCP business.  Management also noted they will be focusing on driving Rule of 40 metrics (revenue growth + margin &amp;gt; 40) which is a common measure for SaaS companies.\n \nFY21 VCP segment revenues are projected at just over 1b alone and total VG revenues expected 1.32b.   Discounting the entire legacy business, a P/s of 5 on 2021 VCP revenues alone would be a 40% increase from current prices. \n \n8Risk:*\nThe primary risk is execution risk as VG builds out its newer business.  Margins are currently below industry SaaS and CPaaS leaders and management needs to continue to manage expenses while growing the business. \n\nMorgan Stanley and JP Morgan are both neutral and of the opinion that this story may take multiple quarters to play out but are encouraged by the plan.     Avg Price target is $15.36 by 15 analysts (6 strong buy, 4 buy, 5 hold).\n \nThis is a space with tons of new competition and missteps could result in a lagging position that is difficult to rebound from.\n \n*My Plan:*\nAs this is a turnaround / transformation play, I do not expect out/under performance without VG specific news or earnings reports.   8/20 13c $1.45 would allow me to capture 2 earnings reports to see confirmation or rejection of my thesis with minimal risk.  \n \nLet me know what you all think!\n\nTLDR: Vonage is a CPaaS company priced like a more like traditional telecom due to its declining legacy business.
