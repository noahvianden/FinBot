{"title": "$f Ford how the options market can possibly make you a lot of money. $Rkt level of movement? probably not but still some solid gains coming up in the next 3 weeks open 3/19 call options are very BULLISH", "selftext": "My thesis ( I am not a financial advisor) is follow the options\u00a0market this is how I found RKT! Options are how $tsla kept skyrocketing deep OTM calls slowly getting pushed into the money by delta hedging. This happened with $gme and today with $rkt as well! This is how you would have found other meme stocks with huge potential follow the options!... When calls are very cheap and there are thousands of them expect BIG moves in the stock for SMALL PRICES since options are very leveraged especially deep OTM calls. Also be very mindful of Call/verse put ratios. For ford the calls greatly outright the puts but that's only half the story. The puts that are there are for strikes OUT of the money meaning they are getting weaker and weaker as we get higher and higher!\n\nThe $12.50 calls are now in the money as of today and creeping up to the $13 calls once we pass the $13 there is no coming back down IMO! [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F) 16,000+ $13 calls moving ever so close to being in the money giving more gamma to squeeze for this week 3/5 and then next week another 5000+ ... that\u2019s just the contracts for the next two weeks. If you dig deeper the number get insane. 3/19 is also another massive call option day and helps push the gamma squeeze.\n\nTo put it into perspective. Today the 3/5 $13 calls started out a .03 cents!!! They got up as high as .18 you literally could have made 6x your money buying the bottom and selling the top and it didn\u2019t even matter if the stock hits $13 by this Friday. Of course no one is that perfect at timing it but hey even if you bought at .05 and sold at .10 double the money in a few hours... or attempt to hold and reach $13 by Friday is very possible so many ways to play the Ford rally!\n\nMy Position I thought you'd never ask. 2200 shares 12.50c 3/5 , 13c 3/5 , 8c 6/8\n\nCall options give great insight into bull/bear movement. Remember last week went everything was RED besides Meme stocks?. Ford was down too but very very small % like 2-3% most things were down 10% and then today $Ford skyrocketed up a lot harder than other because it has lots of call options gamma effecting the price. There are almost no puts negatively effect the price. Look at the puts! Almost nothing in the money and the further we get away from $11 and $12 the less those ones effect the price! People were BUYING more calls correctly during that massive RED sell off day last week. Cheaper calls help rocket the stock back up!\n\nDo some research don\u2019t take my word for it. but I\u2019m in ford!\u00a0\n\nPS $f also number #1 traded /popular stock on robinhood several days in a row.\n\nEdit my \u201cexit plan\u201d I let the call options ride until expiration date generally unless something dramatically changed with the company. Today we saw a drop down to about 12.20 ... I haven\u2019t sold a single $13 3/5 contract. I\u2019m not scared losing it. Markets go up and down. I believe the data shows promise for $13+ and actually bought some $12.50 and $13 3/12 on this dips.

I'm DK.\n\nToday's  stocks market have ups and downs, open high and go low, the three major indexes all have the desire to catch up, but they were finally dried down.\n\nRecently, my friends who hold positions in technology stocks do not know if they are all right. DK is going to give everyone a heart massage, because DK still depends on how much technology, especially the enterprises with good performance \"master core technology\". The future must be dominated by big technology, and technology enterprises will continue to obtain low-cost funds from the market to expand their technical barriers so as to make more profits.\n\nToday, Wood is crazy to increase the position of the day, DK calculated for you, Wood today increased a total of **120 stocks**, reduced the position of **15 stocks**. Let's take a look at the market capitalization of ARK's overall position today.\n\n[The data comes from the ArkTracker App, Google play link at the end of the article.](https://preview.redd.it/vufw03rmtrk61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=89cda8b56d8d1dd74c4346f4a3704ee4b4ad141f)\n\nWood made a big increase in **$one (AONE)$** and **$Zoom (ZM)$** today.\n\n[The data comes from the ArkTracker App, Google play link at the end of the article.](https://preview.redd.it/32676xl5urk61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=420ddba3bd29426937fad8fe3485729fac343e26)\n\n**$one (AONE)$** mentioned in the article when Wood established its position that, as a shell company, it announced a merger with Markforged on February 24th. Markforged is a manufacturer engaged in 3D printing of metal and carbon fiber. Markforged was founded in 2013 to create a set of artificial intelligence AI-driven 3D printing platform Digital Forge, to address key vertical areas of professional applications (including industrial automation, aerospace, military and defense, space exploration, health and medical, automotive) to provide value to customers. The platform seamlessly combines accurate and reliable 3D printers with industrial-grade materials and cloud-based machine learning software to create a more flexible and agile supply chain for modern manufacturers while saving time and cost. So friends who are optimistic about the direction of 3D printing can keep a close eye on the dynamics of **$one (AONE)$**.\n\nI believe that friends who often follow DK may have hit the bottom of **$one (AONE)$**, and we followed in the footsteps of Sister Wood to get on the earliest bus.\n\n**ARK position reduction:**\n\n[The data comes from the ArkTracker App, Google play link at the end of the article.](https://preview.redd.it/y1yy0vhjurk61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c9d54b5aead4353a2d0ceec1c49f1c7609583a1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ARK ETFs Holdings Position:**\n\n[The data comes from the ArkTracker App, Google play link at the end of the article.](https://preview.redd.it/iyzzc5guvrk61.png?width=5400&format=png&auto=webp&s=45fba396d2fa04a6bf4363e9fadba12091a63502)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Click me to get ARK Tracker on Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fintech.track.ark&referrer=utm_source%3Dreddit)\n\n**The IOS version is expected to be released next week.**", "id": "lwow2w", "created_utc": 1614759745.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Nothing says \"I know what I'm talking about\" like talking in the third-person", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10070182383060455}, {"body": "Feels like someone's getting paid to advertise", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1571369171142578}, {"body": "When this comes to IOS I will certainly be getting it, thanks for sharing!

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IRWD) has one product on the market -- Linzess, which treats irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Right now, researching what other conditions that drug might successfully treat is the company's primary focus. At present, Linzess is the leading treatment for IBS, with a market share of nearly 40%. That's more than enough to keep Ironwood profitable in the near term, but management isn't predicting rapid revenue growth anytime soon. \n\nIronwood is trading at a low multiple for a few reasons. The first is that its quarterly revenue and earnings have been shrinking slightly year-over-year as a result of weaker-than-expected sales during the pandemic. The second is that its pipeline is looking rather thin after management opted to discontinue a pair of lackluster clinical programs. In summary, the market may be underestimating the company's future earnings prospects by overreacting to the loss of the canceled programs and economic headwinds. New programs based on Linzess are likely to be initiated soon, and those programs may well succeed where the others failed, potentially allowing it to steal market share from over the counter (OTC) drugs that serve the same role. Keep an eye on this company to see whether its next few earnings reports send the price upward, or whether its scarcity of new pipeline drug candidates and relatively slow revenue growth prove to be a drag.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: IRWD) is a GI-focused healthcare company dedicated to creating medicines that make a difference for patients living with GI diseases.

Options are how $tsla kept skyrocketing deep OTM calls slowly getting pushed into the money by delta hedging. This happened with $gme and today with $rkt as well! This is how you would have found Gamestop $GME... When calls are very cheap and there are thousands of them expect BIG moves in the stock for SMALL PRICES since options are very leveraged especially deep OTM calls. Also be very mindful of Call/verse put ratios. For ford the calls greatly outright the puts but that's only half the story. The puts that are there are for strikes OUT of the money meaning they are getting weaker and weaker as we get higher and higher! \n\nThe $12.50 calls are now in the money as of today and creeping up to the $13 calls once we pass the $13 there is no coming back down IMO! [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F) 16,000+ $13 calls moving ever so close to being in the money giving more gamma to squeeze for this week 3/5 and then next week another 5000+ ... that\u2019s just the contracts for the next two weeks. If you dig deeper the number get insane. 3/19 is also another massive call option day and helps push the gamma squeeze.\n\nTo put it into perspective. Today the 3/5 $13 calls started out a .03 cents!!! They got up as high as .18 you literally could have made 6x your money buying the bottom and selling the top and it didn\u2019t even matter if the stock hits $13 by this Friday. Of course no one is that perfect at timing it but hey even if you bought at .05 and sold at .10 double the money in a few hours... or attempt to hold and reach $13 by Friday is very possible so many ways to play the Ford rally!\n\nMy Position I thought you'd never ask.  2200 shares 12.50c 3/5 , 13c 3/5 , 8c 6/8\n\nCall options give great insight into bull/bear movement. Remember last week went everything was RED besides GME and AMC?. Ford was down too but very very small % like 2-3% most things were down 10% and then today $Ford skyrocketed up a lot harder than other because it has lots of call options gamma effecting the price. There are almost no puts negatively effect the price. Look at the puts! Almost nothing in the money and the further we get away from $11 and $12 the less those ones effect the price! People were BUYING more calls correctly during that massive RED sell off day last week. Cheaper calls help rocket the stock back up!\n\nDo some research don\u2019t take my word for it. but I\u2019m in ford!\u00a0\n\nPS $f also number #1 traded /popular stock on robinhood several days in a row.\n\nHere\u2019s a great technical DD posted a few weeks back for those interested in that\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/lcaepi/ford\\_vs\\_ferrari\\_part\\_1\\_greasing\\_the\\_wheels/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/lcaepi/ford_vs_ferrari_part_1_greasing_the_wheels/)", "id": "lwnbib", "created_utc": 1614753483.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "IDK man 16000 calls is only 1.6m shares.

So let's dive in...\n\n# Basics\n\n**Company:** Kinross Gold Corporation\n\n**HQ:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\n**Industry:** Gold and silver mining\n\n**Exchange:** NYSE\n\n**Ticker:** KGC vs. NEM (Newmont Corporation)\n\n**Price:** $6.39 vs. $56.14 \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Market Cap:** 7.95B vs. 44.29B \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Avg Trading Volume:** 19.5M vs. 6.24M \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Short % of Shares Outstanding:** 1.19% vs. 1.00% \\[3\\]\\[4\\]\n\n**Institutional Shares:** 67.4% vs. 84.11% \\[3\\]\\[4\\]\n\n**12 Month Price Change:** 56.6% vs. -5.8% \\[5\\]\\[6\\]\n\n**PE Ratio:** 5.99 vs. 15.76 \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**P/B Ratio:** 1.22 vs. 1.96 \\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n**P/S Ratio:** 1.93 vs. 3.95 \\[9\\]\\[10\\]\n\n**3 Year Net Income Growth:** 5788.14% vs. 729.61% \\[11\\]\\[12\\]\n\n**Projected Revenue:** $4.6B vs. $13.5B \\[13\\]\\[14\\]\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.29 vs. 0.26 \\[15\\]\\[16\\]\n\n**Industry Average Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.01 \\[17\\]\n\n**ESG Risk Rating:** 30.5 vs. 25.5 \\[18\\]\\[19\\]\n\n## Bearish Arguments\n\n**Head to Head:**\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 0.19% in short % of shares outstanding.\u00a0\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 16.71% in shares held by institutions.\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 0.03 in debt to equity ratio.\u00a0\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 5 in ESG risk rating\n\n**Company/Stock:**\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's debt to equity ratio is significantly higher than the metal mining industry's average debt to equity ratio. This could be explained by the sharp increase in production (linked to gold prices appreciating) and choosing to take on debt to finance operations \\[15\\]\\[17\\]\\[20\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's share price has dropped 29.5% in the last 6 months \\[5\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs very poorly among its competitors for its carbon footprint \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs poorly among its competitors for its water conservation \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Share price is below 20 and 200 MA (bearish signal for some, bullish for others).\n\n**Market:**\n\n\\- Gold price decreased by 10% in the past 6 months and 5% in the past 30 days \\[20\\].\n\n\\- In 2020, global gold production fell by 5.2%. In 2019, global gold production fell by 1% (first time since 2008) \\[24\\].\n\n\\- *\"Based on known reserves, estimates suggest that gold mining could reach the point of being economically unsustainable by 2050, though new vein discoveries will likely push that date back somewhat.\" \"...It is unlikely that large-scale gold mining will continue past 2075 without either huge mining technology advances or the discovery of currently unknown massive gold deposits\"* \\[22\\].\n\n\\- *\"Gold mining can significantly alter the natural environment. For example, gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity.\"*\u00a0 \\[23\\].\n\n## Bullish Arguments\n\n**Head to Head:**\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 62.4% in 12 month price change.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 9.77 in PE ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 0.74 in P/B ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 2.02 in P/S ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 5,058.5% in 3 year net income growth.\n\n**Company/Stock:**\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's projected revenue of $4.6B for 2021 is 2.4x higher than current total debt of $4.2B and has the potential to decrease the company's debt to equity ratio, moving it closer to the industry's average \\[13\\]\\[15\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has seen significant gains in net income in the past 3 years, growing by 5788.14% \\[11\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's share price has grown 56.6% in the last 12 months \\[5\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's stock has a low short % of shares (1.19%) outstanding with a high % of shares held by institutional investors (67.4%) \\[3\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold announced in September 2020 that the dividend would be reinstated. Management has displayed confidence in the near- to mid-term by restarted dividend payments. Based on current production projections, the payments are expected to continue until 2023 \\[25\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's updates on development projects, exploration and mineral reserves, and resources show successful signs of progress with no delays. The company reported extensions of mine life at several sites as well as an expansion of mineral reserves \\[27\\].\u00a0\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has an EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years \\[28\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold is JP Morgan's \u2018top pick in the gold sector,\u2019 rated as Overweight (i.e., a Buy) \\[29\\].\u00a0\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has beaten analysts earning estimates the last 4 quarters \\[30\\].\n\n\\- Average analyst recommendation rating is a Buy with an average analyst price target at $12,08 \\[13\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold is a top performer among its competitors for its pollution prevention, workplace health and safety, and diversity of corporate leadership \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs well among its competitors for its employee satisfaction and pay and corporate governance \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has shared new plans and renewed commitment to decrease carbon footprint and water conservation \\[31\\]\\[32\\]\u00a0\n\n**Market:**\n\n\\- Investing in a growing gold company can act as leverage to the price of gold. When gold appreciates, gold mining companies can increase their production and grow revenues. The price of gold has increased substantially by 561% over the past 20 years, 36% in the past 5 years, and 5.8% in the last 12 months. This has provided smaller mining companies like Kinross with the leverage they need to grow their sales \\[11\\]\\[20\\].\n\n\\- There's a general weak US dollar outlook, especially once COVID worries subside. Gold is a good hedge against inflation when the value of the dollar falls \\[33\\].\n\n\\- 7.5% of worldwide demand for gold comes from the consumer technology industry. As the industry grows, demand for gold will grow with it, driving up the price. Consumer technology is projected to generate $2.06 trillion in 2023, compared to $1.69 trillion in 2019 \\[34\\]\\[35\\].\n\n\\- Gold is widely regarded as a good hedge against economic turbulence and uncertainty, and is therefore considered a recession-proof investment.\n\n\\- Global gold production is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 \\[36\\].\n\n## Sources\n\n\\[1\\]

{"title": "Sick and Tired of RH | Money Transfers are a Massive Hassle | Brokerage Switch", "selftext": "Posted this on r/RobinHood but it got deleted by the automods instantly, so posting on here.\n\nLet's first start off with a quick recap of what happened the past few days\n\n1. On February 23rd, I requested a deposit of $1,000 into my RobinHood account. I didn't get an instant deposit of $1,000 right away. The $1,000 was deposited at pre-market the next day (February 24th), and I got a notification saying that the deposit is \"complete\" and that I am \"now using $1,000\" of my instant deposit limit.. This is great news. I'm glad that deposit was loaded into my buying power.\n2. On February 24th, towards 3 PM EST, I requested a deposit\u00a0of $1,000 again into my RobinHood account. Again, I didn't get an instant deposit of $1,000 right after. So I figured that it would be like the previous case and just get added to my account at pre-market. The next day comes by, and I get a notification saying that the deposit is \"complete\" and that I am \"now using $0.00\" of my instant deposit limit. I checked my buying power the next and quickly found that the $1,000 wasn't added into my buying power.\n3. Keep in mind that on both of these days, I sold off some big positions to buy back into other positions that were tanking hard. So any purchases here were not with the $1,000 deposit because I never got that. They were instead funded through the cash returned from selling other equities.\n4. I reached out to the support team here, and from what I understood from the representative, it seems like the instant deposit of the second transaction was used to fill in the price of the first transaction instead of that first transaction waiting for 5 days. So with that assumption, I figured that now I had to wait 5 days for this transaction to go through and then I'd see the $1,000 come in.\n5. Till now, nothing has been added into my buying power, and it's been 5 business days since I've requested it. I did notice something strange over the weekend that on late Sunday midnight-ish (EST time), my portfolio said that I was up $700 on the daily chart, which I have no clue how that was. I first thought it was a glitch, but it persisted throughout the day, and at this point, I have no clue if it's accurate or not. I also thought that it might've been the $1,000 getting dumped into my equities, but I totally doubt that since it was over the weekend and I don't think I've even set up recurring investments.\n\nSo here I am going back and forth with the RH support team, and here's what I've collected:\n\n1. It takes up to 5 days for the transaction to be added into buying power\n2. Even if the bank fully processes the transaction, it may still be delayed in showing in my RH buying power up to the 5 day mark.\n3. If there's any pending deposits, those get filled using the instant deposit of subsequent transfers\n   1. i.e. the first deposit was technically pending even though they gave me the $1000 before 5 days, and so the second deposit's initial deposit limit was used to cover the previous pending deposit (at least, that's what I understood from what was said)\n\nBut the thing that pisses me off is the fact that they can't give me a freakin estimate as to when my money will be in my buying power. Every freakin day I wake up early as heck hoping that my money is in my account, but then I see a fat zero. And it only hurts more when I see a bleeding market that I can at least average down on a bit (lol 1k won't do much, but invested money is invested money). I'm guessing I'll probably get it tomorrow morning and I just hope the market is still red so I don't miss out on this dip, but meh, it feels horrible to have waited this long for a freakin 1k deposit. Seriously thinking of transferring to another brokerage. Apologies for the long rant, just needed to dump my frustration with RH the past week. \n\nAnyways, I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on good brokerages to transfer to? Also, is it worth transferring now during a market correction (Not sure how long it would take to transfer and whether the duration of the transfer would make me miss more of this buying dip)? In terms of brokerage platforms, I'm looking for the following features mainly\n\n1. Ability to trade within full extended hours, not just between 900 AM - 600 PM EST like RH allows.\n2. Ability to transfer money instantly, even if in big lumps. I don't want to be waiting for a transfer of just $1,000 for 5 days. That's freakin ridiculous to say the least.\n3.

{"title": "The Power of the FED", "selftext": "I am seeing a lot of posts here talking about corrections and crashes so I just wanted to point out one thing that I believe is quite unique in the current market situation. For starters, my buddy started getting into the market a few months before the COVID crash in March. I believed that this was a bad idea because I thought that the market was due for a correction with the way that companies like $TSLA were running up the debt in expectations of future growth and revenue flow. The FED was beginning to [raise rates] (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) prior to the COVID crash, signaling, at least somewhat, the end of rampant speculative investing in the name of future growth. However, we all know what happened next. The coronavirus hit, and the FED decided to drop rates to the floor. They are now actively engaged in monetary policy and money management to a level that I don't think they have been inclined to do so prior. Furthermore, I think we can all acknowledge that Alan Greenspan and Bernanke to some extent were definitely asleep at the wheel, scared to do too much with monetary policy for the simple reason that they did not want to get into a liquidity trap and have no remedies to alleviate any crises on the horizon. At least, I give this much credit to Bernanke, but Greenspan was literally just incompetent or just hated regulating the banks and firms that much in my personal opinion.\n\nThe point of all this is that Jerome Powell and the rest of the FED, at this time, has such a heavy hand in the market compared to the FED pre-COVID, and *especially* pre-2013. They literally cannot afford to let any major market crash occur simply because they have a plan that they have to stick to in order to get America back on track in a major way. This is not to say that a major correction or crash CANNOT occur, but I do believe personally that the FED has more of an interest in not letting this go tits up than ever before. GDP growth in the U.S. has been at dismal levels for quite a while and inflation has been MIA. With the post-COVID economic recovery on the horizon, I believe that the FED sees extremely loose monetary policy as a way to kill these two birds with one stone.\n\nFinally, what I think is somewhat proof of this. The fact that after the COVID crash, the market literally only went up. I am not saying 2020 market growth is sustainable forever or even if its here to stay, but merely using it as an example to show how powerful the FED is right now when it comes to manipulating and ensuring strong market conditions for institutional investors. I thought that rates so low was a recipe for disaster as the FED would have no real policy to mitigate against COVID ravaging the economy for the foreseeable future. However, I was forced to eat my words as to what the FED was doing and how the market was reacting (and my friend's positions) as, so far, a low interest rate policy *has worked and has shown no real signs of failure*. The FED has shown absolutely NO interest in raising rates for the next two years and any changes in the Treasuries are (in my opinion) not sufficient enough to spook them as they have such a heavy role in the current marketplace. To conclude, I am not a financial advisor, expert, or professional investor, so if you think my post is dumb, wrong, or skewed, please comment and let us have a discussion in order to further our knowledge, perspectives, and predictions of where the market is going :)\n\nTL;DR: The FED is so heavily invested in ensuring low rates and economic recovery that it is very, very, very, very unlikely, in my personal opinion, that a major *marketwide* correction or crash will occur on Jerome Powell's watch. If one does occur, then we are truly doomed and monetary policy is bunk.", "id": "lx7vy6", "created_utc": 1614815981.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Turn the fucking money printer back on Jerome!!!

This is a Morgan Stanley article pointing out that Ford Mustang EV is eating into Tesla's market share in the US market and asks the question why the European car manufacturers have fallen flat on their faces.  Actually given that deliveries of the Ford Mustang have only just begun its looking pretty positive for Ford and looks like the Ford Mustang EV will be production constrained \n\nThe answer to the European car manufacturers is that they are focussing on the European market, which is larger than the US market ,and the European models they compete with Tesla are just being introduced.  US customers tend to like larger cars.  The VW Id.3 is a bit small for the US market - but the VW ID.4 is an SUV and is coming to US in March - I think it will do well.  There are a significant number of other ev models amongst the 150 new EV's being introduced in 2021 which will compete with Tesla also in the US market.  Its lining up to be a tough fight - but good for the consumer.  Best strategy is to sell Tesla share now while they are still valued at an unrealistic level and put the money aside for a few months to buy the EV of your choice (which will come with all the gimmicky software for free).  Tesla are continuing to reduce prices to sell their cars - this can only continue given the level of competition.", "id": "lwx9wp", "created_utc": 1614787313.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "noone wants an ev mustang. the definition of mustang is a deep throaty roaring engine", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty sure their YouTube post got more downvotes then up.

{"title": "OSTK", "selftext": "Light DD. Suggesting a quick 10% gain that might not be suitable for more retarded, risk seeking investors.\n\nOSTK crushed earnings but dropped something like 16% last Tuesday. This is in keeping with the overall market sentiment- bond yields are increasing, beer virus stock winners are returning to a normal world etc etc. \n\nThe last time they reported earnings, it was a similar fiasco. Up like 20% early hours on huge revenue boost then actually finished red like 20% as investors realized they have no inventory. (Inventory has since before more available)\n\nIt's a day trader's top stock pick because of such crazy volatility. In my opinion, it's never had a chance to find it's true value because it's been squeezed and day traded abusively for two years. \n\nAnd- I need to be cryptic with how I say this so I don't get blocked- it's a good play for alternative uhh coin stuff.  Like, if alternative coin stuff keeps pushing at new highs, that would be really good for OSTK's medici ventures. Medici is a small facet of OSTK's revenue, but it's fascinating what they've been accomplishing. They issued a small dividend a year ago that's up 901.88% at the time of this post. (It's not really a dividend. Idk what the fuck it is, to be honest. They just issued it to me and it grew. Ticker is OSTKO if someone wants to explain it to me.)\n\nTheir main publicly traded competitor is W. W also had a rollercoaster earnings day. Early hours shot way down (jussst enough to trigger my stoploss order) then corrected way up. I think most of everyone saw they had a 16% run-up on Monday. There's yet to be a post earnings run-up for OSTK.\n\nI might lose some apes here, but I'm going to discuss risk/reward. Most recent extreme low was $47 about a month ago. Most recent high was $110 a couple weeks ago. OSTK is now trading at $65ish. Low volume is below most averages and, given the \ud83c\udf08  \ud83d\udc3b news on tech sell-off, it seems to be finding support.\n\nHousing market up also bodes well for the furniture industry. \n\nThis stock has always been for thrill seekers so I'm not going to promise to drink my own piss if it drops further.

The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an \"Anti Dumping Tax\". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, \"a radioactive\" product.\n\n>***Side Note:***\n\nLG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.\n\nBack in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :\n\n* Production capacity of each factory.\n* Daily production numbers of computers.\n* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, \"absorbed\" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.\n* Mother Nature and her wrath \"overseas\".\n\nThe computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.\n\nA few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire \"Technology Sector\", although it did not exist yet.\n\n>**Points:**\n\n* Always ask \"Why\".\n* \"Due Diligence\" is not just 2 levels deep.
