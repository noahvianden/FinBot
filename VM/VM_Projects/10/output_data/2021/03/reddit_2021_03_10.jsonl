{"title": "$MSFT Bullish Sentiment - DD Included", "selftext": "TL;DR: In depth breakdown of MSFT and why I believe it is a good buy at the moment. I did provide chart breakdowns and analysis in the post but cannot post them to this subreddit. If you would like to read the full post including the chart breakdowns you can do so here: [https://maxxprofits.com/p/msft-bullish-sentiment](https://maxxprofits.com/p/msft-bullish-sentiment)\n\nThe tech giants really took a hit recently. While a lot of people panicked and sold on the hype of inflation and chip shortages I took this opportunity to buy buy buy. This article is going to focus on one of those buys specifically. Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nNot only do I believe that MSFT is a great stable company but it\u2019s also at a price point that I would consider a value. Some of you reading this might think\u2026Wait a second, how can a company be a value buy when it\u2019s sitting near all time high\u2019s? When I say value I don\u2019t mean the Graham-Buffett type of value investing. With this market those types of buys are rare because everything has gone up, up and away. What I\u2019m looking for is companies that I feel strongly bullish on for many years to come aligning with certain technical indicators on the chart. Let\u2019s dive into the meat and potatoes of why I feel MSFT is a great buy.\n\n{Chart Breakdown}\n\nAs you can see MSFT recently peaked at all time high\u2019s of $246.13 on February 16, 2021. After divvies were paid we see it trickle down to the 50EMA and slightly bounce up until we hit the market correction that arrived in early March. On this chart the blue line is the 50EMA and the pink line is the 200EMA. I use these two points for various reasons but just know that the 50EMA(blue) acts sort of like a support line. We can see it trickle down a little bit below it but the last time it saw more than two weeks under the 50EMA was March 2020 and we saw it drop below the 200EMA as well for obvious reasons.\n\n{Chart Breakdown}\n\nCrossing below the 50EMA is a bearish sign to a degree. Crossing below the 200EMA is a hard bearish sign that we shouldn\u2019t ignore. Thankfully, MSFT is far off from it\u2019s 200EMA and I don\u2019t see it getting close anytime soon.\n\n**Part A** of my technical analysis focuses on the price bouncing off it\u2019s 50 day moving average. We now know that the market has corrected, the price rejected the support and reversed and unless the market flips it and reverses it we should see some movement up.\n\n**Part B** is where the real magic lays. For anyone who hasn\u2019t traded with me in the past - I live by the MFI. I get questions all the time why I choose MFI over RSI and just know\u2026**MFI don\u2019t lie**.\n\nThe MFI stands for Money Flow Index and it shows the money coming in and out. It helps traders identify overbought and oversold levels. The MFI starts getting overbought when it crosses above 60. I personally don\u2019t really consider it truly overbought until we cross above 80. Oversold levels are 20s and below.\n\n{Chart Breakdown}\n\nThis is a zoomed out daily chart of MSFT going back to summer of 2017. The MFI only crossed below 30 twice in the past 3.5 years. October 10, 2018 and March 04, 2021.\u00a0\n\nMSFT had some ups and downs in 2018 and people didn\u2019t like that so it sold off. It didn\u2019t really start recovering until late December of that same year and that recovery didn\u2019t stop until our friend COVID arrived:\n\n{Chart Breakdown}\n\nNow, with the price dropping significantly one would think the MFI would immediately go into extreme oversold conditions\u2026.but it didn\u2019t. The price of MSFT dropped from 190 to 131 in such a rapid short time but our MFI held strong at 31. Since then the MFI has dropped down to 31-32 on two other occasions and quickly reversed:\n\n{Chart Breakdown}\n\nEach of these reversals saw a +10%-15% price increase fairly quickly. In the times of roaring GME gains I understand that 10-15% seems like weak sauce but to us investing vets thats a solid ass play. What makes this play even better is that bounce off the 50EMA. In my personal opinion with the combination of the MFI being so low we are about to see MSFT soar past it\u2019s all time high and fly with the eagles in the cloud.\n\n>**Standard Risk:** Buy MSFT stock $235-$237  \n**Riskier:** Buy MSFT LEAPs for January 2022, March 2022 or June 2022.  \n**Balls to the Wall Risk:** APR 23 $240 Call  \n**Are you fucking insane:** MAR 19 $240 Call\n\nThere you have it folks.

{"title": "A $RUBY in the rough? A look at Rubius Therapeudics", "selftext": "I am not a financial professional and this is not investment advice. Do your own research. This is a first DD. I welcome counterpoints and criticism, as well as additional information\n\n**Why you're interested:** $RUBY, a biotech stock, hit a 52-week high today\n\n**Why you're very interested:** $RUBY's all time high was $26.90, nearly 70% higher than today. It went public in 2018 with a $2 billion valuation, the largest biotech IPO at the time, supported by Flagship Pioneering, the same venture capital firm behind Moderna. It's flagship drug, currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial, is RTX-240, weaponized red blood cells that are programmed to activate the immune system to kill cancer tumors. If the treatment works, using red blood cells to kill tumors is wildly more preferable to blasting them with radiation, which as we all know, damages healthy cells and causes harmful side effects.\n\n**My personal stake**: I first took a look at $RUBY back in mid January when it popped up on a screen. I am invested at a unit cost of $9.39, with a scant 0.35% of my portfolio. \n\n**Where we are now**: RTX-240 is currently undergoing a trial with 14 cancer patients who have tumors that are unresponsive to other therapies. They released preliminary data in January that showed T-cells an NK cells had been activated in all 14 patients in response to the treatment. 8 of 14 had an expanded number of these immune cells. And there were no adverse effects reported. The stock has risen on this news. The first clinical data from the trial is expected within weeks, and the data will likely be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in early April.\n\n**The bear case**: $RUBY went public at a huge valuation with little more than a concept--using red blood cells to fight cancer. Last year it shut down its lead program that targeted patients with phenylketonuria and to de-prioritize their rare disease pipeline because of \u201cuninterpretable data\u201d and \"manufacturing challenges.\" The shares hit a low of $4 as late as November. Bear analysts doubt that red blood cells can provoke enough of an immune system response outside the circulatory system to truly mount an effective attack on tumors. Inconclusive or failed results from this trial will tank the stock. Glassdoor reviews depict management as driven at all costs to get results as cash burns--which could be interpreted as a good thing--but some complain that it comes at the expense of employee happiness.\n\n**The bull case**: Rubius has observed striking results in mouse studies and in vitro studies, proving RTX-240 can stimulate the creation of cancer fighting immune cells. They were able to induce tumor immunity in mice. If the current human trial can show positive data that reveals real clinical responses to RTX-240, that can be a game changer in the fight against cancer. Imagine not needing chemo for a tumor. Or even having another weapon available if chemo doesn't work. We're talking about a method of fighting cancer that doesn't have side effects because it uses the body's natural elements to fight. Rubius also has another treatment in development, RTX-231, that targets HPV-related cancers, and a growing patent portfolio related to the technology used to create the weaponized red blood cells.\n\n**Price target**: Based off the original $2B valuation, $24 with upside.\n\nSources: https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/09/with-data-on-a-cancer-drug-derived-from-red-blood-cells-looming-rubius-therapeutics-seeks-to-shed-its-bumbling-image/\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/12/rubius-therapeutics-inc-ruby-q4-2019-earnings-call.aspx\n\nhttps://www.genengnews.com/topics/cancer/immunotherapies-expose-and-exploit-cancers-varied-weaknesses/\n\nhttps://ir.rubiustx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/rubius-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020", "id": "m267nx", "created_utc": 1615404648.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "This aged VERY well.

{"title": "GME and the Chocolate Factory", "selftext": "After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my children, then watching the 1971 movie, the GME events were predicted 40+ years ago.  I included pictures to help guide you along.  I hope this is helpful for you apes.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n\n* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor \ud83e\udd8d.  \n* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing \"Not-a-Cat\" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors \ud83e\udd8d of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab\n* Large corporations \ud83c\udfe2 buy large amounts of candy (stock) \ud83c\udf6c because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) \ud83c\udff0  is going to fail. \n* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets \ud83c\udfab in the candy \ud83c\udf6c they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.\n* With candy supplies \ud83c\udf6c being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs \ud83d\ude80.  Not liking this, the corporations \ud83c\udfe2 restrict limits on the amount of candy \ud83c\udf6c which can be purchased.\n* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket \ud83c\udfab has been found.  This sends the price of candy \ud83c\udf6c crashing.\n* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. \ud83c\udfab  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy \ud83c\udf6c increases. \ud83d\ude80  All this time, Charlie had \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.\n\n***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** \ud83c\udff0 \n\n* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.\ud83c\udf6b  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. \n* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry \ud83d\udd35, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.\n* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels \ud83d\udc3f opening the nuts \ud83c\udf30, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut \ud83c\udf30 opening squirrel \ud83d\udc3f instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut \ud83c\udf30 chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel \ud83d\udc3f.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.\n* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room \ud83d\udcfa, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High \ud83d\udcc8, Sell Low \ud83d\udcc9.  The others learned that Wonka's mission is going to help everyone who is fighting FOR the cause, not against it.\n\n***Other Characters***\n\n* ***Grandpa Joe*** - During the tour, Grandpa Joe passes a room with bottles of soda \ud83c\udf7e.  Grandpa convinces Charlie to drink the soda \ud83c\udf7e.  The soda \ud83c\udf7e causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.\n* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper \ud83c\udf6d.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?\n\n***That Scary River Scene*** \ud83d\udc79\n\n* The scene on the river is similar to CNBC, the Senate Hearings, and other media outlets trying to scare retail investors to sell their shares.  As a kid, it was scary as hell, but we all turned out ok, right??\n\n***Conclusion***\n\n* In the end, Charlie held \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and won the Chocolate Factory.  The last scene of the movie was the elevator, crashing through the roof and going \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.\n\n\n\n***TL:DR;***  Charlie \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 crashed through the roof, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon \ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a.

{"title": "LUMN (Lumen Technologies) should have a lot more upside as the transition to value continues", "selftext": "LUMN has been one of the value plays that's gotten a lot of money shifting out of high growth tech the past couple of weeks, and if that trend continues, it should have a lot more upside over the next few months.\n\nLumen is the old CenturyLink rebranded (the telecom that bought Level 3 which basically runs a lot of the internet backbone in the US).  The stock was punished due to indebtedness and reduced earnings from cord cutting by residential customers over the years, but it has basically pushed most of its debt out years as it focuses on the transition to fiber and 5G (only 30% of its debt matures the next half-decade and that's all easily manageable through free cash flow).\n\nThe stock has entered a long-term channel where it's found significant support/resistance over the past 5 years, and if it breaks above, I think it will basically be cleared for a big run.  It's picked up support from institutions due to the strong dividend and that also has helped it to attract buying flows as a value play.\n\nIt was one of the stocks that rocketed in January due to the GME fueled market-wide short squeeze, but has been a straggler this week as high growth tech has attempted to find its bottom.\n\nStill, I think the mid-term outlook for value stocks is probably better than high growth stocks given valuation levels and the likelihood of a big uptick in inflation in the 2nd half of this year as vaccinations and pent-up demand release a huge amount of consumer-driven demand in the economy.\n\nHere's the chart and how it could play out over the next few months:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shob1z6kc8m61.png?width=1805&format=png&auto=webp&s=a817eefe660e0c5579c00eb4cdae5b8b1b642ca2\n\nAnd this is look at the 4 year chart so you can see the channel it's entered (and why it's important as a place of support/resistance):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pa98scivc8m61.png?width=1805&format=png&auto=webp&s=2baa68e905d98688c276a0534a97e3d59b57ac3f\n\nI expect short-term consolidation in the channel or maybe a bit below (which is a good place to buy for cheaper calls), but any breakout should be explosive and would be hard to play if it happens since calls would probably become expensive fast very quickly.\n\nEasiest way to play it is to just buy long-dated calls out to July or October.  Something like July $17.50 calls or October $20 calls are pretty cheap right now because IV is surprisingly low on a stock that's experienced the past 3 months that it has.  If you want to play more aggressively, something like April 16 $15 or $16 calls are pretty cheap all things considered.\n\nI own April/July/October calls, and I anticipate holding them at least the next couple of weeks to see whether there's more money flow going from growth to value.\n\nThis is also a decent hedge position to have alongside high growth tech if you do own that (as I do).\n\nAs always, do your own DD.

{"title": "Tanger Factory Outlets (SKT) DD from Feb 10K", "selftext": "***TLDR:*** Stick to GME or AMC for quick tendies, buy SKT shares as a longer-term play (\\~1 year-ish)\n\nTanger Factory Outlets Centers (SKT) was fucked during the onset of Covid and has been beat down by Banks and Hedge Funds on the belief that Retail is dead making Tanger the 2nd most shorted stock. I read over their February 10k and came away with a strong belief in them. Tanger seems to have a recipe that works with their outlet design and has made a number of smart consolidating decisions over the past quarters to ensure their continued existence while returning to Pre-Covid levels of sales and activity by January. Despite some claims that Tanger is the next GME I don\u2019t see that case. It has the potential to explode later this year, with May or August earnings providing the action that could ignite the existing kindling, but Tanger is definitely a long-term hold stock rather than an FD or weekly options play. I would aim for a price of $20-$25 by summer's end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is my overview, cons, pros, and what I see as a reasonable future path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Company Overview:*** Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and its subsidiaries is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. They are a fully-integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating, and managing outlet shopping centers. As of December 31, 2020, their consolidated portfolio consisted of 31 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 11.9 million square feet, which were 92% occupied and contained over 2,200 stores representing approximately 400 store brands. They also had partial ownership interests in 7 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet, including 3 outlet centers in Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Cons:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Getting fucked by Covid and negatives consumer trends related to their business model have made them the 2nd most shorted company behind GME:** The main factors behind their current position are that they have been fucked by Covid and the fact that they are at their core a collection of huge retail brand store fronts off the highway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tenant Bankruptcies and Defaults:** In context to Covid a large number of their stores were closed, some rents payments were delayed, and there was an increase in the number of bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers at their locations (an increase in recovered square footage from about 1.75% at end of 2019 to about 8.3% of rentable square feet in 2020). Some of the tenants went through liquidity hardships and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tanger recaptured approximately 903,000 square feet within the consolidated portfolio related to bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers, compared to 198,000 square feet during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nAs a direct result of the pandemic, bankruptcies, and restructurings discussed above, the Company's earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $47.3 million due to (1) write-offs related to bankruptcies and other uncollectible accounts due to financial weakness, (2) one-time concessions in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to lease structure, (3) reserves for a portion of deferred and under negotiation billings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Most Likely will not Increase Rent:** Tanger\u2019s leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain Tanger\u2019s standard for high occupancy levels. The majority of Tanger\u2019s leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents. Tanger has historically been able to renew many leases at higher base rents per-square-foot and replace underperforming tenants with new or existing tenants in Tanger\u2019s portfolio. Given the current retail environment as discussed above, Tanger may choose to renew certain tenants or execute leases with new tenants at lower rental rates to maintain a high portfolio occupancy rate. This is some of their lease agreements include co-tenancy and/or sales-based provisions that may allow a tenant to pay reduced rent and/or terminate a lease prior to its natural expiration if Tanger fails to maintain certain occupancy levels or retain specified named tenants, or if the tenant does not achieve certain specified sales targets. Their occupancy at our consolidated centers has declined from 97% at the end of 2019 to 92% at the end of 2020. If their occupancy continues to decline, certain outlet centers may fall below the minimum co-tenancy thresholds and could trigger many tenants' ability to pay reduced rents, which in turn may negatively impact their results of operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retail decline:** Certain retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet, and other forms of pressure on their business models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Pros:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tangers Model/Outlet Centers:** Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores. Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third-party retailer. Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential while also allowing these brands to maintain a foothold in high-density population centers without a high-cost storefront.\n\nTanger\u2019s consolidated outlet centers range in size from 104,009 to 739,110 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores (so outskirts of major cities). Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores. Most of their outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity. Additionally, their centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.\n\nThey have a diverse tenant base throughout their consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 manufacturers, brand name and discount apparel and home retailers.\n\nNo single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of their combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, no single tenant accounted for more than 7% of their leasable square feet or 7% of their combined base and percentage rental revenues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTenants:\n\nLocations:\n\n**Perk of REITS for dividends.** Because Tanger is a REIT the ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of their common shares. They also have to make distributions with respect to their then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of their taxable income each year. They froze their dividends in 2020 but reinstated them in early 2021 with a dividend of $0.1775 per share paid in February 2021. Because of this high dividend payout holding the stock at least gives the benefit of decent dividends while waiting for a potential squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Return from Covid:** As of December 31, 2020, 99.9% of total occupied stores in their consolidated portfolio had reopened, representing 99.9% of leased square footage and 99.9% of the annualized base rent.\n\n(Checkout Tenants and location attachment)\n\nA number of their tenants requested rent deferrals, rent abatements or other types of rent relief during this pandemic. For March 2020, Tanger offered all tenants the option to defer 100% of April and May rents interest-free, payable in equal installments due in January and February of 2021. Their rent collection rates on contractually billed fixed rents were significantly impacted during the second quarter but steadily improved during the second half of the year, as the Company collected approximately 63% of second-quarter billed rents, 91% of third-quarter billed rents, and 95% of fourth-quarter billed rents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(checkout rent attachment)\n\nIn addition, traffic during the fourth quarter represented approximately 90% of prior-year levels and increased to approximately 96% in January. Governmental mandates effective between late December and early-to mid-February impacted traffic at the Tanger Outlet Centers in Canada, and excluding those centers, domestic traffic was over 99% in January compared to prior-year levels. This is a ridiculously good sign that there returning to pre-covid levels of demand even though only 20% of the US has been vaccinated. With a stimulus bill passing on the horizon, pent-up consumer demand,  and a planned influx of people traveling along highways and going to vacation destinations where Tanger has outlets I would not be surprised if they had stellar summer earnings. This would be the gasoline for a potential share price jump but wouldn\u2019t be enough to kick off a squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, let's talk about what I think could be the item that kicks off a short squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Share Repurchases :***\n\nIn May 2017, Tanger announced that their Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $125 million of their outstanding common shares as market conditions warrant over a period commencing on May 19, 2017 and expiring on May 18, 2019. In February 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $44.3 million of their outstanding common shares for an aggregate authorization of $169.3 million until May 2021. After purchases in 2019 and 2018 the remaining amount authorized to be repurchased under the program as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $80.0 million. The Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases for at least twelve months starting July 1, 2020 as the June 2020 amendments to Tanger\u2019s debt agreements for Tanger\u2019s lines of credit and bank term loan prohibit share repurchases during such time and in order to preserve Tanger\u2019s liquidity position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean? Tanger has a pretty sizeable share repurchasing power that is currently on hold due to their debt agreements from when they shored up their lines of credit and borrowing power in 2020. Because their share repurchasing power will be authorized until May 2021 there is a chance that at their 5/10 Earnings Report they could roll that ability forward to this next year (2021-2022) and when their share purchasing restrictions drop on July 1st, 2021 they could announce a share purchase program where just under 5 million shares could be bought back by the company. This would provide the desired squeeze effect and really put pressure on the shorts assuming they don\u2019t take the time to cover between now and then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** 111 Shares at $16.839, 4 poor man\u2019s covered calls for about $1050.\n\n(6/18 $17 buy 3/19 $40 Sell for $280, 1/20/23 $17 buy $23 sell for $384, 9/17 $23 buy 6/18 $30 sell for $105, 1/21/22 $15 buy 9/17 $24 sell for $281)\n\n[SKT Rents by quarter](https://preview.redd.it/5ewr8rsq79m61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f3fddbd382b50f9aabaf6a0ebef784b078ebde5)\n\n[SKT Top 25 tenants](https://preview.redd.it/pyx88ewq79m61.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ae283e23c7dae5773d90144914111413432f994)\n\n[SKT Outlet locations by state](https://preview.redd.it/6yk0lhtq79m61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=4403fa83fe2b584b8e74fd54928f18005410c2a0)", "id": "m248be", "created_utc": 1615399820.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "My profits will go into tanger outlets.
