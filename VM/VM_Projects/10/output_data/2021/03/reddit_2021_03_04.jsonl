Dow futures implied a loss of more than 40 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also were lower. The benchmark S&P 500 dropped 1.3% Wednesday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.7%. The 30-stock Dow declined 119 points, or 0.38%.

Investors are no doubt hoping to hear comforting words from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he addresses the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit shortly after midday. Due to Monday\u2019s strong rally, the Dow and S&P 500 remain higher for the week, and the Financials and Energy sectors are both up by well over 3% for the week.\n\n*****\n\n> * Top investor John Rogers says to look outside of the S&P 500 to find new opportunities (CNBC PRO)\n\n*****\n\n> * The Labor Department releases its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, with economists looking for 750,000 new claims for the week ending Feb. 27. That would be up from the prior week\u2019s 730,000.\n\n*****\n\n> * Revised fourth quarter productivity figures are also out at 8:30 a.m. ET, with consensus forecasts calling for productivity to have fallen 4.7% on an annual basis during the final three months of 2020. The prior estimate had come in at -4.8%.\n\n*****\n\n> * At 10:00 a.m. ET, January factory orders are likely to have jumped 2.3%, according to economists, following a 1.1% increase in December.\nSupermarket operator Kroger (KR) leads this morning\u2019s shortlist of corporate earnings releases, with BJ\u2019s Wholesale (BJ), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ciena (CIEN) also set to release quarterly numbers. Costco (COST), Broadcom (AVGO), Gap (GPS), SmileDirectClub (SDC) and IMAX (IMAX) are among the companies scheduled to issue earnings releases after today\u2019s closing bell.\n\n*****\n\n> * Top U.S. health officials are warning that highly transmissible variants are threatening the country\u2019s progress on reducing coronavirus cases. New infections dropped sharply after their January peak, but the trend has since stalled even as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid. \u201cSo much can turn in the next few weeks,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. \u201cHow this plays out is up to us.

Residents in Michigan and Indiana who are over 50 years old are now able to be vaccinated; in Connecticut and Arizona, the eligibility is now 55 and up. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) recently cleared single-dose vaccine is being reserved for teachers in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, part of an increased push across the country to safely reopen schools. Nearly 52 million people in the U.S. have received at least one vaccine dose, representing more than 20% of the country\u2019s adult population.

House Resolution 1 passed mostly on partisan lines and would need to see support from 10 GOP senators to get past the filibuster.

In a statement almost two months after the Jan. 6 attack, Capitol Police said it \u201cis aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex.\u201d It also said upgrades to security have been made.

For example, the Arizona House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that implicitly targets both Apple and Alphabet-owned Google\u2019s (GOOGL) app stores and their policies around payment for developers.

The fast-casual burrito chain\u2019s move follows similar steps from Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s (MCD) and comes as individual investors and asset managers alike are placing a greater emphasis on environmental, societal and corporate governance (ESG) issues. For Chipotle, some of its environmental goals include raising its level of organic, local or regeneratively grown or raised food. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n> * Walt Disney (DIS) plans to shutter 20% of its brick-and-mortar Disney Store locations, as the company boosts its focus on e-commerce operations. Disney said at least 60 of its locations in North America will close. Globally, there are about 300 Disney Stores. The Covid pandemic led to increased adoption of online shopping, with some saying the health crisis has accelerated the shift that was already in place. Disney did not say how the store closings will impact financial results. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n> * Hedge fund Melvin Capital, which found itself at the center of the Reddit-sparked GameStop (GME) frenzy in January, saw a return of nearly 22% in February. Melvin had been short the video-game retailer before its stock took off as retail traders piled into the name, and the Gabe Plotkin-led fund ultimately declined 53% in January. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n> * A prototype rocket from Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX exploded Wednesday, not long after it landed for the first time following a test flight. It\u2019s not clear what caused the explosion, or whether it was intentional. On two previous test flights for the Starship prototype, in December and February, the rockets were unable to slow down enough and exploded on impact during an attempted landing. SpaceX, last valued at $74 billion, is working on the stainless steel Starship with the intention of launching people and cargo to the moon and Mars.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 4, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**\n\nStocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent selloff. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. \n* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.\n* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.\n* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square. \n* **Please note that the stock price was written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes.**\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with a host of target raises just over the $200 mark.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 4, 2021.", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**\n\nStocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. \n* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.\n* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.\n* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square. \n* **Please note that the stock price was written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes.**\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with a host of target raises just over the $200 mark.

Nickel is needed for the most powerful lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles.\n\nNickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production,\u201d Musk said on Twitter last month.\n\nNew Caledonia is one of the largest nickel producers, but protests in the French territory have delayed the sale of the lossmaking Goro mine and refinery by Vale to a consortium called Prony Resources.\n\nThe agreement reached in New Caledonia on Thursday will allow the sale to go through and give 51 per cent of the project to state entities based in the territory, according to a Reuters report citing the text of the agreement released by New Caledonia\u2019s political parties. Commodity trader Trafigura will have a 19 per cent share, according to the Switzerland-based company.\n\nWhile Tesla will not have an equity stake, its close involvement in the mine signals its efforts to have greater control over its entire supply chain, from mine to battery, as it ramps up production. A Tesla spokesperson in the UK declined to comment on the news. Vale could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nLast year Tesla agreed to buy cobalt, another battery metal, from the Swiss miner Glencore.\n\nNickel, which is mined mostly in Russia, Canada, New Caledonia and Indonesia, is primarily used to make stainless steel. But growth in electric vehicles is adding a new source of demand for the metal.\n\nWhile Chinese companies have invested heavily in new nickel projects in Indonesia over the past few years, the process to extract and process the nickel uses energy from coal-fired power.\n\n\u201cThe only incremental nickel tonnage is coming from Indonesia but the problem with Indonesia from an ESG perspective is it may not meet the criteria of Tesla,\u201d Jim Lennon, an analyst at Macquarie, said. \u201cTesla is way behind in securing units and the Chinese have wrapped it up.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese stainless steel producer Tsingshan said that it had signed an agreement to sell 100,000 tonnes of nickel to two Chinese battery materials companies, Huayou Cobalt and CNGR Advanced Material.\n\nThe Chinese company said it had begun producing higher purity nickel at its plant in Indonesia since last July, a form suitable for electric vehicle batteries, according to a statement on its official WeChat account.\n\nFollowing the news, nickel prices fell by 8 per cent on Thursday, as traders bet that Indonesian nickel would alleviate any shortage in the market.\n\nNickel last traded at $16,225 a tonne, down 13 per cent this week.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cTechnical advisor\u201d\n\nMy take:\n\u201cHey guys, we see you\u2019re trying to mine some Nickel.

The article glosses over one of the biggest challenges, regulation, and seems questions about the inevitable crashes and liability. It also really oversimplifies the difference between Tesla and other autonomous vehicle companies.\n\nTesla has a big advantage in rolling out a robotaxi network because they've already sold so many cars with the necessary hardware. If we're looking at the US, Tesla probably has a little over 500,000 cars in the US with the FSD computer and hardware? Let's say that when Tesla eventually has a really \"no driver\" FSD update, that about half of those people would be willing to put their cars in the robotaxi network. And that each car can drive for about 12 hours a day, maybe a little less depending on how often the owners actually need their car?\n\nI think Uber has around 750k drivers in the US, but there's probably a small percentage of them that are regularly active, and the average hours driven per day is probably skewed as well. It might be only an hour or two average across that whole number? Then there's the other ride sharing networks, that are smaller. Then, let's assume that robotaxi costs will be cheaper Uber or similar, and also that some people might prefer not having a driver, or at least that it'll be easy to convince people to try it out because it'll be so unusual?\n\nRoughly speaking, a Tesla robotaxi network might be able to totally replace all existing rideshare businesses? At least as long as the cars can consistently operate everywhere and they're safe, or viewed as safe. It'll be interesting to see if the cars can handle things like parking on busy streets or parking lots because if they can go pickup pizza, then they could replace drivers for doordash, ubereats, etc.\n\nThen there's an even more conservative business model, that's like ZipCar, but the car comes to you. Which would still have the renter driving the car, or at least being responsible for it, but the car could do short drives to pick the person up and go back to it's parking spot afterwards. That way the self driving car wouldn't have to be able to go *everywhere*, just around its general neighborhood. And Tesla could have things like remote drivers that could take over if the car gets stuck, which would be much easier to do with short drives or delivery driving, etc. where getting to the destination quickly isn't quite as important.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019ve always been sketched out at the thought of using my Model 3 as a RoboTaxi, but then I thought of using it as a RoboTaxi instead of selling it when I upgrade to a CyberTruck or whatever. \n\nSo I have to imagine a lot of people will just do that instead of selling used and that will also have a positive impact on new car sales because there will be a very small amount of used Tesla\u2019s fir sale.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Tesla vs Uber as a ride share has one big challenge, which you did touch on, which is insurance.\n\nUber just owns the platform.  Everyone who works for them is an independent contractor and Uber has successfully argued it bears no responsibility for any of there actions.  So they have no insurance costs and aren't responsible for any of the problems with the cars or the drivers.  They just take a big cut (almost all profit) of what the drivers make.\n\nTesla likely won't be able to argue that.  They built the car, and wrote the software.  How do you argue that the vehicle owner has any responsibility or liability for what happens in a robotaxi?  Essentially they own the entire liability.  They're looking at insurance for this reason, but insurance is hardly a profitable industry, with margins in the single digits.  Presumably they've done the math, and this makes money, but its not going to be all margin like Uber.\n\nMy last point is that I don't see how this is a year or two away, and that's based on Tesla's actions.  Every software company on the planet has moved away from a one time cost model, and towards a SaaS model.  Tesla's announced plans to do this, but still says it will continue a license model, and hasn't announced anything in terms of their SaaS model.

{"title": "How I'm dealing with this small correction", "selftext": "Since there is much to do in the market in the past 2 weeks, let's talk.  \nHere's how I'm dealing with this mini correction:\n\n* For index positions: you should usually be fine holding for long term, and can take this opportunity to average down by buying more. The broader your index is, the less you have to worry about it. Unless a majority of your portfolio is in 1 index that tracks a single narrow sector like cannabis, then you should probably trim it down. I have most of my portfolio in QQQ, about 10% in 2 ARK funds. Obviously they've lost quite a bit, but I'm not too worried. I'm very tech-heavy, so I might open some positions in VTI if it dropped enough, to balance things out a little bit. I'm also rolling out and down my short puts where it makes sense, but to no longer than May. If QQQ is down 20% from high (around \\~$270), I'd start to buy in more heavily.  \nSince we all love options, it's necessary to remind everyone that you don't always have to buy in lots of 100, nor do you have to sell a put to get assigned stocks. Just straight up buying small amounts of shares. Sometimes this slipped my mind.\n* For large, stable, resilient companies (e.g. AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, WMT, etc.): unless their fundamentals have changed significantly, I wouldn't bother. I might or might not buy more, depending on how far down they go, but I definitely won't trim my positions here. There are no doubts AMZN, AAPL and the likes will bounce back.\n* For meme stock positions: much as we love them, we should look to trim those positions first. The selection criteria is personal preference. For me, since I sized them properly based on their respective ATR when I opened them, they all have roughly the same risk to me. You should always size your positions based on their own volatility measures, whatever you fancy. Remember, 20% drawdown on MARA is different from a 20% drawdown on AAPL. I usually close the positive ones and leave the negative ones as is. If your portfolio is meme stock heavy (e.g. > 15%), it's probably a good idea to trim this down. Taking some loss is okay.\n\nOverall, during these corrections, I just limit my attention to the market and go on about my life. Nothing I should be doing at this time. Nasdaq is down 10%, it either will go back up or down 20%, and I would only need to take actions when either of them happens.\n\nWhat about you?", "id": "lxxqbv", "created_utc": 1614898444.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I'll be honest, I didn't learn my lesson one year ago.

It positive in the sense that it suggests that Tesla's sales have risen 5% this february compared to last year, although the market has grown 40%.  Market share has fallen significantly. Competition from Ford Mustang EV seems to have taken the balance - which is interesting because the ford Mustang has suffered delivery problems and is only just being delivered - so what happens in the US market when the Ford Mustang is up to full production levels?

{"title": "The elixir of inflation, short term interest rates and why stonks will go up", "selftext": "Yet another day,  TSLA and other tech stocks got crushed due to rise in Yields. I feel this is an over reaction because the 10-yr bond yields are just at where they were pre-covid. I outline below why there won't be any rise in the short term interest rates atleast till the end of 2023 and why stonks will go up\n\n**Unemployment claims and inflation**\n\nUnemployement rate in January was 6.3% and the Fed's natural rate of unemployement stands at around 4%. The Fed has cited that if we were to include millions of people who quit the labor force and other misclassifactions the rate could go up to 10%. So, even though we are reopening there is a very high rate of unemployement across the country.\n\nIn Feb 2020, US had the lowest unemployement in it's history at 3.5% and guess what the inflation number was ? less than 2%.\n\n**Effect of stimmy and infrastructure package**\n\nThere is around $1.9 trillion stimulus package on the way and plan for a $2 trillion infrastructure package later. If both of them were to get through (I doubt the infrastrucure deal), the expectation is that in the extreme case we might reach the 3.2% unmployement rate (which is good) sooner (early 2022) than later. With industries moving to automation on a large scale, lower unemployement rates are hard to sustain.\n\n*But with the reopening, there might be a spike in inflation but that will quickly subside due to the forces of globalization, opening up supply chains, cheap labor and goods. This is a case for lower unemployement and lower inflation.*\n\n**How will we pay back the Federal Debt ??? The Inflation elixir**\n\nWe don't need to worry about higher debt, we only need to look at the level of public debt relative to GDP, because the costs of any debt level are less important when the economy is larger. The economy can be made larger in two ways\n\n1. Increase in real production\n2. Increase in the prices of the produced goods\n\nBeing a developed economy there is only so much the US can increase real GDP. The elixir of inflation will solve the problem for us. Here is a simple example\n\n***Assume that inflation returns to Fed's target of 2% per year and the GDP growth rate is 1.5%, then the nominal growth rate would be 3.5%.***Guess, how much uncle sam pays for borrowing ???0.7 percent per year on its 10-year borrowing and 0.1 percent per year on its 3-month borrowing through 2021. At the end of 2019, 1.55 percent and 1.92 percent\u00a0\n\n***Even without a primary budget surplus, the net effect of interest payments and growth would be to shrink the debt-GDP ratio at a rate of 2.0 (=\u00a0 3.5 \u2013 1.5) percent per year, when inflation rate is at 2%. Assume the reduction in debt when inflation rises to 3% or 4%. This reduction would increase to 3% and 4% per year which is huge.***\n\nThe same has happened after world war II when debt to GDP ratio is at current levels and it got diluted over the years because of inflation and the only way we will be able achieve is through lower rates, which is good for stonks overall. I believe the Fed will opt for a higher inflation target around 3%-4% before finally moving to increase any short term rates.\n\n**Tl;DR**\n\nOver-valued tech stocks might be taking a beating but the marker overall is poised to move up. Whether we see inflation or not, interest rates are going to be low atleast for the next three years if not more, else uncle sam can't pay his debt back.\n\nPositions : Long SPY", "id": "lx9d65", "created_utc": 1614821145.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "THE WHAT?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Username checks out", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Cyka bylat comrade", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17920096218585968}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11174183338880539}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06967077404260635}, {"body": "We\u2019re pretending these valuations were reasonable even before Covid.

{"title": "Fellow Apes, Retards and other Degenerates may I have your attention please! OTGLY/CDR", "selftext": "CD Projekt has lost about 50% from the top because of the terrible launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and a hack. But let\u2019s look at what has actually happened. \n\n**You will find a TL DR at the bottom.**\n\n &nbsp;\n\n**Sales of Cyberpunk 2077**\n\nSure the game was buggy as hell on release and Sony is yet to put it back on its stores (you can still buy the physical copy) but the PC + Xbox version sold well even after refunds and it\u2019s still selling on Xbox store. Also if you look at the independent PC reviews (not count the outlets that always give AAA games 10/10) it was still very well received so if they manage to fix the console version we could very well see the sales pick up for consoles.\n\nThe facts are that 12 days after launch they had sold over 13m copies of which 10.8m (80% coming from PC sales) was estimated to be digital, which would make it the largest digital launch ever. This is a big deal because digital sales earn them a much higher margin, for example steam takes 20%(+50m$ sales) while physical stores take 40-50%. These numbers include the first 8 days of refunds which arguably would be the lion\u2019s share of total refunds.\n\nCurrently on Steam its still #20 of bestselling games (removing free to play and special offers), if you only look at games costing +30\u20ac then its #7, #5 for +40\u20ac, in fact it was the bestselling game for 7 weeks in a row on Steam and it\u2019s still selling for full price. On GOG.com its currently #2 and still full price. On Epic Store its #6 and full price, in other words the game is still selling well on PC and still going for full price. So the sales have not been bad in any way, its possible that\u2019s it could have been even better than good, of course it could have been fucking stellar record breaking shit had they not released a buggy mess but still not bad sales in any way.\n\nSo let\u2019s run some simple numbers and lets be very conservative, lest say they only sold standard editions and no \u20ac250 collectors editions. Let\u2019s also say that as of today with refunds they only sold 12m digital and 3m physical copies. For retail let\u2019s say the revenue split was 50% and for digital 25% (Steam 20%, GOG 0%, Epic 12%, Xbox 30%, PS 30%). This gives us \u20ac690m in revenue and that\u2019s more than all revenues from 2012-2019 combined and that\u2019s just for 3 months of Cyberpunk sales. This gives us a PE of roughly 7 as a worst case scenario.\n\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-24-cyberpunk-2077-is-now-the-biggest-digital-game-launch-of-all-time\n\nhttps://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/\n\nhttps://www.pcgamesn.com/cyberpunk-2077/steam-top-seller-player-count\n\n &nbsp;\n\n**The hack**\n\nSource code was stolen but that\u2019s not a financial loss because a Witcher or Cyberpunk knockoff is not a substitute in any way. The hack has pushed back the second patch about 2 weeks so that\u2019s 2 weeks of lost dev time, make that 2 months and its still not a big issue financially. Add another 4, 5 or 6 months of extra dev time for patches (due to buggy release) and we are still talking peanuts. Also remember it won\u2019t be the full dev team working on patches, just a parts of the original team.\n\nLost trust and reputation loss has a minimal affect of future sales in this business. EA, Zenimax, UbiSoft, Activision to name a few have been shitting on gamers for a long time now with unfinished games riddled with micro transactions and gamers still come back every time for their fix. FOMO is too great.\n\n &nbsp;\n\n**The hidden gem**\n\nNow let\u2019s look at what\u2019s actually in front of us and that is something I believe many have missed. I\u2019m sure most that follow the stock knows about the Witcher Netflix series and the Witcher mobile game, by them self\u2019s they are alright but together they could be explosive.\n\nThe Witcher Netflix series was a fucking successes and the next season is almost done and will be released this year. The first season also boosted sales of the PC games. Its production is independent of the game studio so it won\u2019t be affected by it. \n\nThe Witcher mobile game being developed by a separate studio from the one working on PC/Console so once again not affected by Cyberpunk problems. The game is basically a Pokemon Go copy and it has been in open beta for 6 months. The reviews on app store are very good, 4.5 and version 0.9 was released a month ago. They released the beta on version 0.6 and they got to 0.9 in 5 months so I think the game is basically done and they are just waiting for the right timing to release it.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/nz/app/the-witcher-monster-slayer/id1509704647\n\nI believe their strategy is for a simultaneous launch or maybe a week or two apart, hoping that the series popularity will bring tons of players to the mobile game and mobile games like that make filthy amounts  money, it won\u2019t make Pokemon Go money  but even a small amount of that would be filthy amounts. \n\nOne could however look at another AR game connected to a popular franchise, namely Harry Potter and say that it wasn\u2019t popular why should this one be? Well to start of that game missed its timing as it was released far after the franchises popularity peak. Secondly I would argue that a larger base of the Witcher fans are gamers compared to Harry Potter fans. Thirdly that game was aggressively monetized and CD Projekt are known to take it easy on monetization which is more profitable in the long run.\n\n &nbsp;\n\n**M&A**\n\nA third thing worth mentioning is the increasing amounts of M&A happening in this segment and CD Projekt is juicy target, it is almost the only large studio left that has not been acquired as a whole or in part by any of the large players, almost all other large studios have either been acquired or have large shareholder like for example Tencent. Possible buyers could be Amazon or Google, they have both been trying to get into the gaming industry and failed with their in-house efforts. Other buyers are any of the large Chinese players and even Sony after Microsoft bought Zenimax to protect Playstation from Xbox, but this one is a bit of a long shot now that Sony is a bit pissed of at CD Projekt.\n\n &nbsp;\n\n**So whats the price target?** \n\nWell the top was not fair value but this bottom sure as hell is not. I feel based on the known revenue from Cyberpunk and the estimated sales based on bestseller ranking we can assume that it is bringing in good money and will continue to do so for the coming years also we must account for some delays for upcoming projects. But all in all I feel a drop of 20-30% would have been fair not the 50% we have seen. So yesterday it closed at 228 down from a top of roughly 450 and my target is somewhere between 300-350.\n\n &nbsp;\n\n**TL DR**\n\nBased on available data, sales are not a fail, more than all the revenue combined from 2012-2019 on very conservative estimates, it gives us a PE of roughly 7 for just 3 months worth of Cyberpunk sales.\n\nThe Hack has limited financial impact, a month of dev time.\n\nLost dev time for fixing Cyberpunk is also of limited financial impact even if its 9 months as it will not be the entire dev team for all that time.\n\nThe combination of Netflix The Witcher Season 2 and the mobile game The Wither Monster Hunt has the possibility to be a fat cash cow.\n\nAn increased chance as of late to be acquired in part or as a whole by large conglomerates.\n\nPrice target of 300-350, now trading at 230", "id": "lxi6c0", "created_utc": 1614856287.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "I think CD project red was probably overvalued before the release of cyberpunk, because Witcher was that good.

It provides essential services to companies that deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and works with big names such as NVIDA, Sony, Tesla\n\n***1.*** ***Financials are great***\n\n5B of revenue, 5B Cap, criminally low P/E of 17.7\n\nOkay, but what about other companies in semi-cons. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17.  AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79. This alone tells you how  undervalued this company is. Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30\n\nThe company is constantly reducing it\u2019s debt and increasing operating income and it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends too.\n\nLow volume\n\nGreat financials\n\n***2.*** ***Company is in a hot, growing space.***\n\nSemi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board.Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon..\n\n***3. Outlook is great:***\n\nlast earnings call says that everything is going great and growing HUGE -\n\n\u201cOkay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.\n\n2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor\u2019s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021\u201d\n\nFinancial highlights:\n\n[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Great outlook\n2. Best ever quarter and will even pay dividends\n3. Great revenue and P/E\n4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today\n5.
