{"title": "Market Forecast - 3 Step Process To Options Trading - Part 2", "selftext": "This is a follow up to my post Sunday. Every trade should start with your opinion of the market. My trade duration is less than a month so my forecasts stay within that time period. I will post a trade with instructions later today or tomorrow and then I will back track to show you how I found it and why I like it. This forecast was posted before the open Monday.\n\nMARKET BIAS: Neutral to slightly bullish for the next month\n\nOPTIONS STRATEGY: Sell OTM bullish put spreads\n\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n\nLast week the market passed the critical test and major moving averages in the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500 held. Friday stocks rebounded and I believe we will see follow-through buying during this holiday shortened week. This is been a stair-step rally and the price action has been choppy while profits catch up to lofty valuations. Major economic releases should be market friendly and earnings season will be upon us when we return after Easter.\n\nThe NASDAQ 100 tested the 100-day moving average and it bounced off of that level. This is important because it was a higher low. Buyers did not feel that we would be able to test the lows from March and they were more aggressive on this dip. Tech stocks have been soft because of the rise in interest rates the last two months. US 10-Year Treasuries (TLT) found support (interest rates have stopped going up) and the bid in tech stocks should improve into earnings season.\n\nThe S&P 500 tested the 50-day moving average and it also bounced off of that support level. This is been a three steps forward, two steps backwards rally and we are poised to break through the all-time high in the next few weeks.\n\nThis morning there are some nervous jitters over the demise of a hedge fund (Archegos). We saw margin liquidations in their holdings last week and a number of banks have considerable exposure. Credit Suisse (CS) said that it will have a material impact on earnings this quarter. I do not see this as a systemic event and $20 billion will be quickly absorbed.\n\nLast week's initial jobless claims dropped to 674,000 and that was the best reading in the last few months. States are reopening and employment will improve quickly. Approximately 8% of our labor force is tied to the hospitality industry and the rebound should be swift as restaurants reopen. ADP will release its employment numbers Wednesday and the Unemployment Report will be posted Friday (market closed). This week we will also get official PMI's and ISM manufacturing on Thursday. Traders will be watching for steady improvement.\n\nThe Fed has stated that it will not raise rates until 2024 and that it expects inflation to reach 2.5% this year. They see higher prices as a temporary event and that they will normalize in 2022. This means that we are in a \"sweet spot\" where strong economic data points should not raise fear that the Fed will tighten.\n\nStock valuations are stretched, but we almost have another quarter of profits under our belt. Q4 corporate guidance was much better-than-expected and earnings should be healthy. The market bid typically strengthens into earnings season and we are only a few weeks away.\n\nSwing traders are long SPY. Raise your stop to SPY $386 (closing basis). You should be selling out of the money bullish put spreads on stocks with relative strength and heavy volume. I prefer selling bullish put spreads on stocks with strong momentum and technical breakouts through resistance. Sell below technical support and try to keep your spreads inside of a three week window to maximize accelerated time premium decay.\n\nDay traders should look for an early test of support this morning. I believe that the market will rebound fairly quickly. As the market drops on the open find relative strength. Buyers took notice when support levels last week held and overseas markets were fairly strong. The downward sloping trend line for SPY (30 minute bars) was breached and prices should be stable to slightly higher this week. This morning we are simply giving back the gains from the last 30 minutes of trading Friday.\n\nSupport is at SPY $391 and resistance is at $396 and the all-time high.\n\nHere is a link to the first article on the 3 Step Process For Options Trading\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mf45do/3\\_step\\_process\\_to\\_options\\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mf45do/3_step_process_to_options_trading/)\n\nHere is a link to Part 3 where I use the information and I apply it to an actual trade.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mfrovx/3\\_step\\_process\\_to\\_trading\\_options\\_part\\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mfrovx/3_step_process_to_trading_options_part_3/)\n\nTrade Well", "id": "mfpmx9", "created_utc": 1617024682.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "There is a lot of hostility here and everyone should be skeptical.

{"title": "NIO DD ! I LOVE THE STOCK !", "selftext": "For the past 2 months, EV manufacturer NIO has went down by -48% and i'm telling you why you need to buy the fucking dip boiz. \n\nThe big reason to buy the dip is that shares are fundamentally undervalued today relative to the company\u2019s long-term earnings growth potential.\n\nNIO is China\u2019s most dominant premium EV maker, with unrivaled technology and brand equity. On that basis alone, NIO has tremendous long-term revenue and earnings growth potential, since China is the world\u2019s largest auto market and the government there is aggressively supporting EV adoption. MR.Xi  wants China to go full EV by 2030, and when he wants it,  you know it's really going full EV by 2030 and the whole world will follow suit since everyone wants a piece of that chinese Market.\n\nThus, long-term, China will turn into the world\u2019s largest EV market. NIO is right at the epicenter of that market, with a home-grown brand and industry-leading technology.\n\nBut NIO is much more than a China story. Outside of **Tesla**  and maybe **Lucid Motors**  there are no other companies in the world that can rival NIO in terms of battery technology and brand equity. That means NIO can \u2014 and will \u2014 turn into a global company that, by 2025-plus, will be selling a lot of electric sedans and SUVs in North America and Europe.\n\nAfter factoring in the global growth potential, it becomes clear that NIO is way undervalued today.\n\nMy modeling suggests that NIO is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030. Based on a 25X forward earnings multiple and a 10% annual discount rate, that implies a 2021 price target for NIO stock of nearly $125.", "id": "mfwccg", "created_utc": 1617043276.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Anything ev and chinese is shit. \nSorry\nI have quite a bit of Ev and Chinese and I say there stock sucks in the hopes that it may go up all of a sudden.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Haha", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05358187109231949}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5083988904953003}, {"body": "china story?

Earlier today, the automaker prematurely published an incomplete press release to its website it planned to share on April 29th. VW quickly took down the announcement, but not before *CNBC* managed to get a good look at it.\n\nA Volkswagen spokesperson declined to comment on the release, but a source \"familiar with the company's plans\" told the network the document was authentic. The release characterized the rebranding as a \"public declaration of the company's future-forward investment in e-mobility.\" The change will reportedly see Volkswagen EVs feature a badge that bears the new Voltswagen branding and a lighter blue VW logo. Any gas-powered cars the company sells moving forward will feature only the classic VW emblem in the automaker's signature dark blue color.\n\nTraditional automakers have been all about EV-centric rebrandings in recent months. In January, GM [redid its classic logo](https://www.engadget.com/gm-logo-branding-electric-vehicles-210607845.html) to evoke \"the clean skies of a zero-emissions future.\" The new design is also a visual play on the company's [Ultium battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html). For Volkswagen, the change would come at a pivotal point in its history. The company plans to offer [300 EV models by 2030](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-volkswagen-wants-300-ev-models-by-2030.html) and get to a point where at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in Europe are either hybrids or battery electrics.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-voltswagen-rebranding-190713047.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-voltswagen-rebranding-190713047.html)\n\n*Ask Papi Elon to stop fucking around with his banana rocket, it's time to buckle up or Tesla may just tank south to $69?*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
