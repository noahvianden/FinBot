Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, March 17th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lands-end-crowdstrike-plug-power-more.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall\n\n> * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday\u2019s trend and finished higher.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy\n\n> * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won\u2019t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January\u2019s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters\n\n> * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\n> * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to \u201ca lot of people that don\u2019t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.\u201d However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday\u2019s U.S.-China meeting\n\n> * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won\u2019t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.\n\n> * Reflecting Washington\u2019s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing\u2019s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America\u2019s \u201csinister intention to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China\u2019s stability and development.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle\n\n> * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won\u2019t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020.

{"title": "ARK Trading Strategies", "selftext": "As a subscriber to ARK's daily trade updates, I've been curious to watch how she trades around the volatility over the past few months.\u00a0 Cathie has stated on several occasions that she uses large cap stocks as \"cash-like instruments\" and rotates into them when her conviction plays get frothy (thus expanding her total population of stocks).\u00a0 When the market drops, she consolidates and concentrates the portfolio back into her high-conviction names.\u00a0 I've also noticed some other interesting trades that she has made recently that piqued my interest:\n\n**ROKU:**\u00a0 ARKW bought ROKU on 3/8 (daily range $325-356), then turned around and sold ROKU from the same fund on 3/15 (daily range $354-363).\u00a0 If bought at the absolute low and sold at the absolute high on those days, that would be a 12% gain.\u00a0 Great return over 1 week, but if she had enough conviction to buy at $325, why sell so quickly?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**HIMS:**\u00a0 ARKG bought HIMS on 1/27 (daily range $13.00-14.40), then sold on 2/23 (daily range $14.90-17.63) when the market began to panic.\u00a0 This is particularly interesting because the fund was initiating a new position in a company.\u00a0 I would expect if they bought into a new company that there was some underlying thesis that should have remained intact even after a 10-20% upward move.\u00a0 Interestingly, she has continued to sell out of this ticker completely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese are two very different examples.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nROKU, like Tesla, is a staple of the portfolio and another strategy she uses is trading around these types of names (ARK has made lots of money trading Tesla).\u00a0 Since this is a mature investment in the portfolio, she seems to have a designated percent of the portfolio she wants to allocated to it.\u00a0 When the market drops 10%, she buys more to keep that percentage intact.\u00a0 When it recovers, she sells off what she bought again maintaining the base percentage.\u00a0 And on and on, making nice trading profits on high-conviction plays that she wants to keep at a set percentage in the fund.\u00a0 She can always change that set percentage if she has more conviction in the company by letting it appreciate without selling or simply buying more.  I think this is a valuable strategy to use for high-conviction investments that you have built to a comfortable percentage of your portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHIMS on the other hand is a small and new add to the portfolio.\u00a0 I find it interesting and odd to see her buy into something completely new and then lose conviction within weeks.\u00a0 Around the same time she bought HIMS, she also bought BFLY.\u00a0 While she sold out of HIMS during the downturn, she gobbled up more BFLY during the same period.\u00a0 This is what I would expect a fund would do when a new investment they just made goes on sale.  But while she bought more BFLY, she sold out of HIMS.\u00a0 I'm curious if others have found ARK trading around small/new positions frequently (i.e. entering and exiting them completely) or if these types of transactions should be viewed as a more significant change in sentiment toward the underlying company.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDisclosure: I own shares of ARKK, ROKU, HIMS, BFLY\u00a0 (hence why I follow all of them).", "id": "m6n7uy", "created_utc": 1615939591.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "btw, she bought more $BFLY today.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "And sold more HIMS (albeit only 4 shares).", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4465562701225281}, {"body": "I\u2019m so balls deep in BFLY", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3051280379295349}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.359054297208786}, {"body": "Don\u2019t try to follow actively traded funds to match their trades, there are many reasons for them to buy or sell a stock.
