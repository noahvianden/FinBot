Earnings season is picking back up again, with banks leading the charge. We\u2019ve got eight of the largest American banks reporting their financials this week, and I want my slice of the pie. Given that you\u2019ve read my post on [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), or are well versed in theta gang strategies, there\u2019s an awesome opportunity to make some money, as stocks within the financial sector tend to move relatively predictably post-earnings. Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Finance stocks tend to move in tandem with one another**. If one bank tanks, it\u2019s likely that they all will tank. If one succeeds, they all tend to succeed. This is extremely useful to us traders, as these banks report across different days. Since four of the seven banks report on Thursday, we can use their results to \u201cpredict\u201d the direction of their peers who haven\u2019t reported yet. If the three banks are green after reporting earnings on Thursday, the ones who report Friday will likely follow suit. This can be observed across many quarters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral plays are your friend!** Those looking to long or short the financial sector should look to do so through $XLF. Given our observation above, if you\u2019re bullish / bearish on an individual ticker, you should be bullish / bearish on the entire sector. As a result, you can look to make a play on XLF instead of the individual ticker that you planned on playing to give yourself move favourable odds and a larger potential return. More information on that [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$XLF can be used to hedge your plays.** If you want to long or short and individual bank, but don\u2019t want to blindly do so, you can hedge your position by making the opposite play on $XLF. The options on $XLF are very cheap, and the IV is low, allowing you to efficiently shield your capital in the event of a downturn. There\u2019s also a chance you\u2019ll be able to make a risk free arbitrage play as well given that the options are priced awkwardly, resulting in guaranteed profits. Somebody smarter than me would have to run the numbers though, just to be sure. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Many of the reporting companies are historically slow movers.** Your best bet at catching a blowout would likely be through $WFC, $BLK, or $C, as they\u2019ve put up larger moves in more recent times. Unless you\u2019re selling options, I would avoid tickers like $JPM or $GS. You\u2019ll get IV crushed and the move won\u2019t be substantial enough to give a healthy enough return for the risk you\u2019re exposing yourself to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nEight of the largest American banks report earnings this week. I\u2019ve compiled a spreadsheet documenting their historical moves post earnings, alongside some interesting observations about them. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJBJEWMAFKT-C_kXtcIoXYgGp68LqvUVOVfNGhGxlm8/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

{"title": "A TSLA Model Based on Earnings Per EV", "selftext": "Alright guys, I went full on autistic with this model. There will be many words in this post to explain how this model works\n\nFirst, this model is based on the idea that each EV has an average selling price (asp) that is comprised of \"cost-of-goods (cog) per EV,\" \"non-gaap earnings per ev,\" and \"operational/manufacturing cost per ev.\" Here's an artistic, high-quality illustration:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hhoIily\n\nThe strangest value here is \"operational/manufacturing cost per ev.\" It's pretty theoretical so take with a grain of salt. However, it completes my calculations. I'll refer to it as \"operational cost\" moving forward. Anyway, the picture illustrates a formula I've used throughout the model:\n\nASP = COG + earnings per EV + operational cost\n\n\nAlright, here's the sheet. Stand by for a novel on its meaning:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zIxfQ0AxBRXEO_UcuURTkgU9-Fq4cCkUvh_84iOhcN0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAll the black numbers are knowns. Got the ASP's from the shareholder meeting Thursday. Gross margins are gotten from ERs (I excluded reg credits). COG is calculated by ASP*(1 - gross margin). From this point on, all earnings will be non-gaap, I'll just refrain from typing it out. Earnings per ev is calculated by total earnings (EPS*outstanding shares) divided by evs delivered. Once we have ASP, COG and Earnings per EV, the theoretical operational cost is calculated by: ASP - COG - Earnings per ev. The illustration helps understand this.\n\nNow, the mind fuck part are the red numbers which are projections based on trends. The next steps to understanding this model is an assumption on the trend of ASP, COG and the theoretical operational cost.. The assumption is that they follow an exponential decay with an asymptote (i.e. they only get so low, and don't trend all the way to 0). The asymptotes are defined in M2, N2 and O2. These assumptions are that the average price of a Tesla EV will never get lower than $25k (educated guess), the COG will never get lower than $15k (which is 60% lower than where it is today because that's what Elon projects according to the shareholder meeting and other places), and the theoretical operational cost will never get lower than $2k per ev (total guess). After these assumptions, I spent a few long hours of frying my brain to get those ugly ass formulas to project ASP, COG and operational cost into the future. \n\n*warning... math*\nIf you're super interested, the exponential decay is based on this recursive formula: P1 = (P0 - b)*(1 - r) + b where P1 is one iteration past P0, b is the asymptote and r is the rate of decay. If you solve for r you get 1-(P1-b)/(P0-b) which is the \"r\" part of the ugly formulas (but averaged up to 5 past data points) plugged back into the recursive formula. Math :)\n\nOk, so once you project the ASP, COG and operational cost, then you can use the main formula to approximate earnings per EV: earnings per ev = ASP - COG - operational cost. Again, the picture illustrates this. After deriving earnings per ev, and after estimating EVs delievered per quarter (oh by the way, this is estimated with a 10.6% increase per quarter, that's 50% annually.. perhaps low honestly), then we can find earnings per share:\n\nEPS = (earnings per ev * evs delivered) / outstanding shares\n\nand voila! You have estimations on EPS in the future. Looks like a total of $48.29 EPS for all of 2025. Maybe $45 GAAP EPS times an 50 P/E gives $2250/share on EVs alone?", "id": "q5avis", "created_utc": 1633881817.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Do you calculate any software/insurance revenue in the gross margins?\n\nI think the ASP goes down way too fast, for example Q4 2022 not a single car under $40k will have been sold yet the ASP is $41.5k?

Yea I guess the fact that a new model being released is such a discrete event that my numbers only work in the long term? Or maybe it shorts the earnings in the near term.

Well done!\n\nPersonally I\u2019m not too keen on this type of model as it doesn\u2019t look like it links the amount of cars sold with the cost of production - these two aspects should be linked in my opinion and where manufacturing economies of scale comes from. I also think exponential decay is not the best for asp\u2019s which can be more irregular with different model introductions etc. \n\nSome points on the model:\n- you use non-GAAP eps but have excluded reg credits from the gross margin figures, need to include back in reg credits to predict future non-GAAP eps (although reg credits prob tend to zero long term)\n\n- predictive non-GAAP eps estimates should also allow for an increasing share count as more shares are created over time\n\n- the decay on asp\u2019s and gross margins looks a bit too steep to me (subjective). \n\n- the decay on production costs might be ok overall but like I say I prefer to link to the total amount of vehicles made. I get this is a simplified model though. \n\n- Material costs will not likely decay or may even increase. The cost of production decay is more relevant for machinery costs, wages and other overheads. I get you may have wanted to avoid modelling this complexity on purpose though.\n\n- not sure how you came up with sales figures, not checked how they compare with ramp of new products and factories \n\n- not sure how you calc operational costs but if this includes energy products that are roughly breakeven now, may be missing their increased contribution to profitability over next few years. Same for insurance and software revenue.\n\nGood work! You could probably get away using a simplified model like this with minor tweaks to the decay rates and asymptotes.
