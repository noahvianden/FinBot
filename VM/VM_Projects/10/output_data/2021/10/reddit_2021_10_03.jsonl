{"title": "Thoughts on buying KO (Coke) with Pepsi earnings coming up?", "selftext": "Last earnings report, Pepsi had a spectacular earnings, and KO went up along because it was widely thought KO's earning would reflect what Pepsi had. Pepsi's earnings is this Tuesday pre market, and I was thinking about picking up KO on Monday as a short term play (a few months), but can evolve into a long term play depending on how things turn out. I have two main reasons:\n\n1. I think the earnings will beat again. More and more people are starting to go out not only in the United States, but also around the world. Restaurants have more people, movies have more people, travel, and many more.\n2. KO can pass inflation costs down to consumers. With high inflation uncertainty, at worst case, KO can just increase the price, and consumers will pay the price of inflation, and earnings will probably continue to increase. People may start parking their money into stocks that can make consumers front the inflation cost, so this would be good for KO\n\nThough one concern I have about a short term play is how hard are the supply chain issues hitting KO (if at all). The Pepsi earnings may have supply chain issues, which may rattle investors for KO alike. Though if this is the case, I think I'll just change my strategy to long, as I think it will be a \"safer\" stock to hold throughout the upcoming year, two, or three with inflation and Fed tapering / increasing rates.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
