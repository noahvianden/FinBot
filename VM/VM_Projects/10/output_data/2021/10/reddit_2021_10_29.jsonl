{"title": "Nvidia Corporation (Ticker: NVDA) - Brief Breakdown", "selftext": "For my full breakdown check the link [here.](https://greencandleinvestments.substack.com/p/nvidia-corporation-ticker-nvda-brief?r=ksa6f&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompany Description  \nNvidia Corporation is a visual computing company that designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The GPU segment offers processors, which include GeForce for PC gaming and mainstream PCs; GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming; Quadro for design professionals working in computer-aided design, video editing, special effects, Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing deep learning, accelerated computing, general purpose computing, and much more. NVIDIA sells their products directly to manufacturers and system builders and is one of the leaders in the chip manufacturing industry.  \n\n\nQuantitative Analysis  \nAt the time of this writing (10/10/2021), NVDA is trading at $208.31 with a 52 week range of $115.66 - $230.43 and a market cap of $519.11B. In Q2 of their fiscal year 2022, NVDA\u2019s revenue was $6.51 billion, up 68% year over year. NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue grew 85% year over year to $3.06 billion. The data center revenue grew 35% year over year to $2.37 billion. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \\*100) of NVDA is 39.25% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 32.33%. The price to earnings (price per share / earnings per share) ratio was 74.61 and the debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 0.83.  \n\n\nQualitative Analysis  \nNvidia is a global leader in the growing industry of computer chip manufacturers and supplies major companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The COVID pandemic brought a massive increase in demand for computer chips and supply simply could not keep up, leading to the ongoing chip shortage around the world. The impact of the chip shortage is particularly evident in the automotive industry, where new car manufacturing has fallen dramatically and prices of both new and used vehicles continue to hit all time highs month after month. Outside of traditional computing usages, Nvidia has a unique opportunity to integrate into the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\u00a0 In order to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, computers and mining processors need chips similar to what Nvidia creates. There are countless other uses for chips and potentially other uses of chips that have yet to be discovered. With the increasing need and the backing of a large investment from Nancy Pelosi, there\u2019s positive momentum behind one of the global leaders in chip manufacturing.  \n\n\nBullish Thesis  \n1. Backing of Nancy Pelosi Investment: \u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u2019s investment activity has gained a lot of traction and attention, a Twitter account has even been created that now has over 114k followers to track her investments. As mentioned above, Pelosi has a significant investment of $6.5 million in Nvidia. As outlined in the article, Pelosi has had extreme success and retail traders who have shadowed Pelosi have also seen incredible returns. Although this isn\u2019t a bullish point based on the fundamentals of the company, you cannot ignore the success of Pelosi\u2019s investments.  \n\n\n2. Increasing Demand: There are more and more products in need of chips. With increasing artificial intelligence in \u00a0vehicles and chips being placed in everyday products, the need for Nvidia\u2019s products will continue to increase.  \n\n\n3. Major Suppliers: Nvidia supplies chips to major companies such as Amazon, NIO the automated car manufacturer, Facebook, Google, and Tesla currently use Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips. With major companies using their chips, it provides a safety net for sales of Nvidia\u2019s products.  \n\n\nBearish Thesis  \n1. Competition: There are a number of other major chip manufacturing companies that offer NVDA stiff competition. Although Nvidia holds a strong position in chip market share, investors should keep a close eye on several other chip manufacturers. Competitors include: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM).  \n\n\n2. Short-term supply chain issues for semiconductors: The demand for semiconductor chips skyrocketed during the pandemic, leaving many manufacturers unable to keep up. This has been particularly evident in the automotive market, where the chip shortage is estimated to cost auto makers \\~210B dollars. Worse still, some have estimated that the chip shortage could continue into 2022 and even 2023. It\u2019s apparent that chip manufacturing companies have had a hard time scaling production, likely due to a number of supply-chain and other COVID-related issues. With demand likely to remain steady, NVDA will be pressured to scale up production and increase supply - time will tell how successful they are in doing so.  \n\n\n3. Automakers designing their own chips: The chip shortage has caused new car production - and thus supply and sales - to plummet over the last year. Because of the low supply, both new and used car prices have skyrocketed to record highs. Rather than simply wait for chip manufacturing companies to catch up, some automakers have started to consider designing and manufacturing chips internally. For example, Tesla has already begun making their own chips and one of GM\u2019s China joint ventures announced in September that they would begin designing their own chips. If chip manufacturing companies are unable to meet demand, expect more large companies with R&D funds to follow Tesla and GM.\u00a0 \u00a0", "id": "qi20v7", "created_utc": 1635472505.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Still waiting for the nvda and arm deal.

{"title": "Why I think BRGO is an undervalued gem", "selftext": " \n\nBRGO is in my opinion the most undervalued company in the entire market.\n\nAs of right now, the share price is .0055. There are 833m oustanding shares...833m\\*.0055=4.6m mkt cap. Thats crazy freaking low. The 2q21 revenues were 2.1m with a low cost of goods sold (it was 300-400k). The revenue in 2q20? $77k. Thats freaking 30x growth for a company with a 4.6m mkt cap. You just dont see that.\n\nThe 3q21 revenue will be even better because it will be the first full qrtr with recently acquired subsidiary gearbubble. Gearbubble, btw did 20M+ revenue in 2020 (BRGO owns 50%, so assume $10m / yr from gbubble revenues). In addition their acquisition before gearbubble, aphrodite, recently launched on amazon to great success. Actually won new product awards on Amazon. In fact, Aphrodite is doing so well on Amazon, the company recently announced they will be leasing a giant factory w Armenia (w 130 workers) to keep up with the demand.\n\nYou just dont see jewelers with this level of vertical integration. All the big dogs source. But because BRGO has vertical integration, their gross margin is over 80%!!\n\nSo you have a company that did 30x revenue in 2q21 (vs 2q20) and is now selling so much product, they need a new factory (which also helps drastically reduce cost of manufacturing). And not only is 3q21 looking bright (when the financials drop, cant wait)....But the 4q21 financials will be even better....Why? Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas. Fourth quarter is a darn good time to be a jeweler.\n\nIn a 10/13 video from a conference - the CEO projects $40m in revenue in 2022, with $4m net profit. You just dont see that from a 4.6m mkt cap company. And we are starting to see the evidence of these eye-popping projections. As mentioned 2q21 revenue was 30x 2q20.\n\nSo heres the big question? Why is the share price so low? And the answer is dilution. You see OTC is unfortunately pretty much run by twitter pumpers, and they dont care about the underlying company. All they care about is no dilution because if the share structure remains constant- they and friends can load big and then pump it to their twitter audience. And a notorious one, Delarge, just got arrested yesterday. The twitter pumpers wont touch BRGO because it has a bad history of dilution. But heres the thing -\n\nWhen a company sells shares, it opens an s-1 or a shelf offering. A filing with the sec, to inform folks that they will be selling shares from the treasury, from time to time. BRGO had 2 shelf offerings this year. And all the noobs and scammers are like f that company - dilution. But here's the thing. This dilution was literally the only way the company could pay for the huge acquisitions of gbubble and aphrodite. Noobs say, all dilution bad. Experienced investors say - well, what was the capital raise used for? Where are the funds going? And 100% of the money raised by BRGO's offerings went to the Aphrodite and Gbubble purchases. So its beaten up, like heck, right now. The share price I mean, not the company. But its a great freaking time to get in, because now the worst of the dilution is behind us - and the share price is in the toilet. But the company is doing well and using the raised capital wisely. There is no need to really dilute heavily further (there may be a little more dilution, but not much, from the former aphrodite owners cashing in their notes/warrants - but it isnt big money). But the past- BRGO had no choice but to dilute because the revenue just wasnt there. But after the 2 acquisitions, they are making enough in revenue to fund growth organically.\n\nThis company is an absolute gem and nobody wants to touch it. You just dont see $5m mkt cap companies with 30x growth - w upside even more than that. I think that when the 3q financials drop, we'll see another big uptick in revenue and it will be too hard to ignore. Good time to \"buy it when its quiet\". As we've all noticed, most of the posts here are on positions already taken off, because ppl are excited and the buzz is everywhere....But this is a different kind of play. This stock hasnt taken off, but I do think the 3q21 and the 4q21 financials will serve as great catalysts. Also, in a recent 10/13 video - the CEO spoke to 2 unannounced acquisitions. When BRGO acquired aphrodite, the share price spiked to .06 , when they acquired gbubble .03. Currently at .0055 (as I write this).\n\nKnow this - fundamentals always matter in the end. Maybe not to the twitter pumpers, but to real investors they do. If the share price is still this low at this time next year (i dont think it will) but if it is the company will be doing $5m in revenue / qrtr **at least** and will start buying back shares. A company making $20-40m in revenue / yr with profit - which is what BRGO looks like it will be in 2022 - just wont stay at a $5m mkt cap for long.\n\nI couldnt be more bullish on this company, im still buying and am not looking to take any profit below $.025/share. As mentioned, its at .0055.\n\nTy for reading.", "id": "qid7xn", "created_utc": 1635515276.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "I'd like to get some but E-Trade is telling me to pound sand", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "sorry your broker has you locked out.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Oct 29, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities.\n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated\n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year\n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year\n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year\n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year\n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year\n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year\n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap.\n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high.

Too much is on the line and I believe the us will enforce a strict embargo against on China and force their hand. \n\n   Like with TSMC, AMD traded in a channel for almost a year with the last couple months barely staying over 80 a crucial support yet although sentiment was crushed AMD just like TSMC was beating earnings after earnings and trading at the same if not lower level. Now TSMC has the lowest PE in the industry (higher than intel but cmon) with massive cash on hand and massive investments into semiconductors. TSMC has been trading flat since January whereas AMD was last July of 2020. \n\n Everything I said is just a semi educated guess but I imagine this may trade flat for another couple days and when all hope seems lost it will finally pick up again even the lowest analyst prediction sit above 130. With factories being built in US, EU, Japan massive subsidy packages from these nations we could see a supercycle for semiconductors for the next 5-7 years\n\nThe numbers are their these supply chain issues are temporary so is the Taiwan China fears.
