{"title": "Wall Street Crash of 1929: Everything You Need To Know", "selftext": "Wall Street Crash of 1929\n\n\nA stock market crash is a sudden decline in stock prices across a large section of the stock market. A stock market crash generally occurs after a period of panic selling. \n\nGenerally in periods of high economic optimism, stock prices can become higher than their true value, if this optimism fades, market participants become likely to sell stocks at a lower value.\n\nAs stock values decrease, panic sales can set in, causing the stock market to crash. The\u00a0stock market crash of 1929, also known as the\u00a0Wall Street Crash 1929\u00a0\u00a0was one of the largest stock market crash in the history of the United States.\n\nAfter a decade of huge prosperity and predictions of permanently high share values, a decline in real estate prices culminated in the Stock Market showing signs of instability in the summer of 1929.\n\nThe stock market had risen to a record high in September 1929 due to public investors being infatuated with rising prices (and profits) and thus ploughing huge amounts of money into stocks. Investment trusts (those who bought stocks and shares on behalf of their members) were becoming more and more widely used also.\n\nDue to how lucrative buying and selling shares appeared, investors were routinely borrowing more than two thirds of the face value of stocks they were buying. When the stock market began to show signs of instability, those who had borrowed began to fear they wouldn\u2019t get back what they had paid and began to panic sell.\n\n\n\nBlack Tuesday:\n\nOn Tuesday October 29, 1929, or \u201cBlack Tuesday\u201d as it is more commonly known, stock prices plummeted and continued to do so for a month afterwards. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (an indicator of stock prices based on US stocks of 30 large industrial companies) fell 38 points to 260.\n\nThis was a 12.8% drop in one day as panic selling kicked off. Over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 23% in total, and dropped 40% by the week of November 11th from the September high.\n\nThe Stock Market crash of 1929 was the major event that lead to the Great Depression, a severe economic depression, that spread through developed countries globally and lasted for over 10 years.\n\nEffects of the Great Depression were suffered worldwide. In the USA unemployment rose to 25%, while it exceeded 30% in other developed countries. Personal income, tax revenue, profit, and international trade dropped by over half of their previous value.\n\n\n\nBlack Monday:\n\nThe Stock Market crash of 1929 wasn\u2019t the only market crash in the 20th century though. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 22.6% on \u201cBlack Monday\u201d in the Stock Market Crash of 1987, the greatest single day loss in history.\n\n\nThe\u00a0stock market crash of 2008 wasn\u2019t far behind, either, with a 21% drop in a week, 7% less than 1987. That said, no single stock market crash has ever had such devastating effects as 1929 as yet.\n\n\nAudio: [Wall Street Crash of 1929](https://www.karmanullify.com/stock-market-crash-of-1929/)", "id": "qd7v85", "created_utc": 1634871664.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Damn I wonder who bought the dip", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I can\u2019t wait I\u2019m gonna be all over it, never let a good crisis go to waste", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Remember the bottom took 3 months.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1464187502861023}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11890389025211334}, {"body": "Fuck that, I wonder who shorted the peak!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Jesse Lauriston Livermore shorted the market and made 100 million dollars on Black Tuesday 1929.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That's not adjusted for inflation, is it?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, that\u2019s what he actually made.

Everyone thought that the crash was over, when the real recession came. And still during the latter half on 1930, everyone still thought that it was a mild recession which was about to pass any minute.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 25th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 25th, 2021.\n\n# **Big Tech earnings in the week ahead could test stocks\u2019 recent rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/earnings-alphabet-apple-results-could-test-stocks-recent-rally.html)**\n*****\n> An earnings avalanche is coming in the week ahead that could put the stock market\u2019s recent gains to the test.\n*****\n> Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 the biggest of big cap tech \u2014 are among the 30% of the S&P 500 companies reporting. A third of the Dow also releases results, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Merck, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s.\n*****\n> \u201cNext week is the real test,\u201d RBC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a little bit in every sector.\u201d\n*****\n> Of the companies that have already reported, nearly 84% beat estimates. Earnings are so far expected to be up 34.8% over last year, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n> \u201cThe tug-of-war in good versus bad earnings reports has landed in favor of the market with the S&P hitting an all-time high [Thursday]. That may run into difficulty next week,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. \u201cWe may finally be seeing some cracks in the earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh records this week, and the indexes have solid gains for the week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% to 4,544, while the Dow ended the week up 1.1% at 35,677, the first record close since Aug. 16. Some strategists view the return to those highs as a signal the market is on track for a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The Nasdaq Composite was also 1.3% higher for the week, but it was down 0.8% on Friday as tech stocks declined.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re going to learn a lot from this reporting season,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cSo far, so good. Better than feared, with no change to underlying demand. Companies are still managing through for the most part. Investors are punishing companies that aren\u2019t, but they\u2019re not punishing the whole market. The market seems very rational right now.\u201d\n*****\n> For instance, Intel shares were pummeled, falling more than 11.6% on Friday, after the company\u2019s sales missed expectations. Intel warned an industry-wide component shortage hurt its PC chip business. But other semiconductor stocks did not get pulled down in the decline. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was down about 0.8%.\n*****\n> But Snap sent an industry-wide warning Thursday when its quarterly revenues missed expectations. The company reported that Apple\u2019s privacy changes introduced earlier this year affected its advertising business. The company also said that advertisers were holding back due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.\n*****\n> Facebook\u2019s earnings on Monday will be closely watched for any similar comments, as will reports from Alphabet and Twitter Tuesday. The three stocks fell Friday as Snap plunged 26.6%. Facebook lost more than 5%.\n*****\n> \u201cFacebook has been the more broken name. It had the Instagram problem. It had the kid problem. It\u2019s had a hard time going up post-earnings. It will be interesting to see if all these problems are priced in or does it go even lower,\u201d T3Live.com chief strategic officer Scott Redler said.\n*****\n> Redler said the Snap news was a big surprise, since traders viewed social media as immune to supply chain problems. Even though social media was under pressure as a whole Friday, he said stocks have been able to diverge within sectors recently.\n*****\n> \u201cTesla was able to make a new high, and Netflix is at an all-time high. Every group has winners and losers, but overall the participation is better than it\u2019s been in a while. Five stocks aren\u2019t driving the S&P to the all-time highs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of stocks in every sector.\u201d\n*****\n> Traders are now watching the Russell 2000, since a breakout in small caps would be a positive for the overall market, he said. Redler trades the the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which closed slightly lower at $227.41 Friday. \u201cIf the IWM gets above the $230 to $234 area, it could be a signal for more risk on at the end of the year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Redler said the market could be challenged in the coming week. \u201cYou just had a big 10-day move up. You would think there will be some digestion,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to chase the market here. It feels like we could rest a little bit next week. If it could digest here, and we could get some individual stock movement, that would be healthier than the pain trade, which is straight up.\u201d\n*****\n> There are a few important economic reports in the week ahead, including durable goods Wednesday; third-quarter GDP Thursday and personal consumption expenditures Friday. Friday\u2019s data includes the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n> # Higher interest rates\n> The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield continued to edge higher in the past week, touching 1.70% before falling to 1.64% Friday. Market pros are watching to see if the yield will reach 1.74%, the closing high from March, and whether it will begin to worry stock investors. The 10-year yield hit this year\u2019s intraday high of 1.776% on March 30.\n*****\n> \u201cI would say over the next week or two, it\u2019s possible we test it, but I would be a little surprised at this stage if it sustainably breaks through,\u201d NatWest Markets\u2019 John Briggs said. He noted that yields have been moving higher, as investors now anticipate the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year and as the market anticipates more inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cI get a sense that people are more interested in buying here rather than selling,\u201d he said. Bond yields move inversely to price. It could be a busy week in the market, as investors adjust for the end of the month\n*****\n> Briggs notes the front end, or the 2-year note yield, has moved faster than the longer end. He said that reflects the market\u2019s increased expectation for rate hikes next year, with two hikes expected by the market in the second half of the year.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/VHRvq4g.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GPW3ELW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/gxOdKKa.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/pFe6Dod.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/blUbzGe.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rSNImSi.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zZo8jst.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pIO1QVg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7AIyZJw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LifEF77.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8JenQWV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cnotroE.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zsZucxj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 9 Charts We Are Watching\n\n> Here are a handful charts that caught our attention recently.\n\n> Yesterday was the 34-year anniversary of the Crash of \u201987. To this day market pundits still don\u2019t quite agree on what caused the crash. As only Art Cashin can scribe, here were some of the worries at the time that lead to the more than 20% one-day crash on Black Monday: a historically overbought market (the S&P 500 Index was up more than 40% for the year in August); worries over a currency war with Germany; a historic storm in London that closed markets the Friday before the crash, concentrated selling on the New York Stock Exchange; First Lady Nancy Reagan possibly being admitted to the hospital with breast cancer; and even potential worries over engaging with Iran. At the end of the day, stocks up more than 40% for the year in August was likely much of the trigger, as that is a very stretched rubber band.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The S&P 500 finally pulled back 5% a few weeks ago, after not doing so for nearly a year. But remember, the great majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 have already corrected at least 10%, with many down even more. This rolling correction has done a number on overall investor confidence though. According to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, managers were the least bullish they\u2019ve been since October 2020 and cash levels hit the highest level in 12 months. \u201cIt might be clich\u00e9 to say, but many managers moved to cash on the 5% pullback, leaving plenty of cash on the sidelines to eventually push stocks higher again,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, historically the S&P 500 forms a major low near the end of October and has a nice rally to end most years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-chart-3-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Building on the late October period, remember that the last few days of October and first few of November are historically one of the most bullish periods of the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blog-chart-4-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> A post-election year tends to see stocks bottom a tad earlier in late September. So far, this year is following this template nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> November is quietly one of the best months of the year. In fact, it is the best month since 1950 and over the past decade. The past 20 years it is the second best month and in post-election years it ranks second as well. \u201cNo matter how you slice it, November is known for turkeys, but maybe it should be known for bulls as well,\u201d exclaimed Ryan Detrick.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-6.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The S&P 500 is less than half a percent away from its first new high since September 2. Remember, it has made a new high every single month so far this year. Should it make another new high in October it could remain on target to join 2014 as the only year to have a new high every single month.\n\n> (Trivia stat \u2013 The S&P 500 peaked on September 2 in 2020 before a near 10% correction over the following weeks. This year it also peaked on September 2, but it is looking like 5% may be the most we\u2019ll see to the downside this time.)\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.1.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Speaking of new all-time highs, the S&P 500 has made 54 so far this year, one of the most ever. The record of 78 appears to be safe, but with a late year rally this year could go down as the second most ever.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As we noted at the start of the month, stocks have historically done quite well in October during an odd numbered year\u2014years without an election around the corner and no pre-election jitters. Well, 2021 is following suit once again, as the S&P 500 is already up nearly 5% for the month, which would be the best month of October for the index since 2015.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-9.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So there you have it, 9 charts we are watching closely as we wind down 2021.\n\n*****\n\n> # An Impressive 2021 So Far, But Flows Are Slowing\n\n> Yesterday the Investment Company Institute updated weekly fund flow numbers for the US mutual fund and ETF industry. As shown in the chart below, total mutual fund flows were positive this year but compared to the performance of ETFs, the inflows have been only modest at best. ETFs have logged more than $700bn in inflows, and while mutual funds avoided a fourth straight net outflow, their $66bn in inflows wasn\u2019t that impressive. Across mutual funds and ETFs, bonds have been the massive winner this year, with more than $500bn in inflows. Equity funds record outflows over time as a mechanical result of equity retirements, but this year inflows have been the largest since 2014 with more than $210bn in buying across mutual funds and ETFs. About a quarter of total equity fund inflows so far this year have been dedicated to funds buying the domestic stock market. That\u2019s the best year for domestic equity fund flows since 2014, and breaks a string of five consecutive years of outflows, though net flows have been stable for months now.\n\n> This analysis was first published last night in The Closer, Bespoke's end-of-day macro note.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-ICI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Late October Is the To Time Buy Stocks\n\n> As it is written in the 2021 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac on October 21 on page 97, late October is the time to buy depressed stocks, especially techs and small caps. In the chart here taken from page 112 of the 2021 Almanac we divide daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by the Russell 1000 index of the largest stocks since July 1, 1979, and then compress into a one-year seasonal pattern from July to June. When the graph is descending large caps are outperforming small caps; when the graph is rising, small caps are moving up faster than large caps. This year has been rather typical.\n\n> You will remember the November 2020 was a month for the record books for the Russell 2000. And then R2K topped out in March 2021 and has been lagging the big cap indexes since spring. Over the past couple of days the R2K appears to be perking up right on schedule. We just released a new small/mi-cap stock basket to subscribers in order to take advantage of the \u201cBest Months\u201d of the year (November through April/June) for stocks on the heels of our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aae7f1b09323bac024fb7b094cfa9a24/662713d85e5875a3-3a/s500x750/6ba900c108940a7357d25668b92022391020247b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Road and Rail Soar Above Air Freight\n\n> One major economic trend of the past several months has been supply chain constraints including logistics issues. Now in the throes of earnings season, earnings of companies related to supply chains and logistics (whether that be people or parcels) are beginning to roll in with four such names reporting in the past day alone: Kansas City Southern (KSU), United Airlines (UAL), Marten Transport (MRTN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX). In the table below, we show all the S&P 1500 Transportation Industry stocks that have reported since late September. Most of these stocks have beaten estimates on the top and bottom line with a few exceptions. While it is the one furthest in the rearview now, FedEx (FDX) was perhaps the worst of these missing EPS estimates and lowering guidance. KNX, on the other hand, reported a triple play this morning; one of the first companies to do so thus far in earnings season.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn-1.png))**\n\n> Two more transportation names, CSX (CSX) and Landstar System (LSTR), are also set to report earnings after the closing bell today, and over a dozen other names will follow up in the next week alone. These names could potentially be interesting areas to look for anecdotes regarding broader supply chain issues pressuring the economy, but turning to the stock price reactions, Saia (SAIA) has averaged the largest single-day gain on earnings averaging a 2.5% move across its 60 past earnings reports. Old Dominion (ODFL), Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), Hub Group (HUBG), and XPO Logistics (XPO) are the only others that have averaged greater than 1% gains in reaction to earnings. C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Avis Budget (CAR), on the other hand, have historically averaged the worst reactions to earnings of this industry.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn.png))**\n\n> While there are still plenty of companies within the industry left to report providing plenty of catalysts for moves, since the closing low on September 30th, the transports have seen solid performance with an 8.79% gain through today. That move has not only lifted the industry above its 50 and 200-DMAs but it has also broken the downtrend that has been in place since the spring. Currently, the group is still down 6.1% from its 52-week high.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 1-Year After 7-Month Winning Streak\u2013S&P 500 Gains 6.37%\n\n> Going back to 1950, S&P 500 has enjoyed 15 streaks of consecutive monthly gains lasting 7 or months. The most recent streak came to an end with September\u2019s full-month decline. The longest consecutive monthly winning streak lasted 11 months and occurred twice, from September 1953 to July 1954 and from March 1958 to January 1959. S&P 500\u2019s average gain during these monthly winning streaks has been a solid 25.86%. The smallest gain was 9.09% ending March 1993 while the largest was a whopping 53.53% ending in April 1983. When past streaks ended, S&P 500 performance following tended to be mixed and rather tepid compared to its performance during the winning streak. The month after the streak ends, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year after performance appears in the table above.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20211019_7_Mon_Streaks.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sentiment Surge\n\n> Over the past couple of weeks, the S&P 500 has reversed higher, and the index is now only a few basis points away from the September 2nd closing high. With the rally, sentiment has taken a sharp turn towards optimism. The AAII reading on bullish sentiment rose for a second week in a row, climbing 9 percentage points to 46.9%. That is the highest reading on bullish sentiment since the week of July 1.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> While this week's increase was large, it comes on top of a double-digit rise last week. In total, bullish sentiment has climbed 21.4 percentage points in the past two weeks alone. That is the first time since November of last year that bullish sentiment has risen by at least 20 percentage points in two weeks. Going through the history of the survey, there have only been 17 other periods in which there were similar moves without another occurrence in at least six months. Overall, these instances have consistently seen the S&P 500 move higher in the following weeks and months with larger than normal average and median gains. That is except for one year out in which performance has been slightly worse than the norm.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-20-pp-1.png))**\n\n> With the big jump in bullish sentiment recently, bearish sentiment has pulled back to 27.8%. That is the lowest reading since September 9th and the third week in a row in which bearish sentiment has moved lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n> With inverse moves to bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread stayed in positive territory for the second week in a row as bulls outnumber bears by the widest margin since the first week of July.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**\n\n> Big gains to bulls also borrowed heavily from neutral sentiment as that reading fell from 30.3% to 25.4%. Similar to bearish sentiment, that is the lowest reading since early last month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n> As for some other readings on sentiment, the NAAIM Exposure index measuring investment managers' exposure to US equities has also made a significant move higher this week. Readings in this index range from -200 to 200 where (-)200 would indicate responding managers are leveraged long (short), (-)100 would be fully invested long (short), and a reading of zero would be market neutral. At the end of last month, the reading fell to a low of 55 which was the weakest level since May. While the past two weeks only saw modest improvements, this week there was a surge all the way up to 98. The 33.6 point increase ranks as the fifth-largest week over week moves on record in the index dating back to 2006.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.25.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9P8zinF.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2hDtItC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  10.26.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kRoRUQp.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/28eYMaO.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/B5gGP4j.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xENeVQa.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ug3RYOX.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JiBhXlp.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.27.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qNHVTo5.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4cFr5Ao.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ygeEd7g.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0ertV7Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.28.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PiAq7vH.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8JwlIW3.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/8JwlIW3.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.28.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/au55Htc.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cwYP4JT.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/WObtzHd.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.29.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/0yqFFpx.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cRDWQGD.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.29.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)", "id": "qdt6qu", "created_utc": 1634945958.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Appreciate you.
