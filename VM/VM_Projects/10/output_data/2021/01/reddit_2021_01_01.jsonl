{"title": "Teladoc Health. Buy for 2021?", "selftext": "Hi all, Happy New Years to you all! I hope we all have a better year in 2021.\n\nI wanted to post about Teladoc Health. Let me know if any of this information is incorrect, but I am just posting what I've found online. I think this is an extremely interesting and unique investment. They are the global leader in telemedicine, and I believe this is the way the future is moving. A study showed that 76% of consumers are interested in virtual care after COVID, as opposed to only 11% of people showing interest before COVID. I think COVID has made a permanent, ever lasting change in the way people view health and virtual appointments. 33% of people said they would leave their current physician to access virtual care as an alternative, and 66% of patients want their current physician to partner with a telehealth provider so that they can access care virtually.\n\nThe generalized bull care for virtual health is; 1. Saves doctors and patients time travelling to and from the place of appointment, 2. Patients are more comfortable to do appointments from the comfort of their home, 3. Insurers will almost guaranteed charge less for virtual appointments. The generalized bear case would show that virtual care cannot provide sufficient details as a physical appointment would, and you cannot check normal vitals such as blood pressure, etc. Most of the time the doctor will send you for bloodwork anyways, so accessing that prescription online is completely fine.\n\nBasing most of these financials off of their latest release (3Q2020). YoY Q3 revenues increased 109% to 289M. Total visits increased 206% to 2.8 million for the quarter. For the first 3 quarters, their revenue grew 79% to 711M and total visits increased 163% to 7.6 million. For the FULL fiscal year 2020, their **revenue is expected to grow 96% to 1.09B**. Assuming the 4th quarter visits are the same, they should have around **10 million visits for the full year**, which would be **\\~140% visitation growth YoY** (in financial statements they actually say around 10.5 million visits is expected, so a little more than 140%). It is clear visits are skyrocketing and revenues are growing very quick as well. Net loss per share in 2019 was 1.38, as opposed to the expected net loss per share in 2020 to be 1.28, just a 7% increase. This would put Teladoc at a 27 P/S ratio, pretty high; and earnings are still heavily negative. They are going to burn over 100M in losses this year, and with only 1.19B in cash and 1B in debt; the fundamentals don't look all that fantastic.\n\nLooking forward, the EPS for 2021 are expected to be a loss of 54 (per share), a 58% increase YoY, up from the expected 7% for 2020. Revenues are expected to climb aggressively again to 1.95B, an 80% increase YoY. According to 22 analysts Teladoc's first profitable year will be 2023, where they will make 163M. So based off 2 more years of losses, this means if they continue business as is they will burn less than 200M of their 1B cash, and perhaps can use that remaining cash to worry about short term debt (which they have a lot). I could also see them doing another offering of shares to raise capital one last time for continued aggressive expansion.\n\nTeladoc has had a 67% CAGR in revenue from 2015-2020, so this basically demolishes the idea that it is a \"COVID stock\" or \"stay-at-home stock\". It has had consistent growth since 2015, but this isn't to say that COVID hasn't helped them. COVID has forced/gave people the choice to move their healthcare virtually, and Teladoc claims they have a 90% client retention rate. Meaning most people who try Teladoc once, continue to use it, a great sign. Just looking back into 2018 until now, they have provided free telehealth visits for those affected by Hurricane Florence, Lane, Laura and Sally - as well as California/Western Wildfires. With a 90% retention rate a lot of the individuals who take advantage of these visits probably stay on as permanent Teladoc patients; a fantastic business move while giving positive press regarding the company. In 2019 Teladoc also partnered with Johnston Group - in which 30,000 small to medium sized businesses with the Chambers of Commerce Group Insurance Plan would be able to use their platform.\n\n**Intel** recently donated to the **World Telehealth Initiative (WTI)**, a non-profit organization who will leverage Teladoc's telemedicine platform to expand access to care in less developed countries. Teladoc Health has received an endorsement from the **National Labor Alliance of Health Care Coalitions (NLA)** \\[the largest alliance of labor unions and labor management coalitions\\] and 2 accreditations though **ClearHealth Quality Institute Telemedicine Accreditation Program (TAP)**. Nationally recognized agencies are giving Teladoc public compliments. Just added publicity is good.\n\nThey have expanded to give access to virtual healthcare, nutrition services with access to actual nutritionists, mental health care services with access to psychiatrists/psychologists. Teladoc has presence in **175+ countries**, and 60 of the top 100 hospitals use Teladoc and Livongo solutions to run their operations. With the acquisition of Livongo, Teladoc has added another exceptional dimension to its business. Livongo provides managed care for chronic illness patients; it collects data and leans on artificial intelligence to come up with solutions and tips those patients to live healthier lives. On their own, Livongo are a positive earning company and have only captured 1% of their addressable market in the U.S. Primarily they deal with diabetic patients and have near-doubled their diabetic patient count in each of the last 4 years. Paired with Teladoc, Livongo believes they can offer its services to over 50,000 members with diabetes; and their solutions can be applied to many more chronic illnesses.\n\nTeladoc also acquired **MedecinDirect** \\- the market leading telemedicine provider in France. In September 2018 they announced Teladoc Global Care Services - 24/7 worldwide service. Looking at the global growth we can see from 2017 to 2019; revenue from outside-of-the-U.S sources was 19M, 75M, 108M in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Just for reference; revenue from inside-the-U.S sources was 215M, 343M, and 445M in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. We can see that the proportion of revenue from outside of the U.S is growing on a % basis - a very good sign for Teladoc; meaning their goal of diversifying and expanding their network is working. In 2020 over 20% of their revenue will come from outside the U.S.\n\nThe average rating from 27 analysts is $242.78, a 20% upside from current price, with a high of $305, over 50% upside from current price. Yahoo rates Teladoc a 2.1 between a Hold (3) and a Buy (2) - closer to a Buy. On SeekingAlpha it is rated at just above a 4, which implies Bullish. Walletinvestor expects a 1-Year Forecast of $340 (71% upside), and a 5-Year Forecast of $873 (335% upside). Govcapital gives a 1-Year Forecast of $345 (73% upside), and a 5-Year Forecast of $1335 (565% upside).\n\nSome of these values are slightly rounded, taken as of December 31, 2020. **ARKK**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 4.31% (3,882,585 shares at a value of $790,377,828). **ARKW**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 3.53% (933,334 shares at a value of $189,998,802). **ARKG**'s 3rd largest holding is TDOC at 5.75% (2,249,762 shares at a value of $457,984,050). **ARKF**'s 36th largest holding is TDOC at 1.05% (103,554 shares at a value of $21,080,488). Together this means that 4 of the 5 ARK funds hold this company. The 4 funds that do have Teladoc shares have **7,169,235 shares** at a value of **$1,459,441,168**, or an average share price of **$203.57/share** (a 1.8% downside off of December 31, 2020 closing price). In the past few weeks/months ARK funds have been buying into this company heavily. Do we really think they would invest 1.5 billion USD into it if they didn't believe it would be a good company, with good growth, near and long term?\n\nIn total there is 61% institutional holding. There is also 6% insider holding, meaning they have a lot of money in the company. In the past 12 months insiders have sold 822,242 shares and bought 104,618 shares. That means a net of 717, 624 share sold, which makes sense because it had a huge growth year.\n\nTeladoc has a very high volatility it seems, with over 10% of shares shorted as of December 15, 2020. This is down from November in which 15% of shares were shorted. So if you are currently, or looking to invest into the Teladoc Health company, expect a high level of volatility.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I do **NOT** hold a position in Teladoc but am heavily eyeing it. I think it shows great signs of a growth company. Another really large benefit is they are a medical stock; they do nothing but good for the people. They provide healthcare virtually in regions where doctors give insufficient care or where there is no care at all. Who doesn't want to invest in something that helps people while also getting good returns? I personally think that it seems like a sound company for a small position.\n\nAny discussion would be awesome! As always, **do your own due diligence**, I highly encourage it. Into the New Year I wish everyone well wishes, and good luck!\n\nWhat does everyone think about Teladoc Health? Do they believe it is just a \"stay-at-home stock\"?

{"title": "My Custom Stock Screener Findings", "selftext": "# The Metric\n\nI recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric \"Price Elasticity\" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.\n\n* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days\n* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days\n\nUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))\n\n# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?\n\nI made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.\n\n1. **Irrational** \\- Upturn elasticity > 1, Downturn elasticity < 0\n2. **Responsible** \\- Upturn elasticity > 1, 0 < Downturn elasticity < 1\n\nWith any stock I want an upturn elasticity > 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The \"Irrational\" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as \"Irrational\". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.\n\nThen there are \"Responsible\" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is <1 and >0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.\n\nSome popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.\n\n# Link to the 99 stocks found:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been \"invented\") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.\n\nEdit: Happy New Year", "id": "kogze1", "created_utc": 1609528327.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "The metric is known as \"Beta\", specifically: Upside Beta and Downside Beta.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly, comparing individual stock change to market change is nothing new, merely shows its comparative risk profile.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Does beta have a direct correlation to a stock's implied volatility?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": " Generally there should be a direct positive correlation. \n\nBeta originates from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CPM) where it factors the risk premium.
