{"title": "Bearish on GameStop (obviously), but prefer to not go broke trying", "selftext": "Let me start by saying I spent a LOT of time in EB Games (for the snootier game player - Electronics \"Boutique\") and Babbage's as a wee lad.  I've liked video games since I was exposed to the Atari 2600.  The NES practically changed my world - it definitely added the occasional blister to my thumb.  GameStop (Ticker: GME) is the remaining company having [swallowed up](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-corp-and-electronics-boutique-holdings-corp-sign) pretty much all the other game stores (and closed many of them).  Let's take a brief (for me) look at the bearish and bullish case and then provide a way that one can play these squeezes with a bearish bent without going broke. \\[insert this is for educational purposes only and realistically if someone \\*cough\\* that made $13M has a New idea, listen to them instead\\]\n\n## I'm Bearish on GameStop\n\nBut prefer to not go broke expressing that opinion.  Look, I am not the first bear on GameStop and certainly not the richest.  I can say that I won't lose [6 Billion shorting it ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/gamestop-short-sellers-reload-bearish-bets-after-6-billion-loss)though.  Video games are as popular as ever, pulling in $180B in 2020 compared to a movie industry that sold only $42.5B at the box office in 2019.   Why hasn't GameStop been rolling in the money?  Digital.  A \\*lot\\* of games are downloaded digitally, skipping the physical cartridge or disc.  GameStop will get a boost from selling the new consoles, but the fact that both Sony and Microsoft offer \"Digital Only\" versions of their new consoles should be pretty ominous to shareholders.  GameStop's big money maker historically was buying used games for a few dollars and then reselling them for Much Much more.  The digital nature of many video game sales effectively cuts out this profit.    \n\nGameStop has also expanded into merchandise and electronics sales. I'll plead ignorance to how popular the first is, but I know I've never even considered browsing their site for electronics - I just assume Amazon (ticker: AMZN) will ship it to me before I even know I need it. For cheaper.\n\n## Bullish On GameStop\n\nWhy would someone be bullish on GameStop?  Well the big 'news' is that they added some new activist board members with a lot of experience in \"e-commerce, online marketing, finance and strategic planning\". That was good enough for a 68% jump in the stock.  Sixty Eight.  GameStop is (and remains) one of the most heavily shorted stocks.  So -any- good news can lead to a short squeeze and a dramatic rise in the stock.  Very few people predicted this sub $5 stock would be all the way above $30 by January!  [Note, some did](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/) and they made [a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4xje1/gme_yolo_update_jan_25_2021/). (\"Viewer discretion is advised\" for reading those links.  Note that this Won't work for most people, but their conviction was certainly impressive).\n\nOh, but wait, there's more:\n\n[GameStop - You all know this.](https://preview.redd.it/yjyq6agnzkd61.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=f480570f99c54c230ba38175a42555e74be0e059)\n\nAfter hovering around 35-40, GameStop shot up on Friday to over $76, before selling off to end the day near $65.  Then today, it hit a high of just below $160 before settling at $76.79 (editor's note - it's up in the aftermarket).\n\nThere are Lots of articles on the short squeeze, the Reddit vs. Short Sellers saga, that I encourage you to seek out - for entertainment if nothing else. \n\n### Bearish on GameStop - what to do?\n\nI decided to put on a bearish play in GameStop, but (in my opinion) more importantly, I tried to take advantage of the ridiculous implied volatility in the name.   I placed a trade similar to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bearish calendar in GME](https://preview.redd.it/spbi96mszkd61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e472a5688dc6fd7469e714477539a1896dd3f6fb)\n\n* Sell January 29th 50 put for 8.40\n* Buy February 19th 50 Put for 12.30\n\nDebit of a bit less than $4 ($3.90 at the mid point).  This trade profits the most if by the end of this week GME finishes at 50.  \n\n### That's it?\n\nNo.  Take a look at the implied volatility for these options.  I'm selling an IV of 365% and buying one at 253%.  In other words, I'm getting paid a lot to sell the option that expires near term and paying quite a bit less for one that expires longer term - a trade structure I'm happy to repeat over and over.  \n\n### What can happen?\n\nThe ideal state is that the option I sold expires worthless (GME at 50.01) and the volatility of the Feb option skyrockets.  \n\nWhen the nearer term volatility stays more expensive than the further out expirations, one can often continue to sell options against the long.  So this Friday, one could sell a put that expires Next Friday and take in an additional premium.  \n\nIf you roll to a lower strike, one could turn the position into a put spread for a net credit.  At the market close today, for example,  we could close this week's put and sell the Feb 12 45 put, receive a net \\~0.30 credit and a \"free\" diagonal spread.\n\n## What do you do if the stock keeps going up?\n\nI was able to put this into practice today. I got out of a lot of my position when GME was trading well north of $100 - for a profit.  The calendar had increased to about $7 for a 75% profit on this trade in just one trading day.  \n\n## TL;DR - Bearish on GameStop\n\nThese types of run-ups occur from time to time.  There are some that will make life changing money (see previous Reddit links).  If you have some 'play' money and want to take a shot, go for it - but only do it with money you can afford to lose.  As I can't watch the markets the entire time, I prefer to take risk defined approaches on favorable setups.  When GameStop restocks the PS5, I'll use some of today's profits to their (dwindling) revenue and buy mine from there. Actually, I'll probably just wait until Amazon has it in stock (Disclosure Long AMZN!)\n\n(Article copied/pasted from my [website](https://optionsalary.com/bearish-on-gamestop-but-want-to-keep-your-account-balance), so if a link didn't go through or someone things I'm 'leveraging' my own content - I gave me permission)", "id": "l5388r", "created_utc": 1611625480.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Melvin, is that you?

One of the main complaints about Nokia is that it is well-established with very low volatility. It has 5 billion outstanding shares and will need a ton of volume to move.

This lost them some boomer interest, but there have been open discussions to bring back dividends if the company sees continued growth in its cash flow.

{"title": "Stocks to Watch 26/01/2021", "selftext": "Good Morning,\n\nYesterday was an unusual day, starting okay but then seeing a complete U-turn followed by a faded recovery in the latter half. There have been very few days in 2021 which have made for 'good day trading' days, but that's not to say there haven't been opportunities. Most of the gaps are low-cap movers which happen to be my favourite. Anyway, here is my watchlist for today:\n\n1. **$EDSA (Edesa Biotech) -** I'm starting with this stock as it is our leading gapper today, but I'm convinced it'll hold this position. I always watch leading gappers like this, because they're obvious. However, I don't like stocks that have experienced a large selloff before the bell. Especially when they dip below the VWAP. The catalyst here is FDA approval to further clinical study of one of their drugs.\n2. **$BYND (Beyond Meat)** \\- Formed a partnership with PepsiCo, late gapper. Large float here, more than I'd like, but I'm going to watch this.\n3. **$KOSS (Koss Corp)** \\- Made a really big move yesterday to $10 after hours. The catalyst here was some Tweets and a SeekingAlpha article. I think this could be the latest 'WSB Stock'. It has 40% short interest; GME is 140% for comparison. Whilst these are irrational, stocks like these do give opportunities for short squeezes. 1.5m float and a gap of 87% currently so I'm going to be watching this for a break over $12. This is a more risky one with no standalone catalyst, but the fact it is up as much as it is acts as a catalyst on itself.\n\nOther stocks I will be watching: PHUN, VTNR, EYES, MYO, AQMS.\n\nAs a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.\n\nThanks all.\n\n\\-Rep", "id": "l5epzk", "created_utc": 1611670179.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "GME \ud83d\ude80", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "r/WallStreetBets Really did a number on this one!", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12805700302124023}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18596434593200684}, {"body": "Don\u2019t forget BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19424991309642792}, {"body": "What do you think about AMC?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Gurnish", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024284981191158295}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1327192485332489}, {"body": "Sens?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11351475864648819}, {"body": "GMEEE\n\nEdit: forgot \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2262563854455948}, {"body": "BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11867953091859818}, {"body": "You guys should keep eyes on ttoo\n\nLeader in sepsis and can detect the different mutations of covid 19", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31868040561676025}, {"body": "  HTZGQ going up!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3968059718608856}, {"body": "What about oil stocks???", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3977859616279602}, {"body": "Ge?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2248343974351883}, {"body": "Koss!!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12541517615318298}], "tickers": ["recovery"]}

Ground was taken and lost between Cohen's Cohorts in the 80th and the battle hardened 95th. This is ground that has been fought over time and again, and I hope to never see it again for the remainder of my days.\n\n**9:30 AM - 12:30 PM**\n\nI fear I have asked too much of my men. They have already proved their worth to me a thousand times over and then a thousand again, but still I ask them to push. Ground continues to be taken and lost in an endless circle over the same bloody ground. Privately, I despair for the men of the 159th Weaponized Autists that were left stranded and wanting for reinforcements in yesterday's fighting. Every ounce of my strength is now focused on their safe return. Privately, I despair.\n\n**12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**\n\nOperation FD has been launched. The men of the 100th in conjunction with elite troops from the 101st Asperger's Airborne have launched a coordinated blitz assault. Pray for us.\n\n**1:00 PM - 2:30 PM**\n\nThe enemy has been taken completely unawares. We're seeing men feared lost from the 110th and 120th trickle back to camp. Decisive gains have been made across the line. Each time we visit, enemy resolve weakens. I was a fool to have despaired. I know the men and women I fight with. The men of the 150th are fighting for their lives, but mark my words, we are coming.\n\n**2:30 PM - 4:00 PM**\n\nIt is my pleasure to report that all stranded troops of the 120th, 130th and 140th have been joined, and despite their weariness continue to fight with a zeal that even the finest scribes known to man could not capture in words. As our troops massed alongside the 150th, General Left and his horde of crayons were seen retreating to ground that has not yet been contested. Fresh troops from the 200th have been brought up alongside elite ground units from Seal Team 160.\n\nTomorrow we ride to uncharted territory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: In a crushing blow to the enemy, Seal Team 160 obliterated all resistance in it's path.
