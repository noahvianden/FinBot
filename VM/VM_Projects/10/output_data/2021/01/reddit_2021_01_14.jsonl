{"title": "Evolution of Options Trading Mindset", "selftext": "Most tenured investors/traders that actively implement options have likely undergone a change in their approach. When I first started with derivatives, it was all about shorter term, intra day trades to help make me rich now (then). Like most traders starting out, I was as impatient as any of the others. Like many, once I touched the stove and lost some money, it forced me to begin reconsidering my approach to options. I started with options at 17 and am coming up on 30 now. I can comfortably say that my mindset has completely evolved - and for the better. \n\nThe primary adaptation is risk management. Of of the greatest assets of options trading is the ability to get into very specific detail on how much risk we want to offer. Beta weighting deltas is a key tool and can help us keep things in check. If we start getting too long or short, we can simply add additional positions to help adjust. The greatest piece of options is flexibility. Need a long-term hedge? Short-term? There are expirations that suit the need. \n\nThe other major mindset shift is that options are a component to a broader wealth development plan. When first starting out, options were my main effort. Now, they still are the core but I've since added other ventures (real estate, angel investing, flipping, etc). Even as I move into other markets, I have found both options and options on futures as extremely versatile tools in managing risk. For example, when I would buy and sell homes, depending on the rate I receive, if I wanted to hedge rate inflation into a refi, I could. If I wanted to balance out risk on a hard money lend, I could add exposure to bonds. These obviously are not a perfect science since there is a significant qualitative component. Nonetheless, the point is versatility.\n\nI'd be curious to hear how other's approaches to options trading has evolved over time.", "id": "kwvvze", "created_utc": 1610590199.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "I sell options so the big realization for me was to Not be afraid of being tested in my position and get confident managing my positions.

Wall Street looks to start another mixed session\n\n> * Dow and S&P 500 futures rose but Nasdaq futures dipped slightly Thursday, a day after a mixed session left all three stock benchmarks less than 1% from their record highs. Shortly after Wednesday\u2019s market close, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol last week. Premarket stock reaction was relatively muted because the House vote was widely expected.\n\n> * Investors will also focus on the Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are calling for a rise to 800,000 in weekly new filings for unemployment benefits.\n\n> * Delta Air Lines cut in half its cash burn and narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter as the coronavirus pandemic drove the carrier to its worst year ever. Shares in the premarket rose more than 1%.\n\n> * Shares of BlackRock were higher by more than 1% Thursday after the New York-based firm reported better-than-expected profits and revenue in the fourth quarter. BlackRock\u2019s assets under management surged to a record $8.68 trillion at the conclusion of the quarter.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. 10 Republicans vote for Trump impeachment\n\n> * Ten Republicans joined all of the House Democrats in a 232-197 vote to impeach Trump. GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, majority leader until Georgia certifies the Democrats\u2019 two runoff election wins, said the Senate won\u2019t start Trump\u2019s trial until Tuesday. That\u2019s one day before President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, which is expected to be locked down with unprecedented security. In a video released Wednesday, Trump sent his clearest condemnation yet of last week\u2019s Capitol riot. However, he took no responsibility and made no mention of impeachment.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Biden to unveil Covid mitigation plan\n\n> * Biden is expected to unveil Thursday a coronavirus action plan, centering on a mass vaccination program and closer coordination among all levels of government. The Biden plan comes as the U.S. battles another surge in Covid cases and deaths.\n\n> * Mainland China on Thursday reported its first Covid death since May as authorities try to control a spike in cases just outside of Beijing. The flare-up unfolds as a WHO team arrives in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the virus alongside Chinese scientists.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. J&J\u2019s one-shot coronavirus vaccine safe: Study\n\n> * Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-dose Covid vaccine is safe and appears to generate a promising immune response in young and elderly volunteers, according to trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. J&J is expected to release results from its 45,000-person phase three trial later this month, which could then lead to a third vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA. J&J is using the same technologies behind its Ebola vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna employed a new approach for their respective two-shot vaccines.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Petco, Poshmark set to debut on Nasdaq\n\n> * Two initial public offering are debuting on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Petco priced its IPO at $18 per share, above the expected range of $14 to $17, valuing the pet products retailer at nearly $4 billion. Poshmark priced its IPO at $42 per share, above the expected range of $35 to $39. The offering gives the online secondhand goods seller an initial valuation of more than $3 billion.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/BRd9Yd4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MS8vXxs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kxhhvOm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Dr7cIXH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/nM5oV77.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xVZMg74.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTmidUm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Z39U4RB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/duiiAuN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/wsMxjtf.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/xSJAWwz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* GME\n* CCIV\n* DPW\n* NNDM\n* AMD\n* APHA\n* CEMI\n* INTC\n* PSTH\n* DAL\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-gamestop-tesla-nordstrom-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **GameStop (GME)** \u2013 GameStop is jumping once again in premarket trading after surging the past three days in what some analysts are calling a short squeeze.

Apple's App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store combined to have close to 5 million apps. Literally, more businesses than ever before incorporate mobile apps into their platforms and the trends will likely continue post-pandemic as we are approaching Digital America 2.0.\n\nAppian is a leader in creating a low-code process for creating apps, meaning that users don't need to know how to write code to build their apps. Creating an easier way to build apps has been a smashing success for Appian, and in the most recent quarter, the company's cloud subscription sales increased by 40%.

There aren't enough developers around to make all of the apps that companies need these days, and trust me a lot will turn to Appian as a leader in low code to do it for them.\n\nIn fact, a lot of them already have.

It's big software to support the business run mainly on pc's but it is responsive on mobile applications. Putting it in the market for mobile apps is plain wrong.\n\n>the company's cloud subscription sales increased by 40%.\n\nAnother way to see it is not like a normal app. Cloud subscription means that an app is created (for a company) and for each user you pay a cloud-subscription.

My idea is this:\n\nSelling aggressive Covered calls on VIX. Specifically UVXY\nAt present moment UVXY is at $10.23 with a crazy high IV of 150%+. Since were at ATH it has been a kangaroo and hasn\u2019t dropped in value too much.\n\nIf you buy 100 shares for 10.23 at current cost. You can sell a CC for a strike of $11 exp 1/22 for $61\n\nDue to the IV. This is an instant 5.9% ROI for a 7 market day period. ($61/1023= 0.0569)\n\nVIX is not downtrending very much at all right now so the share bleed down I believe would be minimal, and the upside potential is of course $61 + a potential $77 additional per 100 shares (at 10.23 a share)\n\nThat means if this hits $11 or above you can sit tight and let it exercise because you just made a 13.5% return in a weeks time.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t hit you can roll the CC down, and continue to sell more aggressive CCs.\n\nIf you did this with 1000 shares the initial pump tomorrow would be somewhere in $610 range, with a possibility of $770 additional for a weekly return of $1380 if they go ITM.\n\nAssuming somewhat of a stagnant VIX and similar market conditions I believe you can expect decent returns of 2-5%+ (factoring in CC premiums and some possible share value bleed) a week until these eventually moon and hit.\n\nIf the stock traded perfectly sideways this would net you, just in CC premiums, conservatively 2% a week, so 104% ish return a year?\n\nPersonally I see this as a way to limit downside potential risk but to still be making weekly gains while you wait for the possibility of a market correction to then buy back in to your favorite stocks.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "kx1vjf", "created_utc": 1610613890.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Nominal decay for UVXY is 9% month over month.

{"title": "PERI - An Update Since My Last Post (hint hint: $800 million Microsoft contract confirmed, Expanded CTV revenue, and ARK with another 120K shares bought)", "selftext": "Maybe this reads like a diary entry, but fuck it, if this one's not on your radar already then check it out if you like digital ad plays like MGNI and APPS.\n\nMy last post on PERI (Perion) from about a month ago when it was trading at about $10 got a little bit of love, and it has been a wild ride on this low-float bastard since then. Hit $17.85 a couple weeks ago before a massive short attack drove it down to sub $12, and it has since settled in nicely at the $14.00 to $14.50 range on decent volume everyday this week. They just presented at the Needham conference this week and put out a nice little investor presentation that confirms their current growth is looking primo. Check it out [here](https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/perion-IR-deck-20210112.pdf) \n\nBottom line: 4-year $800 million Microsoft contract is confirmed, nice expansion into the CTV space with 232% quarterly growth in revenue since Q3 in that sector, and expected revenue of over $100 million in Q4 (they report earnings on February 9th). \n\nYes, that's correct, this company has more revenue than MGNI and APPS right now, and is trading at 1/8th the market cap of MGNI and 1/13th the market cap of APPS. Sure it may have a lower potential growth rate compared to those two, but its trading at a market cap of essentially 1:1 revenue, which is absolutely unfucking heard of in this sector. It has run up about 100% since early December already, and it's still trading at that big of a discount. That's how much room this puppy has to run.\n\nAnd guess who else knows how much of a steal this valuation is? Aunt Cathie and ARK have added over 120k shares since early December when I last posted. They currently have 286K shares as their #1 largest holding in their IZRL ETF. Check it out [here](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_ISRAEL_INNOVATIVE_TECHNOLOGY_ETF_IZRL_HOLDINGS.pdf). \n\nIn my opinion, this thing has a lot of gas left in the tank to run in 2021. All analysts following this thing (which, granted, ain't a ton) have a buy rating and one just upgraded the target price to $18. Yeah yeah, analysts don't know shit (yada yada yada), but it tells you where a few of the wall street boys want this thing to go.\n\nAnyway, it's late in the day and I need a beer, so I'll finish my rant, but if you are into digital ad plays and want something that isn't trading at its peak yet, check this one out (or don't, doesn't matter to me). Remember boys and girls, this thing has a microfloat of only 21 million tradable shares (comparable to CRSR), it's volatile, it swings like a mofo on a daily basis, and it runs into the occasional short attack. But if you love this daily volatility and long growth prospects heading into 2021 (like I do), then take a look.\n\ntl:dr: read the post, it ain't that long.

{"title": "VIX covered call profit idea - Math warning.", "selftext": "I want to throw something off the wall to see what people think. \n\nSince we are at ATH I find myself increasingly nervous at investing until I see some moderate correction. BUT I don\u2019t want to time this by buying puts and getting my asshole gaped. \n\nMy other idea to make money while waiting for stock to go on sale is this. Tell me what you think. \n\nSelling aggressive Covered calls on VIX. \n\nHear me out:\n\nAt present moment UVXY is at $10.23 with a crazy high IV of 150%+. Since were at ATH it has been a kangaroo and hasn\u2019t dropped in value too much. \n\nIf you buy 100 shares for 10.23 at current cost. You can sell a CC for a strike of $11 exp 1/22 for $61\n\nDue to the IV. This is an instant 5.9% ROI for a 7 market day period. ($61/1023= 0.0569)\n\nVIX is not downtrending very much at all right now so the share bleed down I believe would be minimal, and the upside potential is of course $61 + a potential $77 additional per 100 shares (at 10.23 a share)\n\nThat means if this hits $11 or above you can sit tight and let it exercise because you just made a 13.5% return in a weeks time. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t hit you can roll the CC down, and continue to sell more aggressive CCs. \n\nIf you did this with 1000 shares the initial pump tomorrow would be somewhere in $610 range, with a possibility of $770 additional for a weekly return of $1380 if they go ITM.  \n\nAssuming somewhat of a stagnant VIX and similar market conditions I believe you can expect decent returns of 2-5%+ (factoring in CC premiums and some possible share value bleed) a week until these eventually moon and hit. \n\nIf the stock traded perfectly sideways this would net you, just in CC premiums, conservatively 2% a week, so 104% ish return a year? \n\nPersonally I see this as a way to limit downside potential risk but to still be making weekly gains while you wait for the possibility of a market correction to then buy back in to your favorite stocks. \n\nHonest thoughts on my napkin math?", "id": "kx1rhe", "created_utc": 1610613315.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "If you pull out on the uvxy chart you can see that it has lost 2/3 in the last 6 months.

{"title": "Magna (NYSE:MGA) Stock Is About to Boom", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019re in the second week of January, and **Magna International** (TSE:MG)(NYSE:MGA) has already added 8.8% of value. Magna stock has been on a fine run the past year; it\u2019s up 175% since March 2020.\u00a0\n\nThis stellar performance isn\u2019t speculative like the tech sector but backed by solid fundamentals. The old guard in the auto-parts supply business has positioned itself to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the electric cars spectacle.\n\n## Magna\u2019s edge\n\nMagna is a diversified automotive parts supplier. The company boasts a broad range of products and services that affirm its strengthening in its industry status and long-term prospects. The recent acquisition of Hongli is poised to strengthen its competitiveness further.\n\nThe recent spike in Magna stock price stems from the company positioning itself as a preferred third-party manufacturer of choice for companies looking to make electric cars. Likewise, Magna has enhanced its prospect on self-driving efforts. It is currently working with **Fisker** to develop an advanced driver-assist system for the electric Ocean SUV.\n\nPerhaps more exciting is the prospect of Magna working alongside **Apple** to create its first electric car. Industry experts believe that Apple could break into this lucrative industry by working with the company\u2019s Magna Steyr division, a contract manufacturer of cars.\u00a0\n\nIf this potential partnership materializes, Magna stock could surge much higher.\u00a0\n\n## Low risk\n\nBy virtue of its business model, Magna could be the least-risky investment opportunity in the transition to electric self-driving vehicles. Instead of deploying billions of capital in production and research, the company partners with established manufacturers and signs long-term supply contracts.\u00a0\n\nEffectively, Magna locks in cash flow and recurring revenue, while the manufacturers battle it out for dominance in an increasingly competitive sector. That could make it the ultimate winner over the next decade. Just like Foxconn ultimately won the smartphone battle over the previous decade.\u00a0\n\n## Magna stock valuation\n\nThis impressive run looks set to continue as the stock is relatively cheap compared to industry standards. Magna stock is currently trading with a P/E of 12.9. The stock is relatively cheap for a profitable, well-run company with tremendous prospects in electric and self-driving cars.\n\nFor income-focused investors, Magna would be an ideal pick given that the company offers a dividend yield of 2.1%. The company\u2019s cash hoard of $1.5 billion and free cash flow of $3.45 billion makes this a reliable dividend payout.\u00a0\n\nOverall, a company trading a price-to-sales ratio of 0.92 while it offers exposure to an exciting tech sector is rare. The 2.1% dividend payout and robust profitability is icing on the cake. Magna stock should certainly be on your radar.\u00a0\n\n## Bottom line\n\nElectric cars and self-driving vehicles are clearly the future. However, investors have focused too much on the flashy manufacturers and tech giants in this space. That means suppliers and technology providers like Magna have been overlooked.\u00a0\n\nNow that the market is recognizing the company\u2019s true potential, Magna stock is surging. It\u2019s up a whopping 175% from March 2020. If the company manages to strike a deal with the ultimate tech titan Apple this year, the stock could unleash a further windfall for early investors.\u00a0\n\nFor conservative growth investors, this one is impossible to miss.\u00a0", "id": "kx2eal", "created_utc": 1610616499.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, if I had any money not in PLTR or GME I would rather buy groceries.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "groceries are a waste of money, keep buying GME", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Texas sized 10-4 good buddy.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04680924862623215}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6512985825538635}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2253006398677826}, {"body": "TLDR pls\nalso it feels like a shitty journalist wrote this \u201cthe iPhone maker\u201d just say Apple ffs", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Today's Pre-Market Movers & News [Thursday, January 14th, 2021]", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-14-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Wall Street looks to start another mixed session\n\n> * Dow and S&P 500 futures rose but Nasdaq futures dipped slightly Thursday, a day after a mixed session left all three stock benchmarks less than 1% from their record highs. Shortly after Wednesday\u2019s market close, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol last week. Premarket stock reaction was relatively muted because the House vote was widely expected.\n\n> * Investors will also focus on the Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are calling for a rise to 800,000 in weekly new filings for unemployment benefits.\n\n> * Delta Air Lines cut in half its cash burn and narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter as the coronavirus pandemic drove the carrier to its worst year ever. Shares in the premarket rose more than 1%.\n\n> * Shares of BlackRock were higher by more than 1% Thursday after the New York-based firm reported better-than-expected profits and revenue in the fourth quarter. BlackRock\u2019s assets under management surged to a record $8.68 trillion at the conclusion of the quarter.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. 10 Republicans vote for Trump impeachment\n\n> * Ten Republicans joined all of the House Democrats in a 232-197 vote to impeach Trump. GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, majority leader until Georgia certifies the Democrats\u2019 two runoff election wins, said the Senate won\u2019t start Trump\u2019s trial until Tuesday. That\u2019s one day before President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, which is expected to be locked down with unprecedented security. In a video released Wednesday, Trump sent his clearest condemnation yet of last week\u2019s Capitol riot. However, he took no responsibility and made no mention of impeachment.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Biden to unveil Covid mitigation plan\n\n> * Biden is expected to unveil Thursday a coronavirus action plan, centering on a mass vaccination program and closer coordination among all levels of government. The Biden plan comes as the U.S. battles another surge in Covid cases and deaths.\n\n> * Mainland China on Thursday reported its first Covid death since May as authorities try to control a spike in cases just outside of Beijing. The flare-up unfolds as a WHO team arrives in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the virus alongside Chinese scientists.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. J&J\u2019s one-shot coronavirus vaccine safe: Study\n\n> * Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-dose Covid vaccine is safe and appears to generate a promising immune response in young and elderly volunteers, according to trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. J&J is expected to release results from its 45,000-person phase three trial later this month, which could then lead to a third vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA. J&J is using the same technologies behind its Ebola vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna employed a new approach for their respective two-shot vaccines.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Petco, Poshmark set to debut on Nasdaq\n\n> * Two initial public offering are debuting on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Petco priced its IPO at $18 per share, above the expected range of $14 to $17, valuing the pet products retailer at nearly $4 billion. Poshmark priced its IPO at $42 per share, above the expected range of $35 to $39. The offering gives the online secondhand goods seller an initial valuation of more than $3 billion.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/BRd9Yd4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MS8vXxs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kxhhvOm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Dr7cIXH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/nM5oV77.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xVZMg74.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTmidUm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Z39U4RB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/duiiAuN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/wsMxjtf.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/xSJAWwz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-gamestop-tesla-nordstrom-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **GameStop (GME)** \u2013 GameStop is jumping once again in premarket trading after surging the past three days in what some analysts are calling a short squeeze.
