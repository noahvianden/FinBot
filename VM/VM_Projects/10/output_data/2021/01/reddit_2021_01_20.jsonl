After doing some research last night, I\u2019m attempting to sell my first covered call, can you take a look at this image and let me know if it\u2019s done correctly? Or if there\u2019s anything looks off? \nThank you so much \n\n\n[RBC CC screen shot](https://ibb.co/\n)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Everything looks in order EXCEPT the \"Market Price\" selection. I should have mentioned this in my original reply, but NEVER use market price. Always use \"Limit Price\". \n\nWhy does it matter? \n\nA Limit Price is the price you are willing to sell the call for, and will not sell for anything that is below that. In this case, the Bid/Ask spread is so narrow (Bid 2.93/Ask 2.94) so you can set your Limit Price to 2.93 and it will get filled quickly for that price, since that is the Bid price anyways. You can also choose to set your Limit Price to 2.99 for example, and your call will only sell if the Bid moves up to 2.99 or higher. This way you can set a call to be sold at a price you are happy with and leave RBC alone and wait for it to get executed. Of course you may end up with the call not selling if your Limit Price is never reached, but you can easily adjust it to be lower if needed.\n\nA Market Price is an order to sell your call at the current next Bid price. In this case, the Bid price is 2.93, but that does not mean you will get your call sold for 2.93. Why? Even though the spread is really narrow, it can still shift while you place the order. A common example and one I ran into a few times:\n\nYou see the Bid/Ask spread if 0.01, (2.93/2.94) and think Market Price will get me the Bid price, I am happy. As you place your call, that 2.93 Bid gets sold to, and the next Bid price is 2.85x2, set to \"All/None\". Your order is MPx1, meaning it will not fill the 2 contract orders required for that Bid, so RBC looks at the NEXT best Bid, which is 2.79x1 for example, and executes. You were expecting to get 2.93 and ended up with a 2.79 fill because of how the order was processed. Same goes when you buy a call. You can end up paying more than the Ask if you use Market Price.\n\nWhile this may seem like small money, there are times where RBC's Market Fills can really screw you.\n\nAnother quick note, when using All/None if you want to sell in a batch vs 1 by 1, your order will only get filled if you have a batch for the same volume open. What this means is, if you sell 10 contracts as All/None and at Market Price, the current Bid may be 2.93x1, but RBC will look for the highest Bid that is buying 10 or more contracts in one order. So you can end up selling 10 contracts as All/None + Market Price for 2.50 each simply because that was the best order RBC could find to fit your specs.\n\nAlways use All/None and Limit Price to avoid all these problems. You may have times you get slow fills, but it beats getting screwed.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you again stonk_fish for all the information you\u2019ve provided, I tried to put in the order but turns out I had to authorize the account for options trading- should be activated in a week.

So while you can only wheel covered calls that get exercised upwards, it doesn't really matter that much if you miss out on the CSP half of the wheel.\n\nBut to help with your last question, typically puts earn more in premium but you have to check where IV leans (calls or puts) as there are trends for each underlying stock.

The CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells (Teff cells). Activated Teff cells drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases across therapeutic areas including transplant science, systemic autoimmunity, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, vascular, ophthalmic and dermatologic disorders. Therefore, we believe itolizumab may have broad therapeutic utility in treating a large and diverse set of severe immuno-inflammatory diseases. 2 hour chart ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator and printed a \"long.\" This most likely has a PR coming soon about its prime candidate.

{"title": "Daily Market Recap - Wednesday, January 20, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 20, 2021**\n\nStocks rose Wednesday, extending yesterday\u2019s rally as market participants look ahead to the first actions of the incoming Biden administration. Each of the three major indexes closed at record levels. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 2.33% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.79% up.\n\nToday, people from across the world turned to Washington D.C. to see the inauguration of President Joe Biden. In his first few hours in Office, Biden is set to sign about a dozen Executive Orders to address the pandemic, the economy, climate change, and reverse many of the orders Trump signed during his term, according to a memo from incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Biden reportedly plans to extend a pause on student loan payments and interest on federal loans, rejoin the Paris Agreement, and issue a mask mandate on federal property and interstate travel. Biden also plans to sign additional executive orders in his initial 10 days in office, Klain noted.\n\nBiden is also set to move quickly to begin pushing for additional fiscal stimulus. He recently outlined his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, which includes a host of new relief measures to be added to the provisions in the $900 billion package Congress passed last month. Biden\u2019s proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in stimulus payment to be added on top of the $600 already being distributed, the extension and enhancement of unemployment programs, aid to small businesses, $350 billion to state and local governments, increase in tax credits for low- and middle-income families, and $160 billion for a national program on vaccination and testing. Biden said, \u201cWhile Congress\u2019s bipartisan action in December was a step in the right direction, it was only a down payment. It fell far short of the resources needed to tackle the immediate crisis. We are in a race against time, and absent additional government assistance, the economic and public health crises could worsen in the months ahead.\u201d Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also advocated for significant additional relief spending during her Senate confirmation hearing earlier in the week.\n\nToday, the US passed the grim milestone of 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths, a stark indicator of the human toll of the pandemic. Infections and hospitalizations continue to surge as well.  According to Johns Hopkins University, over the past week, the US has averaged more than 3,300 daily deaths, a jump of around 217% compared to mid-November.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In one of his last acts as President, Donald Trump issued about a dozen pardons. Names included prominent figures in the world of business, former political allies, and bizarrely, two rappers (Lil Wayne and Kodak Black).\n* EU antitrust regulators have sought information from advertisers regarding Google's advertising technology practices, a European Commission document seen by Reuters shows.\n* After reporting more than 200 million subscribers for the first time, Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 16% at the time of writing.\n* Arcus Biosciences (RCUS) target raised by Benchmark from $31 to $51.

{"title": "It's time to short some Facebook $FB", "selftext": " Hey, \n\nLet's go straight to the point.\n\nApple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?\n\n\\--> As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up \"Do you allow this app to track you across different apps\". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.\n\nTherefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.\n\nCertain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.\n\n99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network). They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) \" Could Have A Material Business Impact\".\n\nApple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.\n\nGoogle usually follow suit with these kind of measures.\n\nTLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).\n\nPlay : Wait for Q4 Revenue of Facebook.

It Could End Badly. -- Barrons.com\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5f3zdu6lec61.jpg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b68789578ac91a585a227c02e5b0fe37c9ad17f\n\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 2021/01/19 12:46 GMT-06:00By Connor Smith\n\nGameStop stock continues to soar amid interest from retail investors one analyst called \"rabid.\" Now the stock now has the attention of a notable activist short seller.\n\nCitron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a Tuesday post on Twitter that he plans to host a livestream discussing five reasons those buying GameStop (ticker: GME) stock at recent levels \"are the suckers at this poker game.\"\n\n\"Stock back to $20 fast,\" he wrote. \"We understand short interest better than you and will explain.\"\n\nLeft did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Barron's asking him to expand on his thoughts, as well clarify whether he's taken a short position himself. But around the time of Left's post, GameStop stock pared back from a $45.52 intraday high. The stock closed up 11% to $39.36.\n\nOn Tuesday, 74.6 million GameStop shares were traded, the stock's fifth-highest volume on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Last Wednesday set a record volume for the stock, when 144.5 million shares were traded.\n\nGameStop shares doubled last week following news that three former Chewy executives, including co-founder Ryan Cohen, were joining the company's board. Cohen's RC Ventures has a 13% stake in GameStop, and has urged the company to close more stores and embrace e-commerce.\n\nThe day of the announcement, the company pulled out of a planned appearance by executives at last week's ICR investment conference. A GameStop spokesman had pointed Barron's to the conference for commentary on the company's long-term plans. GameStop representatives haven't returned repeated requests seeking comment in the week since.\n\nAfter the pop last week, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock's massive short interest, recently at 138% of shares available for trading, according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data. Short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, which adjusts its short-interest calculations, estimated short interest of about 58% earlier this month.\n\nSuch bearish bets have left the stock primed for a short-squeeze, a short-term event where short sellers bid up shares, rushing to cover their positions. Pachter said such short sellers were \"squeezed by rabid retail investors.\" He didn't think the pop would last, and has a $16 price target on the stock.\n\nLeft's post signaled he'll discuss the technical factors related to short selling at play during his stream, set for 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. In recent weeks, Barron's has outlined a long-term bearish case. The company is struggling amid broader shifts to free-to-play games and digital downloads, both of which cut out physical game sales.\n\nDespite new consoles from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) that were forecast to drive stronger sales in the broader games industry, GameStop said last week its sales were down 3.1% from last year during the nine-week holiday period. The company pointed to store closures, limited console supply, and the impact of Covid-19. But comparable sales, which strip out the effect of store closures, were only up 4.8% from a rough 2019 holiday period.\n\nMany of the most popular games, like League of Legends and Fortnite, are free to download and play. Instead, publishers offer in-game cosmetic items directly in their online store. For those games, GameStop is often limited to acting as a middleman, selling gift cards for in-game points.\n\nAnd as more players opt to download games directly on their consoles, it's the gatekeepers of such systems -- Sony, Nintendo (NTDOY), and Microsoft -- that stand to benefit. Meanwhile, PC game distribution is a crowded space. Valve's popular Steam online store is facing some competition from platforms offered by Fortnite maker Epic Games, CD Projekt (CDR.Poland), and Electronic Arts (EA). It's unclear how an old-school retailer like GameStop can make sustainable headway in this already competitive landscape.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are also leveraging their cloud infrastructure to offer cloud gaming-streaming services akin to Netflix. Adoption hasn't yet been disruptive to the broader industry. Microsoft, another major cloud player, and Sony have such services that are backed by their libraries of in-house content. GameStop has a profit-sharing deal with Microsoft for its Xbox Game Pass, but Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman noted at the time that he was skeptical that such a deal would offset the decline of physical game sales.\n\nAdd it all up, and it's clear GameStop will need to execute a radical turnaround plan to stay relevant.\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at [connor.smith@barrons.com](mailto:connor.smith@barrons.com)\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nJanuary 19, 2021 18:46 ET (23:46 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPic is of my only 2 liquid cents thrown at the cause at the daily pre top bought at 3 am .

Much of this was due to Intel's appointment of a new CEO as the market viewed this leadership change as a negative to AMD's stock price. BMO capital downgraded AMD's price and the stock fell nearly 10% in a week. \n\nIf you weren't retarded, you took this drop as a buying opportunity, as earnings day is coming next Tuesday (1/26/2020). With AMD poised to shit on earning expectations, AMD is looking to runup on the days before earnings. The high anticipation of a strong 4th quarter combined with the high IV will drive up premium prices, as the releases of the new consoles that utilize AMD PS5 and XBOX series X were smashing hits. Additionally, when you take in that PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade, and that the notebook market share is growing by 50%, the demand for AMD has never been higher. \n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/)\n\n\"Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects AMD's CPU market share to jump to 50%\u00a0in 2021.
