{"title": "The Container Store $TCS - Netflix Effect", "selftext": "The Container Store ($TCS) is a storage & organization specialty retailer that \u201cprovides order to an increasingly busy and chaotic world\u201d by providing creative, multi-functional, customizable storage and organization solutions for their customers. They have 93 locations nationwide and their stock has been pretty range-bound for several years, due to minimal net sales growth and flattish EPS for the past 3 years.\n\nEPS\n\n2017 - $0.40\n\n2018 - $0.45\n\n2019 - $0.31\n\nI bring this stock up because as some of you may know, they partnered with Netflix on the home organization show Home Edit which became a hit on Netflix and in turn, helped bring a lot of awareness to The Container Store:\n\n[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=the%20home%20edit,Container%20Store](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=the%20home%20edit,Container%20Store)\n\nIn the Home Edit TV series, the two professional organizers: Joanna Teplin and Clea Shearer help organize the closets of their clients, including several celebrities including Reese Witherspoon and Khloe Kardashian which resulted in much fanfare. The Home Edit\u2019s followers jumped from 1.9 to 3.9 M in just a few weeks and the Container Store saw nearly 300k incremental followers on Instagram.\n\nApparently, the Netflix series provided a major boost to The Container Store\u2019s sales in September when the series was released, per the CEO\u2019s notes in their Q2 earnings call:\n\n>*During Q2, all 93 stores were opened and operating at close to normalized schedules with limited in-store customer capacity. Q2 to-date through August -- through fiscal August, TCS net sales were slightly down to last year.* ***In fiscal September, TCS net sales were up 17.8% to last year***\\*, bringing the entire quarter up 5.3%. The 17.8% increase in September sales does not include the $6.5 million of online orders taken in fiscal September that are expected to ship, deliver and be recognized in our Q3 financial results.\\*\n\n**Source:** [**https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/21/the-container-store-group-inc-tcs-q2-2020-earnings/**](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/21/the-container-store-group-inc-tcs-q2-2020-earnings/)\n\nThe big boost in net sales on top of their reduced SG&A expenses that was being carried over from Q1 due to pandemic-related expense reduction helped drive a very strong Q2 in all areas:\n\n1. Net Income\n2. Free Cash Flow\n3. EPS\n4. Long-Term Debt Reduction\n5. Improving Gross Margin\n6. Gross Profit\n\nThe reason I\u2019m very interested in this stock is that I think it\u2019s totally undervalued due to the Home Edit tailwinds that continue to persist.\n\nSpecifically, in their Q2 earnings call, the CFO stated in terms of guidance:\n\n>*Given the unusual sales trends in our business, we believe that is appropriate to provide more color about our go-forward Q3 expectations. There are few points I would like to make. As we said, fiscal Q3 is off to a strong start, as a halo effect with The Home Edit's Netflix show launch has continued into October. With that said, we are not assuming the quarter-to-date elevated level of sales persist. The expected moderation of sales throughout Q3 is partly due to our conservative approach and estimating holiday department sales in the light of the notable declines over the past few years in our holiday sales.* ***Therefore, we currently expect year-over-year sales growth in Q3 to modestly exceed the 5% growth we just reported for Q2.***\n\n**Source:** [**https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/21/the-container-store-group-inc-tcs-q2-2020-earnings/**](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/21/the-container-store-group-inc-tcs-q2-2020-earnings/)\n\nHowever, the company made a huge press release on December 22, 2020, that their CEO Melissa Reiff was retiring and in addition to that release, they increased their guidance:\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter Update**\n\n>*Results for the fiscal third quarter 2020 are tracking well ahead of the expectations the Company shared on their October 21, 2020 fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings call.* ***As a result, the Company currently expects fiscal third quarter 2020 sales to increase in the high teens range compared to the prior year period, with adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the $0.35 to $0.40 range versus $0.05 in the prior year period.***\n\n**Source:** [**http://investor.containerstore.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/The-Container-Store-Group-Inc.-Announces-Plan-for-CEO-Succession-Satish-Malhotra-to-Be-Appointed-CEO-and-President-Effective-February-1-2021/default.aspx**](http://investor.containerstore.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/The-Container-Store-Group-Inc.-Announces-Plan-for-CEO-Succession-Satish-Malhotra-to-Be-Appointed-CEO-and-President-Effective-February-1-2021/default.aspx)\n\nFor a company that has historically had softer than expected holiday sales to see such strength in Q3 is pretty great news. On top of that, their adjusted EPS guidance was $0.35 to $0.40, which is likely within $0.05 of diluted GAAP EPS.\n\nMoving on, these tailwinds from the Home Edit have also been transformational to the business fundamentals of this company. This company has for many years now been saddled with high debt that has been an EPS drag. In the most recent quarter, they paid down $60+ M in LT debt from their huge cash flow in Q2 and per the CFO will continue to use excess cash flow to pay down debt.\n\nSince they are expecting another strong quarter and per their guidance on SG&A being only slightly up from Q2:\n\n>*As we look to Q3, with the sales recovery and restoration of expenses, we would expect our SG&A expenses to be largely on top line with the same period last year.*\n\nAssuming SG&A is 113.000 (which is likely slightly higher than guided), they should have another high cash flow quarter which should mean additional payments to bring down LT debt which should then reduce interest expenses which are on average is 2-3% of total net income but should be trending downwards as more LT debt is paid off.\n\n**My Take**\n\nThe Container Store\u2019s current TTM EPS is: $0.38 and as posted above, if they can do a conservative $0.35 GAAP EPS in Q3, their TTM EPS jumps to $0.68 which is the highest TTM EPS they\u2019ve had in several years.\n\nThe Container Store is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 29.29 and assuming they can do a reasonable Q4 where the Home Edit tailwinds continue to persist for another few months at least (it hasn\u2019t shown any real signs of slowing down: [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=the%20container%20store&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=the%20container%20store&geo=US)), it would be safe to assume, imo, a $0.45 EPS in Q4 which is traditionally their strongest quarter, which combined with the Q3 EPS guidance of $0.35 would result in a TTM EPS of $0.87 and if the P/E ratio drops to 20, this would translate to $17.40/share sometime after the May Q4 earnings report (57% increase from today's closing price of $11.07). Hard to say if the market will reward a 20 P/E, but that's what I'm assuming.\n\nI think people are looking for something to do during COVID.  Strong word of mouth referrals for the Home Edit show and people\u2019s general desire to organize may have potentially changed the business trajectory of The Container Store permanently. If anything, it enabled them to reduce their severe debt load likely by half which should enable them to be more aggressive with store openings that should only help improve top-line growth in the future.\n\nDisclosure: I am long $TCS", "id": "ks3psy", "created_utc": 1609987310.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m not.

{"title": "Technical Analysis Series 1: Candlesticks, what are they and how do I use them?", "selftext": "Hey Internet,\n\nThis post is the first part in a series I will be doing outlining some of the basic tools, tips, and techniques I use to conduct technical analysis on charts.\n\nI figured that the best place to start is at the beginning, so the title of today's post is: \"Candlesticks, what are they and how do I use them?\"\n\nIn this post I will present some of the basic elements of candle sticks, a few noteworthy candle stick formations, and introduce some other relevant terminology. In addition, this post will be helpful in generally explaining how to read a chart at a very basic level.\n\nA candlestick tells the story of the price action for the asset during the relevant timeframe you have selected for your chart.\n\nWhile they may not look like much to the untrained eye, markets are run off of human emotion, primarily fear and greed. Candlesticks can give valuable insight into what the mood of the market was during a given timeframe.\n\n**Why Candlesticks vs other types of Charts?**\n\n* There are plenty of valid ways to look at historical price data for assets:\n   * bar charts\n   * line charts\n   * heikin-ashi charts\n* The reasons I prefer candlesticks are:\n   * can easily visually see where the candle opened\n   * can easily visually see where the candle closed\n   * can easily visually see where the candle \"wicked\" up or down to and was rejected from\n      * Being able to easily identify these data points allows for a technical trader to more quickly assess the relevant info required for assessing risk and putting on trades.\n\n**Here is a 1 week (\"1W\") timeframe (\"TF\") chart of Starbucks:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/gmzRPrY](https://imgur.com/gallery/gmzRPrY)\n\n**As explained in the graphic:**\n\n* The asset is generally listed in the top left of the chart followed by the TF of the candles on the chart.\n   * Since this is a 1W TF chart of Starbucks that means that each red or green candle on the chart represents 1 week of price action.\n      * Candle periods are broken into what is considered high TF, medium TF, and low TF.\n* The general rule of thumb is that looking at a high TF candle chart reduces the risks of getting \"faked out\" by bull traps, bear traps, or otherwise sideways choppy action (future posts will touch on what these are if you'd like to know more).\n* Essentially, it would take much more sustained application of capital to lay such a trap for a 1 week period vs. a 1 hour period. Therefore, high TF charts are much more reliable for longer term analysis. The downside to high TF candles though is that they are obviously less responsive to explosive and sudden price action brought on by a catalyst or other outside event.  \n\n   * On equities the TF breakdown is generally:\n      * High TF: 12 month candles, 6 month candles, 3 month candles, 1 month candles, 2 week candles, and 1 week candles\n      * Medium TF: 3 day candles, 2 day candles, and 1 day candles\n      * Low TF: 4 hour candles, 2 hour/90 minute candles, 1 hour candles, 30 minute candles, 15 minute candles\n   * Technical traders will run all types of TF's on candles and these are just some of the most common examples. Furthermore , the most relevant or \"favorite\" TF's of technical traders will change as algorithms are adjusted across the market, thereby requiring the trader to adjust as relevant market data is analyzed.\n\n**Here is another shot of the 1W TF chart of Starbucks with some additional info to cover candle stick bodies and wicks:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/IUNET9x](https://imgur.com/gallery/IUNET9x)\n\n**As explained in the graphic:**\n\n* The body of the candle is the solid portion of each candle.\n   * The body contains the price range between the Open and Close of the asset.\n      * A red candle has the Open at the top of the body and the close at the bottom of the body.\n      * A green candle has the Open at the bottom of the body and the close at the top of the body.\n   * The lines sticking out of the top and bottom of the candle body are the wicks for the candle and represent the High and Low for the TF.\n\nThe importance of Open and Close for a candle will be further expanded upon in later posts, but the short version is that open and closing prices for an asset are extremely important for \"confirmation trading.\" This is a style of technical trading where one waits for a candle to confirm (open, or even open and close) over (or under) a critical resistance level before entering a position. This is a more conservative technical trading style, but it can also increase one's chance of success by preventing them from buying or selling into wicking price action that is not truly indicative of the trend.\n\n**Candle Stick Formations**\n\nA lot of materials have been written on various candlestick formations and in my experience the new trader will put far too much weight in these formations, Treating these formations as if they are some secret sauce to conquering the markets. In my experience candle stick formations and patterns are quite important, but what is less important is memorizing every catchy name for the formations and being able to recite them off the top of your head. Once one understands the principles and market forces these formations are conveying they will be much better served in comparison to just memorizing their names.\n\nThe most important concepts of analyzing candlestick formations relate to the size of the bodies and wicks on the candles being analyzed. In addition, volume should also be a main consideration when looking at candlesticks in order to gauge the level of market participation over the relevant period (a little write up on volume will be coming shortly).\n\n**Core Concepts on formations:**\n\n**Wicks:**\n\n* A long wick coming out the bottom of a candle on a downtrend may reflect that a local floor has been reached for the asset. The long wick reflects this because it shows that the market has readily bought up the price of the asset at lower prices.\n   * For example, here is what is known as a \"bullish hammer\", or dragonfly doji, on the 3d tf for the S&P 500 in the march lows of 2020: [https://imgur.com/gallery/xjjC3dB](https://imgur.com/gallery/xjjC3dB)\n      * you will notice that there was a massive wick coming out the bottom of the candle body (reflecting the strong buy pressure at those lower levels) and then subsequently no candle body closed below the body of this bullish hammer/dragonfly doji.\n* Similarly, a long wick coming out the top of a candle on an uptrend may reflect that a local top has been reached for the asset. The long wick reflect this because it shows that the market has readily sold down the price of the asset at higher prices.\n   * For example, here is a local top reached in September 2020 for the S&P 500 (the second arrow pointing out a long wick to the bottom and resumption of trend): [https://imgur.com/gallery/HFM85ni](https://imgur.com/gallery/HFM85ni)\n\n**Body:**\n\n* The size of the candle body and its relation to prior candle bodies is also of critical importance. As previously discussed, the candle body represents the open and closing prices of that asset for the given TF. This range can be considered the \"accepted price range\" for the asset while the wicks are outliers on the relevant price action.\n* Therefore, a candle body that closes above the prior candle body can be indicative of bullish trend resuming.\n   * For example, here is a shot of 3d S&P 500 showing the relevance of candle bodies: [https://imgur.com/gallery/NP3AT6d](https://imgur.com/gallery/NP3AT6d)\n* Here is another example except for a bearish continuation of candle bodies: [https://imgur.com/gallery/JeZPCUB](https://imgur.com/gallery/JeZPCUB)\n\n**Doji:**\n\n* A doji is a name for a session in which the candlestick for a security has an open and close that are virtually equal and are often components in patterns.\n* Doji candlesticks look like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign.\n   * Here are some types of dojis: [https://imgur.com/gallery/GNWdwyG](https://imgur.com/gallery/GNWdwyG)\n* Dojis by themselves are not inherently bearish or bullish patterns, they must be analyzed in context of the greater trend and accompanying volume.\n* However, Dojis are a sign of indecision in the market place. The fact that there was very little range between the open and close (thereby causing the candle to have a very small body) reflects that bulls and bears are undecided on which direction the asset should continue.\n* In practice, I often view Dojis as a sign to watch out, because it suggests the asset may soon be making a sizable move one way or the other.\n* For example, here is a recent 3d gravestone doji on AAPL incorporating several of the concepts related to candles touched on in this article: [https://imgur.com/gallery/NYYwn1x](https://imgur.com/gallery/NYYwn1x)\n\nNow that some general concepts have been outlined regarding the relevancy of candle bodies and candle wicks, take a look at the below traditional candlestick formations and try to determine why they are considered \"bullish\" or \"bearish\" candlestick formations:\n\n* Bullish candlestick formations: [https://imgur.com/gallery/LgIUUtg](https://imgur.com/gallery/LgIUUtg)\n* Bearish candlestick formations: [https://imgur.com/gallery/cmuRhWP](https://imgur.com/gallery/cmuRhWP)\n\nI hope the above was helpful in providing some useful info for new technical analysts!", "id": "ksew9c", "created_utc": 1610031536.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Nice job", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11058127880096436}, {"body": "Thanks so much for taking the time to write this!

So max loss is capped at $2800, and max gain is essentially unlimited after $158 breakeven, right? I don't think its unreasonable for AAPL to rise 21% in two years.

This is a strategic cost savings plan for them that allows them to purchase a company and expense that money later. Think integration. \n\nWhy? Look into Amazon\u2019s bus contracts in major cities. Almost nobody knows that Amazon spends ~8 figures a year in many of the cities it operates in to bus its employees to and from its FCs at no cost to the employees. Sometimes they do it because it\u2019s agreed to for tax exemptions, other times because they\u2019re nice (and rich) like that. By purchasing EVs they\u2019ll get sooo many more benefits though. With equity in the company they\u2019re buying from a % of profit flows back to them.  Emissions credits to offset their FC costs, and they can expense all the bus purchases and operating coats to offset FC income, effectively enabling them to offset the purchase of the equity in LION through FC expense. Not to mention the major capital injection to an early moving EV company, once cities see these Lion busses everywhere they\u2019ll be like hey, great idea, and now because Lion is already producing at scale to support the AMZN order, their busses are competitively priced and they can break even or make money on the product while other companies are operating at a loss. \n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant deal for them when you consider everything.
