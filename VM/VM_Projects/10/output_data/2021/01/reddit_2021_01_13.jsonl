{"title": "LSE:LOOP. A potentially undervalued remote meetings app similar to Zoom.", "selftext": "#  Business Background\n\nLoopUp Group PLC offers SAAS for teleconferencing and virtual meetings, similar to zoom and microsoft teams. There are a couple of key differences in it's core product:\n\n\\- Virtual calls happen directly through a users phone and not over VOIP. According to LoopUp this has better quality than VoIP which is what competitors use, here's the quote:\n\n>VoIP audio is less reliable for external guests over the public internet than for internal guests over well-managed corporate networks. Reliable audio quality is paramount for most Professional Services firms and so LoopUp chooses not to permit it. By contrast, VoIP audio makes eminent sense for products targeting the market as a whole.\n\n\\- No download options. Users of LoopUp just click a link and then they can join the call. This is the same as zoom in this regards.\n\n\\- Feature-lite. LoopUp's product is very simple to use to keep customers from being overwhelmed. Again, this is the same as zoom in my opinion.\n\nSo the above 3 KSP's are the main benefits of LoopUp and specifically point number one is the one that really differentiates itself from the competitors.\n\nMost users don't actually care about the main difference, the audio of phone instead of VoIP. The only possible clients who do are those who really need the reliability to be extremely good even if their clients have terrible internet speeds (which VoIP depends upon but phone audio does not). LoopUp targets professional services as it's core customers such as law firms as this new contract win suggests:\n\n\\> Securing flagship wins with three of the world's top-100 law firms, still in the early stages of ramping up, and we have a pipeline of approximately \u00a316 million Annual Contract Value of live opportunities\n\nThe downsides of not using VoIP is that it's more expensive to operate.\n\n# Revenue Segments\n\nHere's the recent stock price chart:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/jb3fnrjo1wa61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=de3336a5cf007930e5ab2ac04962193ca625e0d2](https://preview.redd.it/jb3fnrjo1wa61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=de3336a5cf007930e5ab2ac04962193ca625e0d2)\n\nYou can see that on the 6th\\~ November 2020 the stock price crashed around 50%. This is due to LoopUp releasing a trading update that they were experiencing significant churn in their non-core revenue (clients other than professional services) leaving for other platforms such as Zoom and MSFT.\n\nHere's LoopUp's revenue segments:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/lv6kog7p1wa61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac7c005981a601910cbc2a62a9b54176278e948](https://preview.redd.it/lv6kog7p1wa61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac7c005981a601910cbc2a62a9b54176278e948)\n\nAnnual Report\n\nLoopUp's non-core revenue is in total 14% of their revenue now so hopefully the churn of non-core revenue will be stemmed because of it's low overall % to the top line.\n\nTheir Cisco Webex resale dropped from \u00a38m in 2019 to \u00a36m ARR (Annualized revenue run rate) now and their ARR for their LoopUp platform is now \u00a334m, down a massive 32% in a time when they should be gaining.\n\nHere's a report by progressive research which covered the latest drop:[ https://wp-perl-2020.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2020/11/27145857/LOOP-20201127-2.pdf](https://wp-perl-2020.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2020/11/27145857/LOOP-20201127-2.pdf)\n\n# Competitors\n\n\\- Zoom is the main competitor to LoopUp. They offer a very similar product. The only difference I have found is that of the audio being over the phone rather than the VoIP. Zoom operating margin 20% (In covid time).\n\n\\- MSFT is competitor to LoopUp's non-core clients and Cisco Resale. MSFT will probably beat them and Cisco in the internal business VoIP market as companies are so integrated with everything Microsoft.\n\nHowever LoopUp has now integrated directly with MSFT so their clients can use it as well. As seen from this quote by the company:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/z17rv56q1wa61.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=50bae7f42b93a06270901fe4e9bc11acb234da78](https://preview.redd.it/z17rv56q1wa61.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=50bae7f42b93a06270901fe4e9bc11acb234da78)\n\nLatest Trading Update\n\nI like their integration with MSFT as MSFT is winning the cloud telephony business in enterprises.\n\nHere are the reviews for LoopUp:\n\n[https://www.capterra.com/p/168543/LoopUp/reviews/](https://www.capterra.com/p/168543/LoopUp/reviews/)\n\n[https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/meeting-solutions/vendor/loopup/product/remote-meetings](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/meeting-solutions/vendor/loopup/product/remote-meetings)\n\nYou can see that they are very positive which always bodes well.\n\n# Leadership\n\n\\- Co-Chief Executive Officer (Co-founder) Michael Hughes\n\n\\- Co-Chief Executive Officer (Co-founder) Steve Flavell\n\nBoth founders are still at the company and joint ceo's. They have been at LoopUp for 18 years. They both own 2.6 million shares which is \u00a32.21m each so they have a big stake in the company which is good.\n\n# Acquisition of MeetingZone\n\nIn 2018 the company purchased MeetingZone for \u00a361.5m cash. This is a massive acquisition for LoopUp considering their market cap was \u00a3159m at the time. They used their inflated stock price to issue equity to buy is along with debt. It was a terrible acquisition like most big acquisitions are because they simply paid far too much for the company. MeetingZone was a company which resells cisco webex and skype for business (yes the terrible Skype that nobody uses and everyone hates).\n\nI ran a DCF on MeetinZone themselves from when they purchased them in 2018 and I got a fair value of \u00a318.8m. MeetingZone is a private company but the UK requires private companies file on companies house so you can see their results here:\n\n[https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/04300344/filing-history](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/04300344/filing-history)\n\nSummary of MeetingZones financial results:\n\n2019/2018/2017(Change Acc. date)/2016/2015\n\n(\u00a3, 000s)\n\n\\- Revenue: 14.2/17.8/17.1/15.9/13.3\n\n\\- Gross Margin: 57%/58%/67%/69%/72%\n\n\\- Operating Profit (Before Excep. Adjusted): 2.9/2.8/2.9/2.6/4.1\n\n\\- Oper. Margin: 20%/15%/15%/16%/30%\n\nThey are not growing because of competitors like Zoom & MSFT.\n\nHindsight is 20/20 but either way MeetingZone was nowhere near worth \u00a363m and investors clearly hated the acquisition as LoopUp's market cap since then dropped from \u00a3159m to \u00a346.5m today.\n\nLoopUp management's justification was they could get 'synergy' by reducing overall costs and moving MeetingZone users to LoopUp. The fact is though that they diverted away from their core PS users and have paid the price for it.\n\n# Risks\n\n\\- It's a fairly illiquid penny stock so you need to put in limit orders & not market orders.\n\n\\- As internet connections get better and better especially with 5g we might see less of a need for non-VoIP services because VoIP might be fine for 99% of the UK at some point in the future if everyone has a good connection.\n\n\\- LoopUps other features such as simple to use and no downloads are already implemented by zoom so they could see further churn of non-core users.\n\n# Reverse DCF Valuation\n\n**Inputs**:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/0ybtm2wv1wa61.png?width=1675&format=png&auto=webp&s=200ce76d87336336224ef1c3068caf907ec03b79](https://preview.redd.it/0ybtm2wv1wa61.png?width=1675&format=png&auto=webp&s=200ce76d87336336224ef1c3068caf907ec03b79)\n\nAswath Damoradan Template\n\n**Outputs**:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/oe9tbfkw1wa61.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=93d71f3cce2da63e99d644c22f1506b7d6054476](https://preview.redd.it/oe9tbfkw1wa61.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=93d71f3cce2da63e99d644c22f1506b7d6054476)\n\nAswath Damoradan Template\n\nI did a reverse DCF because it's just too difficult to project using a normal DCF right now with all the uncertainties.\n\nThe revenue -35% for next year is based off the ARR from the latest trading update.\n\nGiven Zoom's operating margin of 20% in covid times the above projection of 9% does seem too low, even with more expensive operations due to the non VoIP protocol.\n\nI do think the above market projections for LoopUp seem too low. Management have said in the most recent trading update that they are going to focus on their core PS clients which is the correct move.\n\nHere's LoopUp's past growth rates for reference:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9wew7f3u1wa61.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=965b415feeb77cffb195766fa6a8cee6d88f7ca0](https://preview.redd.it/9wew7f3u1wa61.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=965b415feeb77cffb195766fa6a8cee6d88f7ca0)\n\nIgnore the inflated 2018 growth rate (due to the terrible acquisition).\n\nWe can see that they have grown extremely well in the past. In my opinion once LoopUp sheds this non-core services it can return to similar levels of growth, especially because working habits have changed to be much more remote, this tailwind should in theory help LoopUp as we go forward.\n\nIf management does another non-core big aqusition like they did with MeetingZone I will sell LoopUp immediately. The good thing about this is that the stock price tends not to drop immediately with bad acquisitions, it usually drops over a length of time so I think this is a good strategy for LoopUp.\n\nSo for conclusion I think that to buy this stock you have to buy into their KSP that some clients will want absolutely reliability for their audio, for example law firms when speaking to their clients. I do buy into this because many times over MSFT or Zoom other people have had connectivity issues due to their poor internet (here in the UK).\n\nDisclaimer: I am long LSE:LOOP as of 11/01/2020.\n\nThanks!", "id": "kweos5", "created_utc": 1610537723.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I have a mate who works in selling these products and loop up is not a sought after company... just my pennys worth", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting, what's the reason for that?

{"title": "Daily Market Recap - Wednesday, January 13, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 13, 2021**\n\nStocks rose modestly on Wednesday after trading choppily in the morning as market participants continue to look ahead to the policy implication of the incoming Democratic administration. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 0.25% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.68%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.05% down. \n\nWith the S&P 500 near-record levels, it seems market participants have largely looked past the recent political unrest in Washington and are looking ahead to the policy implications of the incoming Democratic Senate and Presidential administration. \n\nAfter last week\u2019s riots at the Capitol building, the House of Representatives is preparing to vote later today over whether to impeach President Trump for the second time for \u201cinciting an insurrection\u201d. While there seems to be support for impeachment proceedings in Washington, some lawmakers have warned that the trial could pull focus away from President-elect Biden\u2019s agenda in his first days in office. \n\nUnder the incoming unified Democratic government, market participants and analysts are expecting that another large stimulus package will be passed in the not-to-distant future. The prospects for additional stimulus and the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to maintaining its asset purchasing program has buoyed markets in recent weeks amid the surging coronavirus pandemic and the slow vaccine rollout. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe want to get through the pandemic and sort of see where the dust settles, then we will be able to think about where to go with balance-sheet policy\u201d.\n\nYesterday, the US reported its highest number of coronavirus deaths in one day with 4,327, according to Johns Hopkins University. In fact, the five highest daily tallies for new infections and deaths have all occurred in 2021, according to CNN, meaning the virus is spreading and killing faster now than at any point in 2020. According to Johns Hopkins University, over the past week, the US has averaged more than 3,300 daily deaths, a jump of around 217% compared to mid-November.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Gamestop (GME) took off like a rocket today!\n* After removal from Amazon (AMZN) Web Services\u2019 servers and Apple (AAPL) and Google\u2019s app stores, Parler\u2019s CEO warned that the platform may not return.\n* Apple Inc. is launching several projects to extend education and funding opportunities to minority entrepreneurs, part of the $100 million pledge it made in June to help combat racism in response to the national outcry over the killing of George Floyd.\n* The judge overseeing separate lawsuits against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission and a big group of states set a March deadline for the social media company to respond, according to a court filing on Wednesday.\n* Jumia (JMIA) shares jumped more than 10% after Citron Research, a well-known short-seller boosted the company\u2019s price target to $100.

Hope this offers you guys some more info!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Oil Sector, just like everything else, has been impacted pretty heavily by the pandemic. Here I'm gonna discuss what's going on in the Oil Sector, and what that means for an investor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets get some perspective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Historical US Airline fuel consumption](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp).\n\nLets look at the totals for the last five years.\n\n|Year|Consumption (US gallon)|Consumption Change YoY (%)|Cost|Cost Change YoY (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2016|17,044,700,000|1.88%|$24,654,000,000|\\-19.95%|\n|2017|17,295,300,000|1.47%|$29,251,600,000|18.65%|\n|2018|17,868,300,000|3.31%|$38,462,800,000|31.49%|\n|2019|18,269,000,000|2.24%|$36,457,100,000|\\-5.21%|\n|2020|9,359,600,000|\\-44.01%|$13,353,300,000|\\-59.96%|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsumption is down a significant amount, and based on [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/655057/fuel-consumption-of-airlines-worldwide/), it's not expected to make a full recovery in 2021. Airlines represent [7.8% of worldwide oil consumption](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/fuels-aviation-and-shipping). The world Oil Sector is valued at about [$3.3 trillion](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030915/what-percentage-global-economy-comprised-oil-gas-drilling-sector.asp).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if airlines were to make a full operational recovery and begin flying at similar rates to peak years, airlines won't be able to generate the same revenue. Why? [Look at where their money comes from](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp).

To add onto that, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html). The means regular tourism and travel won't be kicking off anytime soon in 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are really interested in taking a deep dive into prices for gas, take a look at consumer [fuel prices, futures, and supply](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/gasoline.php). To help you better understand and analyze this information, check out this [information on how gas is priced](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/factors-affecting-gasoline-prices.php).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"[The nature of the pandemic and social distancing makes weekly gasoline consumption a valuable proxy measure of economic and social activity](https://aei.ag/2020/09/21/the-most-interesting-chart-in-2020-u-s-gasoline-consumption/).\" In other words, gas consumption will rise once people can regularly get out of the house. As I mentioned before, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost important to note is that the [oil companies are actually working to maintain a good supply/demand ratio](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-commit-to-supply-curbs-sustaining-price-rally-11610452802) in order to promote stability and growth in the sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now lets not panic.** Why? Because oil is arguably the foundation of the global economy. People *go to war* because they don't have enough of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at the  [SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOP?p=XOP&.tsrc=fin-srch). This ETF represents the trends of the major domestic companies that operate in the Exploration and Production sub-sector of the domestic energy market. Take a look at its [Holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/XOP/#holdings).\n\nHere how things are looking with the prices:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Date|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020 Open|03 Jan 2020|$96.12|\n|Pre-Crash|19 Feb 2020|$76.52|\n|Current|12 Jan 2020|$70.62|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nXOP is currently sitting at 75.9% of its 52-Week high, and many other stocks in this sector are in similar standing. Why? Because oil has a lot of room for recovery as we move forward into a new administration and start coming out of quarantine. If an investor puts his money in now, he might achieve some solid gains over the next 12-18 months.\n\nAre oil stocks going to the moon? Probably not, but you can always dream of hitting those sweet 2014 highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from [XOP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOP?p=XOP&.tsrc=fin-srch), there are a lot of other ETFs and stocks that you should research for yourself. Here's some examples, but there are tons out there.\n\nStocks:\n\n* [BP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BP?p=BP&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* [Chevron](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVX?p=CVX&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* [Exxon](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM?p=XOM&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* Tons more out there\n\nETFs\n\n* [iShares US Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF (IEO)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IEO?p=IEO&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* [Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLE?p=XLE&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n* Also a ton more out there\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know if you guys want me to look at anything in particular.

{"title": "Buying at the ATH/FOMO", "selftext": "I heard today that more often than not, a stock produces the best gains when people buy at its current all time high. I was wondering what everyone's experience is with this. I don't have FOMO when I buy long-term stocks like AAPL, MSFT, etc. since I'm sure they'll still provide steady gains for years to come. However, I'm more iffy on other stocks that have reached their all time highs, as I worry that it won't produce much more than it has. Take ETSY for example. I planned on buying a share yesterday morning with my $200, since they were at about $183. Then I saw in the pre-market that it shot up to about $206. So I bought a share of Disney instead, since I'm more confident in them in the long-term. My question is, are most people confident in these growth stocks like ETSY to continue shooting up and constantly breaking their ATH? I'm still learning how to do all my proper research on companies and industries, but I don't see them turning into the next GOOG or AMZN or anything. As a result, it makes me feel like I wouldn't see as many gains with this stock. I don't have enough money to buy multiple shares, and I wouldn't want to buy one share of a company and only make about $50 when I could've bought more shares of a cheaper stock for more gains. It's not so much that I have FOMO with growth stocks, it's more like fear of not maximizing potential gains.

Well I'm here to do some diligent DD for you autists to YOLO your life savings into and upgrade the depressing life you live in.\n\n**The company is Sony $SNE**. \n\nSome important things to know:\n\n* Sony dominates in 3 major markets; Consumer electronics, entertainment, and telecommunications\n* Recently, Sony raised its future earnings outlook on [record-breaking earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/sonys-second-quarter-profit-jumps-13point9percent-on-strong-gaming-demand.html)\n* Current P/E ratio sits at around 14, with a historic high of 127 (peaking in PS2 release and averaging 80+ shortly after subsequent PS releases) industry average and competitors is currently at about 25.\n* Sony also has [many predictable sources of revenue including](https://sonyreconsidered.com/sony-q1-2020-earnings-overview-revenue-2-profits-1-f467dafe5609) a \"Financial Services\" branch that advises anti-yolo boomer's assets.\n\nAssuming you autists even read this far, lets get into what the future metrics for this might mean.\n\nLets start with the **Consumer Electronics or the cash guzzling brrrrr machine Playstation** segment. Currently if I want to buy a PS5 and throw my money at our King and money god Kenichiro Yoshida (CEO of Sony) I would have to go through 3rd party. When PS5's hit the market they sell faster than you retards can lose money. In fact, on average [PS5 is outselling Xbox 2-1](https://screenrant.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-series-x-reseller-website/) right now, in addition to that, the Brrrr-virus will cause the game console market to near [$55+ Billion next year](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/multi-billion-dollar-console-gaming-market/). Also, without getting into politics, its also important to know that approximately 10-20% of Stimmy checks will go to buying electronics based on polls. This segment is Sony's cash cow and makes up 30% of their revenue. This number is expected to grow significantly as more consoles are expected to hit the sales floor and is likely to [**exceed the PS2 RECORD 157m**](https://screenrant.com/ps5-order-sales-playstation-ps2-holiday-2020-preorder) **total consoles sold. 200 Million consoles = $90 Billion in sales!!** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nNext is the **steady telecommunications segment; hey Boomers, this tendie stonks only go up segment is for you!** This is your home entertainment stuff like T.V.'s, speakers, solutions segments and mobile phone. They have a ton of patents on imaging and sensing products that they license out to keep revenues boring and flat here. This has been their worst performing segment during Covid and in a relatively fast response, they built the \"sony electronics corporation\", [rebranding their Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile) brand with the goal of significantly decreasing operation costs and bandwagon onto the tech YOLO train.\n\nFinally **the entertainment branch where you autists can laugh, cry, and most importantly tickle your tendies endlessly.** Not including the mad dash to get many licensed PS5 games, Sony's entertainment industry (Columbia pictures) is expected to release a new James Bond No Time to Die and Spiderman 3 in the coming year. Given the shutdown for the last year, the sales in entertainment decreased only 6% thanks to retards like Apple TV+ buying up licensing agreements for Sony's movies and shows. With upcoming hits, and a continued partnership with Apple TV+, revenues are going to quickly recover and even better than before.\n\n**Tldr;** With the growth potential of PS5 alone, Sony should easily be trading at double its P/E of 14 to be closer to its competitors putting the PT at $200+. This does not include the massive shifts that they will be implementing across the org to increase net profits. \n\n**Tldr of the Tldr;**\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\n\nI own (250) shares and another (15) Jan 2022 $140 C and dumping more come the new year (for tax reasons).\n\nGood luck retards.", "id": "kw7qtk", "created_utc": 1610507852.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "The PS5 craze is  smoke and mirrors.

{"title": "SGMO might \ud83d\ude80 at 9am PST", "selftext": "I'll keep this short since there were a couple of SGMO DD posts in December and you guys can't read.\n\n1. SGMO is presenting at JPM (JP Morgan Healthcare Conference) [tomorrow](https://jpm21.endpts.com/) at 9am PST and they will receive widespread attention from many pharma investors.  While everyone jizzing at the seams about their EDIT, NTLA and CRISPY returns, they may not be aware that there are potentially [hazardous](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S216225311630049X) effects of using this genomic editing tech. (You go in to be treated for testicular cancer and then you grow a dong on your forehead)   Also SGMO owns many of the patents to the other three gene-editing companies above.  Despite this, they continue to work on Zinc Finger Nuclease, which is more expensive and labor intensive. This may be indicative of its long term success, since it is safer and has a longer track record in clinical trials. (I don't want to explain the nuance here, I trust my 2.7 GPA Bio friends)  In this clown market, everyone is chasing stocks that are up 420% for the year, no one wants to touch a beaten down underrated company that is pursuing potentially much more lucrative long term production.  The price collapsed in 2018 because they only kind of cured HIV with gene-editing.   One of their collaborators, University of Pennsylvania is also accepting patients for a new HIV trial which may be huge news if it drops on tomorrow's conference.  \n2. The sharks are circling.  SGMO has a partnership with Gilead, Biogen, Pfizer, Novartis, Takeda and Sanofi. All have dumped millions into their gene-editing pipelines.  Biogen is in an interesting place, as they own 17% of SGMO, giving them an enormous bidding advantage.  CEO said he's open to acquisition and the CFO quit for *personal reasons*, which is odd right before a big event like JPM and while everyone is working remote (I assume).  Around [20%](https://dergelcfo.com/2013/01/31/why-do-cfos-leave/) of CFO resignations are for M&A. Oh and there was a massive Block Order over $20 when it peaked two weeks ago.\n3. Some retard shorted the first day it spiked on the 10th, see below.  Since then, the price is over 50% higher and whoever has this position must be sweating, especially with the long list of catalysts (listed above) that could rocket the price in the near future.  In the last two weeks without fail, there is a large sell order at market open.  I hate to use the M word but if they are trying to shake out paper hands, it is working handsomely as 90% of WSB call holders that I have heard from so far have sold at a loss .  You know the cycle, stock spikes WSB fomo's, stock drops -> paper hands then \ud83d\ude80 again and the cycle repeats.  There was also a weak 'Analyst Downgrade' report last week that was paid for with little reasoning for the downgrade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3mj9ble52b61.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=abb6316d1b2f03a1596fa103f263e83d6838c69a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Be careful with this stock.  Bears are desperate and people think of it as that lame boomer tech company that is still somehow alive, don't all-in.  The market cap is 2.4B which pales in comparison to CRSP's 12B so there's lots of room to run.  As for TA, there's a bullflag or something.  There is definitely resistance at $20 which is what the Bears seem to be defending from a break out (lots of interest above $20 because clown market).  Support at $15 seems strong, at least I keep buying there.   I will be waiting with the buy button to buy more while watching the conference.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nSGMO 30C 2/19/21  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBig conference tomorrow.

{"title": "Today's Pre-Market Movers & News [Wednesday, January 13th, 2021]", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)\n\n# 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Stocks set for modest drop\n> * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week\u2019s Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.\n\n> * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target\u2019s stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target\u2019s same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. House to impeach Trump\n> * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump\u2019s first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.\n\n> * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it\u2019s not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It\u2019s unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump\u2019s impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration next Wednesday.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment\n> * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, \u201cI do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.\u201d\n\n> * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week\u2019s siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won\u2019t remove him from office.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account\n> * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump\u2019s account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. \u201cGiven the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump\u2019s channel,\u201d said YouTube, owned by Alphabet\u2019s Google unit. YouTube\u2019s decision to freeze Trump\u2019s account follows the indefinite suspension of the president\u2019s Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns\n> * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.\n\n> * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday.

{"title": "Post #3 Wednesday: I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily (well hourly discounts for the stock market). Here\u2019s what the bot stated under discounted companies...", "selftext": "Wednesday, 13 January 2021\n\n*Live Updates*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First Post:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\\_have\\_a\\_discount\\_trading\\_bot\\_which\\_gives\\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\n* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Note: that this has not been efficiently back tested. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***At Close of Tuesday***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n**Tuesday was a green day.
