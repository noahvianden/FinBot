The AMD-XLNX merger news could come through by EOY. I have questions on how this option gets converted if the merger is approved.\n\n A XLNX 260 Jan 23 option will get converted to 1.73 AMD Jan 23 options.

{"title": "AT&T vs Verizon vs T-Mobile: Are they worth the investment?", "selftext": "The next step for telecommunications around the world is 5G. In the US, the three largest providers in the field are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T. The question here is can they offer us a good return on our investment? The obvious choice for industries like telecommunications are the biggest players in the country. Like I said, in the US those players are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T so lets dig in and find out which one has the best bullish case.\n\n# Operations\n\nLets start with operations. The amount of wireless subscribers is probably the most important metric to look at because it gives us a good idea of whether the operations of the companies are actually expanding. Plus, it is the main and biggest source of revenue for all three of these companies. Verizon has the most subscribers, currently sitting at 121.3 million, followed by T-Mobile with 104.8 million and AT&T with 97.8 million. Verizon acquired TracFone last year, which boosted their subscriber numbers, but apart from that there was no massive change in subscribers for any of the companies. Verizon has also recently broken the record for most awarded brand by JD Power for Wireless Network Quality with 27 consecutive number one awards. Good product quality is always important so that's a positive for Verizon in my books. Plus, they literally service 99% of the Fortune 500 companies and have partnerships with tech leaders like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Right now, it seems like the main priority for all three companies is to improve their 5G network and capability. T-Mobile is the leader in 5G with best download speeds and highest coverage of 295 million having access to its 5G services, out of which 140 million people having access to its fastest service . AT&T's fast 5G coverage is only half T-Mobile's and Verizon is lagging behind with only a quarter of the fast 5G coverage of T-Mobile although their total coverage is similar to T-Mobile's. However, AT&T's 5G has a partnership with Microsoft Azure and Verizon's 5G has partnered with AWS. Such partnerships with major cloud providers are definitely a plus.\n\nVerizon had Verizon Media which comprised of brands like AOL and Yahoo, but Verizon sold its media assets to a private equity company called Apollo Global Management on the 1st of September. The media business was a relatively fast-growing part of Verizon so I'm personally not the biggest fan of that sale. Still, Verizon Media made up only 6.2% of Verizon's total revenue in Q2 so it is a fairly small segment, but it will affect Verizon's revenue and profit going forward. In comparison, AT&T owns Warner Media so you can tell it is a much bigger chunk of its revenue at 21.2% in the third quarter of 2021. They own HBO and HBO Max which have seen an additional 12.5 million subscribers in the past year to a total of 69.4 million subscribers globally. Unfortunately, the gains there were offset by less cinema screenings over the past year although things are obviously picking back up again and we should see better results in the next quarters. Some more bad news, AT&T will be spinning off Warner Media in mid-2022 so that means a big chunk of revenue will be lost next year! I think this will end up badly for AT&T, especially since Warner Media is one of their more profitable segments! Putting that aside, other revenue sources include wireless equipment sales which make up 16.3% of Verizon's revenue, 12.7% of AT&T's revenue and 23.8% of T-Mobile's revenue. Even though it's a big chunk of T-Mobile's revenue, the company actually saw a 5.9% decrease in wireless equipment sales while AT&T saw an 11.4% increase and Verizon saw a massive 30% jump in equipment revenues, which is another plus for Verizon although the question here is whether they can actually keep that up.\n\n# Revenue and Earnings\n\nAlright, so we now have a good idea of what operations Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile have. What does their revenue and earnings look like though? AT&T has the biggest revenue at $39.9 billion in Q3 of 2021, down 5.7% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $173.6 billion, which is almost identical to the same period last year, meaning there was no growth. Verizon follows in second place with a $32.9 billion revenue in Q3 of 2021, up 4.3% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $134.2 billion which is slightly up compared to the same period last year when they had a revenue of $128.4 billion. Finally, T-Mobile brought in a revenue of $19.6 billion in Q3 of 2021 compared to $19.3 billion last year. Last year, T-Mobile saw a massive jump in revenue which was mainly because of their merger with Sprint which closed on 1st April last year, but the growth since then has been much slower. For the last 12 months, T-Mobile's revenue was $79.7 billion up from $60 billion last year, but again that's because of the two companies merging. Overall, Verizon and AT&T have seen a relatively small revenue growth over the last 5 years, less than 2% per year, and they only expect a 1% revenue increase next year. In comparison, T-Mobile's revenue has doubled since 2016, which is massive compared to Verizon and AT&T, but again only a small revenue increase of under 3% is expected next year. What about their earnings though? Verizon have the best net margins at 16.4% which have doubled from an 8% in 2015. Plus, Verizon raised their EPS guidance for 2021 by almost 5%. AT&T's normal margins sit at around 9% although they've had a 0.7% net margin in the past year which are due to write-offs and impairments surrounding their media business. Finally, T-Mobile have the lowest margins with 4.2% right now although their historical average is about 5 or 6%. T-Mobile also have a negative free cash flow unlike the other two, which is a bit concerning. It's not a one-off either as they haven't had a positive free cash flow since 2016! That is most likely due to their faster expansion because telecommunications is extremely capital-intensive, but it is still worrying to see that with T-Mobile. In 2022, AT&T is expected to see a 4.4% drop in earnings while Verizon's earnings are expected to stay essentially flat with only a 0.3% earnings growth, but T-Mobile is looking at a 39.2% earnings growth although that follows after a drop of 32% in 2021. I personally don't think we will see such a big growth from T-Mobile and, to be fair, analysts have been reducing their expectations, too. There are just a lot of uncertainties in the market and the economy and a lot can change over the next year.\n\n# Financial Health\n\nWe can see that these companies are making a lot of cash, but how healthy are their financials? What does their debt look like? Well, surprisingly, AT&T has the lowest debt-to-equity ratio with a 100%, followed by T-Mobile with 106% and finally Verizon with 191.8%! However, Verizon has the lowest effective interest rate with only 1.88% compared to 3.07% for T-Mobile and 3.31% for AT&T. What that means is that even though Verizon has exactly twice the debt of AT&T, their interest payments actually are not that much higher! Also, telecommunications is a very capital-intensive business so this type of debt levels are actually normal for the industry. None of the three companies has substantial cash and none of them can cover their current liabilities with their current assets. However, their quick ratios are just under 1 so the situation is not that bad.\n\n# Dividend\n\nBefore we move to the valuation, we need to look at the dividend. Telecom stocks are not typically fast growers so their dividend is important to investors. AT&T has the highest dividend at 9.4%, but they are expected to cut it by almost half next year following the sale of Warner Media. Verizon follows with a 5.1% dividend while T-Mobile does not pay a dividend at all! Both AT&T and Verizon pay a higher-than-average dividend. Both of them have increased their dividend every year over the last 10 years although Verizon is the company that can actually afford to pay it. Their payout ratio is 47% whereas AT&T's one is massive, 1,578% although that's skewed due to the write-offs I mentioned earlier. Still, AT&T has a historically higher payout ratio than Verizon so that's worth keeping in mind. Lets also take a look at share buybacks since they are another way of returning money to shareholders. Verizon and T-Mobile have not bought back any shares in the last 3 years, but AT&T has actually reduced their number of outstanding shares by 2.5% since 2018.\n\n# Valuation\n\nOkay, we've covered the dividend so lets value the companies. Are they cheap right now? Looking at their current PE, we can see that Verizon is the cheapest with 9.5, followed by T-Mobile with 39.8 and AT&T with 168.2. Obviously, the current PE can be misleading, but if we take a look at their forward PE, we see that AT&T is the cheapest with only 7.3, followed by Verizon with 9.6 and T-Mobile with 32. In terms of the Price-to-earnings-growth ratio, T-Mobile is the cheapest with a 1.11, followed by Verizon with 2.9 and AT&T with 9.6. Finally, AT&T is the cheapest in terms of book value with a PB ratio of 1.04, T-Mobile follows with 2.07 and Verizon with 2.93.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHow can we interpret all of this? Well, AT&T seems to be the cheapest out of the three stocks right now, followed by Verizon. T-Mobile is massively overvalued right now, most likely by investors betting on T-Mobile dominating the 5G market. I honestly cannot see the bullish case for T-Mobile though. Even if they completely dominate the 5G market, they still have such low margins, negative free cash flow and a lot of costs related to capital expenditure. I just don't see them justifying this high price any time soon, definitely not in the next 2 or 3 years. Despite being cheap, AT&T is also a no-go in my books. Why? Their main selling point is their dividend. AT&T will be cutting this in half while also selling their high margin Warner Media subsidiary. Essentially, there is no point to hold them for the dividend and they will also lag behind in revenue and profits so there is no value play there either. It just seems like their best days are behind them. They currently trade for $22.2 which is half of their all-time high back in July 1999. 22 years ago! They have not been able to come close to that price and, in my opinion, they will not do that in the next 5 years. Definitely not worth the investment. You can just stick your money in an index fund and you will get much better returns without having to do more than 5 minutes of research. Plus, AT&T's price is likely to drop further once the Warner Media sale is closed and their dividend drops. The only good purchase here is Verizon. They have a solid dividend, decent margins, they can provide stability during volatile markets. However, they are not expected to grow much. No growth typically equals no jump in price. We can value their free cash flow as much as we want, but if investors don't buy the stock, the price will lag behind the S&P. Still, I think there is a case for Verizon if we see continued inflation or an increase in interest rates. As I said, Verizon's dividend is also solid, which is great for income portfolios or for balancing out your risk. However, if you are looking for price appreciation, a simple US index fund like SPY or VGT will probably outperform Verizon.

{"title": "Tesla Financial Complex: on any trading day TSLA is bigger than AMZ + SP500!", "selftext": "The rally in Tesla Inc.\u2019s shares has lifted the overall stock market value of Elon Musk\u2019s electric carmaker to around US$1.1 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. This year alone, it has added almost US$475 billion in market capitalization, equal to a Procter & Gamble Co., a JPMorgan Chase & Co. or two McDonald\u2019s Corps.\n\nHowever, the real importance and wider footprint of what might be called the \u201cTesla-financial complex\u201d far outstrips the company\u2019s market capitalization. This is thanks to a vast, tangled web of dependent investment vehicles, corporate emulators and an enormous associated derivatives market of unparalleled breadth, depth and hyperactivity.\n\nCombined, these factors mean Tesla\u2019s influence over the ebb and flow of the stock market is far greater than even its size would imply. It may even be historically unrivalled in its wider impact, some analysts say.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the language to describe Tesla any more,\u201d Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management Inc., said. \u201cIt\u2019s like explaining to a person in a two-dimensional world the concept of \u2018up.'\u201d\n\nThe Tesla-financial complex is a phenomenon many investors \u2014 whether passive index funds, traditional mutual funds, hedge funds or ordinary retail investors \u2014 have no choice, but to contend with, given the idiosyncratic force it now exerts over the stock market.\n\n\u201cIt stands out like a sore thumb,\u201d Dean Curnutt, chief executive of Macro Risk Advisors LLC, said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to pay a lot of attention to.\u201d\n\nOne of Tesla\u2019s oddest quirks is the fuel that has helped power its rocketing stock market value. Although its stock is wildly popular with many ordinary retail investors, the swelling size and hyperactivity of Tesla \u201coptions\u201d \u2014 popular derivatives contracts that allow investors to bet both on and against a stock and magnify any gains and losses \u2014 has also flabbergasted many market veterans.\n\nThe nominal trading value of Tesla options has averaged US$241 billion a day in recent weeks, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That compares with US$138 billion a day for Amazon.com Inc., the second most active single-stock option market, and US$112 billion a day for the rest of the S&P 500 index combined. This makes Tesla\u2019s stock more prone to whipsaw movements, because of the \u201cleverage\u201d inherent in using options to trade.\n\n\u201cThe Tesla options volume has always been outsized, but it is now huge,\u201d said Michael Golding, the U.S. head of trading at Optiver, a firm active in the options market. \u201cTesla almost represents a generation. It\u2019s come to represent innovation, at a time when option trading has taken off.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla options market \u2014 more than 60 times as active as the entire FTSE 100 options market, and almost seven times greater than Euro Stoxx 50 options \u2014 has helped push U.S. option trading volumes above actual stock trading volumes this year.\n\nTesla accounts for a big chunk of that aberration. In November, options trading was 50 per cent higher than stock trading in nominal terms, and without Tesla and Amazon, it would have been 20 per cent lower, according to Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe combination of a high market cap and extraordinary option activity make Tesla a critical driver,\u201d the investment bank said in a note.\n\nGolding estimates the combined trading activity in U.S. equity options has historically been between 10 and 20 times larger than activity in the biggest individual equity options market. However, there have been days recently where Tesla\u2019s option trading activity has been five-to-six times the rest of the S&P 500 options ecosystem combined. \u201cThe size of the Tesla options market is absolutely enormous,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value of options depend on what the underlying shares do, but due to their complex mechanics analysts say the option tail can occasionally wag the equity dog if there is enough activity in them, and even bleed into the broader stock market \u2014 adding to its churn and making it harder to navigate for many investors.\n\nCurnutt points out it is unprecedented to have such a huge stock that is also so volatile, and moves to the beat of its own drum. For example, the swelling heft of Tesla\u2019s stock and options market is one of the reasons why the VIX volatility index has diverged so sharply from actual U.S. equity market volatility lately, he said.\n\n\u201cTesla is its own animal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changes how markets price risk.\u201d\n\nOrdinary retail investors have been the primary power behind the Tesla options boom, but some of them have more resources to make bigger leveraged bets on Musk\u2019s company than others.\n\nIT billionaire Leo KoGuan recently said he had by early November accumulated almost 7.2 million shares in Tesla. They had largely been accumulated through aggressive purchases of Tesla call options \u2014 which give buyers the right to buy shares at a pre-agreed price within a certain time period \u2014 and offer a popular route to boost gains. Bloomberg previously verified the growing size of his direct equity stake and options investments, and Tesla\u2019s investor relations head Martin Viecha in September confirmed KoGuan\u2019s original claim.\nThat would make him Tesla\u2019s third-biggest individual shareholder, behind Musk and Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, with a stake worth almost US$8 billion, and has made him a hero on Reddit forums dedicated to the carmaker and trading. \u201cLeo KoGuan = Tesla God,\u201d one thread declared.\n\n\"He\u2019s trading a lot of options, we can definitely see his footprint in the market and he\u2019s inspiring others,\u201d Golding said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s waving the Tesla flag and people on Reddit see him as someone they can follow.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s fame and the volatility of its stock have also started to make it a component in some structured investment products, such as \u201cauto-callables,\u201d further enmeshing its shares into the fate of the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nAuto-callables are complex savings vehicles \u2014 particularly popular with Asian investors \u2014 where bankers construct an attractive, bond-like fixed return by selling stock options. Historically, they have been mostly options on broad stock market indexes such as the S&P 500, Hang Seng or Nikkei, but because of falling market volatility, some bankers have started to structure them with options on choppier individual stocks. Tesla has emerged as a popular choice.\n\n\"Tesla is perceived as safe because it is big and at the technological vanguard, but it\u2019s incredibly lucrative (for investors) to put into structured products because it is so volatile,\u201d Green at Simplify Green said.\n\nThe frenetic rally in Tesla has also buoyed money management groups such as Cathy Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management LLC and Baillie Gifford, which have bet heavily on the electric carmaker.\n\nBut there is a flipside. Its gains have left a huge and growing blot on the performance of many other investors with only negligible or modest positions in Tesla relative to its big heft in their benchmarks \u2014 or \u201cunderweight\u201d in market jargon \u2014 due to what many see as its wildly inflated valuation.\n\nU.S. mutual funds focused on growth stocks suffered their worst bout of underperformance in at least two decades in October, largely due to the carmaker\u2019s rally. For U.S. mutual fund managers as a whole, Tesla alone crimped their relative performance by 0.46 of a percentage point in October, according to Wells Fargo & Co. analysts, helping turn what was heading towards being a decent year into yet another mediocre one for stockpickers.\n\nRead the rest at \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/financialpost.com/investing/the-tesla-financial-complex-how-carmaker-gained-influence-over-the-markets/wcm/017ac912-ca45-456a-8afc-e164c3d0f45e/amp/", "id": "ra5z0p", "created_utc": 1638793043.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Elon selling and here we see many shill posts.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "He sold to pay taxes and exercise more options.

{"title": "AT&T vs Verizon vs T-Mobile: Are they worth the investment?", "selftext": "The next step for telecommunications around the world is 5G. In the US, the three largest providers in the field are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T. The question here is can they offer us a good return on our investment? The obvious choice for industries like telecommunications are the biggest players in the country. Like I said, in the US those players are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T so lets dig in and find out which one has the best bullish case.\n\n# Operations\n\nLets start with operations. The amount of wireless subscribers is probably the most important metric to look at because it gives us a good idea of whether the operations of the companies are actually expanding. Plus, it is the main and biggest source of revenue for all three of these companies. Verizon has the most subscribers, currently sitting at 121.3 million, followed by T-Mobile with 104.8 million and AT&T with 97.8 million. Verizon acquired TracFone last year, which boosted their subscriber numbers, but apart from that there was no massive change in subscribers for any of the companies. Verizon has also recently broken the record for most awarded brand by JD Power for Wireless Network Quality with 27 consecutive number one awards. Good product quality is always important so that's a positive for Verizon in my books. Plus, they literally service 99% of the Fortune 500 companies and have partnerships with tech leaders like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Right now, it seems like the main priority for all three companies is to improve their 5G network and capability. T-Mobile is the leader in 5G with best download speeds and highest coverage of 295 million having access to its 5G services, out of which 140 million people having access to its fastest service . AT&T's fast 5G coverage is only half T-Mobile's and Verizon is lagging behind with only a quarter of the fast 5G coverage of T-Mobile although their total coverage is similar to T-Mobile's. However, AT&T's 5G has a partnership with Microsoft Azure and Verizon's 5G has partnered with AWS. Such partnerships with major cloud providers are definitely a plus.\n\nVerizon had Verizon Media which comprised of brands like AOL and Yahoo, but Verizon sold its media assets to a private equity company called Apollo Global Management on the 1st of September. The media business was a relatively fast-growing part of Verizon so I'm personally not the biggest fan of that sale. Still, Verizon Media made up only 6.2% of Verizon's total revenue in Q2 so it is a fairly small segment, but it will affect Verizon's revenue and profit going forward. In comparison, AT&T owns Warner Media so you can tell it is a much bigger chunk of its revenue at 21.2% in the third quarter of 2021. They own HBO and HBO Max which have seen an additional 12.5 million subscribers in the past year to a total of 69.4 million subscribers globally. Unfortunately, the gains there were offset by less cinema screenings over the past year although things are obviously picking back up again and we should see better results in the next quarters. Some more bad news, AT&T will be spinning off Warner Media in mid-2022 so that means a big chunk of revenue will be lost next year! I think this will end up badly for AT&T, especially since Warner Media is one of their more profitable segments! Putting that aside, other revenue sources include wireless equipment sales which make up 16.3% of Verizon's revenue, 12.7% of AT&T's revenue and 23.8% of T-Mobile's revenue. Even though it's a big chunk of T-Mobile's revenue, the company actually saw a 5.9% decrease in wireless equipment sales while AT&T saw an 11.4% increase and Verizon saw a massive 30% jump in equipment revenues, which is another plus for Verizon although the question here is whether they can actually keep that up.\n\n# Revenue and Earnings\n\nAlright, so we now have a good idea of what operations Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile have. What does their revenue and earnings look like though? AT&T has the biggest revenue at $39.9 billion in Q3 of 2021, down 5.7% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $173.6 billion, which is almost identical to the same period last year, meaning there was no growth. Verizon follows in second place with a $32.9 billion revenue in Q3 of 2021, up 4.3% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $134.2 billion which is slightly up compared to the same period last year when they had a revenue of $128.4 billion. Finally, T-Mobile brought in a revenue of $19.6 billion in Q3 of 2021 compared to $19.3 billion last year. Last year, T-Mobile saw a massive jump in revenue which was mainly because of their merger with Sprint which closed on 1st April last year, but the growth since then has been much slower. For the last 12 months, T-Mobile's revenue was $79.7 billion up from $60 billion last year, but again that's because of the two companies merging. Overall, Verizon and AT&T have seen a relatively small revenue growth over the last 5 years, less than 2% per year, and they only expect a 1% revenue increase next year. In comparison, T-Mobile's revenue has doubled since 2016, which is massive compared to Verizon and AT&T, but again only a small revenue increase of under 3% is expected next year. What about their earnings though? Verizon have the best net margins at 16.4% which have doubled from an 8% in 2015. Plus, Verizon raised their EPS guidance for 2021 by almost 5%. AT&T's normal margins sit at around 9% although they've had a 0.7% net margin in the past year which are due to write-offs and impairments surrounding their media business. Finally, T-Mobile have the lowest margins with 4.2% right now although their historical average is about 5 or 6%. T-Mobile also have a negative free cash flow unlike the other two, which is a bit concerning. It's not a one-off either as they haven't had a positive free cash flow since 2016! That is most likely due to their faster expansion because telecommunications is extremely capital-intensive, but it is still worrying to see that with T-Mobile. In 2022, AT&T is expected to see a 4.4% drop in earnings while Verizon's earnings are expected to stay essentially flat with only a 0.3% earnings growth, but T-Mobile is looking at a 39.2% earnings growth although that follows after a drop of 32% in 2021. I personally don't think we will see such a big growth from T-Mobile and, to be fair, analysts have been reducing their expectations, too. There are just a lot of uncertainties in the market and the economy and a lot can change over the next year. \n\n# Financial Health\n\nWe can see that these companies are making a lot of cash, but how healthy are their financials? What does their debt look like? Well, surprisingly, AT&T has the lowest debt-to-equity ratio with a 100%, followed by T-Mobile with 106% and finally Verizon with 191.8%! However, Verizon has the lowest effective interest rate with only 1.88% compared to 3.07% for T-Mobile and 3.31% for AT&T. What that means is that even though Verizon has exactly twice the debt of AT&T, their interest payments actually are not that much higher! Also, telecommunications is a very capital-intensive business so this type of debt levels are actually normal for the industry. None of the three companies has substantial cash and none of them can cover their current liabilities with their current assets. However, their quick ratios are just under 1 so the situation is not that bad. \n\n# Dividend\n\nBefore we move to the valuation, we need to look at the dividend. Telecom stocks are not typically fast growers so their dividend is important to investors. AT&T has the highest dividend at 9.4%, but they are expected to cut it by almost half next year following the sale of Warner Media. Verizon follows with a 5.1% dividend while T-Mobile does not pay a dividend at all! Both AT&T and Verizon pay a higher-than-average dividend. Both of them have increased their dividend every year over the last 10 years although Verizon is the company that can actually afford to pay it. Their payout ratio is 47% whereas AT&T's one is massive, 1,578% although that's skewed due to the write-offs I mentioned earlier. Still, AT&T has a historically higher payout ratio than Verizon so that's worth keeping in mind. Lets also take a look at share buybacks since they are another way of returning money to shareholders. Verizon and T-Mobile have not bought back any shares in the last 3 years, but AT&T has actually reduced their number of outstanding shares by 2.5% since 2018. \n\n# Valuation\n\nOkay, we've covered the dividend so lets value the companies. Are they cheap right now? Looking at their current PE, we can see that Verizon is the cheapest with 9.5, followed by T-Mobile with 39.8 and AT&T with 168.2. Obviously, the current PE can be misleading, but if we take a look at their forward PE, we see that AT&T is the cheapest with only 7.3, followed by Verizon with 9.6 and T-Mobile with 32. In terms of the Price-to-earnings-growth ratio, T-Mobile is the cheapest with a 1.11, followed by Verizon with 2.9 and AT&T with 9.6. Finally, AT&T is the cheapest in terms of book value with a PB ratio of 1.04, T-Mobile follows with 2.07 and Verizon with 2.93. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nHow can we interpret all of this? Well, AT&T seems to be the cheapest out of the three stocks right now, followed by Verizon. T-Mobile is massively overvalued right now, most likely by investors betting on T-Mobile dominating the 5G market. I honestly cannot see the bullish case for T-Mobile though. Even if they completely dominate the 5G market, they still have such low margins, negative free cash flow and a lot of costs related to capital expenditure. I just don't see them justifying this high price any time soon, definitely not in the next 2 or 3 years. Despite being cheap, AT&T is also a no-go in my books. Why? Their main selling point is their dividend. AT&T will be cutting this in half while also selling their high margin Warner Media subsidiary. Essentially, there is no point to hold them for the dividend and they will also lag behind in revenue and profits so there is no value play there either. It just seems like their best days are behind them. They currently trade for $22.2 which is half of their all-time high back in July 1999. 22 years ago! They have not been able to come close to that price and, in my opinion, they will not do that in the next 5 years. Definitely not worth the investment. You can just stick your money in an index fund and you will get much better returns without having to do more than 5 minutes of research. Plus, AT&T's price is likely to drop further once the Warner Media sale is closed and their dividend drops. The only good purchase here is Verizon. They have a solid dividend, decent margins, they can provide stability during volatile markets. However, they are not expected to grow much. No growth typically equals no jump in price. We can value their free cash flow as much as we want, but if investors don't buy the stock, the price will lag behind the S&P. Still, I think there is a case for Verizon if we see continued inflation or an increase in interest rates. As I said, Verizon's dividend is also solid, which is great for income portfolios or for balancing out your risk. However, if you are looking for price appreciation, a simple US index fund like SPY or VGT will probably outperform Verizon. There are some companies that can offer you a better return so check out my stock picks here if you are interested. Let me know what you think about Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile down below. \n\nP.S.

In fact you can find many articles from the past 6 months about how the cyclical DRAM market has entered a slower phase and the combination of inventory and production ramp-up time means we can expect slower growth from chip makers that are heavily DRAM makers. Like Micron.  That\u2019s the sole reason why Micron (PE 14) has not followed Nvidia (PE 114), AMD (PE 47), Broadcom (PE 42), Applied Materials (PE 27), Qualcomm (PE 23) into much higher valuations.\n\nBut now there\u2019s a nasty new version of an exploit called RowHammer that hackers can use to disrupt or steal from DDR4 systems, which is most of the worlds current PC and Unix systems.\n\nDDR5 is naturally more resistant to RowHammer.  Intel and AMD motherboards are already scheduled to ship in 2022 with DDR5 support, so the engineering work is done.  The Rowhammer exploit increases the urgency to upgrade systems and will thus shift the demand curve ahead of what the analysts have in their models.\n\nNow DDR5 makers like Micron, instead of being seen as in a more slow-growth phase of their industry compared to other chip makers, will quickly be recognized to be in high-growth phase, maybe emergency high-growth if a couple Rowhammer exploitations get publicized.\n\nEdit:  I know I misspelled RowHammer in the title.
