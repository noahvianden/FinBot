{"title": "Amateur hour at RIVN?", "selftext": "When new and potentially interesting stocks IPO (or meme stocks emerge), once their options appear I start tracking their Greeks and other stats with 15-minute data to see how they track. I did this with RIVN on its first day of options trade and was shocked to see the premiums at one of the highest IV levels that I have ever recorded (details at end).\n\nSo then I see that RIVN is reporting earnings after hours on Thur Dec 16. [Any of you who know me know that I heavily trade earnings strangles - this is NOT where this post is going - earnings strangles don't normally pay on young stocks nor meme stocks]. So I am considering writing covered calls on Wed, either at market open or just before close (premiums bloom up a little at O or C). I may also turn it into a collar by buying a distant OTM put.\n\nThis possible strategy, though, is not the point of this post. I normally go look at a company's investor relations page to get some perspective. I did that mid-day Sunday and I get the message \"This page is currently undergoing maintenance.\" I had to laugh - that is pretty rinky-dink for a company that is trying to prove that it is a competitor for Tesla and the like. Anyway ..\n\nFor those of you still reading, here are some specs:\n\nI capture and use implied DAILY volatility and label it IDV. I compare that to various measures of historical daily volatility (HDV). Annual measures of volatility would he about 16 times the daily measure if using a 252-day data year, to give some perspective.\n\nThe first log entry I have for RIVN is on Tue Nov 16 at 12:58 PM PST (2 minutes before market close), ATM Nov 19 180 Call, 170 Put (RIVN @ 174.47!!!), Call IDV was 0.1212, Put IDV was 0.11739. To give you some perspective on how insanely high this is, here are some comparisons for other securities, same day about the same time (all at the money, all Nov 19, showing call IDV only):\n\nSPY 0.00542\n\nIWM 0.009685\n\nGME 0.03808\n\nHOOD 0.02483  Note: HOOD Call IDV on Aug 4th: 0.1209 - so actually higher!!\n\nOn Friday at 11:45, ATM Dec 17 option IDVs were 112 Call 0.05806 and 110 Put 0.05576. BUT by Wed I expect these to be way up once again, and if so, I may do a collar (covered call plus cheap hedge). I used to do collars back in the crazy gold (GLD) mania and they were extremely profitable. So we will see, and I will post if I actually make a trade.\n\nMeanwhile we monitor Investor Relations to see if that gets updated properly.

(First principles). Once I have a dilema, where I\u2019m not sure if I should sell/hold/sell calls/puts and what not, I sit down with my headphones and write it down. Gather as much information as I can, analyze it and take a break. Usually I take a walk with my headphones and I think over what I was analyzing. By the time I get back I have much more clarity. \n\n2) I check myself before making any trade. For starters, if I\u2019m anxious, mad, sad, angry\u2026 I don\u2019t think or talk stocks because I am calling the shots in my portfolio and a level headed decision is usually better. \n\n3) I listen to folks but formulate my own opinions.
