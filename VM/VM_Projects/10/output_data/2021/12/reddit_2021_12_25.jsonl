Apparently it's at least somewhat true. I don't think that this is a reflection of how most Gen z females think at all, but the fact that there's so many people out there that view iPhone and Apple products as status symbols just means one thing: \ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb5.\n\nFrankly I think these people are pompous, ignorant pricks but I love it.

The stock I chose was Apple because I knew this cool chick was a lot cooler than me.   Thanks to Apple, I now have 10 million dollars.  I also invested heavily when Jobs died and AAPL sold off sharply.  And even bought a lot last year during the Trump China trade supply chain wrench in the works which was before covid really messed up supply chain.

I want to gravitate towards Musk as a Jobs 2.0 but the way the market treats the stock (speculative, as you noted) keeps me away.  Steve Jobs came across as much more of a grown-up than Musk does, so when it comes to putting money on Musk I hesitate at what tweet might come out next.

Very overvalued and the most cult-like of the meme stocks. Also, Steve Jobs was a genius, yes, but he was not the greatest CEO and once almost tanked Apple and left the company.  Tim Cook is a much better CEO and manager who keeps everything running smoothly on a steady upward trajectory. So genius does not = good CEO and Musk is highly eccentric and fickle.  He also tweets personal feelings and opinions which is quite unprofessional.\n\nBitcoin may be created by a huge waste of electricity but it essentially worthless in that respect You can plug your EV into it. The electricity is simply wasted. and it pollutes badly. So IMHO cryptos are like the Dutch tulip craze minus the tulips. At least then you had a nice flower.

Buying either one gets you the right to do something, selling makes you obligated to respect an agreement. \n\nGenerally speaking:\n\nBuying a put option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at an agreed upon price (strike price) up until the expiration date. Think of it like buying insurance. Selling a put option means you're on the hook to sell 100 shares of the underlying if the buyer chooses to \"exercise\" their \"option\". The seller is like the insurance provider. \n\nBuying a call option means you have the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price up until expiration. In this way you can gamble that a stock will go up with limited financial risk, but a small window to be right. A seller makes themselves obligated on the other side. \n\nSome example strategies might be selling put options far below the current underlying price, making yourself essentially an insurance salesman, or to lower your cost of purchasing the underlying at a price you want. \n\nOther strategies include buying 100 shares of the underlying and selling calls against it. Limiting your upside potential for a period of time, but otherwise collecting premiums almost risk free. \n\nBeyond that there are almost countless ways you can combine options sales and purchases to create scenarios that can make money. \n\nThe challenge with options is you're very leveraged, and with a margin account you can set yourself up pretty easily to be in a scenario where a losing trade could cost you significantly more than you have in your account. \n\n- Do a ton of homework before you trade. \n- Trust no one that's selling you anything until you know enough to smell bullshit (and by the time you know that much you'll probably recognize what they're selling is a well known strategy). \n- Read up on margin and what it can mean for you. \n- Know that with the power of compounding a hundred small non-sexy wins adds up to a lot more over time than searching for that free lotto ticket. \n- Paper trade. If you don't know what that is, read up and paper trade any strategies you like. Trust your testing, not the YouTuber selling you a course. \n- Learn how to roll positions to manage risk\n\nLastly...know that once real money is on the line and you do it for real everything changes.
