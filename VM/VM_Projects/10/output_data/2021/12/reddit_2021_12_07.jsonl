{"title": "ZM is Looking Good", "selftext": "When I entered this community, I was here to learn more about options. Anytime I do anything, I'm obsessed with becoming a subject matter expert on it and have to consume everything. So while I feel I know enough to have an edge, my personal education will never end.\n\nOne thing I did learn quickly in this community. there are a tremendous amount of traders that simply don\u2019t believe 5-10% returns a month are possible.\n\n100% of my trades are verified by third parties as I have some business interests that are developing several of my methodologies into private funds. Those results aren\u2019t for you. You\u2019re welcome to believe they don\u2019t even exist. It's lame that I even mention something that I'm not going to show you. But here we are.\n\nInstead, I\u2019ll just show you how I do it. I\u2019m not going to sit here and display every single trade, but I\u2019ll go over one at a time, until I\u2019m tired of doing it or Reddit no longer is of interest to me.\n\nI first look at market sentiment to decide how I\u2019m going to approach the day. That\u2019s about as simple as looking at the price action of SPY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tpmpfns75481.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc96d179be5d36f37cb5124a3b734791545a8497\n\nSpy has been consistently moving up, so my overall bias is bullshit, but there are times when it naturally dips. During those times even though it\u2019s an overall bull market, I take a more neutral stance on it.\n\nMy stance will ultimately determine what type of trade I\u2019m going to take. In neutral to bull markets I will generally trade short straddles. In strong bull markets, l\u2019ll trade naked puts. I don\u2019t really get too funky on the more complex options strategies as they seem like they were more designed to get people to trade as opposed to helping people get profitable.\n\nOnce I have a market sentiment, I start paging through various charts. I screen looking for companies that most everyone else is trading. High volume, good volatility. I\u2019m not against penny stocks, but you can get stuck in there with limited options and odd pricing at times if things go against you. I prefer $20 and above. Not upper limit for me. Though I\u2019ve never traded anything higher than Tesla at this point.\n\nToday the market really took off. However, gaps give me a sense of pause as gaps tend to close. They don\u2019t always close but it would appear they do more times than not. So when I see a gap, I visualize it closing to get a better idea of sentiment. Because of today\u2019s gap, I\u2019m looking for stocks that are optimal for short strangles.\n\nLet\u2019s have a gander at ZM. It peaked my interest because while the rest of the market is enjoying some new gains today, ZM Is holding steady.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6iiv1zhv75481.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e8fcdd17bd542f92ea03155f681636d348cdb3\n\nIt\u2019s been dropping lately. COVID is wearing off. People are getting back to work. Virtual conferencing wasn\u2019t as vital as it was last year when ZM roared up to some impressive numbers. I think ZM is starting to settle into a valuation that makes sense for them. People once believed it was a $100 as well as believed it was a $580 stock.\n\nIf the stimulus didn\u2019t happen, $580 would have never happened. But ZM would likely be doing better than not, so I\u2019m comfortable looking at this to trade. It\u2019s been going down, and by this analysis it may have found a current bottom for a new area of support, or it just might be a retracement up a bit before falling back down.\n\nIf it continues downward, I want to make sure I\u2019m far away enough that it stays within the range of my short strangle. I don't believe it's going to be having some any impressive highs anytime soon.\n\nJanuary 21 2021 Options Chain is paying out some good premiums. I prefer looking 30-60 days out. I like low deltas. I\u2019m not the guy chasing high returns and gambling. I like to be right way more than I\u2019m wrong, but I also want to make sure I\u2019m adequately protecting myself in the event I am wrong.\n\nI\u2019ll be selling a call at 250 and a put at 140. Giving me some delta neutrality and room for this guy to breath for the next month and a half.\n\nBecause I have a portfolio margin account, my cash collateral to secure this trade is significantly less than if I had a cash account or a regulation T account. I only have to put up $1737 to collect at least $385 in credits. That\u2019s a ROI of over 20% on my money. That\u2019s some good fucking returns.\n\nBecause of the higher premiums as well, it extends out my breakeven levels as well giving this trade even more room to breath.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to take this trade and see what this bitch will do.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m not a financial advisor, though in my 30s I was. This isn\u2019t financial advise. You\u2019re a fucking moron to let a guy on Reddit make determinations of how you trade with your money that you worked hard for. It\u2019s my interest however, not to have you worry about the specifics of the trade, but the process I took to arrive at that trade.\n\nAll that said, l trade for a living. I live a very comfortable lifestyle. I know my shit. I don't need to sell you shit. I earn 6.8% returns a month. Take it or leave it. My message is for those that want to hear.\n\nWe're all here to make money.

Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 6, 2021**\n\nAfter last week\u2019s extremely volatile trading, stocks bounced on Monday, as investors continued weighing the potential impact of the new coronavirus \u2018Omicron\u2019 variant and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. \n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.18%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.80%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.90%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.01%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -7.80%\n* Del Taco (TACO): +65.60%\n* BioNTech (BNTX): -18.34%\n* Moderna (MRNA): -13.49%\n* Airbnb (ABNB): +8.46%\n* Crude Oil (WTI): +4.44%\n\nSome encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, \u201cClearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although it\u2019s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there\u2019s a great degree of severity to it. But we\u2019ve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesn\u2019t cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.\u201d \n\nLike I said last week during my recaps, it was way too early to panic regarding Omicron, I remember the same song and dance happening after the discovery of Delta, which ended up being one of the juiciest dips all year. It\u2019s still too early to make any conclusions, but the data is so far very encouraging. I\u2019m personally nibbling at some stocks last week and today. \n\nMeanwhile, however, Moderna (MRNA) President Stephen Hoge told ABC on Sunday that there was a \"real risk that we're going to see a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccines\" currently available as the Omicron variant spreads. The vaccine-maker had also said last week it could have a COVID-19 booster shot designed to address the Omicron variant available as soon as March. CEO Stephane Bancel said something very similar last week. Not to be too conspiratorial, but it is in the interest of these companies to produce a new booster vaccine to boost profits. I personally trust public health officials over CEOs and executives, though again, more data is needed to make any conclusions.\n\nJ. Pow\u2019s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word \u201ctransitory\u201d to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, \u201c\u201cWe tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won\u2019t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it\u2019s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper \u201ca few months sooner\u201d than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. \n\nAgain, this is simply my humble opinion. As I have said for months at this point, I am unconcerned regarding tapering the pace of quantitative easing. I remain bullish until the Fed begins concretely discussing plans to raise the interest rate, which the Fed currently telegraphs to happen around the middle of next year, according to the Fed\u2019s dot-plot. Again, this is simply my opinion, don\u2019t get too worked up about it (been weirdly getting a lot of aggressive comments because of this opinion from doom and gloomers). As always, I acknowledge the risks and am prepared to act if it turns out I am incorrect.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock gapped down in the morning, before mostly recovering by market close, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was investigating a report from a whistleblower that alleges that Tesla did not properly inform buyers that defective electrical connectors on the panel could cause fires.\n* Lucid Motors (LCID), another EV company, is also being investigated by the SEC. Lucid said the probe \u201cappears to concern\u201d the merger that took the company public along with \u201ccertain projections and statements\u201d made by the company prior to becoming public. \n* The Nasdaq Inc is geared to eclipse rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in initial public offerings (IPO) this year, which has seen companies raise record levels of capital. Nasdaq raised a total of $191.38 billion through IPOs in 2021, compared with $109.25 billion raised at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) broke (at least briefly) from its death spiral to climb roughly 10% after the company announced it was reorganizing its e-commerce team and naming a new Chief Financial Officer in the face of tightening regulation, increasing competition, slowing growth, and a more than 60% loss in stock price.\n* The Department of Justice opened an investigation into allegations that Apple (AAPL) is unevenly enforcing its rules for app developers, favoring some like Roblox (RBLX) at the expense of others.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) won Yahoo Finance company of the year\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) coverage initiated by KeyCorp with a price target of $191 and a rating of Overweight.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) with two target raises. Stock currently around $565\n   * JP Morgan from $600 to $655 at Overweight\n   * UBS Group from $580 to $660 at Buy. \n* American Express (AXP) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $209 to $211 at Overweight.

Stock currently around $86\n* Micron Technology (MU) target raised by Cowen from $80 to $99 at Outperform. Stock currently around $82\n* Signature Bank of New York (SBNY) with a massive target raise by Morgan Stanley from $400 to $475 at Overweight. Stock currently around $311. Very notable.\n* Snowflake (SNOW) target raised by Credit Suisse from $455 to $465 at Outperform. Stock currently $340\n* Ulta Beauty (ULTA) target raised by Barclays from $492 to $516 at Overweight. Stock currently around $390\n\n\u201cIn my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not a risk, but it is an opportunity.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 7, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 7, 2021**\n\nWrote this on Friday\u2019s Recap: \"*On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip buying. As usual I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market, and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed\u2019s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.\"* \n\n*My point with highlighting is this: the market loves to overreact. Do your own research, stick to your convictions, never listen to mainstream media, but be prepared to react to anything. The market loves overreacting, both to the upside and downside, reality is always somewhere in the middle.*\n\nStocks extend gains from yesterday with a huge bounce today after new Omicron data coming out of South Africa suggests the severity of the variant is less than originally expected and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. In other news, the People\u2019s Bank of China recommitted to accommodative monetary policy in the country in an effort to stimulate growth. This is notable at a time when other Central Banks across the world are tightening policy.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +2.04%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): 3.01%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.38%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.30%\n* Volatility Index: -15.34%\n* Apple (AAPL): +3.54%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.96%\n* Ford Motors (F): 3.85%\n* NovaVax (NVAX): +28.87%\n* Square (SQ): +5.27%\n\nSome encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today.

This is interesting given most other Central Banks around the world, including the US, have started tightening monetary policy. \n\nAfter a massive 25% spike in the Volatility Index (VIX) last week, the fear index lost all its gains in two trading days, a sign that market participants remain bullish and eager to buy up any dips in the market.\n\nAlongside concerns of the Omicron variant, investors have also been ascertaining when and how robustly the Federal Reserve will move to accelerate its asset-purchase tapering program and raise interest rates from their current near-zero levels as inflationary pressures continue to mount. On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release its November Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is expected to show the fastest year-over-year rise in core consumer prices since 1991, at a 4.6% annual gain. \n\nTech and growth stocks are the longest-duration assets, which means they're going to be the most negatively impacted in valuation by any bump up in inflation which would take interest rates up. But on the other hand, what the Fed is doing and is even talking about doing, which is going from accommodative to more restrictive monetary policy, is known.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for \"green\" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.\n* Ford partnered with Salesforce (CRM) to launch new SaaS software for Ford\u2019s commercial and services unit. \n* In similar news, automakers Stellantis rolled out its new software strategy today, with a 2030 target of 20 billion euros in annual revenue. \n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was acquiring messaging platform Quill in an effort to improve messaging tools in the social media. Based on Salesforce technology, the system will digitize paperwork for contractors, repair technicians and other trades people, and start at $39 per month per user, Ford said. \n* Apple (AAPL) signed an agreement with the Chinese government worth an eye-watering $275 billion to placate threats that would hurt their devices and services in the country. As part of the agreement, Apple promised to use more components from Chinese suppliers in its devices, sign deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate on technology with Chinese universities and directly invest in Chinese tech companies. \n* Intel (INTC) rose 3% after the company announced it planned to spin off its self-driving unit Mobileye into a company. The IPO is set for 2022, with Intel hanging on to a majority of the company. \n* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday argued that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia Corp carries out its acquisition of Arm. Sad to say, since NVDA is my favorite company and largest holding, but doesn\u2019t seem like the Arm deal will go through in the end. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that price target upgrades were written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $164 to $200 at Overweight.

Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\n- 2 types of randomness analogy\n  - Mediocristan \u2013 land of average\n  - Extremistan \u2013 land of black swans\n    - Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE \u2013 Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ\n      - Black swans don&#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.\n    - Extemistan \u2013 inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE \u2013 wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data\n      - Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.\n- Black Swan Example \u2013 Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &quot;looking out for my best interests&quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.\n  - The turkey had &quot;learned backwards&quot; from observation\n  - oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?\n  - Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&#39;t. You don&#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.\n    - Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &quot;Black Monday&quot;\n- Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly\n- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\n- Na\u00efve Empiricism \u2013 We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.\n- Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Na\u00efve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _Necessarily_ evidence.\n  - Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.\n- The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.\n- Confirmation Bias \u2013 our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.\n  - To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong\n- Narrative Fallacy \u2013 this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events\n  - We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&#39;t\n    - The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.\n- In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.\n  - Most people have a preference for number 1\n  - Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina\n- We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.\n- Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off\n- We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.\n- Taleb&#39;s Perfect World \u2013 &quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.\n- Louis Pasteur \u2013 &quot;Luck favors the prepared&quot;\n- The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right\n- So, what to do if you can&#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??\n  - Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example \u2013 don&#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.\n  - Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions\n  - Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities\n  - People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.\n  - Barbell Strategy\n    - Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative\n    - Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments \u2013 (Example \u2013 T-Bills)\n    - Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example \u2013 VC)\n    - You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans\n    - Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones\n    - I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan\n\n# **Anti-Fragile**\n\n- Fragile-Robust-Antifragile. Fragile wants tranquility, Antifragile grows from disorder and robust doesn&#39;t care too much\n- Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. This is Antifragile. The opposite is fragile\n- Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets stronger\n- I would rather be dumb and antifragile than smart and fragile\n  - It is much easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.\n- Asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events is antifragile; the reverse is fragile\n- Fragile needs to be very predictive in its approach, and conversely, predictive systems cause fragility\n- For the economy to be antifragile as a whole, individual companies must be fragile. We don&#39;t have this currently\n  - Many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established\n- We are fragilizing social and economic systems by denying them stressors and randomness\n- We make social, political (and other) systems vulnerable to Black Swans when we over stabilize them\n- The problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks. They become prone to black swan events\n- Attempts at eliminating the business cycle led to more fragile economic systems (IE \u2013 The Greenspan Put)\n  - Part of this is due to the fact it is easier to sell &quot;Look what I did for you&quot; than &quot;Look what I avoided for you.&quot;\n- Our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is about zero\n- What makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don&#39;t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile, and they do not need to forecast\n  - A person with extra cash in the bank and stockpiles of tradeable goods and gold bars doesn&#39;t need to forecast correctly.\n  - People in debt are fragile and need a lot more forecasting ability\n- There are 2 types of domains\n  - Those we can somewhat predict. IE \u2013 The physical like planet motions\n  - Those that we cannot. IE - The Black Swan \u2013 Social, Economic, and Cultural life\n- The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside. That means lowering exposure to negative black swans\n- What matters is the route taken, the order of events, not just the destination \u2013 what scientists call path-dependent property\n  - Example \u2013 A kidney stone operation and anesthesia after is very different than the opposite\n- People miss the strong logical precedence of survival over success\n- In other words, if something is fragile, its risk of breaking make anything you do to improve it or make it &quot;efficient&quot; inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking\n- Barbell Strategy or Bimodal Strategy\n  - Combination of 2 extreme areas with nothing in the middle\n    - Playing it safe in some areas \u2013 robust to black swans\n    - Taking a lot of small risks in other \u2013 open to positive black swans\n      - The whole then becomes antifragile\n- The causes extreme risk aversion on one side and extreme risk loving on the other\n  - But the barbell also results, because of its construction, in the reduction of downside risk \u2013 the elimination of the risk of ruin\n- Antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia, protect your downside from extreme harm, and let the upside take care of itself\n- Yiddish proverb &quot;Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself.&quot;\n  - Many people tend to provide for the best and hope the worst takes care of itself\n- Example of above\n  - People find insuring their house a necessity, not something to be judged against a financial strategy, but when it comes to their portfolios, because of the way things are framed in the press, they don&#39;t look at them the same way.\n  - They think that the barbell strategy needs to be examined for its potential return as an investment. That is NOT the point. The barbell is simply an idea of insurance of survival\n- When you are fragile, you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. Conversely, when you think you know more than you do, you are fragile to error.\n  - Overconfidence leads to reliance on forecasts, which causes borrowing, then to the fragility of leverage. Example \u2013 Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)\n- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\n- Much of what other people know isn&#39;t worth knowing\n- Non-linear means that the response is not straightforward and not in a straight line, so if you double say, the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect.\n- For the fragile, shocks bring higher and higher harm as their intensity increases (up to a point)\n  - Example \u2013 Falling from a height of 30ft one time brings more than 30 times the harm of falling 30 times from a height of 1ft\n- What is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects\n- The fragile is hurt a lot more by extreme events than by a succession of intermediate ones\n- For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits as their intensity increases (up to a point)\n  - Example \u2013 powerlifters get more benefits lifting 300 lbs one time than 1 lb 300 times\n    - Every additional pound brings more benefits, until one gets close to the limit, what would be known as &quot;failure&quot;\n- Convexity effect analogy (Positive and Negative) Think of a smile (+) and frown (-)\n  - Positive \u2013 Convex \u2013 Think Happy face - Gain more than pain. Likes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more upside than downside, it will be convex (slopes up)\n  - Negative - Concave \u2013 Think Sad face \u2013 Pain more than gain. Dislikes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more downside than upside, it will be concave (slopes down). The more harm from the unexpected. Large deviations have a disproportionately larger and larger effect (acceleration)\n- The inverse philosophers stone or how to detect fragility\n  - Figure out if our miscalculations or mis forecasts are on balance more harmful than they are beneficial, and how accelerating the damage will be.\n    - You don&#39;t have to be exact with this measurement. You can get a scale that isn&#39;t zeroed and know if you are gaining or losing weight. I can have a non-exact ruler and know if my child is growing or not.\n  - Example \u2013 Government deficits are particularly concave to changes in economic conditions. Every additional deviation in, say, the unemployment rate, particularly when the government has debt, makes deficits incrementally worse.\n  - Financial leverage for a company has the same effect: you need to borrow more and more to get the same result\n- Average (First order effects) do not matter\n  - &quot;Do not cross a river if it is on average 4ft deep&quot;\n  - Analogy \u2013 You grandmother will spend the next 2 hours at 70 degrees (Perfect Grandmother Temp).\n    - But there is also a second point of the data \u2013 she will spend the first hour at 0 and the 2nd hour at 140 for an average of 70\n    - Temp changes become more and more harmful as they deviate from 70. And the 2nd piece of information, the variability, turned out to be more important than the first.\n  - Point of above \u2013 The notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations\n    - Grandmother is non-linear to temperature (response is not a straight line), it curves inward (concave), the more nonlinear the response, the less relevant the average\n- Many people are drawn to financial markets because we hear or see the success, but the failures are buried and we don&#39;t hear about them", "id": "rasfya", "created_utc": 1638857654.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for this, quite interesting.

{"title": "2022 Outlook: The Great Rebalancing Begins", "selftext": "\u201cInvestors seem to agree that the economy is beset by huge excesses and extremes, and that 2022 is likely to normalize economic growth and inflation. However, will the new business cycle resemble the prior one of low growth and low inflation, or are structural shifts afoot that require portfolio repositioning? The stock market seems to discount a scenario in which the winners of the past cycle will repeat. Bond market pricing suggests accelerated interest rate hikes in 2022 and that unchecked inflation will be destructive to the cycle. We suggest a third scenario: a robust global recovery; a moderation of US growth and inflation; and more balanced monetary and fiscal policies. We expect the S&P 500 to be range-bound and volatile, and bond returns to be negative net of inflation. Consider rebalancing portfolios: US equities versus non-US; growth versus value; cyclicals versus defensives; megacap versus small- and mid-cap stocks; and active versus passive management.

That's not that great, at some point the put is too far OTM and you could make more money by simply buying some shares.\n\n$14,000 worth of AAPL shares only has to go up by 2% by march to give a larger profit than selling this particular put.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Some good responses here.

The long party might just hold, and then price could spike back over $140 and it could turn out that was their only chance to exercise the put.\n\nSo you have to be fine with the tradeoff of getting the premium, vs. the possibility of the stock crashing and you being long at a high cost basis, or actually wanting to get in and eke out the premium, but not getting exercised. This is AAPL so it crashing far below the exercise price seems unlikely, but the scenario I'm laying out (where it's briefly in the money, too far ahead of expiration, then bounces back, strikes me as not unreasonable.)\n\nSelling puts is fine if you're purely trying to capture the premium and avoid getting exercised whatsoever, but not always great if you're trying to 'get paid for buying the stock'.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This was really helpful.

They are a lame duck trade.  You're risking 4 to make 1 a lot of the time.  You can have weeks where you make a killing selling these lottery tickets and then boom, one little volatility spike and market mean reversion move and ALL of your condors are gonezo and hit max loss, evaporating all of your gains.  Sure, you can roll, but how far out, will it be worth it?  For instance, using a simple example, lets pretend I had an IC on SPY that I received $0.50 in credit for and I did it $5 wide, with an upper band shorting the $465 call and buying the $470 call.  Let's also pretend SPY closes exactly here for the week but I want to roll it out.  I am now down $250 because I am $3 ITM on my short call, my long call expired worthless, and I only received $0.50 credit.  How far out do I have to go to make an IC worth $250 in credit on SPY and still maintain some sort of protection?  I can get really aggressive for December 17th and write a $470/$475 call credit spread, or if I want to maintain some sort of condor-esque thing I have to roll it out to January 21st and do the $445/$450/$480/$485 combo just to break even and hope that doesn't get breached either.  Now I've tied up my money for >60 days with nothing to show for it and I've paid commissions on top of it.\n\nA less talked about trade that has substantially better R:R with the same underlying premise (stock doesn't move much) is a butterfly.  They are super cheap to put on, often have a 10X return and can be established for a credit if that's your thing, even though the debit trade is the exact same thing.  \n\nCycling back to your original question, the standard you will see is 1SD (so around the .30 delta mark on a directional credit spread and around the 0.15 delta mark on a market neutral trade).
