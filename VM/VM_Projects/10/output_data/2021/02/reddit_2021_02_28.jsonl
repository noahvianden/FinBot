I will be updating this tomorrow after speaking with the CEO of META George Palikaras. This may be the longest DD you\u2019ve ever read primarily because it is three DDs in one. The merger is complicated for many reasons, and I am personally thinking of it more as a PIPE/SPAC play- to be clear we are talking about a publicly traded company providing capital and NASDAQ access to another through a merger.\n\nMy standard disclaimer -Before you read any further, I want you to understand what I look for in an investment; I invest in companies that are undervalued, possess world changing technology and have a large potential catalyst upcoming, whether it be financial changes, a market inflection point, buy out or pending regulatory approval. For it to make sense to me, the company must provide me with a large near-term upside and continued long-term growth. Basically, I am looking for penny stocks that should not be. Metamaterials and Torchlight Energy both fit these requirements, I am not a financial advisor, I am a mom and a professional firefighter, do your own DD.\n\nI believe that **if you find the technology, the money will follow**. I have not been this excited about a company since my discovery of Microvision. While they are completely different companies there is some industry and technology overlap. Both are solidly positioned to change our world in this new technological revolution that is just beginning. For reference my old DDs can be found at [r/PennyQueen](https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyQueen/) \u2013 Penny Queen with assistance from [u/Here\\_Two\\_Stay](https://www.reddit.com/u/Here_Two_Stay/)\n\n**Part 1: META**\n\nUpcoming catalysts \u2013 merger vote, up-listing to NASDAQ, access to large capital markets and scaled production\n\nMetamaterials Technologies, known as META (**MMATF**:US **MMAT**:CAN) is currently trading at $2.66 as of 02.27.2021. After the merger and up-listing to the NASDAQ, I expect META to be trading no lower than $5. With and end of year range of $8-$20 depending on production numbers and new partnerships. Therefore, this is a short term 2x and midterm 3-6x play. (There has been a lot of speculation over META\u2019s co-location at a Canadian incubator facility with TESLA and several cryptic Tweets sent out by Elon Musk. While I see how a partnership between the two could be promising for both companies, my price targets exclude these rumors).\n\n**\\*Important note**\u2013Metamaterials is currently listed in Canada as MMAT, but you can buy it on some US brokers as MMATF. There is currently low volume at these prices so your order may not fill immediately, if there is an increase in price action the volume will also increase and orders will fill quicker.\n\nIf you are unable to buy Meta, you can still buy Torchlight TRCH and after the reverse merger you will have an interest in MMATF. There is more to this, explaining in the merger section below.\n\n**Meta** is a major innovator in materials science, they are creating the disruptive technologies that are on the leading edge of the next industrial revolution. They are currently manufacturing products on a large scale that utilize carbon nanotubes, graphene, and several other exotic materials that have been talked about for the past decade. They have a strong research and development team, the industrial production facilities, proprietary processes and now they have the capital necessary to scale their products.\n\nThey have three primary technologies 1. [**holographic**](https://metamaterial.com/technologies/holography/) technology enables the company to modify the properties of proprietary polymer films at the molecular level to achieve desired effects implemented at nano scale in a thin film. 2. META\u2019s[ **lithographic**](https://metamaterial.com/technologies/lithography/) technology enables the printing of conductive patterns, fine enough to be invisible on a transparent film. 3. META\u2019s [**wireless sensing**](https://metamaterial.com/technologies/wireless-sensing/) technology enables the sensing and control of electromagnetic waves through metallodielectric structures printed on flexible substrates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e417dmrlxak61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0f627f6ddf3bfbaddc30cd151e9de047bf31a9a\n\nMETA is currently in several booming sectors \u2013 **Energy, Green Tech, Aerospace, Defense, Automotive, Medical and AR/VR.**\n\nTheir products have many applications including:\n\n\u00b7 augmented reality\n\n\u00b7 radar and lidar\n\n\u00b7 **transparent** 5G antennas\n\n\u00b7 photovoltaic films\n\n\u00b7 automotive heads-up displays\n\n\u00b7 consumer electronics\n\n\u00b7 IoT\n\n\u00b7 transparent electromagnet shielding\n\n\u00b7 MRI signal enhancement\n\n\u00b7 de-icing/defogging\n\n\u00b7 radio wave imaging\n\n\u00b7 non-invasive medical monitoring\n\nEach of these applications alone is probably worth your investment in terms of market size and growth. This is just the beginning of smart materials, and in the next few years there probably will not be a sector that is not be involved. META claims a **3 trillion-dollar total** addressable market opportunity. I have been able to validate these claims through Research and Markets published projections and I believe META numbers to be considerably downplayed, but it is important to recognize that addressable markets do not translate into directly into market share.\n\n* **$4.1B** by 2023 Metamaterials Market (Emerging market 43% CAGR) Source: [Projected Markets for Metamaterials to 2023](https://www.ntechresearch.com/market-reports/markets-for-metamaterials-2016-2023/)\n* **$200B** by 2030 Advanced/Smart Materials (20.6% CAGR) Source: [Smart Materials: Opportunities in Structural Electronics and Electrics to 2030](https://www.idtechex.com/en/research-report/smart-materials-opportunities-in-structural-electronics-and-electrics-2020-2030/698)\n* **$333B** by 2026 Solar (PV) (25.1% CAGR) Source: [Article on GlobeNewswire About Global Photovoltaic Markets](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/03/1924448/0/en/Global-Photovoltaic-Market-Is-Likely-to-Reach-333-72-Billion-by-2026-at-25-1-CAGR-Says-AMR.html)\n* **$567B** by 2025 Automotive EV (22% GAGR) Source: [Worldwide Revenue from Electric Vehicles Since 2010](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271537/worldwide-revenue-from-electric-vehicles-since-2010/)\n* **$3T** by 2020 Electronics, Displays and IoT devices, 5g antennas (23% CAGR) Source: [Internet of Things \u2013 Forecasts and Market Estimates](https://www.enterprise-cio.com/news/2018/jan/04/roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2018/)\n\n\u00b7 Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality market are currently a 37B year expected to grow to 1.27Trillion by 2030 (2020-2030 42.9% CAGR) Source: [(Research and Markets)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201127005538/en/Global-Augmented-Reality-AR-and-Virtual-Reality-VR-Market-Research-Report-2020---ResearchAndMarkets.com)\n\n\u00b7 EMI shielding market projected to be valued at 6.8Bn in 2020 9.2B by 2025 CAGR 6.3% 2020-2025 Source: [(Research and Markets)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/02/1993356/0/en/9-2-Billion-EMI-Shielding-Market-by-Material-Method-Industry-and-Region-Global-Forecast-to-2025.html)\n\n**Augmented Reality applications**\\- META has been developing the necessary technology while also acquiring other companies and their patents. In 2019 META acquired North, Inc and their roll-to-roll holographic manufacturing tech. The company stated that it believes it will be \u201cpositioned to capture a significant portion of this market by being able to mass manufacture, on a cost-effective basis, the required holographic optical components\u201d for the augmented reality smart glasses market.\n\nAccording to META, the 2nd generation manufacturing line is capable of 100,000+ units per month, to support AR and other holographic products, such as automotive HUD displays, laser glare protection, optical filters, diffractive optics, and other photonic applications. The company added that capacity could be increased to 200,000 units per month with the addition of a second, eight-hour shift.\n\nThis February META acquired [Interglass Technology](https://metamaterial.com/metamaterial-acquires-assets-and-ip-of-swiss-lens-manufacturer-interglass/) AG of Switzerland, their IP and over 70 patents. This will allow them to apply their embedded metamaterial and functional film elements with precision cast corrective lenses. CTO Jonathan Waldern stated, \u201cUnder a new brand name, metaFUSION\u2122, we are now applying that proven technology and other functionality directly encapsulated into eyeglasses, to compliment waveguide-based displays similar to HoloLens\u00ae.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kaziq4nnxak61.jpg?width=1228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aec6784ef28152cef6243ad8ff9e004fa3d12ad3\n\n**Automotive Applications** \u2013 These applications are the root of current Tesla rumors, but these technologies can and will be applied across the next generation of cars. METAs unique Nanoweb films are 98% transparent, meaning that they can be placed on any glass. They can provide a heads-up display across the windshield with almost immediate defogging and de-icing. Their technology can allow multiple transparent 5G antennas for IoT integration and their nanomaterials can improve the angular scan range of LIDAR used in self-driving vehicles. Which will lower the costs and mass of self-driving vehicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3phdsvnoxak61.jpg?width=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9f40ffc3eafae5cdd328cfe68c1a6455f3ea383\n\n**Energy Applications** \u2013 META is currently working with Lockheed Martin and MTI to create metaSolar a NanoWeb based solar thin films that will increase solar cell efficiency by capturing light from all angles and light that would otherwise be reflected. These will be ultra-thin, light, flexible, can be applied to flat or curved surfaces and will be able to add onboard power and charging.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgttfyfpxak61.jpg?width=746&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c52dc303a057a3feecbbb0a059dfc4df054c4db5\n\n**Medical Applications** \u2013 META has a strong research base in photonics as well as wireless technologies, they are currently able to enhance the signals 200-500% on MRIs with their resonators and intensity correction algorithms. They have also created a radio-wave imaging sytsem that has a wide array of uses but can be utilized as a safe, initial-step screening for breast cancers. Biosensors - they are in the development process of a non-puncture blood glucose monitoring system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcvt7eqqxak61.jpg?width=1256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e682b81c18869961df2d77cf91195b7557f56de5\n\n**Aerospace and Defense**\\- META has extensive experience providing laser protection, de-icing and de-fogging products to aviation companies. They have also created electromagnetic interference protection that can play a large roll in infrastructure defense.\n\n**Financials** \u2013 The finances of META do not, in my opinion, create an accurate picture. They have been investing money into research and development, IP acquisitions and scaling their operations. They just received a 10m loan from Torchlight to continue this expansion. While they do have revenue and have partnered with major companies (Samsung, Boeing, Airbus), I am thinking of them more in terms of a pre-revenue IPO. Google finance notes a 21.48% year over year revenue increase and META claims a $121m a year revenue potential over the next 18 months.\n\nAs Cathie Wood stated in the last ARK webinar, she is anticipating a bifurcated V-shaped recovery which will reward companies that have invested in innovation rather than in pandering to shareholders.\n\nMETA is currently trading at $2.66 \u2013 I anticipate a near doubling with a successful merger vote.\n\n83.6m shares outstanding\n\n42.71m float\n\n222.4m Market cap\n\n35.56% held by insiders\n\nThe recent loan from Torchlight does not figure into the numbers below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntae79lvxak61.jpg?width=1084&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e70858b4bb3cc4c507efb1a8a2b8a708e9617164\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e70bbalvxak61.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8042362a8418ade069080c3ba4222be2ba40234\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvu92blvxak61.jpg?width=1086&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9adf2d9ba965bfb1e035ad38571b4e6cf4c8e96\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qkj6blvxak61.jpg?width=1087&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d2a55a03e88913cabb407dafd09d98c8999da1f\n\n**META Executive Team** has an extremely deep educational background in the hard sciences with a lot of experience creating innovative products. At this point I think their customer service reps probably have PhDs\n\n**CEO and Founder** \\-George Palikaras Ph.D. Founded META in 2011, prior to that he founded MediWise, a wireless medical sensor company, he was also an antenna design engineer with AceAxis.\n\n**CTO and Chairman** Dr. Waldern founded DigiLens and Retinal Displays, Inc., he holds a PhD in Computer Science \u2013 Virtual Reality, he has over 170 patents and specializes in waveguides.\n\n**CSO and co-Founder** Themos Kallos is Chief Science Officer with Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with expertise in applied physics, metamaterials, wireless communications, and electromagnetic simulations.\n\n**CFO & EVP** \\- Ken Rice has a JD, MBA and a Master of Laws in taxation, he works as in-house counsel and is charge of financing efforts and progressing Meta\u2019s medical products initiatives.\n\n**Essential Links**\n\n[(5) NanoWeb - A Revolutionary Transparent Conductive Film - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvGXDxfOSOg)\n\n[META overview - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8AgLXnNBCU)\n\n[META Investors deck](https://metamaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/META-TRCH-Investor-Presentation-Feb-2021.pdf)\n\n[META Torchlight definitive agreement](https://ir.torchlightenergy.com/company-news/detail/696/metamaterial-and-torchlight-sign-definitive-agreement-for-business-combination)\n\n[Torchlight Investor Presentation](https://content.equisolve.net/torchlightenergy/media/f8f9cf35e22b064d3b0a0cf6b5dfb6a9.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cmy1x7xxak61.jpg?width=774&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff21a7aecce32a3115451542e4c4a4f015300f8d\n\n**Part II: Torchlight**\n\nTorchlight Energy is currently an oil and gas exploration company. They have three major oil and gas assets. They made what is considered to be the [largest domestic newfield discovery in over 30 years](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2019/06/25/torchlight-drops-a-bombshell-for-shareholders.html) at their Orogrande site. This discovery coincided with economic collapse of oil due to Covid crisis. In March of 2020, Torchlight decided to pivot their entire operation and and to divest all of oil and gas assets and to embark on a reverse merger with a future focused company.\n\nTorchlight Energy (TRCH) is currently trading at $2.48, with a 356.15m market cap, 143.61m shares\n\nThe assets of Torchlight energy include three project sites, an experienced management team, access to capital, and a NASDAQ listing. Two of the project sites are under contract to be sold and the largest asset, the Orogrande site, is likely an extension of the Permian Basin and is being marketed to major and super major oil companies. Once these assets are sold their net proceeds will be divided among shareholders in the form of a special dividend.\n\n**Oil and Gas Assets**\n\n1. Orogrande Basin \u2013 134,000 acre lease 72.5% interest (97,150 net acres), the site has had several [successful test wells drilled](https://www.canadianinsider.com/torchlight-announces-measured-oil-and-gas-production-from-its-orogrande-basin-project).\n\n3rd party valuation of potential recoverable hydrocarbons\n\n\u00b7 Low Side Case 2.3 billion barrels\n\n\u00b7 Medium BTE Case 3.7 billion barrels\n\n\u00b7 High Side Case 5.0 billion barrels\n\n2.

Winkler Project 1,080 gross acres, 12.5% WI (non-operated) [under contract for $450k (350k to Torchlight)](https://ir.torchlightenergy.com/company-news/detail/693/torchlight-announces-sale-of-its-interest-in-the-winkler-project)\n\nThe difficulty for TRCH investor is in determining the sale value of the oil and gas assets of Torchlight.\n\nI have spoken with many industry experts and received varying price targets that trended toward the upper side of the values I am presenting. I could not find anyone willing to go on record. As this is not investment advice anyways, here are some possible valuations. I was told that 50 cents a barrel was a valid price for the amount of potential oil with the limited studies that have been done. I was also advised that the merger and acquisition market for oil and gas companies is still soft but that is expected to change quickly with the rise in oil demand and subsequent price.\n\n**Valuation** :\n\nValuation \u2013 The value oil drilling acreage is a moving target after the price of crude oil started collapsing in March of 2020. The current price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI)is currently $61.50 barrel. Oil prices are expected to rise to [$80-$100 a barrel](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oil-prices-are-rising-here-are-next-steps-for-producers-51614254401) in the next six months.\n\nThe last major purchase in the Permian Basin was in October 2020 when [Conoco Phillips acquired Concho Resources](https://jpt.spe.org/conocophillips-completes-acquisition-of-permian-producer-concho-resources) in a $9.7 BN all stock transaction, adding 550,000 acres in the Permian basin and 200,000 b/d.

(you can quote me on this). This is an arranged marriage of sorts, it is the catalyst that will allow META to bring their disruptive technology to the forefront of several growing sectors, each at or near their inflection point. The board of Torchlight realized that their resource rich holdings were not enough to survive and thrive in the changing economy, and that a new path was necessary. Through this reverse merger Torchlight receives a 25% stake in META. This will also trigger a special dividend to shareholders of Torchlight. The dividend will be one preferred share on a pro rata basis of the holding company holding the net proceeds (or assets if they have not yet sold).\n\nIf the merger is approved, a shareholder with 100 shares of Torchlight would receive 100 shares of the preferred stock in the holding company and 100 shares of the new company. Torchlight shares will be static, METAs shares will be adjusted to maintain the ratio of 75% META share ownership and 25% Torchlight share ownership. (Edited after IR clarification) The special dividend will be as of the record date, which has not been determined. It sounds like the merger vote will occur sometime around mid-March. After the merger is complete META will be the company name and it will be listed on the NASDAQ.\n\nAs of this date certain stockholders of each of Torchlight and Metamaterial have executed customary voting and support agreement pursuant to which persons representing approximately 16% of Torchlight's and approximately 48% of Metamaterial's outstanding voting power have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction.\n\nI am long in TRCH at 36K shares and long in MMATF at 60K shares.

{"title": "Moderna (MRNA) DD \u2013 Why a 60B Company is Still Undervalued", "selftext": "\\*This will be my first DD post so let me know if you would like to hear about anything I didn\u2019t touch on, or if you disagree on any particular points. Hopefully you find it useful!\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis is going to be a long post, so I\u2019m not going to waste your time by explaining who Moderna is. They\u2019ve been in the news for the last year and everyone and their mother knows what they\u2019ve accomplished. They (along with Pfizer/BioNTech) are the big dogs when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S., and their dominance in the market will likely continue.\n\nBut Moderna isn\u2019t just a COVID-19 vaccine company, as their CEO repeatedly stressed in their most recent earnings call. Moderna is a true pharmaceutical giant in the making. They are currently developing 24 different products ranging from viral vaccines, to treatments for autoimmune disease, to cancer and heart disease therapeutics.^(1) The vast majority of these modalities are using mRNA technology to attempt to accomplish the desired effect. Not so coincidentally sharing the same name as Moderna\u2019s ticker, mRNA technology is a relatively new modality that is just beginning to take hold as a game-changer in the biotech/pharma space. Let\u2019s talk a little more about it so we can understand why it has the potential to create a major-shake up in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n**History of mRNA Technology**\n\nmRNA was discovered in the 60\u2019s in mice, but it wasn\u2019t seriously considered for a possible therapeutic target until the 90\u2019s. Various studies in vitro and in mice since this period have been done, demonstrating potential for the treatment of HIV, cancer, degenerative disease, autoimmune disease\u2026 I could go on. As we know, pharmaceuticals move slowly, and serious development of these products didn\u2019t really take off until the 2010\u2019s.^(2)\n\nPrior to December 2020, there were only two medications utilizing mRNA technology that have received FDA approval. Inotersan and Patisiran were both developed and FDA approved in 2018 to treat a rare hereditary condition called hATTR which involves pathologic deposition of amyloid into the tissues of those affected. Without going into too much detail, this condition has a mean survival time of 15 years after diagnosis and leads to significant patient morbidity and suffering in the interim. Inotersan is the more successful of the two drugs and looks to be potentially curative for some patients with a disease which used to be a death sentence. Routine imaging since the phase III trials for Inotersan shows little to no progression of the disease in most patients, laying out the possibility that these patients may live a normal life moving forward.^(3)\n\nWith two more successful examples of mRNA technology being used in the COVID-19 vaccines, I expect that interest in the technology will skyrocket and subsequently so will funding and development.\n\n**First Mover\u2019s Advantage**\n\nThis will be a short section; Moderna is THE biggest player in developing mRNA therapeutics. There are other companies like BioNTech, CureVac, Gradalis, and Ionis, and of these only BioNTech (BNTX) can compete in sheer breadth of product development as well as having a history of success. For the sake of time I won\u2019t address the other companies, but a key advantage that Moderna has over BioNTech is that they have moved more quickly through their clinical trials than BNTX has. Outside of COVID-19, Moderna currently has 4 products in Phase II trials (with their CMV vaccine moving to Phase III very soon), while BNTX only has 1.^(4) Long term I believe both of these companies will be highly successful, but Moderna is a more mature company that will be seeing the fruits of their labors more quickly than their competitor(s).\n\n**The Future of COVID-19 Vaccination, and Vaccination in General**\n\nModerna currently has about 60% market share, distributing 40M of the 70M total doses the U.S. has received. I expect that number to drop slightly, but I would expect that Moderna ends up vaccinating approximately 40% of all Americans when it\u2019s all said and done, with Pfizer vaccinating a large chunk of the rest. After that, Moderna will likely shift distribution to other countries and deliver on their agreements abroad.\n\n\u201cBut what about NovaVax, J&J, and AstraZenica?\u201d you might ask.\n\nWithout undercutting these companies and their potential, they are simply too late to the game in the U.S. to grab meaningful market share from Moderna and Pfizer.^(5,6) Johnson and Johnson was just recommended for authorization yesterday (2/26/2021) and will likely begin distribution in the coming weeks, however they are only expected to deliver 100M vaccines by the end of June. Moderna will deliver 300M by July^(7), on top of the approximately 40M they have already delivered. The U.S. has agreed to purchase more than 1.2B doses of the vaccine from a number of companies, but much of that will go overseas after American citizens have received their 2 doses.\n\nModerna is establishing relationships and trust globally with the successful development and distribution of their COVID-19 vaccine, but why is this important? Let\u2019s think back to what the CEO said in their recent earnings call \u2013 Moderna is NOT a COVID-19 company. Digging into their therapeutics pipeline, we can see mRNA candidates targeting Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, Nipah Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Epstein-Barr, Zika, Chikungunya\u2026 Relationships established during this pandemic will serve them well in the development and distribution of future vaccine candidates like those listed above.\n\nWAIT there\u2019s more: back in January, Moderna announced plans to create a combination Influenza/COVID-19 vaccine, with the possibility of adding more candidates to the mix if they were to receive approval. With the number of viruses that they are targeting, Moderna has the potential to become the leader in vaccination globally, period. Their ability to create combination vaccines targeting a host of common viruses could be the new standard in vaccination. Certain candidates like RSV, CMV, and EBV are likely to become standard vaccinations given in childhood like other vaccines we are familiar with such as MMR and Varicella.\n\nThe potential of this company in the vaccination industry is endless, and right now they are just scratching the surface.\n\n**Future Revenue Projections \u2013 $18 Billion --> ???**\n\nDuring their most recent earnings call, Moderna reported that they have orders for their vaccine totaling $18 billion^(8), and they are expecting more orders throughout the year. The COVID vaccine market is likely to cool off a little after that, but experts currently predict that COVID-19 boosters will become a routine part of care in the future, likely needing a new dose every 2-3 years.^(9) Now this would likely represent a major hit to revenue if Moderna was just a COVID-19 vaccine company but once again, they are not.\n\nLets briefly talk about a virus you may have never heard of before \u2013 cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is something you\u2019ve likely had in the past and didn\u2019t know it, so why is it a problem? Oddly enough, this seemingly benign little virus causes about 25,000 birth defects per year in the U.S. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 1000 babies will be born with a birth defect due to CMV.\n\nCurrently there is no vaccine, but do you know who has the most promising candidate that is already enrolling participants for phase III trials? You guessed it \u2013 Moderna. The addressable market for this vaccine is conservatively estimated at $2-5 billion/year.^(10) I expect that if it is approved by the FDA that it will likely see global adoption and that revenue number is likely to be much higher.\n\nRepeat the above for RSV, EBV, Zika, etc. and it is not hard to envision a company that is bringing in $30-50 billion a year in annual vaccination income alone. If they were to succeed in any of their more lofty quests to develop an HIV vaccine, or therapeutics for autoimmune hepatitis, or personalized cancer vaccines\u2026 the sky is the limit.\n\n**Justifying Current Valuation, and Then Some**\n\nModerna\u2019s current market cap is 62.16B. Their orders for 2021 currently exceed $18B with room to grow. The average revenue multiple for a biotech company is between 6-8x, and Moderna is trading at less than 4x. If you consider Moderna a pharmaceutical company, than the average multiple would be about 5x, still under.^(11)\n\nI know we are looking at unrealized revenue with Moderna at this point, as that $18B will be earned throughout the year, so I understand that technically speaking they are still trading at an obscene P/S ratio compared to other more mature companies. However, I think it\u2019s safe to say that demand for their product isn\u2019t going away anytime this year and they have proven that they are able to execute and even exceed expectations when it comes to manufacturing and distributing their product.\n\nLooking at their most recent earnings report for Q420 which was released on 2/25/21, their balance sheet is stellar. They are holding around $3B in cash from recent deposits, and they have almost no debt to speak of.\n\nSimply put, they are undervalued at their current price. Without even factoring in the potential of everything else in their pipeline, they should be worth more as just a COVID-19 company with stellar financials and a relatively palatable multiple going into the later part of this year.\n\nMy personal price target: $220/share. With 396M outstanding shares, a $220 share price would place Moderna at $87B, which I believe to be a fair valuation through this year. This would represent a 4.8x multiple to their projected revenue in 2021. This represents a 41% increase in price from where Moderna is trading at currently which is \\~$155/share.\n\n**Closing**\n\nUnderstand that this company has enormous potential for growth, but also potential to fail. Most pharmaceutical products fail in clinical trials before ever reaching market, and the same could be true for most if not all of Moderna\u2019s pipeline. I personally believe that mRNA products have a higher chance of success than traditional therapeutics, but I\u2019m not going to go into my reasoning for that in this post.\n\nEvery trade carries risk, and the risk with buying Moderna is that the market for COVID-19 vaccines shrinks as the world gradually develops herd immunity, the rest of their products fail in clinical trials, and they die a slow death without ever bringing another product to market. Nonetheless, I am confident and hopeful that this will not happen, and Moderna will become the next company to join the ranks of Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and company as a true juggernaut of the biotech/pharma sector.\n\n*Disclosures: I own shares in Moderna, and I am considering buying leaps at some point next week.

{"title": "Christmas Tree Spreads, safer than credit spreads?", "selftext": "I just read about Christmas Tree spreads and seeing as I lost about 6k in spreads this week I think I'm going to start using Christmas trees instead plain credit spread. \n\nTLDR, could be useful for smaller accounts who want to trade \"a type of\" credit spread but don't want to see themselves blown out if the stock moves against them.  \nCon: 6 options per spread can add up in commissions.  \n\nShort Christmas Tree Spread can be made with all calls or all puts. Sell 1 atm, skip a strike and buy 3, sell 2 at the next strike. This is routed for a credit and you keep maximum credit whether all contracts expire in the money or out of the money. Break even from Investopedia \"There are two breakeven points.

Currently with the market closed Mid price is 0.24,Nat price is 0.56. Max loss is the distance between the 2 higher strikes (200 - credit).  \n\nThis strategy appears to be a delta ply more than a theta play as theta is -0.132 and delta is 0.15. I can't wrap my head around whether we are long  or short vega here but the net price decreases as volatility increases so this is a good trade to put on 1-2 weeks before earnings and close the day before earnings is reported so my 4/16 may example may not truly be a good one.

{"title": "The VIX and its options", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nI thought I would write a little post about the VIX index and the options on the index as it is a popular but confusing instrument that does not behave like anything else we trade on.\n\n# What is the VIX?\n\nThe VIX is a measure of the implied volatility (IV) or price of options on the SPX (S&P 500) index over the next 30 days. It is also known as the \"Fear Index\". The VIX tends to spike up during times of fear as traders rush to buy protective options. It then declines as the market adjusts. This tendency to spike up and drop back down is (a) expected by the market and (b) important to understanding VIX options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX and SPX](https://preview.redd.it/99cks9ogoak61.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=555e41a443e8508851869dc7f453d9a333938fe7)\n\n# How do VIX options work?\n\nVIX options are cash settled and European style (no early exercise). Because they are European style they are valued based on what the VIX is expected to be at expiry, not what it is currently. And remember, almost everyone knows that the VIX will spike up and drop back down. As a result, the options are priced according to the VIX futures which expire the same time as the options. \n\nBelow is the current VIX futures curve, taken from the useful [vixcentral.com](https://vixcentral.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX Futures Curve on Friday Feb 26 2020. Spot VIX at 28](https://preview.redd.it/ca92ntv6mak61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=358c236dc6c03926a17d9e41635b88bc82091a05)\n\nAnd here's the chart from a week earlier:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Friday Feb 19, Spot VIX around 22](https://preview.redd.it/krlaalo7qak61.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fd3cd0c400e9f361ca0c0f42f6663544f8be5ac)\n\nIf you compare the two, you can see the VIX index moved from 22 to 28, the March future moved from 24.8 to 27 and May went from 28.8 to 29. So if you were long March VIX options you would have seen a modest 2 point rise but 90 DTE calls would see virtually no change!\n\nBelow is the curve for March 16, 2020, maximum Covid panic in the markets, with VIX at it's highest ever! But if you look far enough out on the curve, those long dated futures are only a point or two off the similar DTE futures and options today.\n\n[VIX Futures Curve March 16 2020 with spot VIX at a record 82.69](https://preview.redd.it/aelju38emak61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=c38c547e7b3df640e27d85b79582529a130c2be5)\n\nAnd finally, back in November 2019. Here the 90 to 240 DTE futures are in the 17-18.5 range.
