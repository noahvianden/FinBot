This year is no different, however this year i believe BB actually has some tangible developments and partnerships in the pipeline  to show for and \"general\" public is beginning to finally get the idea that BB is NOT A PHONE COMPANY!!! but i digress...\n\nSo BB shares 5500 @ 7.77 \n\nBB is not known for wild swings and insane gap-ups (w exception or recent rather wild moves co-related with GME saga); \n\nBarring any black swan events i am very bullish on BB for 2021 but believe it might decline a bit from recent levels of \\~$10-\\~12 or go sideways until more partnerships are done and/or ER is finally showing definite improvement in fundamentals (also BO/M&A is a possibility imo)\n\nI was looking at the option chain to far OTM LEAPS \\~$22 strikes and as of last Friday the going bid for JAN23 is around $3.00\n\nSo if i'm not mistaken i were to write 55 contracts for those LEAPS that would bring close to $17K \n\nI'd very much to use the $17K and buy more BB shares +/- 1,700 shares depending on SP, then use the 1,700 shares and write more CC LEAPS (for simplicity sake for the same strike/exp); so that's 17 contracts and another $5K which i'd use to buy 500 BB shares and again write 5 more CC's for $1.5K and so on until i guess i'd end up w 7880 shares...\n\nNow as i've mentioned earlier - I like the stock, so i don't mind holding, on the hand if SP does get to $22 it will be a very generous premium to my per share avg. and would not mind letting the shares get called away as i believe i might get opportunity to buy them back if i really wanted to using the settled funds and maybe at discount say on a dip (based on years of watching BB SP) ??\n\nSo is this above any type of strategy or am missing something so obvious that would make the whole thing unworkable or perhaps it's one of the least optimal ways to utilize CC's or anything else i might be missing/misunderstanding?\n\nThank you in advance for any advise/feedback...", "id": "lomruy", "created_utc": 1613874065.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "You understand the concept clearly.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n> \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n> # Improving forecasts\n> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n> \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n> # Key data during the week\n> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n> \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n> \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n> \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n> # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 19th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-BGCs5KYyc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.21.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YaRBrbpOe8))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NVDA** \n> * **$SQ** \n> * **$MRNA** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$DKNG** \n> * **$HD** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$OSTK** \n> * **$JMIA** \n> * **$RKT** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$ETSY** \n> * **$OXY** \n> * **$TDOC** \n> * **$M** \n> * **$BIGC** \n> * **$RCL** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$BYND** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$MGI** \n> * **$W** \n> * **$MRO** \n> * **$MGNI** \n> * **$SPCE** \n> * **$VALE** \n> * **$CRON** \n> * **$FLR** \n> * **$LI** \n> * **$NLS** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$CROX** \n> * **$NKLA** \n> * **$UPWK** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$DISH** \n> * **$FSLR** \n> * **$DDD** \n> * **$HZNP** \n> * **$OKE** \n> * **$IVR**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n> \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n> # Improving forecasts\n> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n> \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n> # Key data during the week\n> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n> \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n> \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n> \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n> # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 19th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-BGCs5KYyc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.21.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YaRBrbpOe8))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NVDA** \n> * **$SQ** \n> * **$MRNA** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$DKNG** \n> * **$HD** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$OSTK** \n> * **$JMIA** \n> * **$RKT** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$ETSY** \n> * **$OXY** \n> * **$TDOC** \n> * **$M** \n> * **$BIGC** \n> * **$RCL** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$BYND** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$MGI** \n> * **$W** \n> * **$MRO** \n> * **$MGNI** \n> * **$SPCE** \n> * **$VALE** \n> * **$CRON** \n> * **$FLR** \n> * **$LI** \n> * **$NLS** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$CROX** \n> * **$NKLA** \n> * **$UPWK** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$DISH** \n> * **$FSLR** \n> * **$DDD** \n> * **$HZNP** \n> * **$OKE** \n> * **$IVR**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

I'm OK with that, just want to make sure I understand what's happening.\n\nMy starting cash balance (after accounting for CSPs) was basically 0, but now it appears that I have $12k to fully withdraw if I wanted to? The only thing I changed since converting to margin was buying 10 shares of MSFT for \\~$700 after 30% margin. Where did the $12k come from? Is that safe to withdraw?\n\nWhich number represents my current cash balance, i.e. how much I owe or have on balance? Is that the \"maintenance excess\"? I'm finding it a bit unintuitive that now all my purchases use margin and it's hard to tell how much I can afford to buy if I intend the trade to have the same risk as not using margin.\n\nMy understanding is that if the maintenance excess goes negative, I start paying interest but otherwise I'm OK.

I see what your saying about deflationary pressures, and I can see some restaurants, hotels, and airlines continuing to struggle. As for real estate I think it depends where you are because where I'm from vancouver Island in BC and real estate is absolutely skyrocketing with no sign of slowing down. At the same time lots of restaurants and businesses are at half capacity, but our government is giving them a lot of money. In the states I think there is less money for small businesses so more deflation? If the governments stops printing money those deflationary trends will get even stronger and that's a much worse disaster for them then inflation. My perspective is that in the states they need to suppress the cpi as much as possible while continuing to pump the system with as much money as possible in order to counter deflationary trends because otherwise they will enter a full on depression. What do you think?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So we're also seeing a residential real estate boom helped by record low mortgage rates, but rental prices for houses and especially apartments and condos have fallen quite a bit in major cities. As far as commercial real estate, there are a lot of vacancies, have been a lot of defaults, we're in the midst of a major shift in the way consumers shop, so retail is going to be less profitable per square foot and businesses won't be willing to pay as much in rent for those spaces. And maybe a lot of businesses just aren't going to be able to make a profit at all if consumers don't resoundingly return to old habits and shop in stores. So what happens there? We'll see a lot of vacancies, we'll see commercial real estate rent come down and thus the buildings will be valued less. With lower values, governments won't receive as much in property taxes from retail and office spaces, and those governments won't have as much money, they'll have major shortfalls. Will either cut their budgets massively or issue a lot of new debt, which fortunately for them their debt service costs will be low.\n\nBut it just shows there are a hell of a lot of deflationary pressures out there in terms of commercial real estate rents, valuations, how much traffic and earnings shops, restaurants, offices can generate. How will governments, industry respond if there continue to be a lot of vacancies? Governments rely on that tax revenue, and sales tax revenue, and also a lot of people who commute into the big cities for work might continue working from home, depriving those governments of tax revenue. \n\nYou mentioned airlines. That's a whole other issue of the travel industry. But just goes to show the inflation/deflation conversation is a complex one with a lot of moving parts. \n\nBut so with the Fed printing $80 billion a month to buy Treasurys and another $40bn a month to buy mortgage-backed securities, and trying to keep rates low, we'll continue seeing asset bubbles and speculative activity. So oil is around $60/bbl but if it keeps rising, copper keeps rising, agricultural commodities keep rising, we might see major commodity bubbles similar to what we saw circa 2007-2008 in the commodities bubble then when oil hit $150bbl and most commodities were at all time highs.\n\nSo it's possible we face a situation where the slack in the economy, the vacancies, the commercial real estate problems, the budget shortfalls, compels the Fed and other central banks to keep interest rates at zero and continue bond purchases to stimulate the economy, but what if at the same time we get bubbles in oil prices, food prices, other commodity prices? Like we saw in 2007-2008 before the big crash. The economy was stalling and the housing boom was busting so the Fed kept cutting rates, but it propelled all sorts of asset bubbles including gas prices at near $5 a gallon and even with all that inflation the Fed kept cutting because the economy was on the brink of collapse. Finally everything collapsed around September of '08 but we had both a recession and soaring commodity prices simultaneously.\n\nIt's exactly what happened in the 70s. Poor economic activity, recessions, but huge runs up in commodities and thus huge increases in consumer price inflation, which has been dubbed stagflation, a portmanteau combining stagnation and inflation. So I think that really is the worry.

I was only 13 in 2008 so I didnt understand everything that happened very well, but I've been studying history and from what i can see we seem to be heading down the same path. \n\nThe only thing I see short term is oil could dip again because currently its pricing in a full recovery this summer, and if Saudi Arabia brings back a million barrels a day that will definitly drop the price. I feel this could be used to lower the consumer price  index causing less fear of inflation in the short term.  \n\nAlso based on how inflated those bubbles got in 2000 and 2008 based on the money supply at the time I feel like we may have a long way to go UP considering how much more money is in the system. I could be totally wrong about this, so I'm looking for advice.

{"title": "WHERE ART THOU ROMEO???", "selftext": "Positions: 1.7k shares with $15.7 average. Additionally currently holding 15C March calls anticipating a breakout.\n\nTLDR: If you're going to make a speculative bet on commercial EVs, you're best off betting on the company positioning themselves to benefit from them all. Recent catalysts and price action prime RMO for a breakout.\n\nTicker: RMO = Romeo Power\n\nWhat is Romeo Power?\n\nRomeo Power produces clean energy products for commercial EVs. Their 113k squarefoot facility in CA primarily manufactures high-density battery packs for Class 8 trucks and buses, but the real value of RMO is speculative in nature based on their ambitions to expand to other vehicle Classes and be a leader in the entire commercial EV market.\n\nRMO currently has $544M in contracted revenue (Lion Electric, BorgWarner, Workhorse, Oshkosh, Nikola, BMW, etc). More interestingly, they state they currently have up to $2.2B (pending contracted revenue) under advanced negotiation.\n\nThey emphasize the significance of the world's largest companies such as UPS, USPS, Amazon, Walmart, etc committing to EV fleets, as well as the significance of OEMs all developing EV programs. It's worth reminding that the Biden administration has yet to flesh out the logistics of transitioning to EV by 2035. As a California-based clean tech company (and Black owned) Romeo is poised to get favorable government assistance.\n\nWith $2.2B under advanced negotiation the possibilities are exciting to say the least since these negotiations are currently undisclosed. Expect RMO stock to be buoyed by more and more announcements of partnerships and contracts.\n\nWith the services RMO offers it's only a matter of time before they announce a contract with a recognizable company that will cause a breakout in the share price.\n\nWhy will there be a breakout soon?\n\nRMO has been bleeding heavily after rallying to ATH of nearly $40/share after the SPAC announcement. It's been heavily shorted and bled even more after Morgan Stanley announced a $12 PT based on them not currently having profitability. This PT is such a misunderstanding of what makes RMO a desirable purchase. With $2.2B under negotiation and $544M secured I'm comfortable overlooking near term financials, and I believe other's are too, especially in today's market. RMO has pulled back to $15/share, a 100%+ discount from recent highs.\n\nOn Friday (2/19) Romeo Power announced a business deal with Ecellix to develop next-gen EV battery technology by combining RMO's battery packs with Ecellix's high energy density silicon (rather than graphite) based batteries, reducing the weight of Class 8 trucks 25% and allowing for a range of 600 miles. In commercial trucking, range is everything. This is a massive improvement in Lithium Ion battery tech. Despite this amazing news, RMO only gained 4% and ended the week in the red.\n\nRMO had a strong close on Friday AH and reclaimed $15. I think $14-15 is the bottom for RMO. There's too much money under negotiation and too bright of a future for RMO. I believe RMO will reclaim $20 this week and retest $30-40 in the next couple months if any major announcement drops.", "id": "lp3y0q", "created_utc": 1613934080.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Dear Market, \n  If I could just YOLO my way into a new tax bracket, I promise I\u2019ll be good.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "YOLOs are the easiest way to pay less taxes", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry, still poor.
