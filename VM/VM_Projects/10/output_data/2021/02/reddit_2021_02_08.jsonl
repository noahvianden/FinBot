{"title": "$GIK merger with Lightning eMotors; Undervalued with a Massive Future Upside", "selftext": "I've seen GIK mentioned a lot over at /r/SPACs, but for whatever reason it hasn't been mentioned anywhere else. So, heres some info on an actually decent company yah filthy animals. \n\nLighting eMotors is a manufacture of class 3-7 medium duty vehicles, basically anything similar to shuttle busses, ambulances, light duty moving vehicles, etc. The company is currently in the process of going public through a SPAC merger with GigCapital3 (GIK). \n\nWhat makes Lightning a niche in the EV industry is their focus on the class 3-7 vehicles. This is important because most EV manufactures are focusing on standard Class 1 and 2 vehicles for consumers, or class 8 vehicles for large freight transportation. Now, this market is big, to the tune of 67 billion dollars TAM. As we all know, tailwinds for EV vehicles are massive, and governments are going to providing huge incentives to companies to make the switch. In 2020, lightning sold 78 of the 143 class 3-7 EVs in the country, meaning they did over half the market share last year. Yes, its not a lot of sales, however having that foothold of being first, and having the largest market share so far is going to be huge moving forward.\n\nNow lets take a look at financials. In 2020, Lightning did 9 million in sales, and is projected to do 63 million in sales in 2021. Best part is, they've already received purchase orders to fulfill their 2021 revenue. They currently have 150M in contracted POs, and another 800M+ in the projected pipeline. This revenue comes from notable customers such as Amazon, DHL, IKEA, and CBRE. Moving forward, the company projects a CAGR of 195% from 2020 to 2025, which is insanity. The company intends on doing roughly 2 billion in revenue by 2025, and has plans on hitting 20,000 vehicle production per annum by that time.\n\nNow the part that make them attractive currently is their valuation. Most EV stocks right now are trading at huge premiums and have factored in a lot of future growth. When the reverse merger of the company occurs, they will be valued at roughly 800M to 1.1B. Compare this to XL Fleet at 2.64B, Workhorse at 4.89B, and Hyliion at 2.4B, these guys are severely undervalued in their industry niche. \n\nNow if anybody has any bear cases for this, lets hear em. The only one I can think of so far is if they fudge their production and assembly and can't deliver on their current purchase orders, however that would be the same for any other EV company. They also currently use Ford for their chassis and bodies, so if ford decides to cease production they will be in a tough spot.\n\nMost of the information above was taken from their investor presentation, which you can find ([https://lightningemotors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Power-Announcement-Deck\\_vF.pdf](https://lightningemotors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Power-Announcement-Deck_vF.pdf))\n\nDisclaimer this is not financial advice, please use your 6 remaining brain cells accordingly. \n\nPosition: 300 shares @ 14.05 avg.", "id": "lf3ri1", "created_utc": 1612757774.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "nah. they are not undervalued xl,hyliion, workhorse etc etc are all way overvalued .", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2260458916425705}, {"body": "i dont like retrofitters.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, February 8, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 8, 2021**\n\nStocks rose Monday, extending advances from last week\u2019s rally as market participants continue to monitor developments in Washington surrounding additional fiscal stimulus. All three indices reached fresh record highs intraday. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.74%  up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.67% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.72% higher.\n\nOptimism over an additional round of fiscal stimulus rose after a disappointing monthly jobs report last week. While the US economy resumed adding more jobs back than it lost in January, the number of jobs regained fell short of expectations, a sign that the economy might need a fiscal boost to gain momentum. Nonfarm payroll jobs rose 49,000 versus 105,000 expected by economists.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CBS on Sunday the U.S. could return to full employment by 2022 \u2013 or two to three years ahead of some current projections \u2013 if measures in Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan were enacted.\n\nBoth the Senate and the House of Representatives voted to move forward to move forward with a process called reconciliation, which allows Democrats, who have a majority in both houses of Congress, to vote to pass Biden\u2019s new coronavirus stimulus package without Republican votes. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate\u2014plus a Democratic vice president\u2014reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president\u2019s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it. \n\nPresident Biden defended his party\u2019s actions by warning that efforts to pass a smaller bill would only prolong the suffering of many American families. He said, \u201cI\u2019d like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. I\u2019ve met with Republicans ... but they\u2019re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go. If I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly, and being bogged down in a monthly negotiation or compromising on a bill that\u2019s up to the crisis, it\u2019s an easy choice.\u201d\n\nAfter reaching an all-time high on January 8, 2021, coronavirus infections have steadily decreased as the pace of vaccinations has increased, recently improving to over 1 million doses per day after President Biden\u2019s administration allowed retail pharmacies like CVS to become vaccination sites. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Companies including Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER), Twitter (TWTR), Coca-Cola (KO), Corsair (CRSR, and Roku (ROKU), and Disney (DIS) are poised to report quarterly results later this week.\n* After Tesla (TSLA) revealed it purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and would soon accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment, Bitcoin (BTC) gapped up to reach all-time highs over $40,000. Dogecoin (DOGE) is another crypto receiving attention.\n* Softbank (SFTBY) posted impressive earnings on the back of their Vision Fund, one of the largest investment funds in the world. After many high-profile failures in the previous years, the fund recovered after successful IPOs from Airbnb (ABNB) and DoorDash (DASH). Exact numbers for the performance of the fund couldn\u2019t be found. \n* AmerisourceBergen (ABC) target raised by Cowen from $145 to $150. Stock currently around $110. \n* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by Mizuho from $250 to $325 at Buy. Stock currently around $270\n* Marathon Patent Group (MARA) target raised by HC Wainwright from $17 to $30 at Buy. Stock currently around $22.50\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by  BTIG Research from $419 to $600 at Buy. Stock currently around $380\n* Linde (LIN) with two bullish target raises. Stock currently around $257\n   * Wells Fargo from $289 to $300 at Overweight\n   * Deutsche Bank from $300 to $330 at Buy\n* Regeneron Pharma (REGN) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $623 to $640. Stock currently around $498\n* The Boston Beer (SAM) target raised by Guggenheim from $1379 to $1400.

{"title": "TSLA Rules", "selftext": "**The Rules Explained** - General Rules for TSLA stock (unofficial)\n\n**1) You don't talk about $TSLA with coworkers, friends or family**\n\nThere are some exceptions that can be made but the general principle is that when TSLA goes up they will resent you, and if it goes down, they will mock you. If you tell them to invest and it happens to go down, they will blame you. If you want to boil this rule down to its core maybe just this you don't need to tell anyone how large of a position you have in TSLA and doing so might create more problems than its worth.\n\n**2) ~~You don't talk about $TSLA~~, sorry habit**\n\nFight Club Reference, for the lulz\n\n**3) Be careful with covered calls against $TSLA, don't chase premium**\n\nThe few times I've written covered calls even when I thought they were \"safe\" or \"who cares I can just buy back in on Monday\", They have failed me, shares ripped from my hands and growth so large that I couldn't afford to get back in. Also, if your calls are ITM at expiration you might have to deal with tax implications because you were not really planning on having the shares sold you just wanted that sweet premium. This rule also covers naked calls, but I would think that is a no brainer.\n\n**4) Be wary of FOMO buying and panic selling**\n\nJust beware of FOMO in general, the stock afterhours on August 31st ago was 540, people were FOMOing hard and as of now it\u2019s down, those people could have just waited a little bit for a pullback instead of piling in at the top last Monday the stock went up 70 points during trading hours (350) presplit that is unheard of, most people should have assumed there would be a slight pull back if nothing else just some consolidation. Panic selling is also a problem with this stock, if you are a shareholder and not using margin you don't need to worry the stock will recover from these little dips.\n\n**5) Do the opposite of whatever the mainstream media declares about $TSLA**\n\nThis rule is a little old, It comes from a time when everyone was bashing on TSLA, but basically the news exists to sell advertising, and when they aren't doing that they have an agenda. Back then, the powers that be were making tons of FUD about TSLA, so it was imperative that you ignore what they were saying and in that case invert what they were telling you, They say sell probably a good time to buy. This rule may become more useful in the coming days as I feel the FUD is ramping up again.\n\n**6) Don't compare $TSLA to bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin is worth whatever people think it is worth it does not provide any value. Tesla produces a lot and will produce much more in the future, and the stock reflects that. People might be paying more than fundamentally worth but as long as the future continues to pan out as it is looking to then the shares should continue to appreciate.\n\n**7) Buy low, Don't sell, well ok if you have to, sell high (stock price)**\n\nPretty straight forward, if you need to sell to deleverage, buy a house, etc. that\u2019s fine, but are you selling because you think the stock price is high, it \"was a bubble at 800 bubble at 1500, bubble at 2000, bubble at 2500\", just because you think its high it can always go higher, besides what are you going to invest in if not TSLA, GLD?\n\n\n**8) If someone claims to be a bull, but their posts don't align, you know whats up**\n\nMany people would post in the subreddit and they always looked the same. \"I'm Elon's biggest fan, [insert FUD]\". \"I'm the biggest bull on TSLA, [Insert FUD]\" basically it is a warning that if a person has a disclaimer, they might not be genuine.\n\n**9) After-hours on TSLA is for chumps, pay no mind to after-hours (Only applies to down-movement)**\n\nExtended hours trading trades on low volume, options market is not available. The real action is during standard trading day.\n\n**10) If this is your first post on TSLALounge, you have to buy stock**\n\nAnother fight club joke, but probably good advice, you need some skin in the game to have a real opinion IMO.\n\n**11) Don't use a stop loss on $TSLA**\n\nWhen you enter a stop loss its registered in the system the brokerages can see where its placed, and TSLA is very volatile, so there have been historically swings that can shoot the stock down trigger stop losses and then extreme buying pressure comes in and blows out the stock. Now you are out of stock, sold low, and will have trouble getting in. Also, many people putting in stop loses exacerbates sell offs creating avalanches on the tiniest little downtick.", "id": "lfnqy2", "created_utc": 1612823485.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "I wouldn't say bitcoin provides no value.
