While I try my hardest to give you solid research, no one knows exactly how the stock market behave.\n\n### Please do your own research before investing.\n\n[Interactive results](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/top_15_stocks_wsb.html)\n\n[Interactive results, with WSB removed](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/top_15_stocks.html)\n\n# CVS  \ud83d\udc8a +250% in mentions\n\nMarket Cap: $92.35bn\n\nLet\u2019s start off with what I feel is a very overlooked stock, with very good fundamentals: CVS Health Corporation (Ticker: **CVS**).\n\nThis stock currently represents the 3rd biggest holding in Michael J Burry\u2019s portfolio, at 10% of his overall holdings. *(for those of you who don\u2019t know him, I seriously suggest researching him. He was one of the earliest to spot the housing market crash of 2008, his character played by Christian Bale in the film \u201cThe Big Short\u201c, and identified the* [*GameStop short squeeze as early as AUGUST 2019*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/)*)*.\n\n#### Profile\n\nCVS Health Corporation is a US based integrated pharmacy healthcare company. The Company provides pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare, Inc. Omnicare's operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals, related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings.\u00a0It operates through three segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate.\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Retail/LTC Segment included 9,709 retail locations (of which 7,980 were its stores that operated a pharmacy and 1,674 were its pharmacies located within Target stores). CVS also has online healthcare presence through its websites, CVS.com, Navarro.com and Onofre.com.br.\n\nIt also provides healthcare services through its more than 1,100\u00a0[MinuteClinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinuteClinic)\u00a0medical clinics as well as their Diabetes Care Centers. Most of these clinics are located within or outside CVS stores.\n\n#### Fundamentals\n\nCVS has seen both solid revenue and Net Income flows. From 2019 to 2020, revenues grew from $257bn to $268bn (**+4.6%**) and Net Income from $6.6bn to $7.2bn (**+8.2%)**. CVS beat every analyst\u2019 earnings expectations in 2020.\n\nBalance sheet wise, the company is a strong position with a Debt to Total Equity ratio of **0.93**. In short, this number represents the amount of debt the company owes vs the equity it holds, with a lower number representing a less-risky investment. the Average ratio for S&P500 companies is 1.5.\n\nCVS has a Price-to-Earnings ratio (the price of the stock vs the Earnings per share) currently around 9x, the lower the ratio means the cheaper the stock is compared to their total earnings. Current S&P market average is around **25x**.\n\nThe company has seen sustained dividend earnings, and is forecasted for continued income growth, currently at **9%** annual.  \n\n\n#### Increased growth catalysts\n\nThere are rumours that CVS will open up some of their pharmacies to administer COVID-19 vaccines across the US. There are two things to consider from this:\n\n* Increased revenue streams at scale from the current US administration *(this could even become recurring revenue with all the talk of yearly booster jabs)*\n* Increased revenue from the extra footfall going into their stores *(remember the last time you went into a grocery store to buy toothpaste and came out with 2 full bags?)*\n\nThe relatively new CEO, Karen Lynch, is a serial success machine. For the past five years (2016 to 2020), she was named to Fortune\u2019s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business.\n\n#### Potential Downsides\n\nAmazon has announced its intention to enter the pharmacy space, which serves to the shake up the industry as a whole over the long-term.\n\nPersonally, I think the regulatory landscape of the pharmaceutical world means Amazon is still a long way away from making massive strides, and this current scenario is actually beneficial to current CVS stock price, which is lowered and under-valued because of it.\n\n#### Analyst Estimates\n\nThe 25 analysts offering 12 month price targets for\u00a0CVS Health Corp\u00a0have a median target of $86, with a high estimate of $102 and a low estimate of $72.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThe company is displaying very impressive fundamental attributes, and is currently trading at a lower price than what it\u2019s fully worth. That, along with its positive future projections and foray into administering COVID vaccines make it a very interesting stock currently.\n\nIt has been dropping in price slightly over the last few weeks and may continue to drop further before a big bounce; technical analysis shows a support point at $69 where price may fluctuate, and possibly bounce upwards from there. At that price, I would personally be tempted to buy into the stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I will be posting weekly to Reddit, I will post on a more regular schedule on my free newsletter:  \n[https://alikokaz.substack.com/](https://alikokaz.substack.com/)", "id": "lpn4c3", "created_utc": 1613997773.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Great informative.

{"title": "A Due Diligence on $LUMN (Lumen Technologies)", "selftext": "I would like to share with you all what I think about **$LUMN** and why it may and may not be a bet of long-term value in the future. Please feel free to comment anything I may have missed / or falsely claimed. TLDRs will be at the very bottom with my positions.\n\nI will structure this DD by first talking about what Lumen Technologies does and how this is different to what CenturyLink did. (CenturyLink got rebranded to Lumen) I will then include the financials of the company and discuss their most recent quarterly results, finally topping everything off by making an honest list of the potential downside to this investment.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor, please do your own research before investing.\n\n**Lumen Technologies** manages one of the world's largest fibre infrastructure that connects the world and powers networks, edge computing, security and collaborative services.\n\n**Adaptive Networking:**\n\nAdaptive Networking is a set of technologies that provide increased network performance, flexibility and security. It is a large and fast growing market valued at $25.8bn in 2019 and expected to grow to $41.8bn by 2024.\n\nTo grasp this area, think about a firm, new or old, that wants to increase its virtual connectivity in a post-covid world. This company wants to allow its employees all around US and the world to communicate seamlessly with each other. They want to be able to increase their usage of cloud-based services such as remote working, data storage and easy transmission of operational details among others. They can either set this up by themselves by approaching a plethora of service providers such as lets say, zoom for video calling, aws for cloud stroage etc. Or they could go through Lumen who will provide cloud connectivity, internet and networking, content delivery and will also manage IT services securely so this company doesn't have to.\n\nWhy can Lumen do this better than Zoom / Amazon / Google?\n\n\\- They operate one of the biggest networks of fibre with over 400,000 miles of networking lines and over 100,000 processing centres, you do not have to go through a third party when you can deal with Lumen directly.\n\n**Collaborative Services:**\n\nThey drive productivity, innovation and engagement with reliable and easy-to-use voice, video and contact centre solutions that keep your team in sync and customers connected, regardless of location or device.\n\nWhat this means is that essentially if you are betting on virtual working to persist, then betting on Lumen will mean betting on them providing faster global connectivity with security. They will be able to provide data-driven analytics of employees productivity and other key metrics. Why choose lumen then you may ask? They have leveraged their technology to do this better than their competitiors:\n\n[https://www.lumen.com/en-hk/resources/infographic/adaptive-networking.html](https://www.lumen.com/en-hk/resources/infographic/adaptive-networking.html)\n\nThey average 20% extra operational cost savings, 30% increased application performance, 32% faster configuration changes, and 25% improved security posture.\n\n**Security:**\n\nThey base their security on leveraging AI in machine-learnt threat detection. In my honest opinion, I see every company saying they focus majorly on security and protection of customer\u2019s data, which is true but as outsiders we have no way of validating how true it is. The main question to ask is whether LUMN security services are as good as market standard. To which I say: LUMN is the only company to win the Frost & Sullivan's prestigious 2021 Global New Product Innovation Award for its Holistic Web Protection Solutions. You can read more about this on the link below but the fact that lumen is being recognized and not just stating that their security is good, is a great step in the right direction for their turnaround. At the end of the day, the need for privacy and security will only increase down the line, and a company that is able to tackle such threats is in my opinion well positioned to sustainable growth in the future without having to undergo a completely security update in later years.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-only-company-win-130500720.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-only-company-win-130500720.html)\n\n**Why trust Lumen when you hated CenturyLink?**\n\nThe company launched a plan in 2019 to reduce operating costs by $800 million to $1 billion by the end of 2021, and in 2020 alone, Lumen reported savings of $830 million, indicating that its efficiency has significantly improved. They are really trying to rebrand themselves and change their entire operational structure. There will always be doubts on this transformation but if they consistently demolish targets like the one mentioned above, one has to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are at least trying. And of course the completely change in the way they are approaching the future of cloud computing and setting up to be one of the leaders to bring 5G to around the world with their massive fibre network.\n\n**Financials:**\n\n1. The market is pricing in a significant decline in corporate earnings for Lumen, and this has created an anomaly that could be exploited by value investors. The stock is trading at a forward earnings multiple of just 7.85, compared to the sector average of 22.27, suggesting the market is very bearish on the company\u2019s prospects\n\n2. Solid Dividend of around $1 (around 9% yield) annually. This has been reduced from the past years in a bid to save free cash flow to reinvest in strategic involvements.\n\n3. They are still perfecting their technology and this may be a negative point for many value investors given declining revenues. Quoting their conference call 2020 Q4: \"Moving to revenue. For the full year 2020, total revenue declined 3.5% to $20.712 billion.\" However, the pace at which revenue is declining is declining itself;, this is a 150 basis point improvement from the 5% year-over-year decline in total revenue from 2018 to 2019. Their revenue is not exploding like other growth stocks but it is heading in the right direction.\n\n4. They have massive transformation costs and this will continue to persist in 2021 too. These amass to around $224 million.\n\n5. I am posting their balance sheet and income statement from the latest quarter and year below with some of my comments. To be honest, they do not have the best financials, but they have been paying off their long term debt this year and have leveraged the lowest Interest Rates to take on marginally cheaper debt. They are tactically averaging down on the interest they have to pay on their debt.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QPc76LD](https://imgur.com/a/QPc76LD)\n\n**So what happened in Q4 results and what can we learn from the conference call?**\n\nFirstly, I am going to quote a few things said by their CEO and CFO, please make of this what you want, but these were the things I found exciting / to be careful about.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 we added 400,000 homes passed to our fiber-to-the-home footprint. We now reached more than 2.4 million homes and are very excited about the digital customer experience we are providing to our Quantum Fiber brand.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026we do see lengthening sales cycles as companies continue to evaluate their new infrastructure needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we connect customers in more than 180,000 on net buildings directly to our infrastructure with secured and reliable fibers. We have deep and robust interconnections and peering facilities to the world\u2019s eyeball networks and ISPs acquiring and distributing traffic to and from millions of endpoints. We have direct fiber connectivity to cloud service providers, hyperscalers and more than 2,200 global data-centers with tremendously scalable capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe operate one of the world\u2019s largest Internet backbones and carry a significant portion of the earth\u2019s Internet traffic each and every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have fully enabled edge facilities, covering roughly 60% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency\u2026by year-end, we expect to have more than 95% of U.S. enterprises within that same latency performance.\u201d\n\n**Things to get excited about:**\n\n1. \u201cWe\u2019re working with a major auto company on their autonomous vehicle program, helping them train their machine learning systems by building an accelerated data access network that decreases data transfer times between the metro areas they\u2019re testing with their headquarters.\u201d\n\nNow, EVs require <10ms of latency to be able to achieve optimum success and with self-driving in the works and LIDAR what not, Lumen is positioned at the prime spot. Lumen has tested around US and can provide <5ms latency.\n\n2. \u201cWe\u2019re also working with a financial services company to update their computing architecture to meet exacting specifications for performance with financial counter-parties around the world.\u201d\n\nIf this is successful, other companies will likely choose Lumen to not fall behind on their competition. Monkey see, monkey do.\n\n3. Many other partnerships which you can search up and they will also strategically keep announcing more partnerships as 2021 progresses.\n\nFinally, time to balance the knife and talk about all the bad things\n\n**Bad things to consider:**\n\n1. Macroeconomic challenges faced by the broadband business segment have a lot to do with the 61% share price decline witnessed over the last five years. The good news, however, is that Lumen is now focused on catering to enterprise customers, positioning it as one of the key infrastructure players amid the ongoing rollout of 5G technology.\n2. Lumen\u2019s traditional enterprise and consumer businesses are facing headwinds as technological developments have increased the efficiency of network usage, resulting in reduced demand for the company\u2019s fiber network. Enterprise businesses account for approximately 75% of the company\u2019s revenue, but many U.S. companies are increasingly embracing shared networking services, leading to a decline in demand for private networks, which has also weighed on Lumen\u2019s revenue.\n3. In addition, the consumer business segment has come under pressure as the company continues to lose broadband subscribers with speed limits below 20 Mbps, which was one of its primary drivers of earnings in the past.\n\nThe good news is that Lumen has reshaped its business model to cater to leading national telecommunication giants such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Due to the extremely high capacity required to roll out 5G technology on a national scale, mobile carriers are depending on fiber networks, and Lumen is monetizing its expansive fiber network by catering to the largest mobile carriers in the United States.\n\nReferencing:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-undervalued-tech-giant-112711717.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lumen-technologies-undervalued-tech-giant-112711717.html)\n\n**Some interesting questions asked in the last conference call and their relevance:**\n\n**Q1**: \u201c...it sounds like potentially next year there could be a several hundred million dollar impact to free cash flow and you would probably reinvest some CapEx into fiber-to-the-home. So curious, how do you think about your dividend payout ratio beyond this year pro forma some of those initiatives, and whether that changes your capital allocation initiatives at all? And in addition, if you could maybe frame-up the outlook for fiber-to-the-home within your consumer segment, how many homes you think makes sense to build to, and maybe some more color on that would be helpful?\u201d\n\n**A1**: So if you think about CAF II like I mentioned, we were \u2013 for last three years, we averaged more than $300 million of capital. The other thing to keep in mind is that we \u2013 through end of last year, we have enabled about 1.1 million units, and these are really in underserved areas. So we are selling into that and that revenue and penetration is picking up every quarter. So there is also cash coming in from the footprint that we have enabled. So when you look at the puts and takes going into next year of the subsidy, the capital going away, and cash coming from customers in that footprint, when you add it all up, it is not a material impact to our free cash flow. So really doesn't change anything from a capital allocation perspective.\n\nThe ubiquity of our fiber, the density of our fiber, the reach, the stand, the quality and the ability to upgrade capacity which we saw in 2020 with COVID is second to none and we'll continue to invest in building that infrastructure. But not only that, we've been able to locate our edge compute nodes with that fiber and with the peering connectivity within 5 milliseconds of the majority of the U.S. enterprises. By the end of the year, we'll be at 95%, 98% of U.S. enterprises and so there is that coupling that nobody else has, nobody else has that ability.\n\nClarification of confusing term (CAF II): Through CAF II, the FCC provides funding to service providers to subsidize the cost of building new network infrastructure or performing network upgrades to provide services in areas where it is lacking. ([https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-faqs#:\\~:text=Through%20CAF%20Phase%20II%2C%20the,areas%20where%20it%20is%20lacking](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-faqs#:~:text=Through%20CAF%20Phase%20II%2C%20the,areas%20where%20it%20is%20lacking).)\n\n**Q2**: We've got a new administration, a lot of focus on the digital device, there was money set aside for RDOF too. There's other programs being proposed in Congress, infrastructure builds etc. So what are you hearing from your folks in Washington, what sort of opportunities do you think this might present for Lumen? And then, perhaps you could just expand a little bit on the lengthening sales cycle. We're obviously still and the kind of pandemic, what \u2013 has anything particularly changed over the last month or two I think it's gradually getting better or any color there would be great.\n\n**A2**: I don't really have any particular expectations. I expect something out of Lumen. I expect us to following a disciplined, financially driven logical approach to what we serve and what we don't serve. And as Neel pointed out, we think we have lots of opportunities to put our money to work inside of our existing footprint and outside to some extent. But inside our existing footprint, at better returns than some of the RDOF dollars even with the subsidies. And so, we will follow a very disciplined approach to whatever comes out of Washington.\n\nAnd we'll work within the footprints that we have to deliver the best service for our customers with the best digital interactions so that they can overcome the digital device and have the best capabilities. And that's one of the things that we think we stand out on is more people work from home and educate from home. We think the symmetrical nature of our fiber footprint is a huge advantage for consumer customer or small business customers.\n\nOn the sales, the lengthening of the sales cycles. Is there anything different here? Probably not. That was what we found is people aren't resolving what is this post pandemic world look like yet, because we're not in a post-pandemic world, we're still in the middle of it.\n\nAnd so, I think that it is not terribly that much different. But we thought it would be getting better by this point.\n\n**Current Competitors: Verizon, AT&T, Comcast**\n\nIf this garners enough interest, I can provide a competitive analysis of their biggest competitors and also an analysis of their margins and where there might be room for improvement that we should see in 2021.\n\n**TLDR**: Lumen Technologies operates one of the biggest networks of fibre networks across the globe through which they can leverage cloud-based services and 5G. They have completely transformed from CenturyLink with visible improvements and if you are betting heavily on an increasing importance paid by the US on remote working, cloud computing, and faster internet speeds then buy $LUMN with a long term hold.\n\nAnd of course I cannot forget the obligatory rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Positions**: 900 shares and looking to buy some LEAPS soon.", "id": "lpmx3o", "created_utc": 1613997085.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Oh yea and Dr.Burry buying $LUMN just really makes me like this stock.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4750036597251892}, {"body": "Funny you should mention LUMN.

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, February 22nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-22-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Wall Street set to open lower on rising bond yield concerns\n\n> * U.S. stocks futures fell Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to open down about 0.5%, with the Nasdaq indicated off double that, as Treasury yields continued to push higher. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, traded Monday at about 1.37%, the highest level in almost one year. Finishing little changed Friday, the Dow eked out a third straight weekly gain, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke two week winning streaks. However, February\u2019s solid monthly gains remained intact for all three stock benchmarks.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. B/itcoin slips from records as Musk tweets it seems high\n\n> * B/itcoin dropped about 7% on Monday, one day topping $58,000 for another all-time high. B/itcoin, the world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency, exceeded a market value of $1 trillion Friday. Elon Musk, whose Tesla is estimated to have made about $1 billion in profit on its b/itcoin investment, tweeted early Saturday morning that b/itcoin seems high. Shares of Tesla \u2014 up 325% in the past 12 months \u2014 fell nearly 3% in Monday\u2019s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. PPP loans tweaked to try to reach even smaller businesses\n\n> * President Joe Biden is launching changes Monday to the Paycheck Protection Program to try to reach smaller, minority-owned firms and sole proprietors left behind in previous rounds of aid. For two weeks, starting Wednesday, the Small Business Administration will only accept applications for forgivable PPP loans from firms with fewer than 20 employees. The program was relaunched last month with $284 billion in new funds from a Covid relief bill passed in late December. About $150 billion of PPP money is still available, according to a Biden administration official.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Total U.S. Covid deaths near 500,000; Biden plans remembrance\n\n> * While daily U.S. Covid deaths have been dropping in recent weeks, total fatalities from the disease in America, the highest of any single country in the world, could exceed 500,000 as soon as Monday, based on data from Johns Hopkins University. When it happens, Biden plans to mark the sad milestone with a moment of silence and candle lighting ceremony at the White House. The latest daily numbers show an average of 1,872 people died over the past seven days, down from a single-day record of 4,407 on Jan. 12. Daily new cases averaged 69,986 over the past seven days. The highest single day of new cases was just under 300,000 on Jan. 2.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. United takes two dozen Boeing 777s out of service after engine failure\n\n> * United Airlines will temporarily remove 24 of its Boeing 777s from service after one of the planes bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The plane returned to Denver safely.

It's possible we see rates rise or inflation or some other catalyst which causes different parts of the market to catch up, while parts of the market that seem to have become expensive over the last year come down to earth. By betting on ARKK, one of the biggest winners of the last year, you're essentially betting that recent trends continue, which could happen! It is also possible that the incredible rise we've seen of unprofitable stocks is a bubble (it's actually picked up pace for no obvious reason over the last 3 months). Just know that that is a bet you are making when you go with ARKK. If you understand the bull and bear argument and are comfortable with the bet, great. If you dont have a strong opinion on which way the market will go in the future (most people shouldnt), you should go with a more diversified approach.\n\nIf we see a rotation in the market and different sectors start to catch up (for example, expectations of rising interest rates could cause banks and value stocks to outperform and growth stocks to underperform), it's likely that wildly successful parts of the market like ARKK will underperform at least in the near term. Whereas, if you go with a globally diversified portfolio of low cost etf's, you're basically not making a contrarian bet on which way the market will move in the future, which is a reasonable thing to do for a vast majority of people.\n\nHubris aside, this portfolio will outperform 95% of people on Reddit over the long term. 55% Vanguard Total Stock VTI, 12% Vanguard Emerging Markets VWO, 33% Vanguard Developed Markets VEA.\n\nIn any case, theres no way to predict which way the market will go in the future and the worst thing you can do is panic sell. ARKK is more high risk/high reward than my recommendation, but it's still a reasonable bet.

Going with a portfolio of 55% us, 33% developed markets, 12% emerging markets means you're not making a contrarian bet one way or another (not overweight US or underweight US).\n\nAs for different index funds that track the same underlying benchmark (many etf's are in effect index funds), there is little difference in \"quality\" between different index funds that track the same underlying index, ie ishares' s&p 500 etf vs vanguard's s&p 500 etf vs schwab's, etc. Fidelity's free versions underweight small caps so I wouldnt recommend those, but otherwise they tend to be similar in quality. The main difference is expense ratio. Vanguard's tend to be the cheapest, if not within a basis point or two of the cheapest, and unlike every other company they're owned by their customers not their shareholders, which means they're incentivized to continue dropping fees when they can in the future, whereas the rest of the companies tend to drop em afterwards to keep up.
