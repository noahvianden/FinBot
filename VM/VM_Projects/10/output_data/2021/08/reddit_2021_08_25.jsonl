{"title": "SPY puts or VXX calls as portfolio hedge", "selftext": "Hello, r/Options\n\nI have a decent but not crazy high amount (6 figures) of Vanguard S&P 500 Index VINIX serving as the bulk of my portfolio, and due to the insane bull run since last March, this has performed extremely well. I am young and decades away from retirement, and inflation is running hot, so I do not want to sell any and move to cash or bonds. However, due to the Federal Reserve getting ready to taper and September being a historically bad month for the market, I am getting increasingly uneasy.\n\nI have bought ATM SPY puts in the past as a portfolio hedge, and they have never ended up being anything other than a waste of money because the index would move up enough to make my puts deep OTM, and the next dip would not bring them back ITM. For example, if I were to buy 10/15 SPY $448 puts today, I am afraid that SPY could climb to $465 and then merely dip back down in late September to $450.\n\nI am now looking at picking up 10/15 $28 VXX calls instead. Would this be a good hedge against a correction and allow me to hold my VINIX/VOO to keep benefiting from a continued rise, or should I give up on the idea and simply move some of my portfolio to cash instead?\n\nThank you", "id": "pbf821", "created_utc": 1629910245.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Calls on VXX are a relatively expensive way to hedge for two reasons: (1) VXX tracks and holds VIX futures in inventory and VIX futures are almost always in strong contango relative to the actual VIX index, which means that the futures price is well above the spot index. To give you an example 3:56:46 NYT today, the VIX index was 16.50, the C1 front futures contract (peg between bid and ask adjusting for nickel spreads - expiry 15sep21) 19.25, C2 20oct21: 21.20. C3 17nov21: 22.10, and C4 22dec21: 22.45. This spread is typical. These futures have to converge to spot (the VIX) as they wind down and so that nearly always causes a standard long futures position to lose money over time. Because the VXX ETF inventory consists of these futures, the VXX iNAV has consistently degraded over its entire history - VXX has had to reverse-split more times that you can count. (2) ... and you are asking about October monthly calls on VXX, which of course is plagued with relentless time decay, and in this case you can count on a much higher probability, given point (1), that this strike will end up OTM, which means the entire premium is gone. \n\nNow if there was a true black swan, this might still be a meaningful hedge. VXX calls would perform if SPY experienced a negative 6-sigma move. But this would otherwise be a very expensive hedge. especially if you wanted to hedge your entire portfolio (which would require you to calculate the appropriate hedge using a device like the \"minimum variance hedge ratio\" or similar as is used by professionals (for futures, not VXX)). \n\nEven SPY puts is problematic. Right now SPY has very strong volatility skew, which means that as you go down in strike price looking for cheaper puts that are more OTM, they are priced at an ever higher IV. Just look at the volatility skew for SPY on any brokerage site. So traders are currently trading at an extra premium for hedges already. So again, this will be a little on the expensive side. BUT if you are only hedging against swans, then you can drop well down into lower strike prices, like the 15Oct 380 Put at 1.25. That would cost you $1.25 per share for a $450 per-share asset. As young as you are, there is no reason to hedge against a correction, say -10%. Who cares about that unless you are 65 or older?\n\nJust for background, I trade VXM futures extensively, and I often use them for hedges, but I am very experienced at that.

From all the various responses I have seen, it seems like the best move is to simply ride out any corrections or taper tantrums in the near-term.

Well like you many of us have made aot of money and the gains were relatively easy... you could have thrown darts and made money from last March to say it simply...\n\nThere is nothing wrong with taking profits and setting some aside in case a down turn happens... but hedging doesn't always work the way you want it to. If the markets do turn down the vix will rise but if you hedge equally to your holdings you may not cover losses completely and you still need to close the hedge at some point and that timing will be just as difficult as timing a down turn... once you close and take hedge profits your holdings could still continue downward making another hedge not as efficient to enter as it will then carry the same level of risk and you may end up hold a negative on the hedge as well as a negative in the holdings... \n\nI have taken profits and set them aside and I am still holding 30% with stops at profitable levels to prevent bag holding. You're holding profitable positions so you could always sell off a percentage of them and keep some on the table on case it keeps going up. Nothing wrong with that either. Vix is a good hedge but it won't move like the indexes really so it probably won't cover all or most of the reds if it does move down. \n\nSince you have a many decades till retirement you can easily take profits and wait for imposing downturn and if it does you can scoop up those juicy stocks paying great dividends for the long haul or of course by more spy which pays a nice divi as well. March 2020 was a great time for my shopping spree and many others but today's market is as always is .... different... there will be more bull runs and bear runs and if you are young you got plenty of time to play smart trades... you can buy some puts with an exp out or you sells some covered calls on what you already own of course you know this already as you're thinking about protecting your holdings so I would assume that you could start some covered calls for extra profit on tip of what you made already and if the strikes are hit and called away from you it no loss for you just extra profits from premium collected. You're wise to be thinking of this. If a downturn does happen then selling puts is not the best as you will be assigned and that assignment may continue downward so bag holding - there is nothing wrong with bag holding on assets that pay good dividend so don't let that discourage you but I am also anticipating some downward action and my very profitable long stocks are being sold as covered calls as the market would need to dive substantially to make them negative holdings and they pay dividends so the trickle keeps coming. \n\nHope this helps", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you very much for the detailed response.\n\nSince most of my holdings are Vanguard S&P 500 Index, I am basically taking a lazy approach to diversification and riding the general market.

The odds of hitting red is 1 in 100.  Therefore, if the payout for betting red paid more than 100:1, it\u2019s a good bet and mathematically you are at an advantage.  These are the bets I look for.  You won\u2019t find it in a casino.  If red paid 125:1, I will bet it over and over and over and over.  The key is to properly manage your speculative money and don\u2019t run out of it.

If you look at the previous spikes, they generally last at least several days of insane volatility.  Maybe I missed the boat already, maybe I didn\u2019t. \n\nAlso, when buying scratch offs, or spinning an actual roulette wheel, the odds are against you.  Not metaphorically speaking but mathematically.  \n\nLooking at the previous parabolic moves with GME, look at the first day of huge movement, then look at the following few days.
