{"title": "Full Diligence Post on ALIBABA ($BABA) - An Undervalued Stock That's Worth a Look IF You Can Stomach the Risk", "selftext": "I know Chinese stocks are super polarizing, but at some point, they become too cheap to ignore (IMO). I think with the recent negative newsflow and huge stock declines in quality businesses, right now is one of those times where there's more upside potential than downside risk. Here's my full diligence post on Alibaba, which I believe is one of the most undervalued of the top Chinese tech companies.\n\n**WHAT ALIBABA DOES**\n\n* Alibaba is basically like the **Amazon of China.** Revenue segments are broken down below and are based on the company's 2021 fiscal year-end [report](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/pre210513.pdf)\n* **Alibaba's first revenue stream is core commerce** which accounts for **87% of the company\u2019s revenue** and can be broken down into many smaller segments\n   * The first is **Customer Management revenue, which accounts for 43% of revenue and the two biggest products in here are Taobao and Tmall which are both very important**\n      * **Taobao** is kind of like Amazon and\u00a0eBay put together where any individual or business with a Chinese bank account can buy and sell products\n      * **Tmall**, on the other hand, is known as a more legitimate\u00a0platform where brands like Nike or Nintendo set up online storefronts and sell to customers so if you buy on Tmall you know you\u2019re buying from a trusted source\n      * You can go on Taobao and search for virtually any product and often times, Tmall links are prioritized and are marked by a red logo\n   * The second largest segment is an **others segment** that accounts for 23% and many of the names in this segment like Sun Art, Tmall Mart, and Freshippo are food delivery platforms\n   * Another 5% of revenue comes from **international commerce** which is a key part of Alibaba\u2019s future growth strategy\n   * Another 5% comes from **Cainiao logistics** which you can think of as **similar to Amazon fulfillment where Alibaba has huge warehouses** it stores products for businesses and earns money delivering orders to customers\n   * The\u00a0last one I want to point out is **wholesale** which accounts for 4% and this is probably the Alibaba that most Americans\u00a0know for dropshipping\n* **Alibaba\u2019s second revenue segment is cloud computing** and\u00a0only accounts for 8% of Alibaba\u2019s revenue but below on in the bull case\u00a0section I\u2019ll discuss why **this segment is so important for Alibaba**\n* **Alibaba\u2019s third segment is digital media & entertainment** and in here is **Youku** which is a streaming service, **UC** which is an internet browser, and **Alibaba Pictures** which produces films\n* **The fourth and last segment is innovation initiatives and others** which\u00a0include amap\u00a0which is like Google maps and DingTalk which is like slack\n* Lastly, an important segment that Alibaba doesn\u2019t report because it owns a minority stake is **Ant Group**\n   * **Alibaba owns 33% of the company and Ant Group owns Alipay which was the primary way that almost all consumers paid for digital goods and services until WeChat pay came along**\n   * **You can pay for almost anything with the two apps but you can\u2019t use WeChat Pay for Taobao and\u00a0Tmall because they\u2019re owned by Alibaba and you can\u2019t use Alipay for JD which is backed by Tencent**\n\n**COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n* I\u2019ll only be going over **Commerce and Cloud** because these are the **two most important revenue streams for Alibaba**\n* **For Commerce, Alibaba\u2019s two main competitors are JD and Pinduoduo, which have been increasing share over the past few years**\n   * **JD is known for offering a more premium service because they actually buy the products from businesses, store them in warehouses, and deliver products themselves**\n      * JD also has a lot of support from Tencent who as I mentioned earlier is a fierce competitor to Alibaba. You can buy a lot of goods on WeChat from JD but not from Taobao or Tmall\n   * **Pinduoduo started off focusing on eCommerce for third and fourth tier cities but since then has expanded to China\u2019s major cities as well**\n      * **Pinduoduo is known for really cheap goods** and is also known for **group buying** which means you and friends can purchase together to buy at discounted prices\n   * Though the competition is getting fierce, from friends I\u2019ve spoken to in China, **people generally buy mostly from Taobao** just because it has the strongest brand recognition\n* **For Cloud Computing, Alibaba\u2019s two main competitors are Huawei and Tencent**\n   * **Huawei is known to have very strong government relationships** and a lot of their cloud revenue comes from government\n   * **Tencent is known to have a lot of the basic foundational\u00a0tools needed for most companies but does not have as robust an offering as Alibaba**\n   * Overall, the general sentiment is that Alibaba offers the best product set and has a huge lead in the cloud market which will likely be a huge growth driver for the company\n\n**THE BULL CASE**\n\n* The first reason to be bullish on Alibaba is that the company dominates in eCommerce\n   * **As of 2020, Alibaba owns 29% of the global eCommerce market and COVID has also helped accelerate the growth of eCommerce**\n      * **What\u2019s also scary is that Chinese smartphone penetration is only around 63% which means many more users are still left to be captured**\n      * **The average income in China is also increasing by a little less than \\~8% a year as the country gets richer and richer, meaning the average order amount will be increasing on Alibaba\u2019s eCommerce platforms**\n* The second reason to be bullish is Alibaba\u2019s opportunity in cloud computing\n   * Alibaba owns 40% of the market, Huawei owns 20%, and Tencent owns 14% as of [Q1 2021](https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/30820/cloud-infrastructure-services/)\n   * Many people know that most of Amazon\u2019s revenue comes from eCommerce but **most don\u2019t know that the vast majority of the company\u2019s profits actually come from AWS their cloud computing platform** which contributes to **12% of revenue but 59% of operating income** in 2020\n   * This is because **eCommerce is a low margin business** where you earn maybe a few cents per order **while cloud computing revenue can be reoccurring and generally is a much higher margin** business\n   * As the cloud market continues to mature and grow in China, **Alibaba is best positioned to take the most share with the strongest product** offering\n* The third reason to be bullish is Alibaba\u2019s **international expansion**\n   * In Alibaba\u2019s latest earnings call, CEO Daniel Zhang stated globalization to be one of his top 3 priorities\n   * Currently, Alibaba has 240 million international users, and they are aiming to double that figure in the future\n\n**THE BEAR CASE**\n\n* The first key risk is **Alibaba\u2019s relationship with the Chinese government**\n   * As you may already know, **Jack Ma made infamous headlines** last year when he made a speech **saying that China\u2019s regulatory system stifled innovation**\n   * **Chinese regulators suspended Ant Financial\u2019s $37 billion IPO two days before its launch** and there\u2019s also some talk that Jack Ma actually knew this was\u00a0coming and that\u2019s why he made the remarks he did\n   * **Then earlier this April, Alibaba was hit with a record $2.8 billion fine for monopolistic practices**\n   * Generally speaking, Alibaba is skating on thin ice with the government and so **regulations especially related to antitrust are a huge risk** for the company\n* The second important risk relates to **Alibaba\u2019s investments**\n   * **Alibaba\u2019s CFO Maggie Wu stated in the FY 2021 earnings call that Alibaba will be investing its incremental profits into the business**\n   * This signals to me that regardless of its size, Alibaba is still very much in growth mode and **one or two really big investments that go poorly can really hurt the company**\n   * For example, **if Alibaba were to heavily invest in gaming** which is an industry Tencent dominates, **it would face a huge uphill battle and burn a lot of cash**\n   * Of course, there\u2019s a lot of potential upside with all this investment, my main point is just that **it\u2019ll be important to monitor the progress**\n* The third important risk is that **Alibaba is structured as a Variable Interest Entity or VIE**\n   * Basically, what this means is that **you aren\u2019t actually buying shares that give you ownership of Alibaba when you buy stock and instead you\u2019re buying shares of a shell company** based in the Cayman Islands\n   * **If the Chinese government decides these VIEs should be disbanded, all Chinese stocks like Alibaba will take a massive hit**\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n* **Alibaba's revenue grew by 32%** for its 2020-2021 fiscal year, which is really impressive given the size of the company (see [slide 9](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/197/70197/original.pdf) for more detail) which is super impressive for a company this size\n   * In their latest quarterly [earnings report](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/pre210803.pdf), **revenue growth has been reported to be 22% year over year** excluding their Sun Art acquisition (slide 5)\n   * Though revenue growth has declined significantly, I think it's expected given the huge year Alibaba had in 2020 due to COVID, so rev growth is something I'm keeping an eye on, but I wouldn't say Alibaba's business is declining or in a bad spot\n* Company generated **$26 billion in free cash flow** in 2020-2021\n* Company has **$73 billion in cash and $23 billion in debt** as of their [latest balance sheet](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/110465921099438?cik=1577552)\n\n**TRADING COMPS VALUATION**\n\n* **Referencing this** [chart](https://ibb.co/JBGHv8d)**, Alibaba is trading at 13.8x 2022 EBITDA at a share price of $195.49 (price as of the publication of this post)**\n   * As you can see in the chart, Alibaba is much cheaper than its US and Chinese peers while growing at a respectable growth rate and with healthy margins\n\n**WHAT I'M DOING**\n\n* **Paying 13.8x 2022 EBITDA for a company that completely dominates in eCommerce and cloud computing in China seems like a very fair price to pay even with all the potential regulatory risk**\n* Right now Alibaba is worth $531 billion in market cap and to me, **given the company\u2019s dominance in two highly lucrative markets and the growth of Chinese smartphone penetration and average income**, I\u2019d be surprised if Alibaba is not a **$1 trillion company in the next few years**\n* These days, it\u2019s pretty hard to find a quality business trading at reasonable prices, and **there\u2019s a lot of risk with Chinese stocks, but I think it\u2019s important to be contrarian when investing**\n   * Right now, **a lot of investors say they\u2019ll never touch Chinese stocks until they\u2019re more safe** to invest in, but by the time things are safe, that\u2019ll just mean companies like **Alibaba will have jumped in price and there won\u2019t be as much upside left**\n* So this isn\u2019t financial advice, but **I've been buying on the dips** because I think there\u2019s **more upside potential than downside risk (assuming Chinese stocks aren't de-listed). My cost basis is around $200 and if the stock ever reaches $150 or less, I think it's a screaming buy (though it depends on the news flow).**\n   * Also important to note - I'm not betting the farm on Chinese stocks because of all the risk, but I am keeping my Chinese exposure to \\~10% of my portfolio to capture the potential upside\n\nBtw, last time I tried linking to all my sources, my post got rejected so if you'd like to know where I got any of my data, I'll respond to as many comments as I can with my sources.\n\n**TLDR:** Alibaba dominates eCommerce and cloud computing in China and is growing at 32% revenue growth + generated $26 billion in cash in its last fiscal year. IMO, there's a lot more upside potential than downside risk = asymmetric bet that's worth a 5-10% bet in your portfolio.", "id": "p2g1g4", "created_utc": 1628697820.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Great information thank you", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "no prob\\~", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3116069436073303}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.035142604261636734}, {"body": "Would like to know what you think it\u2019s worth in 7-10 years.

Maybe that can make their stock go up and be good enough for the investment.\n\nBut in terms of their actual business, its not good.  Most of these companies have Lvl2 chargers out there.  That's similar to what you have at home.  Takes several hours to charge a car.  Their business model is most similar to RV parks.  And in fact RV parks are used by EV owners for emergency charging.  There is no real margin to this business as the natural competition is the home unit, which can be bought for a few hundred dollars.\n\nLvl 3 charging is more interesting.  More like a gas station in that a car can be charged in maybe 15 minutes (it varies).  Lvl 3 is DC current versus AC for the Lvl1 and Lvl2.  TSLA leads in Lvl 3 charging (Super Chargers) but its not a profit center for them.  Cost tens of thousands of dollars for each charger.  Again it competes with home charging for most users.  (unlike gas stations which normally don't have to worry about customers getting their own gas at home)  Home charging doesn't have to be fast as the car is parked overnight anyway.  So Lvl 3 charging main market is long distance driving.  A greater number of Lvl 3 chargers across the country is needed to make EVs as practical as ICE cars for long trips.\n\nBut there are not enough EVs out there to justify that many Lvl3 chargers.  So they need subsidies to get the network built out enough.  That's great for the equipment suppliers, but not so much for the operators.  They still won't have great margins because there are still not enough EVs out there.  Long term, if you project large growth in EVs, the EV charging business becomes just like your local gas station.  Local gas stations compete on price and location, but rarely have good margins.  But they do have locations already, so relatively easy for them to add Lvl3 charger to their existing facility if the margins ever justify it.\n\nAnd that's the problem.  It's a crappy existing business, but growing.  But no barriers to entry, so when it becomes big enough to be viable, the existing gas station can just jump in and have a competitive advantage with their existing locations.  Long term, I don't think the pure play charging companies are viable businesses.

I've had times when simply placing my limit at exactly the market distance between bid/ask still won't get filled.  I've even had times where it moved further in my direction after this and the net debit on my limit order was more than the current market spread but the order was still open.  In this case I went back and closed each leg independently and it worked fine.  And this was on Tesla and while decently OTM the options were still plenty liquid at the time I was trying to close.\n\nBottom line though, you should be able to roll on Fidelity if you use the roll option on the expanded trade ticket.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7759475708007812}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4055052399635315}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.019227182492613792}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I was just wondering if I used Tastyworks if that would help a novice person like myself understand these trades better.
