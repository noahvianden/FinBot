On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) was driven slightly lower due to weakness in financial and energy stocks while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its winning streak to close 0.41% lower. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.\n\nDespite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minus, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, \u201cAt the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.\u201d\n\nPowell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would \u201carrive after the need has passed\u201d and \u201ccould be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, \u201cThe main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.\u201d\n\nRegarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated the need for caution but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, \u201cCentral banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supply\u2013demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.\u201d\n\nHere is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It\u2019s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)\n\nRegarding Powell\u2019s speech, BTIG Chief Equity and Derivatives Strategist Julian Emanuel said, \u201cPowell \"did three things very, very right, and obviously the markets are celebrating that. First was keeping the speech succinct. Second thing he did risht is, he sent the rest of the Fed governors out over the prior four weeks to basically tell us all that the taper was coming. He merely had to reiterate, and reiterate softly, that message, which he did very effectively. The third thing is he really tackled inflation head on. He knew that\u2019s been the preoccupation of the markets for these last couple of months. While he didn\u2019t give any new real evidence as to why he views inflation as transitory, he did cite the ongoing moderation in commodity prices and the view that past history would indicate that inflation is likely to be temporary.\u201d \n\nLooking ahead, market participants are set to receive more data on the strength of the labor market recovery this week, with the Labor Department's August jobs report due out on Friday. Consensus economists are looking to see that 750,000 payrolls came back during the month, representing an eighth straight month of gains but a slight pullback from July's 943,000.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of buy-now-pay-later company Affirm (AFRM) gapped up more than 40% after announcing partnership with Amazon (AMZN) that will let customers buy items of $50 or more in installments. \n* Shares of travel and leisure stocks slid after the European Union issued a new recommendation to restrict nonessential travel from the US due to surging coronavirus Delta cases.

Keep in mind that while they are certainly going to run very large models for automatic data labeling, these models won't be more than a few orders of magnitude larger than the inference models they have to run on the vehicle.

Regarding short interest being high, the company needs to sells shares to raise needed funds (per their own earnings report, they are running out of money before the end of this year if they don't raise funds).
