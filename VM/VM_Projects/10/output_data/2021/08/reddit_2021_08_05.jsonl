No one is an \"expert\" on exactly when and no two time periods are the same. Sometimes AAPL goes up around earnings sometimes it goes down and it usually has little to do with the actual earnings results. One thing has always been true though, if nd when AAPL goes down more than 5% it is a buying opportunity, and if it ever goes down 10% it is time to back up the truck an buy all you can.  Now AAPL is around 146, so 10% is 14 points. Can it go down to 132?  Unlikely but some general market sell-off collapse or some major trouble in China, some awful supply chain problem or losing the epic case badly or being ordered to break up the company,  these unlikely but possible events are \"worst case scenarios\" and yes the 10% level is realistic in case of very bad news. But where is the bad news?  The story now is Delta is threatening to semi-close the economy again. That might be very good for AAPL as it was during the shutdowns last year.   So we are nearing the release of the new iPhones and then move on into the christmas and new year. Anyone want to bet against that?  This is actually the period when AAPL historically does best, though yes there will be ups and downs.  I said buy and HOLD.  AAPL is a stock that allows you to sleep well almost every night.

AAPL and MSFT. BRK.A is on that list at #8, and Buffet can't find a better tech opportunity than holding AAPL at over 5% of his portfolio.\n\nMSFT's growth couldn't possibly be *less* played out.  They are making huge inroads with cloud deployments despite AWS's continued dominance, Azure is very likely to run up the market share pie slice over the next 10 years.\n\nThey can easily acquire to continue to add revenue to their books, and there are \"killer apps\" we haven't even dreamed up that will run their workloads on Azure or a competitor without question.\n\nThere is no \"played out\" in tech.

I worked for SAP once upon a time, so while Dynamics isn't at that Royal Dutch Shell level of ERP, they are certainly in the $200 M manufacturing facility range with a very compelling offering.\n\nAnyway - I'm ranting on here a bit - but your post requires a lot more thought on your part.\n\nI think you're literally out of your damn mind to think that MSFT and AAPL will \"trade sideways and uptrend at index rates for the next few years\"\n\nIt literally only takes one new product, one new announcement, from either company, as demonstrated with napkin math above, to add billions in revenue to their balance sheets.

If you bought calls twice a year you would need at least 20% upwards price movement twice to recoup those 8000.   \n\n\nSo I think that buying shares is better because they retain their value, and the only money lost in a year of side trading would be the 400 insurance- a 5% loss so to say.

If I made $3 bajillion selling oranges and 50 cents selling ads, the tax would be calculated ~~on a percentage of $3 bajillion and 50 cents.~~  on the 50 cents from selling ads, but how much you're taxed is based on the $3 bajillion and 50 cents.\n\n**EDIT: I can't read.** the tax is imposed on the amount you earned from the digital ads, but the tax rate depends on your global annual revenue. So it's not as stupid, but still pretty stupid.
