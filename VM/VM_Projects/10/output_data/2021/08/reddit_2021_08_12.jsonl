{"title": "2 Bagger TSLA Day Trade Analysis", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Zoomed out view of the larger time frame trend ](https://preview.redd.it/1xx7i3eufzg71.png?width=2441&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b1c54592434f57a3aaf730a1ee12f3249c99a64)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Trade Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/ic7o51zvfzg71.png?width=2427&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeadf9afc6ea364707bdc3c69ff6078042017712)\n\nBackground:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. TSLA's contained its price  action within a wedge since its very delicious break of the $700 lvl on 08/02.\n2. Since then, TSLA bears have made two (failed) attempts at breaching the $699.xx lvl in order to invalidate wedge.\n3. The first, and the more important one was attempted on 08/06. However, bulls invalidated that attempt the very next day with a lovely gap up and opening rally to test the upper bounds of the wedge.\n4. Since, then price has settled down within the wedge again, and on another welcome move, since the failed 08/06 exhausted bears significantly, TSLA bulls have been able to clock in higher lows since then, thus creating a new uptending lower bound to this the existing wedge, coiling the price further.\n5. Another important element to consider is that on 08/09 two major block were reported on\n\nTSLA at the $719 and $711 prices. Block trades are significant because they create a pool of buyers/sellers at the price they were executed at, thus turning those price lvls into quasi support/resistance lvls.\n\n6. Lastly, the Call Wall at the $720 strike is another component invaluable to this trade\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrade setup:\n\n1. TSLA had an inside day yesterday, within Tuesday's candle\n2. TSLA opened with a gap down below the uptrending lower wedge bound\n3. It then got on the ol' opening dumperoo and took out yesterday's low\n4. After, breaking through one inside candle, TSLA capitulated by testing the uptrending lower bound for resistance on a low volume and set its sight on taking out thursday's low\n5. Using the momentum of breaking through another inside candle, TSLA bears got audacious and attempted to breach 699.xx again\n6. However, much to their chagrin they weren't able to follow through and it took only marginal volume green candles to set up a fierce bounce.\n7. The bounce was further aided by bears closing their shorts in panic due to the sharp whiplash at the 699.xx lvl\n8. The potential energy from the 699.xx rejection worked in the favor of bulls as the rally created by bears closing their shorts aided TSLA getting back into the bounds of the wedge\n9. Price settled into a pennant by setting up two low volume tests for the support at the lower bound\n10. I entered into my position at 10:45 AM following a second bounce off of the lowerbound support\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTRY: I BTO 08/13 TSLA 710c @ 4.50 per contract at 10:47 AM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlayout:\n\n1. In hindsight, I MADE A MISTAKE entering here.\n2. While true that the price action was settling into a pennant, I should have waited on a confirmed breakout of the 711 lvl, with it being a price a major block trade was executed at\n3. Although this trade turned out fine, by waiting for the confirmation break of 711,\n\nI could have assured a better risk/reward for myself.\n\n4. We did see an upwards breakout of this pennant but price ultimately did reject the first attempt at breaching 711\n\n5. Luckily, this rejection turned out to only be a small setback for the bulls as the pullback that followed was on anemic volume. The low volume of the pullback was the only reason I hung onto the trade.\n\n6. The next time volume returned tho, and believe me it returned in a big way,  the bulls smashed the pedal to the metal and convincingly tore through the 711 lvl, and used that momentum to break through the upper bound of the wedge.\n\n7. Like I explained yesterday on the MRNA channel break trade, all major channel/wedge breaks are followed by some sort of consolidation because of how exhausting they are to the participants.\n\n8. TSLA, too consolidated right after the wedge break, that too in a very healthy manner by indulging in two volume tests of the wedge, to flip it from support to resistance\n\n9. Following the very bullish low volume test of support, buyers were back after having taken a breather\n\n10. The very next candle, we got ourselves into touching distance of the 719 lvl\n\n11. Another low volume mid-rally pullback/consolidation (I call these reload zones) followed, and we smashed through that lvl as well.\n\n12. However, right after we approached 720, and I decided to exit my position here since the 720 strike is the call wall for this weekly options expiration\n\n13. A Call Wall is a strike with the highest positive gamma and price moves in a peculiar manner\n\nwhen in vicinity of it.\n\n14. The Call Wall acts both as a resistance and a gravity i.e. if price is near this strike, doesn't matter above or below, it gravitates back to this price lvl if its not being directed strongly to another lvl\n\n15. With how much headwind there was in this zone: Call Wall, 723 resistance, 719 block trade lvl, I secured my profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEXIT: I STC 08/13 TSLA 710c @ 13.20 per contract at 12:01 PM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrade Technicals:\n\n1. Time in Trade: About an hour and fifteen minutes\n2. Price of contract at initial entry - 4.50\n3. Price of contract at close - 13.20\n4. Profit percentage - 195%\n\nNotes:\n\nAlthough this trade turned out positive, I could have taken a much better entry and avoided risk\n\nof a fakeout. This is especially important since I was holding 1DTE options and any fakeout/thetaburn\n\nwould crush my premium. Not my best/brightest trade, should be paying more attention to all the variables going forward.", "id": "p37q3q", "created_utc": 1628798860.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "These are so incredibly helpful...

Yes?\n\nAnd so whether at the 3m chart or just because you wanted to wait for it to test that 700 support....you seemed confident once it regained the lower-wedge that it would break upward?\n\nExplain.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, you are correct in your assessment that a downward break on a wedge is bearish especially if it invalidates a larger trend. However, like I explained in the post, the bears were already exhausted after a previous failed attempt to breach 699.xx on 08/06. This time when bears rode price down to that lvl after the wedge break, they weren\u2019t able to follow thru and it took only some of the buyers to step in, to overwhelm the sellers. This set off sellers panic closing their shorts, exaggerating the rally and leading to successfully reentering the wedge and more importantly, retesting it to claim it back as support\n\nAs you will notice I didn\u2019t enter into my trade until price had already retested the wedge for support. When it did retest it, it bounced twice into the pennant pattern. When it did enter a pennant, standard pennant/flag breakout dictates the breakout follow thru to be about as many points as the pole itself. That would mean a rally of 10 points if we disregard all else else headwind and variables in the larger pattern. That would put the breakout target at 720 approx but that wasn\u2019t what I was playing for.  I was only in it for a retest of the upper bound of the wedge given how coiled the price action had been, and the failed downward break had set off a frenzy. \n\nLike I mentioned in the post, I had made a mistake entering where I did and should have entered when it cleared the 711 resistance. However, I got lucky that the pull back was on low volume and that kept me from exiting my position. When it did break through 711, it was only a matter of following along and watching price action. Again you\u2019ll notice on the chart, the VOLUME that came in on the 711 break and kept coming in. VOLUME is everything. It indicates intent. The buying volume got progressively higher after the 711 break making the follow thru extremely DECISIVE, something that was missing when price tried to breach through 699.xx. Notice how earlier when bears tried to break downwards through 699.xx there was no follow through on volume, however here you got progressively increasing buying volume. \n\nSo when we did have that sort of volume come in on the break, I let the momentum have the trade play out and I was a passenger.

{"title": "How I use Data Science to Trade Options Around Earnings", "selftext": "Recently I started a trading strategy around earnings releases. These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.\n\nLike most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.\n\nUsually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.\n\n# Idea\n\nThe main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that \u201cspots\u201d companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.\n\n# Features\n\n# Since I\u2019m not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:\n\n\\- **Company related**Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..\n\n\\- **Earnings related**I am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4rlbo8cltg71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=effb4ef9f94472d66cc3a294651a8a01f14c495a\n\n\\- **News related**The goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfxuf9seltg71.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f7b92a8cafa3081935db8bc738597b1acdb390e\n\n# Target\n\nNow that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.\n\n# Model\n\nThe next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).\n\nWe obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljf7858hltg71.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffa9b4f3e377f1e2eb9cb4cf643e3507a6ea835\n\n# Results\n\nTo backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.\n\nLooking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability > 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we\u2019re keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3eyi1giltg71.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=26149b81c73d224add4266b177db298ea5ea3a9b\n\nThis model is behind the data and recommendations of [earnings-watcher.tech](http://earnings-watcher.tech/) where you can browse into what was discussed here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7j4a94jltg71.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f3d4a6bd242968c752101449ac6c68e375bcb01\n\nI use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, August 12, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 12, 2021**\n\nStocks largely finished higher, with all three major indexes managing to close out the day in the green. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) once again recorded fresh intraday highs.  The Nasdaq (QQQ) broke two consecutive red days and finished higher today. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed relative to the major indexes, closing the day 0.26% down. It seems a pattern has emerged in the last week or so, in which the market pulls back early in the morning before reversing to the upside. Market participants continue to weigh new economic data and corporate earnings with concerns around the coronavirus Delta variant and potential inflationary pressures. \n\nYesterday, The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June\u2019s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nCore CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June\u2019s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June\u2019s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it\u2019s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It\u2019s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. \n\nThe US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, \u201cThis historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you\u2019ve been asking for for a long, long time.\u201d Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared \u201c100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration\u201d said of the deal, \u201cI was proud to support today\u2019s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.\u201d The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation\u2019s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre.

Wait until they open intl. travel and alllll those canceled trips are rebooked.  Wait until they open Brazil in the world showcase (rumor).  Wait for Spiderman multiverse and the much hyped Dr strange or Thor love and thunder or eternals.  Wait for the completely revamped epcot to open next year.  Wait for paid fastpasses-which I absolutely fucking hate personally but will be a cash cow.  They have a lot of content rolling out soon to an entertainment starved public.  I think I convinced myself to buy more you son of a bitch I'm in!  Also I think universal being busy is a PLUS for them.  Does it take a day or 2 away for some people?

I used to go every year, but no more. It's ungodly expensive, and their only stripping benefits. We were averaging 3-5k for a 5 day trip, but now, you're looking at 8k. For that much, we will go overseas and see the world. International won't be opening up for atleast another year. Disney+ numbers are fluffed up because they're counting the people that got a year free with Verizon. The new content (outside Mando) has largely sucked, especially the Marvel stuff. I think the upcoming Eternals movie will signal the decline for their films and when the holiday crowds are done, February will be extremely rough for WDW. The only thing they've promoted for the 50th is merchandise and color schemes.

Disney is a generational phenomenon.  Parents bring their kids bring their kids bring their kids.  Sneaky big deal the ESPN world of sport arena opened up, they have massive dance and gymnastic competitions there just funnel in dollars and build habits of visiting disney.  I don't personally like it but I stay offsite and only eat 1 meal a day in the park, and I know it's not a popular opinion but disney is actually a very affordable trip value for dollar wise if you do it economically.  Between credit card points and flight deals and having some meals in room 8k would be more than 2 trips for me typically, right now prices are astronomical but normally.  I'm cheap as fuck in normal life but actually find myself wanting to spend when in the park.  I buy $3 waters for my kids willingly without being begged.
