{"title": "Important Advice on Investing in China - UXIN", "selftext": "I am bullish on $UXIN but I want to share some information that you can apply to other stocks, especially in China (please share around):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The US stock market is dominated by institutional players, however, in China the opposite is true. In China, 80% of the market is dominated by retail investors (ie people who aren't full time investors).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. This means that institutional investors in America cannot outperform the market because they are competing against other smart institutions with the same resources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. However since the Chinese stock market is dominated by retail investors, hedge funds and institutions outperform the market. Hedge funds achieve this by taking advantage of retail investors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. This also means hedge funds often manipulate the stock price to induce panic selling so they can then scoop up the shares on the cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Let's be honest, hedge funds are smarter, better resourced, AND ABOVE ALL they are not emotional. After all this is their full-time job and they're playing with other people's money, not their kids college fund.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHAT CAN RETAIL INVESTORS DO?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The first thing, is to remember there is a difference between between a COMPANY and its STOCK PRICE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The COMPANY is governed by the UNDERLYING BUSINESS (making money by selling its goods/services).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The STOCK PRICE is governed by the GREED/FEAR of people. For example Apple\u2019s market value increased by $1Trillion dollars during COVD, that\u2019s more money than it made in 30 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* This means you should only sell your stock when the underlying business isn\u2019t performing or is vastly overvalued (ie AMC had it\u2019s all time high price during COVID when it was shut and not making money).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* \\* In regards to UXIN, the company is doing great so HOLD on because it\u2019s going to the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy best advice is to ignore the daily stock movements because that\u2019s just the hedge funds trying to force you to panic sell.\n\n$UXIN to the MOON\n\n&#x200B;\n\nr/UXINStock\n\nr/China\n\nr/pennystocks\n\nr/WSBDeepFuckingValue\n\nr/uxin", "id": "p6iwdy", "created_utc": 1629256301.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Could you please elaborate further on point 1?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I prefer point 1, it was informative.\n\nPoint 1 was crap\n\nPoint 1 intuitive", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.49812808632850647}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1864406168460846}, {"body": "I think you have a bunch of points here that are at best questionable.\n\nWallstreet has access to chinese stocks.

{"title": "Palantir != Plantronics", "selftext": "tl;dr - Plantronics makes communication devices like headsets. 2022 FYQ2 guidance (particularly with respect to the chip shortage) has disproportionately lowered the price of the stock. There might also be a strong \"return to work\" boost in sales because enterprise's have been using services like Teams and Zoom while WFH, but as employees return to the office they will need to adopt a digital device rather than the traditional desktop anal log phone.\n\nThe ticket used to be called PLT and I bought it cause I thought it was Palantir. I actually made quite a bit of money (\\~$200 / 25% return) So I decided to up the ante and try and play earnings and got completely slaughtered.\n\nI've already lost the money, so this post isn't about trying to salvage those 8/20 calls I'm down 98% on. I just want to try and put my reasons for investing in this company out here for you wise men and retards at WSB to try and ask you, where did I go wrong?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mfuvq47751i71.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=a29152ed092c676a067e3d9a18a370cabd2adf82\n\nNeil Armstrong said the first words on the Moon with a Plantronics headset. So when we Moon, I recommend POLY. I use them at work, they are great quality, (but expensive). POLY's main source of revenue is enterprise communications device sales.\n\nI'm thinking that POLY will see a Return To Work boost. I don't think companies will go back to using analog devices. Many companies have been using Teams, Zoom, etc. to accommodate people working from home. Back in the early days, people just went on Amazon and bought whatever cheap USB / Bluetooth mic they could. POLY does not focus on the consumer device level, so unfortunately they did not profit from WFH. But when people start to come back to the office they will find themselves needing a new headset so they can communicate on Teams or Zoom. I guess they could dial in with their traditional office phone, but I don't think people will want to go back to doing that. As enterprises place orders for new Bluetooth and digital devices I envision they will stick with Plantronics.\n\nAfter the Q1 22' earnings and subsequent guidance for Q2, the stock is currently down about 14%. Even though the guidance was not really bad news with both revenue and EPS forecast to increase.\n\nI think there is room for a lot of room for upside with this company. They are making inroads into enterprise video devices (94% increase yoy). The chip shortage is improving, so Plantronics' gross margins will improve significantly. Finally, they have a new CEO who seems like a cool guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Q1 22' Financial summary](https://preview.redd.it/5kitkp3951i71.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=7236d941d0548efcedfda5caff153e92ee3f89b8)\n\n[Revenue breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/son0qh0a51i71.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef9a67d9b9b275aadea3fc8127c3d93f360a77f9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Q2 22' Guidance](https://preview.redd.it/bu5e4efc51i71.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d94627e6497906ca717c028211db28a27385b28)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stock price over the last 10 years](https://preview.redd.it/blvm6zpd51i71.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=1abbd83ce2d97b4ca84f9c871c5a15a22ebad06e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New CEO \\(Sept 2020\\) with lots of communications experience](https://preview.redd.it/76eu060f51i71.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=3148421387385da2db3ebcfda1236817a63a2e27)\n\nThis is my first DD post.
