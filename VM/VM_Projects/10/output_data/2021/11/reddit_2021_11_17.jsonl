{"title": "$SFT Shift Technologies - David Vs Goliath", "selftext": "I'm posting this to other subs btw. Idk why people get so mad about that but I'm just openly telling you that I'm doing it. I want my gospel to spread.  \n\nI've got a play that I think might actually go somewhere. I'll break this post up into 5 parts. Part 1: Intro, Fundamentals, and Carvana, part 2: technicals, part 3: short squeeze potential (I know this is super annoying at this point, and this play can do well on it's own without the short squeeze but trust me just look at the numbers, it might make sense.) part 4: risks, and part 5: TL:DR.\n\nThis post is going to be long, dry and honestly really boring (that's what she said). But for those of you who are looking for a fresh play, I highly recommend you read it through.\n\nPart 1: Intro, Fundamentals, and Carvana\n\nShift Technologies is an ecommerce business that focuses on buying and selling used vehicles. Think like a younger, more fun brother to Carvana.\n\nMarket cap: $540M\n\n**P/S (Price to sales):** 1.37 (Compared to Carvanas 4.64. A smaller p/s ratio is considered better since you're paying less in relation to their revenue. Essentially Carvana is more expensive when using the metric.)\n\n**P/B (price to book):** 3.14 (Carvana's is 66.25, again a smaller number is better so Carvana would be considered significantly more expensive.)\n\nIn fact, **$SFT has Carvana beat in essentially every category**. Comparing both companies Q3 results show the same thing, SFT is the better deal every time.\n\nSFT reported -0.33 eps, Carvana -0.38 eps.\n\nShift reported $180M in revenue, Carvana reported $3.5B. However, this number alone means nothing. Shifts market cap is $540M, so in a single quarter, they brought in 33% of their **total market cap**. Carvana has a market cap of $50B, so they brought in 7%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayodwpqcc2081.png?width=4031&format=png&auto=webp&s=856c8ee686eaa02b3e168ee818909b6ad9b93dd1\n\nComparison of $SFT and $CVNA via finviz.com. Open up the image or something if it's too hard to see or just go on the website.\n\nShift's Q3 results:\n\nRevenue: up 200% YOY\n\nGross Profit: $13M, up 250% YOY\n\nNet Loss: $37.4M, up 60% YOY (Note that it hasn't grown as much as their revenue or profit, meaning that they're proving they can scale.)\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $248M (Let me remind you again that their Market Cap is $540M. So their cash and cash equivalents makes up 45% of their entire market cap.)\n\nTotal Revenue for 9 month period: $440M. ($100M less than **THEIR ENTIRE MARKET CAP**) this is up 360% YOY\n\n**In conclusion: They're obviously growing. Their losses aren't growing as fast as their revenue which means that they're proving they can scale and can turn profitable. And they are significantly cheaper than Carvana.**\n\nPart 2: Technical (Anal)ysis\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5su82ocbc2081.png?width=1499&format=png&auto=webp&s=06dab8cd836faf62efb699ac8e5d84fb0a9ebff9\n\nFalling Wedge + Bullish RSI Divergence\n\nOkay I like to keep my technical analysis to a minimum. Usually just plot supports and resistances etc. As you can see, there is a falling wedge. $6.50 is going to be a very tough resistance to break, once that's broken though it shouldn't have any trouble until the $8-$8.50 area.\n\nFalling wedges are considered bullish, but what I really want to point out is the very clear bullish RSI divergence, this happens when the stock makes a new low but the RSI doesn't follow. This can signal a reversal.\n\nIf you're trading this, the obvious play would be to wait and see if it breaks $6.50, then ride it up to $8 and see what it does there. At least from a purely technical standpoint.\n\nPart 3: FFS It's Short Squeeze Talk\n\nAlright, I've never been involved in a short squeeze, nor do I try and seek them out. It's simply not part of my trading style. However, the numbers with this stock just seem a bit too compelling to ignore.\n\nShares Outstanding: 81.3M\n\nShort Float: 20% (ranges from 19%-25% depending on what website so I'll use 20%) -16.26M\n\nAvg daily volume: 1.68m\n\nInsitutional Ownership: 58% - 47M\n\nInsider Ownership: 23% (HOWEVER, during their Q3 conference call, they stated that their lockup expiration was Monday 11/15) so it's safe to assume that this could now be less. I'll go ahead and say worse case scenario everyone sold half, not realistic but why not i'd rather be conservative)\n\nQuick math time, Days to cover would be roughly 10 days, not great but not bad.\n\nA 20% short float with 10 days to cover could cause some sort of squeeze, but here's why I think this number is severely underestimating the potential. Say insiders sell half, they then own 11% of shares, and assume institutional ownership stays the same at 58%. That's now 69% (hehe) of the shares bought, which translates to 56M shares.\n\n**So this means that only 25.3M shares is actually being circulated around. So the short float would be closer to 64% of those shares being circulated.**\n\nAssuming all of this is correct, there needs to be a reason for the price to start turning bullish. I have 3.\n\n1. Q3 results beat estimates. And Shift actually raised their guidance for Q4.\n2. The stock just hit an ATL today ($5.87), which makes it risky for shorts. It's equivalent of buying a stock at ATH's. This coupled with the bullish RSI Divergence means that a reversal is likely.\n3. During their Q3 conference call they said that the lockup expiration for their shares was on 11/15. This most likely is what caused the frenzy of selling. However, once this blows over, there won't be any specific negative catalyst for the company (macroeconomics sure, but not anything specific to Shift). And with the clear Q3 beat, there should be some bullish momentum leading into Q4.\n\nIn conclusion: The numbers seem interesting and the company itself is actually growing quick and doing well. It's not a dying company where there is a reason for the high short interest. It's a growing company with a lot of potential, that happens to be heavily shorted.\n\nPart 4: Risks\n\nObviously everything has risks, and this is no different. I don't want to try and make it seem like this is the perfect company. there are dangers involved, so here's some that come to mind, and add any in the comments if I missed some.\n\n1. Used car prices are at ATH's, once they cool down that'll impact Shift's (and Carvana and whoever else is in this industry) in a negative way.\n2. They aren't profitable yet\n3. Monday was the end of their lockup period\n4. Inflation worries could keep people away from small cap, speculative plays.\n5. Uhhhhh they could go bankrupt?\n\nPart 5 TL;DR\n\nShift buys and sells used cars online. They are a much better deal than Carvana. They have a short float of 20% which I believe is higher when accounting for the high institutional and insider ownership. It obviously has risks but what doesn't? Nothing that was ever worth anything came risk free. Also they've been growing a lot. K bye.\n\nPosition: 1500 shares avg $6.35. 10 leaps exp 1/20/23 - total cost was $1850. Strike $7.50.\n\nBonus: For what it's worth, analysts all have a PT ranging from $12-$15. So without the squeeze it's got over 100% till it meets the low end of the PT's. These haven't been updated btw so I'm guessing they get raised since Q3 results were a pretty big beat.\n\nk bye.", "id": "qvo810", "created_utc": 1637114497.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, November 17, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 17, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday\u2019s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. \n\n**Here are some key numbers for today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.25%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%\n* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%\n* Target (TGT): -4.73%\n\nThe Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers\n\n* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected\n* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%\n* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%\n\nThe solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. \n\nSteven Wieting, Citigroup\u2019s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, \u201cThe markets generally are looking at it \\[the pace of inflation\\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct \u2013 it\u2019s benign for markets. It doesn\u2019t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.\u201d\n\nToday, Target (TGT) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):\n\n**Target (TGT)**: \u201cWith a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,\" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. \n\n* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion\n* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%\n* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%\n* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%\n* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84\n\n**Lowe\u2019s (LOW):** \u201cOur momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management\u201d, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. \n\n* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion \n* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36\n* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020\n* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The party seems over\u2026 after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I\u2019d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy\n* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. \n* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y\n* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. \n* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)\n* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current price target are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with two target raises.

I don't like corporations as much as the next guy, but I think it's actually a really good opportunity to join Grubhub or buy the stock and potentially win big. I say this because there are a ton of posts on Blind/Reddit trying to find the next \"IPO\" (looking at you Rivian). However, I believe there are some companies in plain sight that can potentially 5x in terms of market sentiment and the government printing money in the next few years. Grubhub is one of them.\n\nBefore we dive into the potential, I want point out the issues with Grubhub, and where there is risk.\n\n**Current Issues:**\n\n\\- Loss of market in suburban US\n\n\\- UI/UX (They improved UI recently but the logo / colors lack)\n\n\\- HIGHLY competitive GIG companies in US Markets\n\n\\- Reduction in Capital from stock market\n\n\\- Economics of gig based companies (Fee's / Caps)\n\nI do think these are large problems, but I think the potential is still great. So let's address them one at a time.\n\n**Loss of market:**\n\nI believe this is one that Grubhub definitely fumbled on, which was the US Suburban market. They didn't respond to COVID effectively in suburbs and they ate a fat L. However, I think there strategy is still sound, which is to focus on cities which VALUE convenience and fast delivery. The thesis is that when people go back to the office (highly debated) they will be less likely to order delivery. This would be especially true in suburban areas where there is a lot of driving. I for one would have a higher likely hood to drive to a restaurant to pick up food then deliver it. This might not be the same for living in a highly dense city.  It's a moot point, but a strategy that is valid. I also think by pouring money to become the clear winners into these metro areas from other regions where JET (parent company of GH) which it is the clear winner in, it can drastically improve logistics and cost which will improve its unit economics.\n\n**UI/UX:**\n\nThe UI/UX and branding from Grubhub is confusing. It has the JET logo to be more in-line with the parent company. This logo to me is trash and can be improved. I am a firm believer that if you have the engineering + users the marketing is the easiest to improve. Moreover, I have seen improvements in the app with reels, and frankly I am thinking they will keep getting better because DASH is now more focused on putting ads on its mobile landing page which will dissuade users.\n\n**Highly Competitive GIG economies:**\n\nGIG based companies like DASH, UberEats, Instacart etc. are super competitive and currently DASH has the edge. I think DASH is absolutely overvalued (15x revenue), it doesn't have a global presence and cannot acquire direct competition due to SEC laws. So where does it put DASH? It puts it in a highly competitive place where it needs to prove its unit economics and hold its position with a stock price that I believe will tumble. DASH needs to expand and grow but the market is so competitive and it is behind in the global economy losing in Asia, Europe (JET is the winner owns GH), etc. If they don't buy a grocery delivery company like Instacart, it puts them in a really weak position. This is why I believe it will deal with Survivorship bias, and it's exactly what Grubhub dealt with. It will seem like they are the winner and their lack of foresight can be their doom. DASH is so expensive, a larger company won't even look to acquire it, nor do I believe their leadership will allow it to be acquired. However, this makes Grubhub look like a steal in retrospect, because companies such as AMZN, Walmart, etc would all be good candidates to BUY GRUBHUB!. Yes, I believe they will get acquired or WILL partner with the likes of Instacart. This has huge potential upside, because the market needs consolidation. Also what is a better owner then AMZN their logical play is to move into food delivery that is already proven.  **Why do I think they will be acquired, well the CEO of JET Jitse Groen said it himself :). Moreover, so did the second highest stakeholder in GH.**\n\nCEO of JET\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/takewawaycom-shares-dip-investor-day-growth-target-disappoints-2021-10-21/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/takewawaycom-shares-dip-investor-day-growth-target-disappoints-2021-10-21/)\n\nSecond Highest Stakeholder of GH Article\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211025005332/en/Cat-Rock-Capital-Sends-Letter-to-Just-Eat-Takeaway.com-%E2%80%9CJET%E2%80%9D-Board-Urging-Sale-or-Spin-Off-of-Grubhub-by-End-of-2021](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211025005332/en/Cat-Rock-Capital-Sends-Letter-to-Just-Eat-Takeaway.com-%E2%80%9CJET%E2%80%9D-Board-Urging-Sale-or-Spin-Off-of-Grubhub-by-End-of-2021)\n\nSecond Highest Stakeholder of GH Presentation\n\n[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c13f4c6e17ba3aca12b9686/t/618b3d9d89755c08ab3bc41d/1636515230864/Cat+Rock+Capital+Presentation+on+Just+Eat+Takeaway.com+10+November+2021.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c13f4c6e17ba3aca12b9686/t/618b3d9d89755c08ab3bc41d/1636515230864/Cat+Rock+Capital+Presentation+on+Just+Eat+Takeaway.com+10+November+2021.pdf)\n\n**Reduction in Capital:**\n\nThe stock is taking a hard tumble. I believe that GH is reaching its floor, and will bottom out. It might also seem like they are hemorrhaging capital, but they are actually getting more and hiring like crazy. That is because the strategy of JET is to take from winning markets and grow losing ones. JET is the 2nd largest food delivery company in the WORLD. Capital from JET is a lot more than it might be perceived.\n\n**Economics of gig:**\n\nGig economies as a whole have shit margins, and with Fee caps etc. it makes it even harder. However, what if I told you that these fee caps aren't here to stay. The reason being is that these companies are actually GOOD for restaurant's. There is weird sentiment that these companies are bad for restaurant's, but actually they are good. They are increasing revenue for them drastically, and solving logistics that the restaurant would not care to do. The shift to dark kitchens as well will only make their economics better because they can disrupt the market to have different levels of fee caps. Also, fee caps are being appealed left and right and I think they can win, because of the level of scrutiny into such laws. They are actually making huge headway here, and I think GH has a strategy to improve its economics with all of its partnerships with Corporations + Campuses using robotics.\n\nCramer(I don't like this guy) on restaurant's needing food delivery\n\n[https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-restaurants-need-doordash-uber-eats-grubhub](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-restaurants-need-doordash-uber-eats-grubhub)\n\nAmazon Prime GH\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/prime/offer/GrubHub/student-discount](https://www.amazon.com/prime/offer/GrubHub/student-discount)\n\nRobotics Partnership with Ohio State\n\n[https://media.grubhub.com/media/News/press-release-details/2021/Grubhub-and-Yandex-SDG-Launch-Robot-Delivery-Technology-at-The-Ohio-State-University/default.aspx](https://media.grubhub.com/media/News/press-release-details/2021/Grubhub-and-Yandex-SDG-Launch-Robot-Delivery-Technology-at-The-Ohio-State-University/default.aspx)\n\nDoorDash Appeals\n\n[https://www.liberationnews.org/san-fransisco-gig-workers-demand-doordash-drop-appeal-of-prop-22-ruling/](https://www.liberationnews.org/san-fransisco-gig-workers-demand-doordash-drop-appeal-of-prop-22-ruling/)\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nGH has a lot of potential growth opportunities with their stock, but what makes me the most bullish is the potential of an ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AMZN, WALMART, KROGER ETC. In general the stock is undervalued, and is still growing like crazy. Even if they are losing to DASH, they will still continue to grow and improve and both may not fail.", "id": "qvr7pt", "created_utc": 1637124212.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "I am not a corporate shill and hate corporations is exactly what a corporate shill would say.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Also this is pretty much one of the only reddit places where you don't have to identify with the socialist zeitgeist lol", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2951032817363739}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2288401573896408}, {"body": "Lawl?

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, November 17th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe\u2019s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe\u2019s.\n*****\n> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.\n*****\n> Home improvement giant Lowe\u2019s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.\n*****\n> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.\n*****\n> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company\u2019s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.\n*****\n> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.\n*****\n> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.\n*****\n> The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.\n*****\n> The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.\n*****\n> Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.\n*****\n> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.\n*****\n> \u201cUS stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.\n*****\n> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria\u2019s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/jnD7DiY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/199Ptn8.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3UfhdZX.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Ks8X4jM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sphxmmg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oNQL407.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Peda6db.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kPv68Vv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7dXDEoE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IvQACNC.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/91BampG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ssUxyux.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tpVw8Yv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2sJ2bOx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-lowes-target-glaxosmithkline-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Lowe\u2019s (LOW)** \u2013 Lowe\u2019s rose 2.5% in the premarket after beating estimates on the top and bottom lines and raising its annual revenue forecast.
