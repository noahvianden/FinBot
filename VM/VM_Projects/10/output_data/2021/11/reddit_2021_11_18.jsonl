We chose ITM since SPY is generally increasing slowly or dropping rapidly. We chose a strike where the delta/gamma is high enough to offset theta losses over some time and we purchase the straddles under periods of low IV.\n\nThe idea here is that if SPY continues rising slowly then we either break even or make a small amount from delta/gamma. Or, if there is a large drop in SPY then we make money off the put side and the large increase in IV.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Nov 18, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 18, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. \n\nKey Numbers For Today \n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.34%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% \n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%\n* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%\n* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%\n* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%\n\nAfter a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. \n\nEarlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. \n\nThe possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. \n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) fell after the company disappointed in their latest earnings report and slashed guidance for the full year, citing slowing consumption trends in China. Here are the numbers:\n   * **Revenue** $31.15 billion vs $32 billion expected\n   * **EPS**: $1.74 vs $1.93 expected. \n   * **Guidance Forecast:** 20-23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, down from 27% growth expected\n* Shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite stock, exploded higher after the company posted record revenues in gaming and data center sales and raised guidance moving forward. CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cDemand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.\" Here are the numbers:\n   * **Revenue:** $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion expected.\n   * **Earnings per share:** $1.17 versus $1.11 expected.\n   * **Gaming revenue:** $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion expected.\n   * **Data Center revenue:** $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion expected.\n   * **Forecast for Q4:** Revenue and EPS expected to grow 50% year-over-year, much higher than 38% growth expected\n* A bipartisan coalition of State Attorney Generals said it was launching an investigation into Instagram\u2019s effects on children and Facebook\u2019s role in promoting the service to young kids. \n* According to a report by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, Apple (AAPL) is working to speed up development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities. According to the report, the company is pushing for a debut as early as 2025.

Separation occurred at around 8:41 PM EST and the first stage splashing down at around 9:24 PM EST, according to a tweet from Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck.\n\nRocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice in its history \u2013 the only other company besides SpaceX to achieve reusability. The first successful recovery took place November 2020 and then again in May 2021, though that latter mission resulted in the destruction of the payload.\n\nLike those flights, this booster made a splashdown via parachute. But the recovery included an additional element: the presence of a helicopter, which hovered near the splashdown area to track and observe the booster as it made its descent. While the helicopter didn\u2019t actually do anything related to the recovery, its presence is significant, as it indicates that Rocket Lab is also a step closer to executing its ultimate reusability plan: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster and capturing it mid-air with a helicopter.\n\nThe Electron sent two BlackSky Earth geospatial imaging satellites to low Earth orbit, part of a rapid five-launch agreement on behalf of BlackSky between Rocket Lab and launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. These satellites were originally scheduled to go to LEO in August, part of a three-launch schedule that ended up being delayed due to a small resurgence of the coronavirus in New Zealand and subsequent lockdown measures.\n\nThe two BlackSky satellites will join seven others already in orbit, as the geospatial intelligence company\u2019s aims to grow its constellation to 14 satellites by the end of this year. Earlier this year, two BlackSky satellites were lost due to a significant anomaly that occurred shortly after the Electron\u2019s second-stage ignited.\n\nThis mission marks Rocket Lab\u2019s twenty-second Electron launch and the fifth mission this year.", "id": "qwge9v", "created_utc": 1637205646.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Up 62% in 3 months, under the radar.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "On Reddit it's buried under news about SpaceX, which isn't tradeable and is now becoming just another delay factory.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3762526214122772}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12350301444530487}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08186285197734833}, {"body": "Scooped an all in basically when it dropped to 12,5 and no one talked about it - already up like 35 percent and a shit ton on calls, this is stellar news and they have one more launch inc.

As someone greatly explained it to me,   \n\n***The problem is that with shorts you are not betting that the stocks is undervalued, you are betting that people will realize within a short span of time that it is overvalued which is more risky than the former.***\n\nAnyways, I been seeing and hearing lately a lot of people looking for long-term investments during 2021. Don't mean to be a bear, but it's important to understand that the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock.\n\nThere are plenty of companies out there going mainstream with potential for a bright future. EV sector, Renewable sector, Crypto, Fintech & Tech, etc. \n\nI agree. I firmly believe renewables, electric vehicles, and internet-based payments are, in fact, the future. EV vehicle sales are growing at exponential paces. Solar panels will be seen more and more in your neighborhoods. ATMs probably won't even exist in 2030. Major cities are pushing for 100% electric buses by 2035. Major car dealerships are expecting to sell only EVs by 2040. Crypto is making a push as well.\n\nBut what's important is also hopping in the stock at the right price. Now, I'm not advocating for market timing. But hopping into Rivian, whose currently valued at $100B with 0 sales is just insane. Lucid being another one whose valued at $75B with a QUARTER of a MILLION in sales. Don't even get me started on $PLUG. $PLUG is a leader in hydrogen fuel cells for forklifts that reported negative revenue (wtf) and is valued $23B. We all know Tesla is a leader in its sector as well, but the price is outrageous. History has shown prices will always correct based on the company's fundamentals. Too many posts on $TSLA so I won't go into this. \n\nIt's no doubt we are in a bubble. Lots of \"Stock Gurus\" on Instagram promoting all these overvalued stocks just because their \"future looks bright\", and here come all these people commenting talking about how they just invested for the long term. Not saying their future isn't bright, but it's important to know when a stock is reasonably priced as opposed to just hearing a pitch line and going all in if they convince you. \n\nI have no ounce of doubt the prices will drop substantially. I'm not worried about missing out on these hyped stocks. And no, I'm not talking about a 30% correction. Check the dot com bubble companies. I'm talking 95% corrections.

In the years preceding the bubble, record low interest rates, the adoption of the Internet, and interest in technology companies allowed capital to flow freely, especially to startup companies that had no track record of success.*** \n\nI'm not here to spark rage or scare you. It's just the hard truth, lots of inexperienced investors have no idea how crazy the outcome could get.

You need to transform sunlight into electric energy and that's what these two companies specialize in.\n\nThere's 3 sectors in solar: Manufacturers ($FSLR, etc.), Installation and Services ($RUN, etc.) and Inverters (these two).\n\nThe competition is simple. Who produces the best inverter at the cheapest cost. Generally, in any industry, these type of companies see the best returns on their services. Why? Pretty simple. These companies spend tons of money in specializing their product. Suppose you spend $100 million to innovate your tech. Once you're ready to sell, you sell by volume.\n\n\"Hey First Solar, would you like 100 inverters? 1,000? 10,000?\" Their business model lets them grow at their own pace. You can kind of say the same for $FSLR but to an extent. The more complicated your product is, the more chance there is for failures. (I come from an engineering background in manufacturing and quality. Won't bore you with those details but point is, more room for potential error).\n\n$RUN is the leader in its sector (contractor) but as their business grows, so does their overhead. Think of construction (I also have construction background). If you want to install panels at 15 sites, you need 15 different crews. 45 sites? 45 crews.

{"title": "Gentex Corporation (GNTX) - Early Christmas Present", "selftext": "Alright retards, listen up! I'm here to bring you an early Christmas present. It's comes in the form of an automotive technology company, and no I'm not here to pump the EV chubs. Gentex Corporation (GNTX). \n\nI'm talking about a company that has an 85% rally rate in the month of December. That means that 23 out of the last 27 years GNTX has seen a price rally in the last month of the year.\n\n\"What's the average rally?\", you ask. Well, for all years it has been 8%. In rally years it has an average growth of 10.93%. In falling years an average decline of -8.81%. With it's largest gain being a whopping 48.52% and it's biggest drop being -14.56%.\n\n\"So, what makes you so sure this is a rally year?\", you ask. GNTX has been on a rally since the end of October. Including running up to an all time high just recently. And the auto tech industry is in a run-up like never before. This specific technology is in high demand. But what's great about GNTX is that it's technology is expanding beyond the auto industry and into other areas, such as biometrics, and opening up new revenue streams. Plus the financial health of GNTX is so strong that it is able to survive any downturn in the US market currently. \n\nEven at close to an all time high GNTX is on sale right now at $37.29. Because by the end of December it will be significantly higher. I am expecting a growth greater than last year and will close out the year over $40.\n\n\"That's not enough growth for me to get my wife out of her boyfriend's bed!\"\n\nWell, retard, take a look at the options because I know that's the only thing you idiots do. 12/17 -  $37.50C finished down 17% today at $0.83 while $40C expiring on the same day finished up 1,400%. Needless to say, I already made my money, so no need to pump this stock. \n\nSo call me Santa and go by your wife a new Tesla for Christmas so she can take her boyfriend out in style with all you hard earned casino money.\n\nTLDR; GNTX options are about to explode even more before Christmas. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "qx17nb", "created_utc": 1637274056.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Commenting so my smooth brain can remember this shit tomorrow and go balls deep in calls.
