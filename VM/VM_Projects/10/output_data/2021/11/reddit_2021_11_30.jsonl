The Moderna vaccine also produced higher postvaccination anti-RBD antibody levels than did the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. **Differences in VE between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might be due to higher mRNA content in the Moderna vaccine, differences in timing between doses (3 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech versus 4 weeks for Moderna), or possible differences between groups that received each vaccine that were not accounted for in the analysis**\"\n\nAlso, on your claim about diluted dose from Pfizer... that's not how I'd put it.

Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. \n\n**Some Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.87%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%\n* Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%\n* SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%\n* VIX: +15.51%\n* AAPL: +3.24%\n\nJ. Pow\u2019s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word \u201ctransitory\u201d to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. \n\nPowell said, \u201c\u201cWe tend to use \\[the word transitory\\] to mean that it won\u2019t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it\u2019s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.\u201d\n\nOriginally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the \u201crisk of higher inflation has increased,\u201d but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central bank\u2019s 2% target over the course of 2022.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a \u201cmaterial drop\u201d in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. \n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no world, I think, where \\[the effectiveness\\] is the same level\u2009we had with \\[the\\] Delta \\[variant\\]. I think it\u2019s going to be a material drop. I just don\u2019t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I\u2019ve talked to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. are like, \u2018This is not going to be good\u2019.\u201d\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.\n\nVivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, \u201cInformation is coming rapidly, it's evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors \\[last week\\] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It's all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we've seen. And it seems most likely at this moment \u2014 notwithstanding more information to come\u2014 that it looks like a delay.\u201d I agree, it\u2019s important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) introduced two new custom designed computer chips aimed at competing with data center chips from Intel (INTC), NVIDIA (NVDA), and AMD. \n* Goldman Sachs (GS) unveils new Amazon-backed cloud trading service for Wall Street firms.
