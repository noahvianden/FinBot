Suppose that, in the interim, Microsoft rebrands itself and gets a new ticker symbol.

It is not that the \"call\" is substantially identical to the \"stock\" - rather, the rule explicitly states that buying an option on the thing you just sold at a loss is a wash sale.\n\nWhat the rules are intentionally vague about and do NOT spell out at all is whether a \"November 26 $150 AAPL call\" is \"substantially identical\" to a \"December 3 $152.50 AAPL call\".  When you look on the interwebs, different people will have different opinions.  Most people here will tell you they are NOT substantially identical.\n\nPage 58 of publication 550 says that buying PUT options is treated as a short sale of the stock for tax purposes.

{"title": "KLIC September quarter DD", "selftext": "  \n\nKulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc., (KLIC $57.07) reported September quarter results that were better than initial expectations and guided the December quarter to be above street estimates as the core wire bonder business is performing a bit better than expected given the drop in IC unit volume growth. KLIC is seeing upside to other segments such as high-end LED, advanced packaging tools for thermal compression bonding, and growing opportunities in the automotive segment with power management chips and battery assembly applications.  Over the next couple of years the company's LED pick and place tool could drive revenue in this segment to be over $300 million from around $80 million in FY2021 establishing KLIC with another major growth driver.  The new LED tool addresses more applications besides just final placement including sorting, binning, and adjusting the LEDs on the substrate and is expected to drive much broader customer adoption outside of the initial customer who we believe is Apple. We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.\n\nThe company reported September (Q4FY2021) revenue of $485.3 million up 14.4% sequentially and up 173% versus last year's September quarter and in-line with the company's pre-release of results on November 1, 2021.  Revenue was better than initial estimates driven by strength in general semiconductor, memory and LED revenue coming in at the high end above $80 million for the year. Gross margin was 47.7% up from the 46.1% reported last quarter driven by volume, mix, cost reductions, and ASP increases. Operating profit was a record 31.9% up from 28.4% reported last quarter and the 13.0% reported in last year's September quarter. Pro-forma EPS was $2.17 up from the $1.87 reported last quarter and the $0.35 reported in last year's September quarter and in-line with the pre-released EPS estimate of $2.15-$2.17.\n\nKLIC generated $123 million in cash flow from operations and total cash increased $105 million sequential to $740 million or $11.63 in net cash per share up from the $10.00 in net cash reported last quarter as KLIC continues to be a cash generating machine.  Increasing cash by $4.15 per share over the last twelve months\n\nKLIC's reported FY2021 revenue of $1.52 billion up 144% in versus FY2020 and better than the company's initial $1.50 billion estimate driven by much higher IC unit volume growth in 2021 driving the company's core wire bonder business significantly higher servicing the 5G, EV's, and increasing content and complexity of each IC.  Strong growth in LED displays, service and the automotive recovery also helped revenue growth for the year. Operating income was $412.4 million or 27.2% of revenue in FY2021 up from the 9.4% reported in FY2020 driving huge EPS growth of 482% to $6.14 propelled by the increase in revenue and tight operating expense control.\n\nThe company guided December quarter (Q1FY2022) revenue to be $460 million down 5.2% sequentially and up 73% versus last year and better than the street's $411.7 million estimate driven by another strong LED display quarter and less of a decline in the core wire bonder business than initially anticipated.  Gross margin should be around 47% down slightly from the 47.7% reported last quarter. Pro-forma EPS should be $1.88 +/- 10% down from the $2.17 just reported and up from the $0.86 reported last year and better than the street's $1.54 estimate driven by the higher revenue and gross margin. \n\nKLIC did not update the $1.5 billion revenue estimate for FY2022 (flat with the $1.52 billion just reported in FY2021) but did suggest we might now have a bit of upside to that number as the core wire bonder business declines a bit in calendar 2022 as overall unit volume growth slows from over 20% in 2021 to around 8-10% in 2022.  This decline of around $150-$200 million in core wire bonding revenue in 2022 will be offset by growth in the company's other segments of high-end LED, advanced packaging focused on thermal compression bonding with a large OEM who we believe is Intel, new opportunities in automotive battery assembly and power management segments with customers such as Tesla and increased service revenue producing flat revenue for the year, or as we are forecasting, moderate growth for FY2022 to near $1.6 billion.  Expanding gross margin and operating leverage should produce higher EPS on flat revenue in FY2022. We are now forecasting pro-forma EPS of $6.34 in FY2022 up from the $6.14 just reported.\n\nWe would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.  In the near term the core wire bonder business will drop a bit in 2022 but then probably start to grow again in 2023 as increased IC unit volume growth drives up the core business again. The ramp of the LED display business from $80 million to over $100 million in 2022 and the ramp up of new advanced packaging products, in the back half of 2022 in the thermal compression bonding segment, which should double from the $20 million range to over $40 million in 2023 and $80 million in 2024, and growing automotive and battery assembly revenue should allow KLIC to show slight revenue growth in 2022 and higher revenue growth above $1.5 billion in 2023 and 2024 pushing the stock to over $100.", "id": "r0xnap", "created_utc": 1637732355.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "KLIC is insanely undervalued and it blows my mind that it's traded as tough as it has the past few months while the rest of the semi group has taken off.

The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.\n\n**Why did MU pop on Friday:**\n\n**Micron opened at 78.93, had a high of 83.86, a low of 78.93, closed at 83.03 (7.80% change), and 47.22M volume.**\n\n[Covered in the first DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzkdma/mu_micron_technology_deepdive_adderallfueled_dd/) *Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).*\n\n(\n*\u2018\u201cIn his note, Muse wrote that while shares of chip makers like Micron have lagged behind the PHLX Semiconductor index, or SOX, since early June, the tide may be shifting.*\n\n*\u201cWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,\u201d Muse wrote.\u2019*\n\n[Useful Nasdaq article explaining Friday\u2019s hype \"Why Is Everyone Talking About Micron Stock?\u201d](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-everyone-talking-about-micron-stock)\n\nThis is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).\n\n**Why did MU pop on Monday:**\n\n**Micron opened at 83.66, had a high of 87.67, a low of 83.66, closed at 83.86 (1.00% change) and 34.35M volume.**\n\nMU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday\u2019s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.\n\n**An important thing to note is that despite the market slide on Monday, Micron generally held its own and remained green.** The rest of my calls were obliterated, meanwhile the calls I bought pre-market and 5 minutes after open remained in profit. I did not sell these on the peak, I am still holding them. \n\n\n*Evercore ISI analyst upgrade from Friday:* \nAgain due to the Evercore ISI price upgrade on Friday, MU saw strong momentum on Monday.\n\n*Citi analyst upgrade from Friday:*\n*\u201cCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the pricing correction in the DRAM market was \"drawing to a close\" as the PC and server markets stabilized and expanded. As such, he expects Micron to benefit from \"more positive catalysts\" in the coming months and maintains a \"buy\" rating with a price target of $120 -- more than 40% above its current price.\u201d*\n\n*CNBC article released pre-market:*\n[An article was released on Monday from CNBC, 7:00AM EST.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html)  This highlighted the two analyst upgrades, their targets, and the upside. Due to CNBC\u2019s wide reach, this highlighted the stock to other investors and drove momentum. \n\nOne bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC \u2018Trading Nation: \u201cOn CNBC\u2019s \"Trading Nation,\" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.\u201d\nHowever my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.\n\n*Micron\u2019s LPDDR5X DRAM is going to be used in the MediaTek Dimensity 9000:*\n\n**This is important news, I\u2019m going to cover this later in my DD.** This was also announced pre-market. \n*[\u201cMicron Technology, Inc.

Micron claims LPDDR5X to be the fastest and most advanced mobile memory available. It says that it has shipped the first batch of samples.\u201d*\n \n*\u201cMeanwhile, Micron disclosed that it was joining hands with leading smartphone manufacturers and chipset vendors to enable ecosystem innovation with LPDDR5X.*\n[*Micron outperformed the general market on Monday*](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-technology-inc-stock-rises-monday-outperforms-market-01637619013)\n\n[*Nasdaq recommended Micron as one of top 4 stock trades for Monday*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-lcid-hood-mu-fl-2021-11-19)\n\n[**Furthermore MU was the 3nd (2nd according to other scrapers) most discussed stock on Wallstreetbets Monday**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24215526/gamestop-top-discussed-stock-on-wallstreetbets-heading-into-new-week-micron-tesla-and-th)\n\n**Why did MU pop again on Tuesday:**\n\n**Micron opened at 85.04, had a high of 87.71, a low of 84.33, closed at 85.41 (1.85% change), and had a volume of 31.64M**\n\nMicron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. \n\nThe primary reason for this was that [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/) upgraded Micron back to a buy (one month after it was downgraded). \n\n[Link to Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-upgraded-back-to-a-buy-at-mizuho-just-one-month-after-it-was-downgraded-11637672539?mod=mw_latestnews)\n\nMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.\n\n*\u201cWhen Rakesh downgraded Micron last month, he cited expectations of a soft demand outlook for the first half of 2022 for PCs and notebooks, server and handset markets.*\n\n*\u201cHowever, our recent checks indicate the \u2018ACTUAL\u2019 demand is improving across all three markets,\u201d Rakesh wrote in a research note, with first-quarter PC/NB builds \u201conly\u201d flat to down 5% from the previous quarter, compared with expectations of a 10% to 15% decline and handsets flat versus expectations of down 10%. He also believes server demand could improve.\u201d*\n\n\n[From Barrons:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537)\n\u201cNew data indicated actual demand was improving across PCs, servers and handsets that \u201ccould support an improved pricing,\u201d prompting [Rakesh to raise the stock to Buy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-mu-western-digital-wdc-stocks-analyst-buy-51637675537) and boost his price targets. The new target for Micron is $95, up from $75\u201d\n\n*\u201cRakesh estimates that first-quarter PC and netbook builds will only decrease between 0% and 5% quarter over quarter, up from previous estimates that they would fall between 10% and 15%. PC demand alone could be up as much as 5% year over year, a shift Rakesh said was surprising given Wall Street consensus that demand would be down between 2% and 3%.\u201d*\n\n*\u201dRequests for memory chips in China also could improve compared to previous estimates, as well as orders from server hosts like Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google (GOOGL). An additional boost could come from upcoming investments in the metaverse and virtual reality.\u201d*\n\n*\u201dMicron may be a new darling among analysts. Last week, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse added Micron to his list of top stock picks, anticipating a return to earnings growth next year.\u201d*\n\n[**Micron was once again one of the top discussed stocks on Wallstreetbets on Tuesday, being in the fourth position.**](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/11/24243247/gamestop-remains-top-wallstreetbets-interest-zoom-video-micron-technology-and-these-are-)\n\n**Wednesday outlook:**\n\nMU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today.\n\nUpdate: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M).

It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.\n\n[**When sampled**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/lpddr5x-ram-vs-lpddr5-dram-dimensity-9000/) Micron\u2019s LPDDR5X solution achieved data transfer speeds of up to 7500Mbps, however this is behind the transfer rates supported by the new standard (8533Mbps). As Micron emphasized on the 8533 figure, my personal prediction is that it will soon bring out products achieving higher transfer speeds (or that it is maybe saving them for other manufacturers than MediaTek). LPDDR5 (highest rate) achieves 6400Mbps. \n\n*\u201cBased on these results, MediaTek concluded that LPDDR5X modules lead to 17% faster transfer speeds and 15% lower latency compared to the previous generation.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMediaTek remarked the new RAM technology will allow increasingly higher levels of data processing, which are needed for the complex and heterogeneous processing units that are built into modern-day chipsets. These higher processing capabilities will be vital for the high-data requirements of the 5G era.\u201d*\n\n**The difference between Micron\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s LPDDR5X solutions can only be compared once the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks are released, or newer chips featuring the most recent RAM technology.**\n\n*Availability of Micron\u2019s new DRAM:*\n*\u201cMicron\u2019s Taiwan fabs have begun volume production of 1\u03b1 node DRAM, starting with DDR4 memory for compute customers and Crucial consumer PC DRAM products. Micron has also begun sampling LPDDR4 to mobile customers for qualification. The company will introduce additional new products based on this technology throughout calendar 2021.\u201d*\n\n**P/E Ratio:**\n\nMU\u2019s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I\u2019m sourcing from the below linked article for this section. \n\n*[\u201cRecent times have been advantageous for Micron Technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-piece-of-the-puzzle-missing-from-micron-technology-inc.s-nasdaq%3Amu-27-share-price-climb) as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMicron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.\u201d*\n\nLast year delivered a 117% gain to the company\u2019s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.\n\n*\u201cTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 35% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\u201d*\n\nMicron\u2019s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It\u2019s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. \n\nThe risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility. \n\n**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q3 2021:**\n\n[Recent relevant article released today, I will be sourcing from this for this section.](https://evertiq.com/design/51010)\n\nHyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. \n\nMajor smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models. \n\n*\u201cAs such, clients in both server and smartphone industries made significant contributions to the revenue growth of the NAND Flash industry for 3Q21.\u201d* \n\nHowever, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM\u2019s are showing signs of decline. \n\n\u201c\u2018On the whole, the industry\u2019s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cDemand from the data center segment remained strong, and clients continued to adopt Micron\u2019s 176L products. However, Micron\u2019s shipment share in the smartphone market lagged behind that of other NAND Flash suppliers. Furthermore, its PC OEM clients were starting to be affected by the uneven supply of semiconductor chips. In light of these factors, Micron\u2019s NAND Flash bit shipment increased by a modest 4% QoQ. On the other hand, the NAND Flash market remained in a severe shortage in 3Q21, thereby driving up Micron\u2019s ASP by about 5% QoQ. Hence, Micron\u2019s NAND Flash revenue for 3Q21 reached USD 1.97 billion, an 8.8% QoQ increase.\u201d*\n\n[*Sales ranking of Branded NAND Flash makers, Q3 2021 (in million USD)*](https://imgur.com/sbJyTmY)\n\n**NAND Flash revenue growth for Q4 2021:**\n\nThe impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. \nCurrently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components. \n\n*\u201cFor OEMs and ODMs, the differences between the NAND Flash inventory level and the inventory levels of other components have been growing over the past several months. Therefore, they have to scale back orders and reduce stock for NAND Flash. As inventory adjustments are happening, NAND Flash contract prices will start to drop and thus bring about an end to the several quarters of strong revenue growth enjoyed by suppliers.\u201d*\n\nI would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron\u2019s business though. \n\n**Micron\u2019s CEO, an analysis of his performance**\n\n[\u201cMemory chip demand has been exploding since Sanjay Mehrotra was recruited as Micron CEO in 2017.\u201d](https://investorplace.com/2021/11/mu-stock-is-at-the-middle-of-an-upswing-not-the-end/)\n\nMehrotra previously founded SanDisk. He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.\n\n[After Mehrotra joined Micron as CEO, strong performance was seen in 2017 and 2018.](https://investorplace.com/2018/05/micron-technology-inc-booming-despite-low-stock-price/). Micron\u2019s sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time. Long term debt fell to $7.8 billion nd could be paid out of cash on hand. It\u2019s price to earnings ratio was 10 (as of May 2018), which would mean a 25% bump in stock price. \n\n*In March 2020* [Micron surprised \u2018analysts by earning $405 million, 36 cents per share, on revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter ending in February.\u2019](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/micron-mu-stock-offers-hope-in-turbulent-market/) Certainly strong performance despite being at the start of the pandemic.\n\n*\u201dThe results sent MU stock up over 5% on March 26, although shares are down over 3% in mid-morning trading March 27.\u201d*\n\n\u201cShares rose sharply thanks to a [conservative outlook from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/micron-earnings-conservative-outlook-seen-as-prudent-but-rest-of-year-remains-a-big-question-2020-03-23), who has seen many booms and busts in his 30 years as a memory company executive.\u201d\n\n*\u201cLast week, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a letter that the company took early precautions in January to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in its facilities in China and the rest of Asia and expanded those protections as the virus spread world-wide.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWe have also carefully managed raw materials and our supply chain to maintain our manufacturing capabilities and production,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cOur global team has shown tremendous strength and solidarity, operating with excellence despite lockdowns and quarantines that challenged staffing, shipments and work schedules.\u201d*\n\nBecause memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a \u201csupercycle,\u201d with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.\u2019\n\n*Analysis as of today 24th of November 2021:*\nMemory has been going through a \u2018super-cycle\u2019 for years now, this is due to SSD\u2019s/flash memory replacing standard HDD\u2019s in consumer devices and more recently in data centres. SSD\u2019s/flash memory are faster and more reliable. As the price has been coming down for SSD\u2019s/flash memory, the switch to these has accelerated. \n\nAnalysts may warn that this \u2018super-cycle\u2019 is peaking, however it is just [cooling down](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107140009). And as outlined in my previous DD, in 2023, 2024 and the future. We can actually expect memory demand to exponentially increase. \n\n[Chart showing price projections of various DRAM product categories for Q3](https://imgur.com/bPkMum5)\n\nThe current supercycle is expected to run [until 2023 (\u201cThe super cycle in global memory chips, where price strengthening is coupled with demand overwhelming supply, is expected to last until 2023\u201d)](https://m.pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=489942), and could go well beyond that with new demand from [the Machine Internet](https://cplaneai.com/the-machine-internet-age/).
