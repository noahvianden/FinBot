{"title": "Understanding Delta for Deep ITM call (for PMCC)", "selftext": "I am researching ITM LEAPS for PMCC and I read that deep ITM call moves as close as possible to stock depending on the delta. The recommended range is 0.8-0.95.\n\nSometime in the options chain I see that there are higher delta at a higher strike prices - Below is screenshot of AAPL Sept '22 chart and you can see 55$ has delta of 1.00 and then delta below that drops to .85;  \n\nYou can see similar differences in delta at 0.87-0.89 range (circled in blue)\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. why does this happen(Vega, Theta at 0 make me think that this could be an anomaly?)\n2. is it better to snap the 55$ option?\n3. since all 50$,52.5$,55$ have delta of 1. Is buying 55$ ITM Call better than buying 50$ ITM Call as it requires less capital? is it better to buy the least highest delta strike price you are willing to target?\n4. For PMCC I read that Longer duration LEAPS are preferred, any reason to look at Jan'23 expiry instead of Sept'22? I see that Jan 23 call is may be 100$ more?\n\nAppreciate the responses!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ix70pntorup71.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=195ae16f1c1e3a315fa5a0b9a93861dedb7dc596", "id": "pvucb8", "created_utc": 1632664670.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "That\u2019s just an error in the display pricing.

They are 96-99 for the most part [https://imgur.com/a/DXoamRu](https://imgur.com/a/DXoamRu) . Those all have 0 volume, which could explain the greek errors. If they were more heavily traded, it would probably normalize. It could also just be a flaw in how TOS is calculating delta.\n\nWhen you're looking at that high of a delta for a PMCC, the date is more a factor of how long you want to give yourself to be right. Anything over a year and you would have long term gains.\n\nThe idea behind the deep ITM call is you are buying more intrinsic, which will hold it's value, assuming the stock doesn't move against you. \n\nYou can cancel out negative extrinsic with a backspread, if you don't want to buy an option years out. For example, right now the 9/16/22, 57C last traded at $97.55 and has -$49 extrinsic and 99 deltas. You could buy (2) 130C, 1/31/22 exp. and sell (1) 145C, 1/31/22 exp.. You would have 101 deltas and $111 in positive extrinsic. This position would cost $3,085. I've heard people refer to these positions as \"renting the stock,\" which is a fitting description.

When you introduce terms like negative extrinsic it becomes very nuanced and could confuse someone into thinking that extrinsic value doesn't exist, it actually reduces the cost of the option!

With any long option or spread, your max loss is the price you paid. The upside potential is unlimited. It's 100 long deltas.\n\nI suppose in this case you could divide the premium by 100 and say that's your range before max loss. A spread with 100 deltas will roughly behave that way, but not exactly, since you'll lose net deltas if the underlying moves against you.\n\n>Not a bad idea if you're confident in direction. Could bite you if direction doesn't work out and you have no hedge.\n\nOP is asking about a PMCC. This is a simulated stock position which is directional. I'm suggesting other ways to simulate stock than just a far dated, deep ITM call.\n\n>I believe Liz and Jenny from TastyTrade/Works created this idea - or at least brought it to the public eye.\n\nThat's correct that TT coined that phrase and popularized the idea. Backspreads or back ratio-spreads have been around long before TT. Any long ratio spread will reduce your negative extrinsic value. The ZEBRA is a specific type of backspread that seeks to have zero extrinsic. I just find it's easier to explain it rather than confuse people with specific names.\n\n>The idea that extrinsic values are negative is in how you frame the value of an option.\n\nNot really. This is just options terminology. If something works in your favor you are \"long\" or it's \"positive.\" Same as any greek or price factor. If you buy an option, you have \"negative\" extrinsic, meaning that value will work against you over time. If you sell an option, you have positive extrinsic. It's not something TT invented.\n\n>Option Premium = intrinsic + extrinsic\n\nThis is true for ITM options. OTM options do not have intrinsic value and will decay to zero, as long as they stay OTM.

In 2015, General Electric created a subdivision called GE Digital. They hoped to dominate the industrial internet. However, GE was slow to digitally transform. Most companies transformed in the \u201890s and mid-2000. GE dumped billions of dollars into this project and appointed thousands of employees to oversee the transformation. So where did they go wrong? GE moved away from its core business and spread its resources too thin. They focused on quantity instead of quality. Well-knownGE\u2019s companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google who dominate the tech industry, made it hard to compete.\n\n**Porter\u2019s Five Forces Model**\n\n1. *Threats of New Entrants*\n   1. Increased competition in the aviation industry\n   2. Barrier to Entry (Healthcare): Regulation from HIPAA and FDA\n   3. Barriers to Entry (Renewable Energy): Lack of infrastructure, fewer government subsidies compared to fossil fuels\n   4. The overall threat of new entrants is weak due to the high cost of entry\n2. *Supplier Bargaining Power*\n   1. GE has an extensive list of suppliers which can be found \\[here\\]([https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE))\n      1. The most notable suppliers are: 3M (MMM), Honeywell International (HON), Boeing (BA), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)\n      2. A lot of these suppliers products overlap with each other, meaning, GE has many options\n3. *International Competition*\n   1. Competition is stiff from companies like Siemens and 3M\n4. *Threat of Substitutes*\n   1. There are few substitutes in the market so the threat is minimal\n5. *Customer Bargaining Power*\n   1. GE has a wide range of customers which can be found \\[here\\]([https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE))\n      1.

This pattern was soon followed by a breakdown. Since then, the stock has been operating in a horizontal channel with resistance at $107 and $98. Look to enter the market around the lower resistance mark. We\u2019d also like to highlight the month of March. There was a lot of positive news during March which explains the increase in GE share price.

GE spread its resources too thin and moved away from its core business. GE could have been more profitable if they focused on developing their money makers in the Healthcare, aviation, and energy industries. That being said, GE is now focusing more on those industries. GE\u2019s acquisition of BK Medical is a big step in the right direction for healthcare profit. Aside from that, the new GEnx jet engines are quite impressive. The increased fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions are attractive to customers amid the growing global commitment to reach carbon neutrality. GE has been known to create terrific jet engines. Back in WWII, their J-47 engine dominated the skies. If you look up the best/most popular jet engines in history, you\u2019ll find out they were made by GE. GE has been making some major moves in the renewable energy industry. Most recently in the wind power sector. Emphasis on global carbon neutrality will have a positive impact on General Electric in the future. CEO Larry Culp is committed to driving down debt and liabilities. Long Term Debt debt has decreased by 45% in five years and Total liabilities have decreased by 32% in five years. In order to drive down these numbers, the CEO has slashed dividends. If you\u2019re looking for a similar company with a higher yield dividend, we suggest you look into United Technologies (3.37%) or 3M (3.26%). Despite General Electric's performance these past 5 years, we believe that GE can bounce back...If General Electric focuses on its core business (Healthcare, Aviation, and Energy), it will be very profitable. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

What constitutes an \"up day\" or \"down day.\" On $PLTR I've basically been waiting for a 25 cent move either way to call it an up or down day. And then sold the option. But I think I likely need a better guide or rule that I can more universally apply than 25 cents. \n\nSo before I blow up my account.
