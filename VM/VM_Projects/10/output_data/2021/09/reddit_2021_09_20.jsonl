The specifications of that contract make no mention of futures and the settlement rules require that final options exercise settlement is determined by the SOQ (special opening quotation) of the VIX index. The futures contract expiring on the same day will also converge to a very close price, the final mark to market.\n\nThese two prices are clearly related and will be correlated because they are converging to a nearly identical spot (if they have the same expiry), but neither is based on the other, they are both based upon an index of weighted SPX options. Today. which is a big day for the VIX, now at 28.79, the Oct 20 VIX/VXM, which has been in contango for weeks, no longer is at 26.70, up 4.50 from Friday. The 26 Oct 20 call is up 2.6 to 4.5, the 27 call is 4.10, up 2.35. Correlated? Of course.

If you don't believe me you can look for yourself. For [VIX options](https://www.cboe.com/index_settlement_values/) the September 2021 settlement value was 19.79. This matches the [VIX futures](https://www.cboe.com/us/futures/market_statistics/final_settlement_prices/) settlement value for September as well. Check out all the other months. You'll see they match.\n\nBecause they settle to the same final value, the options behave as if the corresponding futures contract is the underlying. If they were priced off the actual VIX index there would be an arbitrage possible. For example, when VIX futures are in contango, you could buy very deep ITM VIX calls, which would have very little time value, and short the VIX futures (so VIX options strike + price < VIX futures price, buy options and sell futures). Since they eventually converge to the same price it would be free money.\n\nVIX options being priced off the futures prevents this arbitrage.

VIX futures are almost always in contango. Over 252 annual trading days (not counting the partial Sunday trading day) VIX futures will be in contango for around 225 of those days. Yesterday's backwardation was rare and already today (at least at market open) the contracts are all back in contango.

But I am finding this conversation quite beneficial and it is forcing me to think through some key issues that I haven't thought about in a very long time. [It sounds to me like you trade both options and future ... I trade futures a lot, but only VXM, and seldom options, although ironically as I type this I am hedging long leveraged DIA deep-in-the-money 255 calls (Nov 19) with VIXW Sep 28 30 Calls until I can get a better price for a VXM hedge].\n\nI spent a long time today combing through final settlement contract specs for both these weekly futures and options and discovered that you are absolutely correct - final settlement values for weekly VIX futures and options contracts are always exactly the same value, the Cboe VRO quote, which in turn is the Special Opening Quotation (SOQ)for the VIX index on the morning of settlement day. I knew that the SOQ was used for futures but I did not know that it was also used for options. I think I thought otherwise because I remembered from somewhere else that the daily settlement price for futures is not calculated in the same way as the daily closing price for the options contracts. But you are certainly correct in insisting that the FINAL settlement price is not only calculated the same way, but it is more correct to say that the same calculation is used for both the expiring futures contract and the expiring options contract.\n\nOn that matter you are right and I was wrong.\n\nI still want to hold my ground though on the argument that the behavior of the options contract is not determined by or a function of the behavior of the futures contract ... that instead both are determined by the behavior of the underlying SPX products. \n\nI always fall back to models because modeling is what I do, and I am actually willing to explain my position from a modeling perspective if you would care to hear it. However I would completely understand if you DO NOT want to hear at all! I will throw it out here tomorrow or the next day if you have any interest, will probably develop more completely for others if not.\n\nI will at least start with the premise assumption: Comparing the options contract valuation to the futures contract valuation, that valuation is determined by the expected future value of a singular price (the same price). That singular price is the VRO relevant to those two contracts. [I will not be arguing that the futures price is equal to the expected future spot price, because that is not a logically valid argument unless the contract is neutral on hedging].\n\nSo anyway, this is where the argument starts with me. Regardless of whether you want to continue down this increasingly academic path, I thank you for correcting my mistakes and forcing me to think about these relationships for the first time in a very long time. You were the teacher and I was the student and not the other way around.\n\nBest regards.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm glad that you responded because I've always enjoyed your YouTube lectures, and you also make interesting and helpful posts to Reddit.\n\nYou're correct that I trade futures and options. I like you also trade VIX options and futures. Lately it's just been VX futures. I've tried trading VXM in the past as an outright short position, instead of the spread trading I do with VX, but I honestly don't like how much riskier that is compared to spreads.\n\nI too have VRO data going back to March 2006 for when I was trying to figure out if there was any pattern the day before expiration. I couldn't find any (maybe there is but I gave up looking for it) and the only interesting thing I found was that the only date VRO and the VIX open matched was 2018-03-21. I have an entire VIX project for backtesting that I use for trading VX futures, so talking about the VIX is a subject that's near and dear to me. I was surprised when you said they didn't match on final settlement because I know you've been trading them way longer than I have.\n\nI would love to hear what you say about the model. I have always said that VIX options behave as if the corresponding VIX futures is the underlying because everything I've read says that. I don't know if you're familiar with [Vance Harwood](https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2010/01/trading-vix-options/) is but he has a great blog about volatility and specifically the VIX. Bloomberg will quote him when they write articles about the VIX. He's definitely an authority on the subject and knows more about the VIX than I ever will, and he's talked about how VIX options behave as if the corresponding futures contract is the underlying, so I've always trusted what he's said.\n\nIt makes sense because the market makers need a way to hedge. They could try with a strip of SPX options, but I don't see how that's practical at all, since you have to constantly be updating the hedge when an option's moneyness changes, on top of expiration dates too. Much simpler to do it with a VIX (whether VX or VXM) futures contract.\n\nAnd when you think about the arbitrage that would be possible if it tracked the VIX index instead, it makes perfect sense then that they track the futures. After all, if the options were really priced off the current value of the index, if the futures were in contango you could sell the futures and then buy a super deep ITM VIX call that has very little extrinsic value, hold both to expiration, and since they settle to the same final value your profit would be the spread between the two.\n\nBut despite all that, I'm more than willing to hear your argument about the model. I don't pretend to know everything or that I don't make mistakes. But in the end even if we don't agree I still think I can learn something from it.\n\nIf you have the time I'm all ears. Take care.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yesterday I carefully worked on a framework for an argument, and went back yet again to the complicated settlement terms for all of the volatility suite to review them to make sure I understood them and that they were consistent.\n\nIn doing all of that I discovered much to my shock that I had delivered a full lecture on the VIX volatility suite in 2017, but not since. I found two interesting slides. One of them had this comment: (paraphrased slightly because the language was in the context of a whole series of points where the literal copy would make little sense): \n\n(1) \"They [options] will converge to the actual VIX on settlement day BUT they track a near-term future until that point is reached. The [unclear language replaced with word \"value\"] value is determined by the value of that futures contract, NOT the VIX (and remember that the futures contract must also converge to the VIX).  \n\nThis point makes it clear that I believed as you do that essentially the options tracked the futures. I am pretty sure that I had not reasoned through that though. I think that I accepted what was generally being said about about options tracking at that time. \n\nThen there was a second statement that appears to be a quotation from the Cboe information site at that time: \n\n(2) \"At times, VIX option contracts may appear to be mispriced relative to the VIX index. Although VIX options settle to the VIX index at expiration, prior to expiration prices of VIX options are based on expectations of what the VIX index will be at expiration. This expiration of what the VIX index will be at expiration also appears in the pricing of VIX futures contracts. As a result of this market dynamic, traders are advised to consider the price of the corresponding VIX futures contract when making trading decisions regarding VIX options\"\n\nCan you see the subtle difference there? My current view is well represented by the second quote. \n\nInteresting that these two quotes, one from me and one from Cboe, are in back-to-back slides. Even more interesting (and a little distressing to me) is that the second quote is in a slide that has IBKR image cutouts of WEEKLY VIX options chains and I was actually in position with one in 2016. \n\nThis means that I have to stop relying upon my memory and actually go and check to see if what I say about options or futures are true - and after seeing this I apologize even more deeply for making the ignorant statement that there are no weekly options.\n\nIn looking through the history of VXM I think the reason for my confusion became apparent - VXM was also promising weekly futures that I think were discontinued due to low popularity or maybe never initiated, but even today the Cboe contract spec document for VXM mini-futures declares that they are issued with weekly expiries just like their big VX futures (including the week number designation, like VX41 and VXM41 - 41st week in year). But VXM weekly futures don't seem to exist. At first I thought this was an IBKR limitation (and in looking for that I discovered that they do offer the VX weekly futures - but I don't trade VX) but I found no evidence that they exist anywhere else, including on the Cboe site, EXCEPT on their contract specification page.\n\nSo I guess I will work out the model-based approach, which is not going to be an easy task (and I am not going to develop anything like a DE model ... just the conception behind the development of one). I need to do this because I find myself trading VXM and hedging with VXM more and more.\n\nHere are a couple of related comments to guide the thinking about this. \n\n(1) Everyone keeps describing VIX futures/options as having a \"mean reversion\" property. This irritates me because the word \"mean\" actually has a meaning. The derivatives DO have an obvious reversion property, but not to any mean that one would calculate - certainly not to the mean of the VIX index nor to a mean established by considering the continuous growth rate of the VIX. To what do they converge? I have been trying to figure that out for the front four futures for about 6 months (I am algo-tracking them along with the VIX and SPX every 15 minutes including extended hours) and see clear convergence target over long periods of time).\n\n(2) Assuming that they are using Greeks derived from BSM or the BS DE, brokerage sites continue to publish the delta, theta etc. on the options chain pages. This is complete gibberish because the formulas for these Greeks assume, given how they are derived, that the underlying satisfies a geometric Browning motion where the continuous growth rates of that motion fall into a normal distribution. It is OK to assume that for SPX options, but certainly not for options of an index that uses an arbitrary formula to reflect the volatile IV of a basket of those SPX options. [Maybe the brokerages are using a non-GBM model? If so, would like to see it].\n\nAs I pursue this, I think it would be better if I presented my argument in steps in the options sub (I don't think anyone reads the futures sub) to see what kind of reaction I get. I don't think it would get much attention (I can't really do a tl;dr because THIS is the tl:dr) but maybe some VIX fans will pitch in and have something to say.\n\nOne of the spinoffs that I believe now (but with some doubts) is that if the options contracts existed but not the futures contracts, or vice versa, the performance of the existing derivative would be similar and nearly identical to what it is now (which raises the question of the role of arbitrage, or more directly, if the possibility of arbitrage really matters all that much).\n\nSo let's end this thread here - just you and I are reading it. Let me see if I can eventually move the core argument to a new thread. Your comments have really forced me to confront a carelessness in my own research but more important kind of forced both of us down to a more fruitful level of consideration and discourse. So again my deepest thanks for that and my sincere apology for not reviewing my background assumptions or \"knowledge\" before I stated such a strong opinion at the beginning of the thread.

Stock options pricing models assume directly that the log growth rates of the underlying fit, at least roughly, a normal distribution (qualified by tail events, which can be built into a model these days).

support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

{"title": "The Man Who Lost $20 Billion: Bill Hwang from Archegos?", "selftext": "The Man Who Lost $20 Billion in Two Days Is Lying Low in New Jersey\n\nAbout 15 miles from midtown Manhattan, the head of Archegos is groping for answers in the wake of one of the biggest debacles in Wall Street history.\n\nHe sits on the porch in a white plastic chair, a swing set out back, the lawn freshly mowed.\n\nHere in suburban Tenafly, 15 miles from midtown Manhattan, few would guess that this unassuming figure is none other than Bill Hwang \u2014 the man who just lost more than $20 billion.\n\n\u201cBillion with a B?\u201d gasps a neighbor down the block, when told of the epic blowup at Hwang\u2019s Archegos Capital Management.\n\nYes, billion, with a B, as shocked lenders can attest. Four months after Archegos rocked global finance, bankers and federal authorities are still sifting through the wreckage. The liquidator who mopped up after Lehman Brothers has now come for Archegos. Some colleagues have turned on Hwang; others hope he\u2019ll bankroll hedge funds that might yet rise from the ashes.\n\nU.S. prosecutors are asking questions, too, including the big one: Was all of this another spectacle of Wall Street greed and hubris, or was it something worse? Credit Suisse Group AG, staggered by a $5.5 billion blow, says it was likely deceived by Hwang\u2019s family office.\n\nHwang is groping for answers of his own. He amassed one of the world\u2019s great fortunes in virtual secrecy \u2014 and then lost it, very publicly, in a blink. In the easeful heat of this summer morning, he\u2019s awaiting a call with a retired U.S. general who, he hopes, might provide some counsel. He\u2019s dressed like your average American soccer dad: teal shirt, blue cargo pants, Adidas slides. He has a pad of paper and a pen handy. An 8-ounce plastic bottle of Poland Spring water stands on the white plastic table which, like the chair, could have come from Costco.\n\nAt hand, too, is a Christian pamphlet \u2014 a testament to the faith that\u2019s guided Hwang as he made dangerous bets in the markets and was even charged with insider trading in the past. The title is Armor of God, a reference to Ephesians 6:11 \u2014 \u201cPut on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil\u2019s schemes.\u201d\n\nHwang is relaxed, self-deprecating and reflective in a brief conversation, but declines to discuss the Archegos fiasco or his next steps. He\u2019s been lying low here in New Jersey, in this tidy borough of 15,000, beyond The Palisades cliffs that rise above the Hudson River. He is not exactly a Wall Street Napoleon exiled to Elba: Hwang has lived here for years, in the same house, with cobwebs in the eaves and hedges out front. A Mercedes sits in the driveway. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs dot neighbors\u2019 manicured lawns. Homes on this tree-softened street tend to sell for a few million dollars \u2014 a modest price, for a billionaire.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to square Hwang\u2019s mostly unglamorous life here with the portrait of him that has emerged over the past few months. By all accounts he eschews the trappings of extravagant wealth. At the Tenafly Classic Diner, where the \u201cNJ Sandwich\u201d goes for $6.95, the servers say he\u2019s been known to stop by, but haven\u2019t seen him lately. More recently he\u2019s been chauffeuring his family around town, in between coping with one of the biggest debacles in Wall Street history.\n\nCredit Suisse provided the first official peek into the flameout. A 172-page autopsy, released publicly on July 29, exposed a litany of management failures at Credit Suisse. But the embattled lender also says \u201cit seems likely that Archegos deceived CS and obfuscated the true extent of its positions, which Archegos amassed in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic.\u201d\n\nThis account also hints at a shift in Hwang\u2019s strategy that has baffled outsiders. Archegos had grown rapidly by making huge bets on established FAANG stocks \u2014 blue-chip U.S. technology companies. But by last year, it was plowing money into risker bets like ViacomCBS and several U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, some of which had been targeted by short sellers.\n\nWhen the banks began dumping Hwang\u2019s portfolio, these shares tumbled. And a more recent crackdown by the Chinese government has further decimated many of Hwang\u2019s favored bets.\n\nFor Hwang\u2019s family office, now comes the inevitable: liquidation. Only months ago, it boasted holdings \u2014 built on borrowed money \u2014 valued at more than $120 billion. Today, everyone is lining up for the scraps.\n\nThe person handling the liquidation is David Pauker, the specialist who stepped in after Lehman failed during the 2008 financial crisis. More recently Pauker worked on the restructuring of Steinhoff International Holdings, the South African furniture retailer that nearly collapsed after an accounting scandal in 2017. He declined to comment on pending matters.\n\nAcross the river from Tenafly, at Hwang\u2019s midtown Manhattan office, his landlord is suing Archegos for unpaid rent. Like building owners citywide, real-estate giant Vornado Realty Trust \u2014 run by billionaire Steven Roth \u2014 has been stung by the pandemic. It\u2019s trying to recoup $159,165.55 from Archegos.\n\nHwang\u2019s 38th-floor offices in the building across from Carnegie Hall have mostly been emptied, and his Christian charity, the Grace and Mercy Foundation, has decamped to a cheaper 22nd floor in the same building. The foundation had more than $600 million in assets as of 2019, according to its most recent tax filings. It had even more money in early 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe size of Bill Hwang\u2019s fortune remains uncertain. Former employees have been grousing that while they\u2019ve been wiped out, Hwang, through private investments and other holdings away from Archegos, could still be a billionaire.\n\nOne such investment was the seed money he poured into four of Cathie Wood\u2019s exchange traded funds that have exploded in popularity thanks to their market-beating returns.\n\nBanks are haggling with Hwang\u2019s team to figure out the size of his remaining wealth and whether they can claw back any of it. Credit Suisse has said it will seek to recoup money from Archegos and its related entities and individuals. The Swiss bank also flagged in its findings that Hwang\u2019s firm took out more than $2 billion in excess margin from its account with the lender in the days before the collapse.\n\nThe Department of Justice has been moving ahead with a probe into the blowup. At least one line of questioning has revolved around the communication between Hwang\u2019s top associate Andy Mills and the lenders, and whether he may have misled them in the week of the crash, according to a person interviewed by prosecutors.\n\n\u201cThe assertion that Andy Mills or anyone at Archegos misled the banks during the week of March 22 is untrue in every respect,\u201d a spokesman for Archegos said.\n\nThe Archegos debacle has fractured ties between Hwang and some former colleagues, who are fighting to recoup deferred compensation that was tied up with the firm. Part of their annual bonuses \u2014 which amounted to about $50 million \u2014 was invested alongside Hwang and rocketed in value with his portfolio, people familiar with the matter said. They want Hwang to carve out cash from money he may have set aside elsewhere.\n\nOne of Archegos\u2019s employees has put his home in Manhattan and another on Long Island up for sale, according to real-estate listings.\n\nDespite everything, Hwang is trying to push forward. He\u2019s investing his remaining money, and occasionally crossing the Hudson to catch dinner at a New York restaurant. He spends spare hours as he has for much of his adult life: praying, reading Christian-themed literature, and listening to recordings of the Bible. He\u2019s recently been reading \u201cThe Screwtape Letters\u201d by C.S. Lewis, looking for guidance to navigating the current troubles. A satirical epistolary novel, the book features the demon Screwtape writing letters of advice to his nephew, Wormwood, who is trying to win the soul of a young man.\n\nOthers are trying to move on too. Hwang has promised to throw his weight, if not his money, behind at least three funds being launched by prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Hwang named his firm Archegos, an ancient Greek word for leader or author, a reference to Jesus. The names of two of the new funds reflect the cataclysm at Archegos.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9brk0w620oo71.png?width=2668&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9e48b60a203a512e916039a142c8f77362a176\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out high dividends (\\~1.56% annually) but does re-invest that money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.
