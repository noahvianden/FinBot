{"title": "Let us take a deep dive into Up Fintech $TIGR as it grows over 100% and makes money as well, what is a company worth when making 50-75 cents next year growing at 100%? More than $15 I hope!", "selftext": "Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking your time to read my post. I have seen Up Fintech (TIGR) covered just a few times in several months but since they had a very good earnings report this past Friday I think it is important to have a review.\n\nTIGR is based in China but also has other arms in East Asia, Singapore as well. They grew sales the 1st quarter at 250% and made a profit, and this 2nd quarter 100% and lost 2.5 cents. They are actually growing much faster than any US broker, including Robinhood and are going to make some serious profits far sooner!!! If your gripe is it being a Chinese company, and you do not want to invest, I understand, but do keep in mind this stock has been crushed with BABA, DIDI and the like\u2026.Also, this loss was due to add spending which increased from 2.8 million to 24 million but growing accounts by more than 300%!! \n\nActually, this was $25 a share April/May before Archegos debacle and then Chinse fall out\u2026 .this crashed under 13 as well\u2026.Then when they crushed earnings this went from 12-30 in a few weeks! This was trading around 23-24\u2026.Goldman Sachs actually put a sell rating with a target of $21\u2026.. It started to come down\u2026. DIDI Ipoed in the US, on a Wednesday and that weekend China came down on DIDI hard\u2026. Everything ADR even CPNG fell like a brick. They have not recovered since.\n\nWhat you should ask yourself is what a company is worth that is growing sales at 100%, grew accounts by 300% and stands to make between .50-.75 cents. Generally speaking with this type of growth it is easy to say that a 50x PE ratio can be given\u2026 Take 50 cents x 50 and that is 25 dollars\u2026..\n\nSome highlights from the most recent report. You also check last report of 250%! Growth!!! But I know this market is what have you done for me lately, so I will touch on this past quarter.\n\nDuring the second quarter, the total number of funded accounts increased to 529,100. The Company added more funded accounts in the first six months of 2021 than it did in its entire cumulative operating history. The total account balance increased 188.9% year-over-year to US$23.9 billion as the Company continued to attract new clients from multiple international markets. In Singapore, UP Fintech's local subsidiary, Tiger Brokers (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., launched new products and in-APP functions such as an industry heatmap, Mini USD/CNH futures, and OSE futures, supplementing the wide range of analytical tools and securities trading functions available on the Company's platform.\n\nWe added 153,100 funded accounts in the second quarter, an increase of 353.5% year over year and 30.4% quarter over quarter; of these newly acquired accounts, over 60% came from international markets. Total account balance reached US$23.9 billion despite challenging market conditions, nearly triple that of the same period last year and 11.8% increase from the first quarter of this year.\n\nTotal revenues were US$60.2 million, a 98.7% increase from the second quarter of 2020. We increased investment in self clearing, user acquisition and talent recruiting, which are essential to our future growth, which resulted in increasing operating costs and expenses compared to same quarter last year.\n\nOutside of this being an ADR, I am not sure why anyone would be negative on it.

All-or-nothing basically. That took a lot of time: around 5 years IIRC?\n\nWhat Tesla and Brandenburg are doing instead is iterative: instead of permitting the whole thing at once, Tesla started building the factory (accepting the risk that should it not be approved it would be torn down in the worst-case), and used the preliminary permit process to allow each aspect of the factory to be examined by the relevant agencies.\n\nTesla has also shown very big flexibility in adjusting their design: the ~10 km water pipes they laid all the way to Berlin is an example of that, or their drastic reduction in water consumption and waste water production.\n\nThis \"modular & iterative\" approach actually works much better and faster than the BMW \"monolithic\" permitting process, because each agency will get a smaller and rather self-contained sub-task to examine & permit, and they worked with Tesla to adjust their implementation. If there was any concern - it would be signaled to Tesla who'd react and adjust as necessary.\n\nAs a result we basically have a factory that has been examined & permitted by all the responsible authorities already, we \"just\" don't have the final permit yet - which is legally conditional on a mandatory public review process.\n\nBut unless any of the relevant agencies messed up big time, the final permit is basically just the sum of all the preliminary permits - which have already been approved. That's why the responsible minister says that the final permit is mostly a formality, with 95% chance of success. (He cannot say 100% chance, because the public's right to object cannot be ignored.)\n\nIn that sense any REACH impact would already have been examined by Brandenburg's environmental agency - run by the Green Party no less - and any chemical processes with better substitutes are already modified by Tesla.\n\nAlso note that there's no compromise to the public interest in terms of the quality of the end result: both in the BMW case and in the Tesla case all relevant rules were fully followed.

How many other investors will/need to take any risk at all?

Scary.\n\nThere is nothing physically stopping the US from switching over to 100% sustainable energy production and transportation use within just a few years. If we treated climate change like the threat posed by WWII and took the same command-economy approach, we could do it. We would just have to make sure, like WWII, that the people who had been making money before the effort were also the ones receiving the money flowing forth from that effort to get them to not fight it. The Southern Company just finished a $20 billion nuclear plant that will cost more to run than it would cost to build and operate the equivalent solar.

{"title": "Why Moderna's 2x Antibody Titer News Is Better For Pfizer", "selftext": "**Why Moderna's 2x Antibody Titer News Is Better For Pfizer**\n\n>Breaking news: *Moderna vaccine creates twice as many antibodies as Pfizer: research* - [Source](https://news.yahoo.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-doubles-131601816.html)\n\nModerna vs pfizer dose size is 100mcg vs 30 mcg respectively. Lets take a look at the charts to see what a increase in dose size does to antibody titers. (Yes, I realize this is pfizer vaccine - results are similar for moderna dose size changes) \n\n>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2814-7/figures/1\n\nWe can see that a 50 mcg dose provides about 50% more antibodies at day 43, compared to the 30mcg dose - 18,289 (50 mcg) vs 12,431 (30 mcg). \n\nAnd we can see from this news today, that a 100 mcg dose provides 100% more antibodies than a 30mcg dose (2x antibodies!). But what does that mean in terms of additional duration of protection? Lets find out.\n\nDetermine the additional amount of protection 100% higher initial antibody titers provide...\n\nGiven that [antibody titers are key](https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1420870547039158273?s=20), with an [igG half life of 27 days](https://www.google.com/search?q=igg+half+life), a standard coronavirus reinfection period of \n90 days, and using the [half life equation](https://www.google.com/search?q=half+life+equation)...\n\nFind the antibody critical threshold:\n\n>Nt = No \u00d7 (0.5) ^ (t / tHalf)\n\n>Nt = 100 \u00d7 (0.5) ^ (90 / 27)\n\n>Nt = 10 (10% of antibodies provided by natural infection)\n\nFind the vaccine lifetime, given [4x](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-07-covid-antibodies-vaccination-higher-infection.html) antibodies induced by **pfizer** vaccine:\n\n>10 = (4 x 100) \u00d7 (0.5) ^ (t / 27)\n\n>(10 / 400) = (0.5) ^ (t / 27)\n\n>log(10 / 400) = (t / 27) \u00d7 log(0.5)\n\n>t = 143 +  [14 days](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/711x216/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5fe0a2eba64cb65886bd533b/Charts-describing-the-duration-of-neutralizing-antibodies-from-the-Moderna-vaccine-/960x0.jpg?fit=scale) = 157 days\n\nFind the vaccine lifetime, given 8x antibodies induced by **moderna** vaccine (100% more b/c of larger dose)\n\n>10 = (8 x 100) \u00d7 (0.5) ^ (t / 27)\n\n>(10 / 800) = (0.5) ^ (t / 27)\n\n>log(10 / 800) = (t / 27) \u00d7 log(0.5)\n\n>t = 170 +  [14 days](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/711x216/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5fe0a2eba64cb65886bd533b/Charts-describing-the-duration-of-neutralizing-antibodies-from-the-Moderna-vaccine-/960x0.jpg?fit=scale) = 184 days\n\nFind the difference in lifetime between the moderna and pfizer vaccine, given the larger moderna dose size.\n\n>delta t = 184 days - 157 days = 27 days.\n\nThese estimates line up with the latest news!\n>[Biden says officials consider 5 month boosters](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/biden-says-us-health-officials-are-considering-covid-booster-shots-within-5-months.html)\n\nBottom line: Moderna vaccine uses 333% more active ingredient, 100mcg vs 30mcg, for 27 days of additional protection, or exactly 1 full igG halflife. This much higher dose comes with [2.5x risk of Myocarditis](https://www.biospace.com/article/higher-rates-of-myocarditis-with-moderna-shot-health-officials-investigate/). This means the pfizer vaccine is safer, more scalable (less active ingredient per dose), and more profitable because it has higher margins. For every 100 mcg of active ingredient manufactured, pfizer can produce 3.3 doses where moderna can produce 1. This results in $67 for pfizer vs $20 for moderna, at $20 a dose, for every 100 mcg of active ingredient (mrna).", "id": "pnmpv7", "created_utc": 1631561966.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|79|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1382640302181244}, {"body": "OP forgot to sell his $30c's and is getting IV crushed right now.
