{"title": "The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers", "selftext": " The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \\~[**$290 billion by 2026**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184028/0/en/Global-Gaming-Market-2021-to-2026-Industry-Trends-Share-Size-Growth-Opportunity-and-Forecasts.html). How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:\n\n**2019 -> 2020**\n\n*Global Box Office*\n\n\\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \\~11.5 billion\n\n*Gaming Industry*\n\n\\~152 billion -> \\~164 billion\n\nThat\u2019s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\\*. Gaming\u2019s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohwldi8mdx271.png?width=3999&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a415b78bc52c3d24d4e683d5aef21196466dda2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubjho9vmdx271.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6c3744b3494825b9d4213a1c129993c0d27c05f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.\n\n**eSports**\n\nAnother beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to [surpass \\~1.1 billion in revenues](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-esports-growth-idUSFLM4K2cJ7) in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020\u2019s \\~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.\n\n**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**\n\nWhat is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.\n2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.\n3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).\n4. Gaming PCs for those that don\u2019t want to self-customize their own.\n\n**Corsair - Outlook**\n\nWith the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \\~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.\n\nThe target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \\~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nGiven the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.", "id": "nqxo47", "created_utc": 1622671439.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "FINALLY!

{"title": "MRNA in bubble?", "selftext": " \n\nMRNA current price: $193, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \\~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \\~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 \u2013 not bad. But clearly we\u2019re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \\[1\\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.\n\nThis price already seems too high though\u2026 depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \\[2\\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \\~75 bil (read: overbought) \\[3\\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they\u2019re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have \u201cplans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022\u201d\\[2\\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a \u201clong term\u201d supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring > 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?\n\nI don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna\u2019s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \\[4,5\\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven\u2019t YET got the vaccine never intend to: \u201cnearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them\u201d. \\[6\\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA\u2019s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )\n\nAnd the reason it\u2019s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \\~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \\~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.\n\nAnd furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that\u2019s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.\n\nIn Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. \u201cThe drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country\u2019s supply.\u201d \\[7\\] This article advocates caution because, at the time \u201cdata is scant\u201d. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.\n\nWhat started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \\[8\\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well \u2013 what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \\[9\\] \u201cExtraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.\u201d At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \\~1,200 healthcare workers, \\~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \\~800 did. Of the \\~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \\[10,11\\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: \u201c98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \\[0.09-0.39\\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \\[0.09-0.25\\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \\[0.14-0.42\\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \\[0.04-0.63\\] for early treatment.\u201d \\[12,13\\]\n\nRemember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there\u2019s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult\u2026\\[14\\]. What about Africa? Didn\u2019t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well\u2026 a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \\[15\\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \\[16\\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\][https://www.thequint.com/news/breaking-news/moderna-vaccine-approved-in-united-states](https://www.thequint.com/news/breaking-news/moderna-vaccine-approved-in-united-states)\n\n\\[2\\][https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/heres-how-much-money-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-could-make-from-covid-vaccines](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/heres-how-much-money-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-could-make-from-covid-vaccines)\n\n\\[3\\][https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/market-cap](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MRNA/moderna/market-cap)\n\n\\[4\\][https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441?utm\\_source=twitter&utm\\_campaign=contentshareicons&utm\\_content=article\\_engagement&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_term=040621#.YGyZ3Ln8tHN.twitter](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=contentshareicons&utm_content=article_engagement&utm_medium=social&utm_term=040621#.YGyZ3Ln8tHN.twitter)\n\n\\[5\\][https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371665/covid-vaccine-side-effects-moderna-pfizer](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371665/covid-vaccine-side-effects-moderna-pfizer)\n\n\\[6\\][https://time.com/5925467/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/](https://time.com/5925467/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/)\n\n\\[7\\][https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02958-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02958-2)\n\n\\[8\\][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251768/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251768/)\n\n\\[9\\][https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3765018](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3765018)\n\n\\[10\\][https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04425850](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04425850)\n\n\\[11\\][https://trialsitenews.com/argentinas-ivercar-ivermectin-carrageenan-study-shows-positive-results-targeting-covid-19/](https://trialsitenews.com/argentinas-ivercar-ivermectin-carrageenan-study-shows-positive-results-targeting-covid-19/)\n\n\\[12\\][https://www.onedaymd.com/2021/01/ivermectin-and-covid-19-review-updated.html](https://www.onedaymd.com/2021/01/ivermectin-and-covid-19-review-updated.html)\n\n\\[13\\][https://ivmmeta.com/](https://ivmmeta.com/)\n\n\\[14\\][https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/05/11/indian-state-will-offer-ivermectin-to-entire-adult-population---even-as-who-warns-against-its-use-as-covid-19-treatment/?sh=7cfefc7a6d9f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/05/11/indian-state-will-offer-ivermectin-to-entire-adult-population---even-as-who-warns-against-its-use-as-covid-19-treatment/?sh=7cfefc7a6d9f)\n\n\\[15\\][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795896/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795896/)\n\n\\[16\\][https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities)", "id": "nqo7lr", "created_utc": 1622647382.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "It really depends if you see it as a pure covid play.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**\n\nThe three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. \n\nThe month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called \u201cmeme stocks\u201d that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.\n\nNew economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers \u201ccontinue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand\u201d, noting that \u201crecord lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.\u201d As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The U.S. said Wednesday it will impose tariffs on the U.K. and five other countries in response to their taxes on U.S. technology companies, but will suspend the levies for six months as it seeks to negotiate an international resolution.\n* Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6,000 U.S. vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure, documents made public on Wednesday show.\n* Twitter Inc said Tuesday it will begin testing ads on its disappearing posts feature called Fleets, as it works to offer more options for advertisers. The company previously said it set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023 from last year's levels, which it plans to achieve in part by selling ads on more parts of its site and mobile app.\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Broadcom (AVGO) target raised by Piper Sandler from $500 to $525 at Overweight.

{"title": "The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers", "selftext": "The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \\~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:\n\n**2019 -> 2020**\n\n*Global Box Office*\n\n\\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \\~11.5 billion\n\n*Gaming Industry*\n\n\\~152 billion -> \\~164 billion\n\nThat\u2019s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\\*. Gaming\u2019s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.\n\n**eSports**\n\nAnother beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \\~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020\u2019s \\~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.\n\n**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**\n\nWhat is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.\n2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.\n3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).\n4. Gaming PCs for those that don\u2019t want to self-customize their own.\n\n**Corsair - Outlook**\n\nWith the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \\~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games. This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.\n\nThe target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market. Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \\~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nGiven the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.\n\n**Positions**: None at this moment in time although I trade in an out of positions on this ticker frequently.", "id": "nqxp6i", "created_utc": 1622671522.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "There\u2019s also something to say about not only the gaming market as a whole BUT the shift from console to PC gaming as the more mainstream platform.  \nIn the past, PC gaming was more niche and for older gamers.

Running the division is Doug Field, a former top vehicle engineer for Tesla Inc., along with a management team of fewer than a dozen executives. At least three members of that Apple car management team have departed this year.\n\n\nIn recent days, Dave Scott, who led teams working on robotics related to the car, left to become the chief executive officer at Hyperfine, a health care company developing next-generation MRI systems. Before Scott\u2019s departure, Jaime Waydo, who led autonomous car safety and regulation teams, departed to become the chief technology officer at Cavnue, a startup focused on the safety of autonomous cars on public roads.\n\nIn February, Benjamin Lyon, who helped create Apple\u2019s original car team several years ago and was key in the future project\u2019s development, left to become the chief engineer at Astra, a company developing technology for sending satellites to space.\n\nDespite the recent departures, Apple has added notable names to the car team over the past few years, including former top Tesla executives in charge of drive systems and manufacturing engineering, car interiors and exteriors and self-driving software. The team also includes other car industry veterans and executives who have developed key Apple products.\n\nApple has become the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, by selling smartphones, tablets, personal computers and services. But investors and customers have been clamoring for new device categories, with speculation increasing about an Apple car in the technology and automotive industries.

The Cupertino, California-based company initially set out to build a full car to rival Tesla, but pared back its ambitions around 2016 to focus on the underlying self-driving car system. Several months ago, it set out again to build a car, placing a portion of the division\u2019s engineers on that effort.\nIf Apple ends up releasing a car, it\u2019s unlikely to launch until later this decade at the earliest.

If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK\u2019s estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.\n\n> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW\u2019s autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.\n\n> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future.

{"title": "The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers", "selftext": " The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \\~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:\n\n**2019 -> 2020**\n\n*Global Box Office*\n\n\\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \\~11.5 billion\n\n*Gaming Industry*\n\n\\~152 billion -> \\~164 billion\n\nThat\u2019s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\\*. Gaming\u2019s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzt4hta5dx271.png?width=3999&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4262f1ce48f2cdb147de57aadb37358e41edc0f\n\nThere is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhmyyow5dx271.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ab577faef9b2abdd438edf9162b5e372a76063\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurrence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.\n\n**eSports**\n\nAnother beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \\~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020\u2019s \\~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.\n\n**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**\n\nWhat is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.\n2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.\n3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).\n4. Gaming PCs for those that don\u2019t want to self-customize their own.\n\n**Corsair - Outlook**\n\nWith the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \\~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.\n\nThe target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \\~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nGiven the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.\n\n**Positions:** None right now, but I've sold puts on CRSR over the last 6 months.
