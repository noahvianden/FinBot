{"title": "Hasta La $VST-a Baby. Entering the Stratosphere", "selftext": "  \n\n# Preamble\n\nEarlier this year, you probably heard about the insane cold snap that hit Texas. This was the harshest cold snap that has occurred in the past 30 years. During this cold snap, Energy prices soared as Texas residents turned up the heat in their homes. Due to this unexpected need for energy and a breach of contract by natural gas providers, every major energy provider in the area struggled to keep up with demand. Customers found themselves with mountainous electricity bills, however those who were provided energy by TXU(subsidiary of VST) were assured that they would be \u201cinsulated\u201d from the incredibly high energy costs. TXU covered the costs and took a major financial hit. This led to many investors riding the small brain slide down to a share price of $17 near the end of February.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cefgrmkmjy371.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f95e79ac6b85fb806f2d91c8109cefe3a0351af5\n\n# Insider Buying\n\nIn early March, insiders reacted to the dip by purchasing more shares of VST. James A Burke, the president and CFO of the company, purchased 30,000 shares. Being the CFO James is very aware that VST is not likely to go bankrupt and has very good future prospects. In early May, on another VST price drop, James A Burke purchased 50,000 more shares. The CFO of VST is betting nearly $1.3m dollars that the share price will return to the $20s. On May 6th, CEO Curtis A Morgan, bought 61,730 shares of VST. It\u2019s clear that insiders know this stock was hit far too hard on the bad news in February.\n\n# Huge Expansion in Texas Market\n\nBefore the pandemic, Texas was being flooded with young entrepreneurial minded millennials who were tired of paying the insane rent prices of CA and NY. During the pandemic, this Texan renaissance was accelerated due to younger people and larger corporations fighting back against COVID restrictions(Elon Musk\u2019s move to Austin is a prime example). This huge expansion in the Texas market was already starting to show in 2019 when VST hit nearly $12b in revenue and the stock hit an all time high of \\~$27. With the good press TXU received by absorbing the costs of energy during the crisis, their image amongst these newcomers is great.\n\n# Short squeeze potential\n\nThis company is not a meme and has very low short float. There will be no squeeze, the big brain balloon will carry VST to the top of the atmosphere at a steady pace but it will not enter orbit. \n\n# Bear Case\n\nWhile Vistra is one of the leading energy providers in Texas, and will continue to be in the near future, Vistra is not pivoting to clean energy as quickly as it could be. With political forces pushing towards net 0 emissions, Vistra could find itself in hot water. The company currently has a plan to push for 18% of it\u2019s energy to become renewable by 2030 but as of 2020 only 0.3% of the energy produced by Vistra is renewable. With 9% of their total energy produced by uranium, \\~9.3% of energy produced by Vistra in 2020 was \u201cclean\u201d energy.\n\n# Fundamental graph analysis\n\nA strong fundamental analysis of VST stock clearly shows the big brain balloon bringing to stock back up to $24. Those who sold after the small brain slide are funding the big brain balloon passenger tickets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fr40azojy371.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc25d98c4d611ccd89befddb6bfa178db7ea6a01\n\n# TLDR\n\nIt was cold in Texas. Vistra took a financial hit because energy costs rose but it kept the price low for customers. The market reacted with a huge sell off. Insider bought lots of shares after the sell off. Insiders are riding the big brain balloon to the top of the atmosphere when Vistra recovers.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf88\u2601\ufe0f \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf88\u2601\ufe0f \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf88\u2601\ufe0f\n\n# Position\n\nI own 500 shares of Vistra @ 16.43.

I only use technicals to determine entry and exit points once the fundamental analysis is complete. I don't trade (in and out of positions) because of technicals but use it to maximize my profit probability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First entry point 5\\/18: RSI divergence and volume increase](https://preview.redd.it/6c5vd6oz01471.png?width=2373&format=png&auto=webp&s=61b4d0b2efd13ba4690cae156c4927dde762251b)\n\nLots of volume once the price dips below the IPO public debut of $145. This is a significant pivot point, it's the first time the price dips below $145 after that strong leg up in 2021. It also represents a higher low from that initial dip in the first 5 trading days **and the substantial increase in liquidity** **was bought** \\- lockup had expired so plenty of shares sold from insiders for tax purposes, lock gains, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Second entry: consolidation and breakout from bottom](https://preview.redd.it/veek8ng511471.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eddc663817c3f526ed5b6a4a2139239800ea6db)\n\nSecond entry point: that nice and clean breakout; RSI kept increasing and price consolidated, a round handle on the lows. I expected more resistance at the $145 but it flew past it. If it looks like a bottom, behaves like a bottom and feels like a bottom - it has to be a bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, that's all fun and all but you're here because you want tendies and you can't go back in time and buy calls - bet you'd like that now tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut wait, there's more:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[bullish flag with big volume gap](https://preview.redd.it/4i8g5ec811471.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=28dcc91b7e940b7f97029887511b946fc93e937f)\n\nThere's the magic! A perfect bullish flag with a **big volume gap above $150**. Let's recap: IPO priced at $65 and public debut at $145; price jumps to $175 - $200 range within 20 trading days and stays within that range for 4 months post Q4 earnings and **even as growth stocks sold off** during the trading rotation / inflation scare; $ABNB starts selling off with very little volume (hence the volume gap) 2 weeks before the lock-up period expires; liquidity tsunami at the bottom and increased selling from insiders post-IPO; liquidity is bought and price goes up, then consolidates. \n\nConclusion: there was very little interest in buying from $180 to $130 just before lock-up period expired. So it just took a few smart traders to dump positions 2 weeks before to make a killing. But there is significant buying interest now as the past days clearly show and there won't be volume resistance going up. This is a great setup for a very quick and very profitable rebound. Next leg up can reach $180.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[after-hours trading: someone's in a hurry](https://preview.redd.it/l3znj8la11471.png?width=2389&format=png&auto=webp&s=cabd1cc3f75fb5e4ca1557f971acac889649ba0c)\n\nFor those worried about the virus and lockdowns, don't buy into FUD. Summer is not cancelled. In the EU, almost all the population above 50 is vaccinated and in the US and UK even higher vaccination rates have been achieved. The clear effect: hospitals, deaths, ICUs are not going to get as pressured as they were last year. And that is the main driver for government decision to close up borders and lose the much needed tourism revenue over the summer. It's a great buy the FUD occasion for the hospitality industry in general but even more for $ABNB: no lockdowns = short term stays; some lockdowns = higher long term rentals; complete lockdowns = wfh from the beach. 62% of $ABNB summer nights in NYC booked are for long term stays and 24% of bookings in Q1 were for more than 28 days. It's a win a lot - win a little - win some situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[is that a head and shoulders pattern in US ICU patients?](https://preview.redd.it/vfpjddv631471.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3a7219a25dcd57bf1154e59332bdf5542fda477)\n\nGet rich or die tryin' - $160.000 in calls and shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[heee-yaaah](https://preview.redd.it/u3dsj1rc11471.png?width=2649&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb9bfcb1d0430741ae5c219638f2c6a2534b7bd)", "id": "nv3ebj", "created_utc": 1623156949.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I wish I could understand this shit better \ud83d\ude05", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14438727498054504}, {"body": "Airbnb is my recovery play.

The credit would be subject to phase-out if the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods annually in the United States are determined to be equal to or less than 25 percent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods in the United States for calendar year 2021.*\n* ***Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit****. Section 30C(a) provides a credit of 30 percent of the cost of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year, subject to a credit cap. The key changes in the bill would be to increase the Section 30C credit cap from $30,000 to $200,000, in the case of qualified property that is depreciable property, and to expand the definition of qualifying fuels to consist of hydrogen and any transportation fuel for which the Clean Fuel Production Credit is allowed. (I think this is about new rng fueling stations).*\n\nState regulatory support for RNG may come from the Low Carbon Fuel Standard system \n\n* Overview: [https://www.usgain.com/blog/understanding-the-california-low-carbon-fuel-standard-lcfs/](https://www.usgain.com/blog/understanding-the-california-low-carbon-fuel-standard-lcfs/)\n* Supported by California [https://energynews.us/2021/05/13/california-clean-fuel-standard-sparks-renewable-gas-boom-in-midwest/](https://energynews.us/2021/05/13/california-clean-fuel-standard-sparks-renewable-gas-boom-in-midwest/)\n* That Amazon had supported in Washington State [https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-throws-support-behind-low-carbon-fuel-standard-bill-washington-state/](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-throws-support-behind-low-carbon-fuel-standard-bill-washington-state/)\n* that Washington State indeed approved [https://www.opb.org/article/2021/04/27/washington-joins-oregon-california-british-columbia-in-passing-low-carbon-fuel-standard/](https://www.opb.org/article/2021/04/27/washington-joins-oregon-california-british-columbia-in-passing-low-carbon-fuel-standard/)\n* Many US States will follow [https://thejacobsen.com/news\\_items/states-considering-lcfs/](https://thejacobsen.com/news_items/states-considering-lcfs/)", "id": "nvgvpc", "created_utc": 1623192543.0, "score": 175, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR: buy more \ud83d\udc04\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude80\u2705", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12565715610980988}, {"body": "$CLNE to the moon  \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude80", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09005295485258102}, {"body": "another big catalyst for CLNE!!!
