BEST always promotes green logistics solutions by emphasizing plastic reduction at all aspects, reducing carbon emissions in the transportation, and meeting government\u2019s environmental protection requirements. They do this through green packaging, low-carbon transportation, and smart route planning.\n\nBEST Statistics: \n\nMarket Capitalization: $509.48 Million  \nSales: $48.5 Billion  \nEmployees: 6,927  \nBook/Share: 0.74  \nCash/Share: 0.51  \nForward P/E: 4.30  \nRecommendation: 2.80 Buy-to-hold  \nPrice/Share: 0.10 !!!  \nPrice/Book: 1.73 !!!  \nPrice/Cash: 2.49 !!!  \nShares Outstanding: 245.63 million  \nInstitution Owned: 32.50%  \nInsider Owned: 20.54%  \nShares Float: 52.36 million  \nAverage Volume: 3.09 million  \nShort Float: 25.67%  \nBeta: 0.53\n\n The BEST catalyst: (Cryptocurrency in supply chain financing.)\n\n Traditionally, supply chain financing happens in five steps.\n\n1) First, the buyer (typically a manufacturer or distributor) issues a purchase order to a foreign or domestic supplier. \n\n2) The supplier then ships the goods to the buyer and issues an invoice to the buyer. In a supply chain financing arrangement, the buyer then submits approved invoices to a supply chain finance company for processing.\n\n3) The supplier requests discounted payment of its approved invoices from the supply chain finance company. \n\n4) The supply chain finance company sends the discounted payment to the supplier. \n\n5) The buyer pays the supply chain finance company the amount of the approved invoice on the negotiated maturity date.\n\nHowever this has some drawbacks.\n\nSupply chain financing is available to large global manufacturers and distributors and their suppliers. Middle market buyers and their suppliers haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of the benefits of these programs because they are often too small and not as credit-worthy as larger rated companies.\n\nThis method of financing requires the negotiation of a confirmed payment amount between buyer and supplier up front and limits deductions, setoffs, counterclaims against billed invoices that typically occur in trade transactions. However, these constraints must be weighed against longer payment terms by the buyer and quicker receipt of payment by the supplier.\n\nCryptocurrency and digital asset payment will disrupt all of this. Payments will be immediate with smart contracts. This will remove all the inefficiencies of the old financing system. This lesson became evident during the pandemic when supply chains where strained. \n\nThe problem with Memestocks:\n\n Memestocks suffer from survivor bias. For every one person you see post massive gains, there are ten other people that suffered small losses. You never hear from the losers because of embarrasment. People don't like to show their losses or hide their gains. Once a stock has been \"Meme'd\", hedge funs will start buying the stock to increase the price which attracts more investors to the stock. Once the price has been sufficiently inflated, they can simply take their time and short it, bleeding money away from retail investors. Hedge funds always come out the winner. \n\nThis play is the BEST because it is a pure fundamentals play in an disruptive technology industry.", "id": "o4tbe1", "created_utc": 1624276293.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
