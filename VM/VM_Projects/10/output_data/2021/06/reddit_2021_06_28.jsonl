{"title": "$BA \u2014 Citing a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity, FAA slows Boeing 777X certification", "selftext": "https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/citing-a-serious-flight-test-incident-and-lack-of-design-maturity-faa-slows-boeing-777x-certification/\n\nIn yet another blow to Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration last month formally denied the jet maker permission to move forward with a key step in certifying its forthcoming giant widebody airplane, the 777X.\n\nIn a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023.\n\nThat could push the jet\u2019s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned.\n\nThe FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an \u201cuncommanded pitch event\u201d \u2014 meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots.\n\nBoeing has yet to satisfy the FAA that it has fully understood and corrected what went wrong that day.\n\nThe letter was signed by Ian Won, the manager of the local FAA office that judges whether Boeing has met all regulatory standards. He also told Boeing that a critical avionics system proposed for the airplane does not meet requirements.\n\nAnd he expressed concern about proposed modifications involving late changes to both software and hardware in the electronics of the jet\u2019s flight controls.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft is not yet ready,\u201d Won wrote. \u201cThe technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.\u201d\n\nAn FAA official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said the drag on 777X certification is now \u201cthe subject of a lot of attention\u201d at high levels both within the agency and at Boeing.\n\nBoeing\u2019s last all-new jet, the 787, had to be grounded in 2013 when its batteries smoldered in flight. The next new plane, the derivative 737 MAX, was grounded for 21 months starting in 2019 after flawed new flight controls caused two fatal crashes.\n\nNow the forthcoming 777X is having a troubled certification process. Is this just the FAA getting tough because of all the scrutiny?\n\nThe FAA official said that even if the MAX crashes hadn\u2019t happened, the list of serious issues now raised about the 777X would merit rigorous regulatory attention.\n\nWithin the FAA, the person said, \u201cthere\u2019s a general feeling that Boeing has kind of lost a step,\u201d referring to the slide away from a historic reputation for engineering prowess.\n\nAnd because of all the missteps, the official added, \u201cthe days of Boeing being able to say to the FAA \u2018Just trust us\u2019 are long gone.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Friday, Boeing said it \u201cremains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development.\u201d\n\nThe airplane is undergoing \u201ca comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety and reliability \u2026 to ensure we meet all applicable requirements,\u201d Boeing added.\n\nThe FAA in a statement said safety drives its decisions and timelines.\n\n\u201cThe FAA will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards,\u201d the agency said.\n\nFAA exasperated\n\nBoeing launched the 777X at the Dubai Air Show in the fall of 2013, and at that time targeted 2020 as the year it would enter service.\n\nSet to replace the Boeing 747 jumbo and Airbus A380 superjumbo passenger planes \u2014 which are no longer built \u2014 as the largest airliner in production, the 777X is a stretch version of the successful 777 passenger airliner featuring a new, superlong, carbon composite wing with folding tips and the largest jet engines ever built.\n\nBoeing invested more than $1 billion in a new composites fabrication plant in Everett to build the wings.\n\nInside the main Everett assembly building, Boeing also installed state-of-the-art, automated stations to robotically assemble the wings \u2014 equipment designed by Mukilteo-based engineering company Electroimpact \u2014 and completely changed the way the 777 fuselage and wings come together to make assembly more flexible and efficient.\n\nThe first of two 777X models and the largest \u2014 the 777-9X, which carries 426 passengers in a two-class configuration \u2014 made its first flight in January 2020, kicking off the test flight program.\n\nBy now, four test planes are flying out of Boeing Field and at least 17 more 777Xs destined for customers Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and All Nippon Airways have rolled out of the factory.\n\nBoeing will have to park those production aircraft and any more built from now through at least late 2023 until certification allows their delivery.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s letter on the status of 777X certification is addressed to Tom Galantowicz, the head of Boeing\u2019s internal organization consisting of engineers and managers who act as proxies for the federal agency, tasked with testing and verifying that a new airplane design meets safety standards.\n\nThe letter denies Boeing a specific approval for the 777-9X called \u201cType Inspection Authorization\u201d readiness. Without this, Boeing cannot put FAA personnel on board flight tests and begin to collect certification data.\n\nThe wording suggests a degree of exasperation with Boeing pushing for TIA when the FAA deems it far from ready.\n\n\u201cThe FAA and Boeing have been discussing the TIA readiness of the Boeing Model 777-9 in numerous meetings over the past nine months,\u201d the letter reads, adding that despite Boeing\u2019s assertion that proceeding with TIA \u201cwarrants consideration,\u201d the FAA in contrast \u201cconsiders that the aircraft is not yet ready.\u201d\n\nThe letter then lists a host of shortfalls in Boeing\u2019s readiness.\n\nFAA demands data, not promises\n\nAsked about the test flight that experienced the \u201cuncommanded pitch event\u201d in December, Boeing said the plane went on to land safely and that engineers investigated the root cause and have developed a major software update to fix the problem.\n\nIn the meantime, until that\u2019s approved, Boeing has given the test pilots instructions on how to avoid the incident recurring so that test flights can continue.\n\nYet the FAA clearly isn\u2019t satisfied with Boeing\u2019s promise of a software fix.\n\n\u201cAfter the uncommanded pitch event, the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cSoftware load dates are continuously sliding and the FAA needs better visibility into the causes of the delays,\u201d it states.\n\nTo confirm \u201cthe maturity and safety/airworthiness of the aircraft,\u201d the FAA demands comprehensive and documented reviews of the changes resulting from the investigation into the incident, to ensure that a similar problem \u201cwill not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.\u201d\n\nThe FAA separately highlights concern over a critical piece of new avionics on the jet \u2014 the Common Core System, a set of shared computing resources critical to the functioning of multiple airplane systems.\n\nWon notes that Galantowicz conceded in a letter to the FAA earlier in May that the CCS has incomplete software and does not meet TIA requirements.\n\nCiting a \u201clack of data\u201d and the absence of a Preliminary Safety Assessment for the FAA to review, the agency\u2019s letter declares that Boeing hasn\u2019t even met its own process requirements.\n\nBoeing\u2019s CCS \u201creview dates have continuously slid over a year,\u201d the letter notes.\n\nIn turning down the 777X for TIA readiness, the FAA also cited a finding that the supplier of the avionics provided \u201cinadequate peer review\u201d in a safety analysis \u201cresulting in inconsistencies \u2026 and incorrect reuse of 787 data.\u201d\n\nGE Aviation\u2019s plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, supplies the CCS, which builds upon the similar common core avionics system it designed for the 787.\n\nGE, which touts the CCS as the \u201ccentral nervous system and brain\u201d of the airplane, deferred comment to Boeing.\n\nDemand for 777X currently near zero\n\nAnother problem for the FAA is Boeing\u2019s proposal of late changes to the 777X flight control system.\n\n\u201cBoeing is proposing modifications that will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator controls electronics of the Flight Control System,\u201d the FAA states. \u201cBoeing needs to ensure the changes do not introduce new, inadvertent failures modes.\u201d\n\nOther pending modifications to the design of systems around the jet\u2019s horizontal tail or stabilizer, which controls the pitch of the airplane, will change the crew alerts that flag certain system failures.\n\n\u201cDesign maturity is in question as design changes are ongoing and potentially significant,\u201d the letter states.\n\nSeparately, the letter states in passing that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also \u201cnot yet agreed on a way forward\u201d with regard to 777X certification.\n\nIn an emailed response Friday, EASA spokesperson Janet Northcote said the agency is \u201ccooperating closely with the FAA\u201d on 777X certification.\n\n\u201cWe are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s letter told Boeing that because of the gaps in the 777X technical data, it anticipates a significant increase in the required level of testing and analysis, \u201cand the potential to increase the number of certification flight tests that will need to take place.\u201d\n\nThe letter concludes by requesting that Galantowicz\u2019s unit \u201cclose these gaps\u201d before submitting any further requests for TIA approval and that \u201cbased on the information from Boeing,\u201d 777X certification is realistically more than two years out, in \u201cmid to late 2023.\u201d\n\nIronically, the only positive for Boeing in this situation is that \u2014 because of the pandemic\u2019s destruction of international air travel demand \u2014 no airline in the world wants a 777X right now.\n\nWhen international travel begins to pick up again post-pandemic, airlines will begin service with smaller jets like Boeing\u2019s long-range 787 until long-haul air travel gradually returns to a level approaching what was typical in 2019.\n\nYet at a Bernstein Research industry conference this month, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun doubled down on the 777X despite all the setbacks. Once the jet is certified, he said, \u201cit will have a 40- or 50-year run, and I think it will be one of the great runs of all time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have lots of confidence in it,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWe love it.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s website lists 320 orders for the 777X, though because of the delays airline customers will have the option to cancel some of those and may switch to smaller Boeing jets.\n\nDubai-based Emirates, the largest 777X customer, reduced its initial order for 150 aircraft to 115, swapping out 35 of the 777Xs for 30 much less expensive 787s.\n\nThe original 777 flight test program in the mid 1990s, from first flight to certification, took 10 months. For the 737 MAX, that period was just over 13 months. During the problem-ridden and much delayed development of the 787, first flight to certification took just over 20 months.\n\nThe 777X is currently set to reach certification almost four years after first flight.\n\nCiting the delays in getting the plane certified, Emirates airline President Tim Clark has said he doesn\u2019t expect any 777X deliveries until 2024.\n\nRealistically, that\u2019s the earliest any global carrier might want to take delivery of such a huge aircraft.

There are not many things that Americans enjoy more than these 3 items; however, some say ammo is a close contender. We are currently experiencing an ammo shortage like no other. [People are currently scalping ammo and selling it for 3-4X MARK UP.](https://outsider.com/outdoors/viral/ammo-shortage-scalpers-buying-ammunition-profit-resale-making-issue-worse/) This is insane and we have not had a shortage of ammo like this before. \n\nIf we take a look at the charts of one of the largest gun manufacturers and ammunition providers in the US, Smith & Wesson ($SWBI), you can see their stock price has rose over 60% in the last 10 trading days. This is due to them blowing their earnings expectations out of the water and a share buyback announcement. In the conference call with the higher ups of $SWBI, the CEO himself states the shortage may continue to worsen and he does not believe it will get better anytime soon. \n\nNow here comes the good stuff: Ammo inc., also known as $POWW. This is a relatively new company that was listed on the NASDAQ on December 2020. They have some of the best financials you can hope for. Here is a link to their [investor presentation in April.]( https://ammoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AMMO-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-April-2021.pdf) Going back to the fiscal year of 2018, they are experiencing and projecting a 160.6% CAGR which is amazing. Their guidance for their net sales in 2021 was reported as $58M; however, they have now increased their guidance to $62.2M. For a company to increase their guidance by so much in such a short amount of time, you know good things are cooking. Due to this being the end of fiscal year of 2021 for this company, the addition to their guidance will be portrayed in their next earnings report, which comes out TOMORROW. I am banking on the fact that they will blowout their earnings just like Smith & Wesson. Their net sales, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA are increasing tremendously year over year. They recently acquired a US department of defense contract to manufacture multi-purpose rounds. The company is becoming more and more financially efficient while also being in an extremely high demand area. \n\nIf the earnings are not spectacular tomorrow, then this will still be a good long term hold due to &POWW\u2019s exciting future. They are building a new production facility in Wisconsin that will increase their production capacity by over 100%. This facility will be finished and in production in early 2022.

{"title": "$QDEL is undervalued", "selftext": "First shot at DD so \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3c with me. Not a professional financial expert and this information is not intended to be taken as financial advice. Quidel is a medical diagnostics company with the aim to democratize testing. The company has been profitable for multiple years. Sales and revenue prior to the pandemic were strong and continually improving. \n\nThe company was able to create a very good rapid Covid test utilizing its propietary and relatively affordable analyzer. This allowed them to grow exponentially in 2020 with revenue in excess of 1.6B dollars. Currently the stock is trading around 125$ but went as low as low 100s and during covid surge as high as 250$. The reason for the volatility is the relatively small float volume of 42.6 million shares and the decrease in covid cases with wide vaccination efforts. The current stock price gives the company a market cap of 5.2 billion. \n\nIf you have followed the company you will know it most recently released an over the counter rapid covid test that they sell in retail pharmacies and online retailers such as Amazon. In addition to their professional testing segment which has huge potential for growth, the companies future growth I think lies in its  attempt to sell directly to the consumer diagnostic tests that previously needed a physician to order and a lab to process. \n\nThis democratization of medical testing can be compared to the adoption of OTC pregnency tests. The market is huge and will be compatible with an ever increasing push for digitalized primary care medicine. Short term there is an adjustment for loss of revenue from decreased covid testing in a hospital or clinical setting. \n\nLong-term, the company is undervalued imo. This stems from its potential to shake up and advance medical diagnostics tests for direct consumer purchasing. We will likely see OTC flu tests and whichever other testing there is a market for. My position is long with 68 shares. Company also has short interest at 13.40% or around 5m shares as of 6/15.

{"title": "PSFE, Wyckoff Schematic, and the Great Tendie Heist", "selftext": "Howdy Apes,\n\nLongtime PSFE (bag) holder here with a bit of TA I think you might be interested in. For one, I know you all like rockets and tendies, and I also know how much you dislike \u2018tutes hoarding those things to themselves. This will be discussed at length\u2014all thanks to a little schematic posited by one of the OG apes, Richard Wyckoff.\n\nFurther, anyone else sort of think that Paysafe pump on Friday out of nowhere was a little odd? Yea, me too, and I\u2019m a big PSFE bull (I sincerely really like the stonk and have for months). That will be discussed too.\n\nMy position: 2007 shares @$15.21. (Yep, lol). This is not intended as a pump or rescue mission. I\u2019m content on my asteroid for the longterm. Still, I think you might be interested in this.\n\n**A Little Background:** I, like every OG PSFE holder, had been pretty confused by the price action on this stock. Sure, the idea that a stock that you believe in and which seems like an obvious buy can be pummeled and overlooked by the market for a long time isn\u2019t at all unheard of. We all know that feeling. It was entirely possible that I had just paid too much early and would be in it for the long haul\u2014which was the plan anyway.\n\nHowever, I couldn\u2019t deny the maddening nature of some of the price action on this stock over the past few months, especially post-earnings. I had never seen such a seemingly inoffensive value stock (with growth potential) so strategically targeted by shorts any time a bullish reversal signal would appear. We knew it was shorts because a) the sheer capital it would take to bid hunt, and throw up cent for cent sell walls by the thousand at any pivot point on a stock with a relatively large float disqualified retail traders; and b) we could see it in the ever increasing short interest being reported.\n\nWhat made it more interesting were the signals that we had a highly professional short that knew the exact price points that would lead to a reversal confirmation and yet would always seem to go right back on the defensive as soon as the price was pinned again. They never seemed to want to all out tank us. This seemed counterintuitive and led to a whole lot of conspiratorial thinking by folks\u2014myself included. Remember, I was the guy who posted about the buyout theory a while back based on this short activity and on the (valuable) discovery of Blackstone\u2019s securing of a controlling stake with their additional share purchase.\n\nIn any case, I kept trying to wrap my head around it while continuously hearing the word \u201caccumulation\u201d tossed around. I could accept that in a passive way, until last Wed. and Thu. (6/23 and 6/24). Watching our volume shoot up, inflow drastically outpace outflow, and yet trading within a few cent range\u2014textbook signs of accumulation. That\u2019s when I knew I needed to dig deeper, and it also when I stumbled upon the Wyckoff schematic. This changed everything about the way I look at this chart.\n\n**Wyckoff, a brief history:** I will stick to what I consider the pertinent points of this method in relation to PSFE, but I would highly encourage you to do your own DD on the various facets of this method (the three laws, P&F charting, the composite man, etc) and its history. It\u2019s fascinating.\n\nSuffice it to say though, this method was created by Richard Wyckoff in the 1930\u2019s as a way of conceptualizing market trends in terms of periods of accumulation followed by a mark up, and distribution followed by markdown. Accumulation occurs when a price is consolidating (typically following a downtrend) and big fish are gradually purchasing shares within the channel in a way that is inconspicuous and allows for some level of cost control. If they were to just buy it all outright, the stock price would go up, likely attracting attention and forcing them to load at higher prices. Distribution is the same in reverse. Simple enough? Again, most of this is built on the basic laws of supply and demand, cause and effect, and effort vs result. It\u2019s worth digging deeper on you\u2019re own\n\n**The Point:** What makes it far more amazing though is that Wyckoff actually developed a specific schematic that these periods follow. This is where my mind got blown and Paysafe\u2019s chart suddenly lit up for me (imagine Russell Crow in A Beautiful Mind, but much stupider)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9h5b5qioq1871.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d833db9a54db5646da949ad0c84220f1bd6c60\n\nNotice anything specific about this schematic in relation to Paysafe\u2019s chart? Here, I\u2019ll help:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h4on23apq1871.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca1f81b60f6eab0d91592818cb5026e52f147b65\n\n**Phase A:** The (accumulation) schematic always begins with what\u2019s called a selling climax\u2014the full court press that drives the price down at a rapid rate, clenching bull asses everywhere. Once that selling pressure dissipates, in comes the Automatic Rally (AR)\u2014which is bulls taking full control and giving us a V shaped recovery back up. The bottom has now been established by sellers and the churning begins. Now look again at PSFE\u2019s chart on Earning\u2019s Day.\n\n**Phase B:** Following the AR, we\u2019ve now established the rough channel within which whales intend to load up and hope all the while that all those clenched retail bulls will bail and sell their shares for cheap. This is the game. Hallmarks of the Wyckoff schematic include: notoriously untrustworthy bullish patterns, false breakouts, and FUD. Sound familiar? They want you to sell your shares and think your stock is dead money. That way they can load up in peace without a bunch of pesky bulls (or dare I say, apes) getting all FOMO/YOLO happy and disrupting their feeding frenzy. Phase B typically includes a wave or two of sheer psychological torture, which may or may not include false breakouts above or below the bounds of that accumulation channel. Remember, they\u2019re loading up at the bottom of those waves with all the tear soaked shares of broken retail holders. Look again at Paysafe\u2019s charts on 6/23 and 6/24\u2014huge volume on the buy side, no price movement. If you had watched level 2 data you would have seen how coincidentally the bid blocks mirrored the ask blocks with the buy side just being slightly larger each time. Phase B has the potential to be the longest phase and is mostly dependent on how long institutions need to load up, but then comes phase C.\n\n**Phase C:** Okay, the institutions have now loaded up their lion\u2019s share of the rocket so what do they do? Well, Phase C tends to be the least consistent as far the schematic goes. In Wyckoff\u2019s model, the institutions are especially sadistic and decide to go for one last bid raid, driving the price way down once again, shredding every last paper hand and setting up the real launchpad (\u201cThe spring\u201d). This is the real reversal, and the truest test of diamond hands. That being said, the spring doesn\u2019t always happen. Sometimes C can look a bit more like a small subset of D, maybe with a test somewhere in the middle of the channel. Sometimes not. The point is, things are turning around and \u2018tutes are ready for their tendies\u2014or should I say, YOUR tendies if you sold.\n\n**Phase D:** And herein lies the final test. Phase D carries us out of the accumulation channel and leaves bulls with one final test\u2014the Sign of Strength. Here we begin to see bullish signals like flags, pennants, etc. and basically what\u2019s happening is the top of the channel begins to be tested for support. If bulls succeed and there isn\u2019t more opportunity for whales to go down and keep right on loading, so begins the markup phase.\n\n**Phase E:** Now the game has changed and it\u2019s time to ride the rocket up until whales decide they either want to take their sweet stolen profits (distribution) or we pause for another fuel up. They will do whatever they can to get every last one of us on board and touch the farthest reaches of the galaxy.\n\n**Here\u2019s the interesting point that inspired me to write this up today:** Take a good hard look at the timing on PSFE\u2019s chart. Notice anything interesting about the price action on Friday into today? Coming out of the base of an accumulation channel after a B wave, we suddenly have PSFE popping up all over WSB. Look, I\u2019ve been in this thing for months, I\u2019m holding long because I believe in it and would love for it to get all the attention it can.\n\nHowever, even the apes on WSB were commenting on how \u201cout of nowhere\u201d the pump came from\u2014many of the posts from new accounts. It was bizarre. Exciting, but bizarre, and that\u2019s coming from someone who wants for this to pump (and not dump). Now look at the price action today in regards to the Wyckoff structure. Sure looks an awful lot like a sign of strength right in the correct position and a big fat bull flag to boot. EDIT: the abbreviation on the sign is getting autobanned, so that's why I keep typing it out, lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15mmq5trq1871.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d1ac0c2f50fc8fb7b8907d9fd4a81e4d3861f9a\n\nInitially, I would have said that we are premature on this sign of strength. We were most likely due for another B wave, and maybe we are. However, I can\u2019t help but ignore that timing within the structure and the fundamental psychology behind the markup (PUMP!). Again, this is just one possible read within the schematic, and I'd be interested to hear other reads on it too. I'm no expert.\n\nTherefore, I guess the point I\u2019m trying to make here is, we have been operating within an age old structure for accumulation which has certainly given me some solace on this stock. We already knew whales were loading up and now we have technical evidence to prove it. However, somebody is ready for this thing to move\u2014whether that\u2019s apes, the \u2018tutes that had been loading, or somebody who wants to spoil it for them. Hold tough, bulls. The rocket has been fueling up for awhile. They just hoped you were going to bail before take off.\n\n**TL;DR:** Institutions were hoping you weren\u2019t going to catch them buying up all the seats on the PSFE rocket these last few months. They\u2019ve been buying them up dirt cheap. You want them to take her back down and buy the rest? or do you think Planet Paysafe, rich in bountiful tendies, has room for us too?

{"title": "WHY IM SO BULLISH ON $VUZI$", "selftext": "\nAlright ladies and retards, listen up. Some of you have already seen u/Velociraptorsss DD on VUZI a few days ago and I have to say I completely agree with him. After doing my own research, I am extremely bullish on this company. Not just because Aunt Cathie bought a bunch but for the reasons listed below:\n\nFINANCIALS-\n\nThe smart eyeglass industry is at it's beginning stages and VUZI is considered to be the front runner already. Other competitors are virtually not even close and we have seen VUZI's YOY growth grow from 2Q FY 2020 of 2.92% to 1Q FY 2021 of 104.5%. Any company growing this fast deserves to be looked at. Although the Gross Profit YOY is still sitting at (167%) in Q1 of 2021 it is trending in the right direction up from (337%) in Q1 of 2020. Operating income has stayed relatively sideways at (20.3)m which is to be expected from any future tech company trying to expand. In 2020 VUZI's sales grew 177% YOY and in 2021 Q1 should be around 49% YOY.\n\nSHARE PRICE AND OFFERING-\n\nThey're sitting on approximately 150 million in cash which I suspect will be used for strategic acquisitions in the AI space. Not to mention they have next to no debt, and the CEO said in a recent interview that they will not be completing any more offerings as they don't need any more cash as of right now. This is always a good thing because in a small growth company their prices are often volatile. To know management won't complete any offerings is a good sign as momentum will be killed in any large price fluctuations. It is also important to note that the offering was done at $20.50 which usually acts as a price floor and VUZI is currently trading at $18.25 at the time of this post. Cathie Wood has been buying the \"dip\" so to speak as the share price this year went from $2 - $30 and now back to $15-18 ish. VUZI currently sits in a few different ARK funds as we all know because Cathie is bullish on AI. There are currently 63.07m shares outstanding of which 7% are held by insiders and 35% are held by large institutions. These are both solid numbers and both insiders/institutions have not been selling their stakes recently.\n\nSHORT INTEREST/RATIO\n\nCurrently the short interest is sitting at 19.42% and the short ratio is at about 2.75. This represents approximately 10.07 million shares short as of May 14th or 18.07% on short shares outstanding as of June 15th. I believe this is important because as we have seen with MULTIPLE other \"MEME\" stocks with the same or close to the same SI a squeeze is inevitable at some point. 20% isn't absurdly high but definitely enough to get some solid momentum forward and see an upside of at least 70-100%. This being combined with the fact that VUZI is a legitimate company with some solid tech and some solid backing should make for some advantageous returns. My personal PT is $70 before I'd consider taking some profit but I am a longterm holder.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS AND INVESTMENT THESIS-\n\nI look at VUZI as a great growth story who is early to the party. If you look at Apple, in the beginning stages of the smart phone it was tough to forecast just how big Apple would become and here we are. Just last year there were 1.8 BILLION smart phones sold and whose to say smart glasses won't rival this? I am confident in the products VUZI produces such as the M4000, M400 and BLADE glasses. They are all already used and rapidly expanding. Some of these workplaces include, Manufacturing plants, warehouse solutions for amazon esque companies, Tele Medicine ie. surgical procedures and student learning centres, not to mention field services. These products are all utilized in many different countries such as US, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Denmark etc. and are available pretty much everywhere if necessary.\nAlso, if you look at the evolution of the cell phone or computer being morphed into one there has been one obvious transformation. That is they are both becoming smaller and smaller and require less touch and maintenance. The transition to touch-less or touch-free products is now and I believe VUZI's products can make this transition seamlessly. For these reasons I am extremely bullish on Vuzix Corp. and my current position is.\n\n2,000 shares at 18.92$\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "o9r86e", "created_utc": 1624907701.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|230|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw13vn/why_i_n_m_b_is_a_screaming_buy_right_now/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9r86e/why_im_so_bullish_on_vuzi/) \n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2446395456790924}, {"body": "Yep.
