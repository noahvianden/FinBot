{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**\n\nThe wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday\u2019s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed\u2019s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. \n\nYesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nToday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. \n\nHowever, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March\u2019s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   \n\u201cString\u201d of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d The April Job Report bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\nIn addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper \u201cwell before\u201d the interest rate is increased. He said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I\u2019m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near-term. Just my two cents. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Labor Department Released its Weekly Unemployment Report\n   * **Initial jobless claims:** 473,000 vs. 490,000 expected and 507,000 the previous week\n   * **Continuing claims:** 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected and 3.7 million the previous week\n* Cryptocurrencies fell across the board after Elon Musk reversed his stance and said Tesla (TSLA) would no longer be accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment due to concerns over the environmental impact BTC mining is causing. \n* AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc has raised about $428 million from a share sale, capitalizing on the retail-trading driven surge in its stock earlier this year.

Hopefully my comments can help!\n\n1) In terms of low risk/low reward investments, definitely a diversified portfolio is important. Sprinkle in some blue chip stocks, index funds, and ETFs and play the whole market for on average 5-8% return a year. If you want to split your money 70/30 or 80/20 on those low risk investments and more risky growth investments then it can make trading a little more fun if you have the time to do research. If not just put in the money and add on any major dips in the market.\n\n2) Either 500 or 5k is a great investment. Just getting into the market is important and as you can put in more money you can grow your account faster. The low risk investing style takes time though so whatever money you put in just make sure its not money you need at this time.\n\n3) Invest in a diversified portfolio of companies that cover all industries. Wait for stocks to pull back to their daily or weekly moving averages and starting averaging in to positions. Add on the way down as they dip and then hold. Right now or in the next few weeks is a great time to add blue chip stocks once we find a relative bottom.\n\n4) If you are a long term low risk investor find a diversified portfolio and hold for a few months if not longer. You want to add on dips and then profit later. This type of investing takes time. If you are more interested in safer shorter term plays, option spreads are a great way to make money.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3150932490825653}, {"body": "Good advise is always research first, - like you are doing here, and research who you use and buy.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**\n\nThe wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday\u2019s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed\u2019s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. \n\nYesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nToday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. \n\nHowever, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March\u2019s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   \n\u201cString\u201d of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d The April Job Report bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\nIn addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper \u201cwell before\u201d the interest rate is increased. He said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I\u2019m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Labor Department Released its Weekly Unemployment Report\n   * **Initial jobless claims:** 473,000 vs. 490,000 expected and 507,000 the previous week\n   * **Continuing claims:** 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected and 3.7 million the previous week\n* AMC has raised about $428 million from a share sale, capitalizing on the retail-trading driven surge in its stock earlier this year.

{"title": "What's with the media's never-ending shill on CPI data? iNfLaTiOn Is +4.2% yOy, hIgHeSt SiNcE 2008. DUH. Yo2Y makes more sense as I demonstrate here.", "selftext": "Note that I am not a fan of CPI. Inflation was already here a long time ago. So please spare me from using CPI. I am just sick of the media choosing to play easy journalism, in turn, putting so much pressure on ape stocks. BUT, this is a great buying op and here's why.\n\nTLDR: CPI %Change number is COVID-biased. The actual number is not high. Inflation is already priced in.\n\nSince yesterday all the channels have slammed ape stocks with the CPI data saying its YoY number was ATH since 2008. It's not fair to use YoY numbers because COVID messed up the trajectory of the CPI. The YoY 2019-2020 April number barely changed (from 255.548 to 256.389)[ https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/), which created stored energy that MUST be realized once the economy started recovering. The latest number of 267.054 is justified because it put the number back into the previous trajectory. In simple terms, the +4.2% seems huge because April 2020's number was frozen by COVID.\n\nIt's more appropriate to use Yo2Y number in this case (actually, in many other cases too as broader scope = more smoothened/accurate, less squared error). Think of it this way, without COVID, the number would not have been different than what we have now. The number should still be in the range of 264 - 268.\n\nYoY, It's fair to say +4.16% is huge as it has not been this much since 2008 Sep.\n\n[YoY](https://preview.redd.it/q1exbb7s2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6d0ff66f3c9da03fed8f0217ce8431eb057668)\n\nHowever, if we smooth the data with a Yo2Y calculation, an increase of +4.5% over a period of **TWO** years is so common. The average number is +3.8% (this means +3.8% in **TWO** years).\n\n[Yo2Y](https://preview.redd.it/ft5ukqtt2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17854220026ae80337519a3b9c356fa06a1cb3fd)\n\nPlease shut the fuck up about CPI. The use of CPI is retarded, but the way it's being brandished is even more retarded.\n\nIMO, Inflation has already been priced in as, currently, KO has a higher P/E than AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BABA by more than 10%. These are not ape stocks, but my point stands as \"value\" stocks are overpriced than these tech stocks.\n\nIt's important that you know this because stupid journalism is making the price discovery process fucked. Investors flee to safe big cap stocks, making them overvalued. These big cap stocks then use these undeserved overvaluations to:\n\n* afford massive ads budget so that it can shove stupid just-to-be-seen ads in your face. I don't want another Coke or Fanta ads to sell me the same message over and over for decades. It's an absolute waste of time and resource.\n* lobby. Boy oh boy, where do I even start?\n* take over other small companies.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nPeace", "id": "nbjqzf", "created_utc": 1620920949.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "#just buy the dip and stfu", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2484721541404724}, {"body": "That's the beauty of the stock market the truth rarely matters in the short term.

{"title": "Investing 101: For WSB fresh meat", "selftext": "Hello  WSB, You might recognize me as the author of that shitty GME DD (that was taken down for \"hate violations\" rip old wsb) that never came true. Actually, I think there still may be truth to the post. Maybe HF's are hiding SI, maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what \"writing a put\" means?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long/Short Portfolio\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is Long/Short? The premise of a long/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long/short combination is SPY/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo give an example of how I use the SPY/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This \"reaction\" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\\* Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix.\n\n\\*Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50/50 vix spy split will not be profitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many ways to set up a long/short portfolio. SPY/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long/short backbone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would\n\nargue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long/short, use SPY/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first.  This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with.

{"title": "V2G, a Long-term EV Energy Infrastructure Play", "selftext": "# About the Grid and V2G\n\nLike any other commodity, the price of electricity constantly fluctuates in accordance with supply and demand. However, unlike most commodities, electricity is not cheaply storable. This causes a huge inefficiency for electricity providers because they must develop enough power plants to meet peak power demand. Building new power plants is incredibly capital intensive and a poor use of capital if those plants are only needed for a few hours per day, week, or month during high load events. Instead, utilities are incentivized to \"flatten the curve\" of electricity demand and keep their capital investment in new power plants low. Historically, prices to consumers have been fixed with time of day fluctuations built into the calculation, but smart meters and deregulation have led to more states offering real-time pricing. [source](https://extension.psu.edu/real-time-pricing-for-electricity). This creates opportunity.\n\nIt's a load balancing problem. Power plants can supply all the necessary power if demand is spread uniformly, but when everyone wants that power from 4PM-8PM on a hot summer day, it's a problem and black-outs occur.\n\nEnter V2G. Why let any asset sit idle when it could be making you money? Rather than turning your EV into a robo-taxi when you're not using it, here's a simpler idea: leverage the most valuable component of the EV, the battery. Grid operators will pay to rent your energy storage and use your car's battery as a \"virtual power plant\" to meet peak demand.\n\n# The future of the grid\n\nGreen energy like solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity generation in most parts of the world ([Bloomberg 2019 Energy Outlook](https://www.enelgreenpower.com/media/news/2019/07/bloomberg-new-energy-outlook-2019)). Yet, passive green energy generation varies depending on conditions and cannot respond to greater demand like a traditional power station. Additionally, electricity demand will continue to grow with the population and EV ownership. By 2035, an estimated 50% of ALL cars will be electric ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ninety-percent-of-u-s-cars-must-be-electric-by-2050-to-meet-climate-goals/)). Adding more battery storage to the grid is part of the solution.\n\n# Hurdles\n\n**Plug problems**\n\nThere are 2 dominant fast charging plugs used for EV's: CHADeMO and CCS (adapters between the two are not possible). ~~In North America and Europe, CCS has become and will continue to be the  standard, but it does not yet support bidirectional charging which is projected for 2025 (~~[~~Inside EVs~~](https://insideevs.com/news/342354/charin-ccs-combo-standard-to-offer-v2g-by-2025/)~~).~~ Newest CCS plug supports bidrectional charging. This is mostly a moot point.\n\nCHADeMO does support bidrectional charging and has decent coverage across the globe, but it's dying everywhere outside of Japan. There are a couple mass market CHADeMO vehicles on the market, notably the Nissan Leaf, but it's difficult for people to justify buying V2G equipment right now because changing from a CHADeMO to CCS vehicle would render the V2G equipment useless.\n\nTesla. In the US, Tesla uses a proprietary plug for fast-charging instead of the CCS standard they have shifted towards in most other markets. Tesla is the single largest EV maker, so their proprietary plug poses problems for a V2G future. Tesla would need to be willing to enable bidirectional charging on their fleet and potentially canabilize their Powerwall business.\n\n**Battery degradation.**\n\nAll studies I've seen suggest this is minimal ([source](https://youtu.be/QKg_GWDogFc?t=420)). Advancing technology in accordance with Wright's law ([source](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-fall/)) should bring larger, cheaper, more resilient batteries, so long-term, I do not expect this to be an issue.\n\n**Battery capacity and user error**\n\nLet's say you're a 9-5 wage slave. You plug in your vehicle at 5:30 and it starts powering your house to offset peak power prices. But, a couple hours later you decide you want to go out only to discover your vehicle has lost 10+ kWH powering your house. Obviously, this defeats the purpose of such a system. There are 2 solutions to this.\n\n1. Press a button on the V2G equipment that will keep your car charging instead of discharging on days when you may go out.\n2. Get a car with a large enough battery that it practically has no effect. If your car doubles as a home battery backup, it makes sense to spend the extra money on this and benefit from the greater range. It's beautiful - wait for it - synergy.\n\n**Regulation**\n\nBack in 2016, Tesla's chief technology office said battery degradation and regulation were the 2 largest risks ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzAPyk8Wbhk&t=219s)). I don't disagree about regulation. This is where V2H makes a lot of sense. Getting permission from numerous different regulatory agencies sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nIt's feasible because it's essentially the same scenario as someone with solar panels that feed back into the grid. Yet, we still see nightmare cases like Bill Maher who waited over 1,000 days to get regulatory approval for solar panels.\n\nFortunately, V2H is plenty profitable and should require less regulation since you would not feed power back into the grid. I plugged in my own home energy usage and found I could decrease my \"capacity charge\" on my electric bill from $50/month to $0/month if my vehicle powers my house everyday from 4-6 PM during typical peak demand and then recharge late at night using practically free electricity.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAt present, EV buyers are generally wealthier and more educated. So, they are likely to adopt V2G/V2H because the math works out. It's a low risk investment with consistent returns via savings on energy bills. The only issue? There's no V2G product available on the US market, yet. You want to extract as much value from a depreciating asset like a vehicle as fast as possible because advancing technology makes your vehicle more obsolete everyday. If battery degradation is minimal, as evidence suggests, then it's only logical to enroll your vehicle into V2G and extract maximum value from it with minimal inconvenience.\n\nCHADeMO vehicles have served as the guinea pigs. They have shown the feasibility of V2G. Utilities have partnered with private companies even with residential customers ([residential experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h9EecmLatY&)). Now, it's a matter of waiting for CCS to achieve bidirectional charging, waiting for enough vehicles to proliferate, and then the V2G payday will come.\n\nPositions: 1000 @ $7.7 Nuvve (pronounced new-vee) bag holder\n\nEdit: Fixed CCS info", "id": "nbnzzs", "created_utc": 1620931458.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "University of Delaware (part owner) contributes language that\u2019s incorporated into Federal policy.

{"title": "$DGX suddenly a PRIME Short Squeeze candidate DD", "selftext": "Congrats to those who have made some tendies following my previous $DGX DDs series over the past 3 months (see post history). Although the returns have already been excellent, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.\n\n* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective (**not** to disparage these plays), Days to Cover is below 1 for both GME and AMC.\n* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.\n* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:\n   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.\n      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.\n   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.\n\n**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = \"Retail\" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.\n\n**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can rocket. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's too large to simply be a hedge. See DDs for non short interest related analysis.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice.
