Recently however for various reasons (Covid, stimulus, etc.) I'm sitting on a lot of extra cash.  I already put a lot in series I bonds (inflation-protected), but I think I can do better than that and want to invest a good bit in taxable account as well.  For now I don't need the money, and I've got my 1st tier (cash) and 2nd tier (savings bonds) emergency funds set already.  But looking at a 3-5 year time horizon there's a lot of uncertainty for me right now and I may have some big purchases (major home renovations, back to school, new car, etc.)   Again, though, I don't just want to sit on cash or savings bonds and miss out on gains.\n\nRight now my taxable account has 50% index funds (VTI and VXUS).  These are great long-term plays but I'm worried about having total market exposure in the event that I need to pull out equity at some point.  The absolute worst thing that could happen would be for markets to drop 30% right when I need to access that cash.\n\nThus I'm considering creating a fully defensive portfolio for the meantime, collecting dividends with some hopes for modest capital appreciation.  I have 9 stocks that I already own or that are on my watchlist.  My question is that if this will provide enough diversification for the short-to-mid term.  If you're interested, here they are:\n\n1. MSFT\n2. AAPL (these two are not for dividends, I just think they're solid companies worth holding in any portfolio)\n3. BTI\n4. IMBBY\n5. PM\n6. MO\n7. UVV (3-7 are tobacco companies)\n8. KO\n9.

That said, I am concerned that some unforeseen event could wipe out 10%+ of my portfolio.

But I think that's missing the point: these corporations are walking on thin ice, with over a decade of spectacular success generating substantial financial wealth to their high level employees, all while a lot of other folks in the country did not do well at all.\n\nThis is from Schiller's \"Irrational Exuberance\":\n\n>\"The premise of the 'community of interest' theory of stock prices turned out to be wrong; those who expressed high optimism for stocks on this basis were not thinking of all that could go wrong.\"\n\n>\"People were not considering the possibility that society would not tolerate this shift of wealth toward stockholders.\"\n\n>\"Rarely do discussions of the level of the stock market consider the possibility of government reaction to the level of profits, even though government policy toward corporations has changed substantially and dramatically over time.\"", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": []}

{"title": "The perfect portfolio anxiety.", "selftext": "***TL;DR*** *- The anxiety that comes with putting a lot of your hard-earned money on the line, especially when you're new to this.  Consider this something of a vent and me sharing my thoughts.  I think it's a good read but hey I'm biased.*\n\nHey guys,\n\nI want to share about one of the emotional issues of investing that I'm sure many of you can relate to, even if it's not talked about much around here.  I wasn't sure about sharing this, but I figured I would because I think it's important, important for me, and like I said, I imagine for others, too, even if we don't usually talk about it.\n\nI've been investing in a Roth IRA for a few years now, but this February marked my first foray into more extensive investing.  I was sitting on a lot of cash thanks to stimulus, less consumption thanks to Covid, and other reasons, and decided now was the time to put it to work.  I got into individual stocks because of GME.  Sometimes I'm kind of ashamed to say it, because there seems to be a negative stigma attached to that, and you know what? I understand why: the meme stock thing can be anywhere from facepalm to totally cringeworthy.  I share that opinion in some ways.  But at the same time I think that moment brought a lot of young folks into the market who actually have taken the time to learn about it and get serious, and I think that's wonderful.\n\nFebruary 2021 was a bad time for a lot of us to get into the market, because a lot of us tried chasing performance in things like ARK funds.  I understand a lot of people got nailed.  Luckily, I was cautious about getting in tech after such a crazy bull run, and I started out quite defensively.  I haven't lost money yet.  I'm slightly up.\n\nBut man, I've rebalanced... twice now.  I mean, the initial portfolio, then a complete overhaul, followed by another complete overhaul today. There's been innumerable minor tweaks and adjustments along the way, too.  In theory, my allocations have gotten better as I've gone along.  My second portfolio definitely made more sense than my first, but after this last readjustment I'm left thinking \"what the hell did I even bother to change for?\"   What I have now isn't bad, I think, but I'm not sure it's really better than what I had before.  It might even be worse.  I'll have to chew it over a bit.\n\nThat's the thing.  Honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I could just make a rule \"alright, what's done is done\", but that's not the best idea, either.  Sometimes things do change.  Sometimes there are better plays.  We learn and what not.  So I don't feel comfortable making a rule about not making any changes, and if I did make a rule, I'd probably break it anyway.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore.  Totally clueless.  Go back to the old allocation?  Keep things as they are?  Wait and see?  I'm leaning towards wait and see.  Just get this stuff of my chest.  Ride the market a little more and keep an open mind.\n\nIt's the uncertainty that kills me, man.  Can I afford to bet a good portion of my money on the entire market (ie: VTI?)  Would it be better to hold cash right now?  What about inflation?  How about individual stocks? What if my pick underperforms or goes bankrupt?  There's always black swan events.  And what about my future?  Where will I be in 10 years?  I wish I had all the answers, but I don't.  Nobody knows.  And that can be frustrating.\n\nOne last note.  I know people are going to say \"just do index funds and be done with it\".   I already do them - that's all I have in my Roth IRA.  They're a wonderful idea; I get why people love them.  That said, the portfolio I'm talking about here is in a taxable account and it's money I may need in the mid-term.  I'm young, and my future is uncertain.  I don't know if I'm going to need to buy a house soon, or a car, or go back to school.  I have a job but the pay isn't anything to write home about, and it's not necessarily something that I'll be able to do until I retire.  I think a lot of young people can relate.\n\nYes, I've got my 6-12 months in cash, and I've even got a tier 2 savings fund in series I bonds (inflation protected, check 'em out).  But still.\n\nI don't want to just sit on cash, especially since cash sucks right now.  I want to put that extra money to work, and make some returns, even if they're modest. But at the same time I don't want my whole portfolio to go crashing down 50% suddenly.  I lost the link, if someone has it please let us know, but there's this great website that shows you how your portfolio (in dollar value, not actual allocations) would have been affected in different crashes (dot com bubble, 2008, etc.)  In 2008 a portfolio would decline over 50%, IIRC, and it would take 5 years and 5 months to recover.   Great, right?  Buy and hold.  Long-term time horizon.\n\nYeah, that's acceptable if you're 30 years old and saving for retirement.  But for me, it's absolutely unacceptable if I need that money to put a down payment on a house in the next 3-5 years.  You see?\n\nI wish people would be a bit more open-minded when it comes to constantly recommending index funds.  Like I said, I think they're a wonderful idea - probably the best for retirement.  But at the same time every case is different, and every market is different.  Totally wonderful to recommend them, but maybe the downvoting and criticism needs to be cut back a bit.  Dialogue would be nice.  Comprehension. Not everyone has the same goals, needs, or time horizons.  We're all learning here, and nobody has the definitive answer for anyone's financial situation, especially not for yours.\n\nAnyway, that's all guys.  Love to hear your thoughts, feelings, and feedback.  All the best and good luck to everyone.", "id": "n7bqw5", "created_utc": 1620429254.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": ">I don't know what to do anymore.

ETFs are usually structured to minimize capital gains. \n\nas a general rule, investing is for money you can leave alone for several years. 5 years is the usual guideline, because ~90% of any 5 year periods have a gain. if you'll need this money in as little as 3 years I would not invest all of it. part of it? sure. but the rest is fine in a CD, savings account. don't obsess over every last dollar needing to aggressively earn more money for you. nothing wrong with a big fat savings account. most people have $1000 or less in the bank. \n\nmight want to look at a low-volatility ETF for the taxable account. they will have a \"beta\" lower than 1. VTI has a beta of about 1, meaning it moves exactly with the market because it IS the market. ARK funds will have beta of about 1.5 to 1.7, or 50-70% more volatile than the market. In contrast, a low-volatility ETF will have a beta of maybe .6 ... so it's LESS volatile than the market, the ups and downs will probably be less intense.  low volatility will be less prone to sharp drops in a crisis. here's one, for example, look under \"portfolio characteristics\". \n\nhttps://www.ishares.com/us/products/239605/ishares-msci-all-country-world-minimum-volatility-etf", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate your tips!
