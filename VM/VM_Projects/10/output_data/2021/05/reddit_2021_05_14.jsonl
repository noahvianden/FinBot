{"title": "Why are red days redder for Redditors? An analytical perspective!", "selftext": "We have all seen it. SPY drops 2% and then there is a barrage of posts and comments about how it\u2019s due to manipulation/next recession/long-overdue correction etc. I wanted to understand what causes such extreme reactions over small drops in SPY. There might be multiple reasons as mentioned in other posts such as inexperienced investors/lesser time in the market/volatile portfolio. While the first two cannot be proven analytically, we can definitely verify the volatile portfolio concept.\n\nFor this, first, we have to understand Beta. Put simply, Beta is the measure of the volatility of a stock in relation to the overall market. If we consider SPY as the benchmark, Beta of SPY would be 1. A high-risk tech company with a Beta of 1.75 would be more volatile than the market. I.e., if SPY returns 10% in one week, the company is expected to return 17.5% (75% more than SPY). But, this works both ways. If SPY drops 10%, the stock will drop 17.5%. Herein lies the problem.\n\nHere is the list of most discussed stocks last month, along with their Beta values.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuicageu63z61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=6487e65e9c213b9a98a533bce2610757a716aa08\n\nAs you can see, almost all of the popular stocks in social media have extreme volatility. For e.g., PLTR has a Beta of 9.6! This means that the stock will drop a whopping 9.6% for every 1% drop in the market.\n\nFor analysis purposes, I am creating an equally distributed portfolio of these 9 stocks (Coinbase is not considered as it has not been trading long enough to calculate Beta). The average Beta of this portfolio is 3.14! This implies that if SPY drops a mere 3% your portfolio would be down 9.3%. This value would be even higher in case you have a portfolio that is skewed towards CLOV or PLTR. What\u2019s ironic here is that GME with its negative Beta can act as a hedge against red days!\n\n**Limitations of the analysis:** One of the major assumptions with the analysis is that people who talk about stocks probably own that stock which might not be the case. Also, this analysis might not hold for future patterns since Beta accounts only for historical data and cannot predict where the market will go. Finally, the data is taken from nasdaq.com (as of 2nd May) and they haven\u2019t exactly disclosed the time period or the benchmark they use for Beta calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAs we can prove from the analysis, we significantly underestimate the overall risk we are taking by adding popular stocks to our portfolio. The phenomenal gains we see on good days can easily be taken away on red days which explains the overreaction. In other words,\n\n*\u201cwhat Beta giveth, Beta taketh away!\u201d*", "id": "nc8fw9", "created_utc": 1620998392.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "Green Day\u2019s are red days for redditors", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04401050880551338}, {"body": "When 100 loses 10% on a red day we are left with 90.

So while the beta of 11.45 reflects the average relationship between the market and PLTR during this period, there were huge discrepancies each month.\n* I agree with the OP that assuming the patterns will continue in the future is tenuous. For the PLTR beta, I have a 95% CI of -362 to 293.. so you probably shouldn't select stocks based on this because it does not give much information as to where the beta might be in the future. Indeed there were only 6 data points in this analysis so there is not much data to generalize from (PLTR went public only 7 months ago and I don't have the most recent month).\n* Regressing \\*daily\\* PLTR returns on the market gives a beta of only .09 and an R\\^2 of 16.7%. So, day to day returns of PLTR was mostly independent of the market.\n\nFor GME, the picture is also a little more complicated:\n\n* In my analysis with monthly returns, GME has a beta of -1.22 with an R\\^2 of 4.7%. Basically the model does not fit at all and the results are confounded by an extreme outlier - January 2021 where GME returned about 1600% while the market was flat. If I use the data up until (but not including) Jan 2021, the beta is positive: 1.02. The negative beta of the whole period is probably reflecting the unwinding of the GME squeeze post-Jan while the market happened to be increasing.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6304086446762085}, {"body": "I was not aware some of the risk factors are that high.

{"title": "Is now the time to buy the dip on PTON?", "selftext": " \n\n* PTON has sold off because of the recent recall on all of the treadmill products\n* There are only 125k Tread+ and a little over 1k Treads\n* PTON claims they will be able to deliver Treads as early as July\n* PTON has more than 2m subscribers meaning Tread and Tread+ users only make up \\~6.4% of connected fitness users\n* Delivery times are back down to pre-pandemic levels (this was the initial cause for concern) \n* Revenue projections remain strong for this year and the recent quarter had better than expected profitability. The latter part is becoming increasingly important with today's market trends. \n* PTON trades at \\~8x sales for a company growing at 140% with a subscription revenue model and strong gross margins. This seems very justifiable. \n* If the average recall costs PTON $6k, and everyone recalled. That would translate to a loss of \\~650m. The stock is down around $10B in value! \n* Revenue for 2021, even with this impairment is expected to be 3x what it was in 2019 and they aren\u2019t seeing a decrease in demand \n* The company is only projecting a <200M hit to their business even once this fiasco is solved. \n* Lastly, the business is experiencing record low churn numbers!\n\nPTON is an ecosystem. Every bike or tread is a trojan horse into your household so you start paying the subscription revenue. PTON has done nothing but grows at higher than 100% for the past 6 years. This is not a pandemic story. This company was vastly successful prior and will be successful after, society puts the pandemic behind them. The recent recall is tragic, but the biggest risk isn\u2019t a loss of revenue or earnings, rather it is consumer sentiment. Foley (CEO) came out and said the way PTON originally acted was a mistake, and he apologized for his initial comments. With that out of the way, and the recall being less of a drag than feared, this stock is now trading at a large discount.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**\n\nStocks continued yesterday\u2019s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed\u2019s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend. \n\nOn Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nYesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. \n\nHowever, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d The April Job Report bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\nIn addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper \u201cwell before\u201d the interest rate is increased. He said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I\u2019m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Labor Department Released its Weekly Unemployment Report\n   * **Initial jobless claims:** 473,000 vs. 490,000 expected and 507,000 the previous week\n   * **Continuing claims:** 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected and 3.7 million the previous week\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) is weighing plans to pump tens of billions of dollars more into cutting-edge chip factories in the U.S. state of Arizona than it had previously disclosed, according to Reuters.

Tmall is Alibaba\u2019s business-to-consumer eCommerce platform, where local Chinese and international businesses sell branded goods to consumers in Greater China.\n* Disney (DIS) notably underperformed the market after the earnings report showed disappointing subscriber growth in Q1 2021\n* AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc has raised about $428 million from a share sale, capitalizing on the retail-trading driven surge in its stock earlier this year. The company said it sold 43 million shares at an average price of $9.94 apiece in the at-the-market offering, sending the stock sharply higher.\n* Executive Chairman of Ford (F) Bill Ford signaled that automaker plans to reinstate the dividend it suspended last year, though he gave no timeline. \"We will do it as soon as possible, but we also want to make sure that when we do it, that we can sustain it.\u201d\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the market session and may not reflect the closing price\\*\\***\n* RedRock Resorts (RRR) target raised by JP Morgan from $47 to $48 at Overweight.

{"title": "Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber Companies", "selftext": "Based on questions I've been getting the last couple weeks, I want to share all the various sources I\u2019ve used to keep myself educated on the industry and get my \u201cfeel\u201d for long term exit strategies.\n\nThis post isn\u2019t about doing EPS or IV projections.  It\u2019s simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity, as well as any major news/opinions out there that could affect the commodity\u2019s future direction.  \n\nI find it **very** helpful, because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit, I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didn\u2019t change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industry\u2019s record profits.  I didn\u2019t panic when futures went red the last few days, because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30% and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine.  So this \u201cmarket feel\u201d research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noise.\n\n**Basic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber Industry**\n\nI think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it, because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have confidence in your investment when the fundamentals are still there.\n\nHere are two excellent podcasts from two industry insiders discussing the current state of the industry:\n\n[Odd Lots Podcast with Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-price-of-lumber-has-soared-day-after-day-after-day/id1056200096?i=1000518629853)\n\n[Building Optimal Podcast with Dustin Jalbert; Fastmarkets RISI Senior Economist; Episode #71]( https://buildingoptimal.com/episodes/)\n\nBoth are great podcasts to help you understand what\u2019s causing the surge from the people that know.  Hint: it\u2019s not due to an industry-wide conspiracy.  This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from it\u2019s high after the summer.\n\n\n**Apparently Social Media Actually has a Positive Use**\n\nI don\u2019t use social media, but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other non-stop about things going on in the cash markets / futures, as well as the occasional opinions.  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts.  So it\u2019s a great way to keep yourself educated.  Also, they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see what\u2019s going on with them any particular day.\n\nIt can be insightful (and calming on red days), especially since normal members of the public can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening in the cash markets real time, but sometimes these guys will let you know.  The other day, when all the futures were nose diving, cash markets were still up, meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship (which is a good thing!).\n\n[Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://twitter.com/LumberTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \u2013 The King of Lumber Twitter.  Nice guy and great insights.  Don\u2019t ask him what the price of lumber will be in Q4.  No one fucking knows.  \n\n[RISI Senior Economist Dustin Jalbert](https://twitter.com/2x4caster) \u2013 Also a very prolific poster in Lumber Twitter and will share great insights.\n\n[Forestry Insider Bryan Davis](https://twitter.com/bryandav1z) \u2013 Another knowledgeable insider who likes to share insights on the industry and some of the main lumber stocks.\n\n[Housing expert/Chief Economist Ali Wolf](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon) \u2013 The housing market is driving this surge.  The lumber industry uses housing demand/data as the canary in the coal mind.  You probably should too.  If housing demand is still going bananas, then lumber will do so as well.\n\n[Madison\u2019s Lumber Prices](https://twitter.com/LumberNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \u2013 They post Lumber Cash Prices, typically about 2 weeks behind, but that\u2019s still way ahead of whenever the company\u2019s next earnings statements, and provides a break down by the major types of lumber.  Sometimes you even get a video interview/update.\n\n[RISI Analyst Bryan Smith](https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en) \u2013 He tweets out when some of these forestry companies declare wood pulp price increases (which extra is a significant source of income for a lot of these companies).  I find it a helpful data point.\n\nThose are main ones.  But if you follow these people enough, you will see them talking to other insightful people as well and sharing informative content.\n\n**Publicly Open Websites That Help You get a Sense of Market Direction**\n\nHere\u2019s the link for lumber futures: [CME Lumber Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#) - This is the closest thing to a general market gauge of the lumber industry.  But this isn\u2019t an exact predictor and this price is pegged to the Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&Btr.  There are many different types of dimensional lumber, some cost more (like Eastern SPF) and some cost less (like Southern Yellow Pine \u2013 SYP).  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally.  But remember, these prices can change.  They can go up or down, these aren\u2019t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn\u2019t mean it will stay that way.\n\n[Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) \u2013 a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don\u2019t need to panic.  \n\nThe industry\u2019s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don\u2019t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.\n\n[Madison\u2019s Lumber Reports]( https://madisonsreport.com/) If you hate twitter, here\u2019s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.\n\n[US Housing Data Releases](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) \u2013 US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don\u2019t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that\u2019s when you know the party is over.\n\n[Shanghai Pulp futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices) \u2013 This isn\u2019t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  [Here\u2019s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.](https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf)\n\n**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**\n\n[Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  \n\n[Whale wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/) is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F\u2019s so it isn\u2019t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.\n\nOverall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.\n\nIf there is one place you *shouldn\u2019t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it\u2019s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending \u201clumber stocks.\u201d  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.\n\n**TLDR:** there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don\u2019t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don\u2019t FOMO buy just because \u201cthe sucker\u2019s going up.\u201d\n\n**Disclosure:** most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.

If you look historically, the pure lumber companies (like wfg, canfor and Interfor), their stock price followed the futures price extremely closely.

LPX even further disconnected from price of lumber because of how much value-added products they now offer.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**\n\nStocks continued yesterday\u2019s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed\u2019s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  \n\nOn Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nYesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. \n\nHowever, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d The April Job Report bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\nIn addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper \u201cwell before\u201d the interest rate is increased. He said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I\u2019m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Labor Department Released its Weekly Unemployment Report\n   * **Initial jobless claims:** 473,000 vs. 490,000 expected and 507,000 the previous week\n   * **Continuing claims:** 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected and 3.7 million the previous week\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) is weighing plans to pump tens of billions of dollars more into cutting-edge chip factories in the U.S. state of Arizona than it had previously disclosed, according to Reuters.

{"title": "The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - May 10th to May 14th", "selftext": "What\u2019s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season has largely come to an end, meaning we can slowly get back to \u201cnormal\u201d movement among stocks, giving us some easier trading conditions! We\u2019ve also had a whole plethora of real-world news, so without further ado, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **At the start of the week, it was revealed that Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline operator in the United States, was taken hostage by hackers**. Most energy related stocks took a hit as the hack disrupted supply chains across many regions. By the end of the week, Colonial Pipeline reported that they\u2019ve made substantial progress in safely restarting the pipeline system, and can report that product delivery has recommenced in most of the markets that they service. Unbeknownst to most, Colonial Pipeline revealed that they ended up paying nearly $5 million dollars to the hacking group to regain control of their pipes, likely explaining how they managed to get back up and running so quickly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Stocks plunged throughout the first half of the week**, likely due to investors realizing that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. These inflationary pressures  may then prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, which in turn would deliver a swift beatdown to most of our favourite tech and growth stocks. Furthermore, among these inflation fears, the CPI report was set to come out this week and confirm everyone's suspicions, so the market obviously had to price in a dogshit report before we could continue melting up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **On Wednesday the CPI report came out**, and although the numbers weren\u2019t the best, they were already priced in so the damage wasn\u2019t all that bad. The CPI rose 4.2%, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis, compared to the respective estimates of 2.3% and 0.3%. While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they were expected, and with the SPY trading near ATHs for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of most tech stocks, the sell-offs were to be expected.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **On Thursday, the Department of Labour released their Weekly Unemployment Report**. The initial jobless claims came out to 473,000 vs. the 490,000 expected while continuing claims clocked in at 3.655 million vs. 3.650 million expected. Fairly average numbers, all things considered. We\u2019re showing clear signs of recovery, albeit slowly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **By Friday, most of the chop was resolved**. VIX plummeted, and most indices made up almost all the lost ground throughout the week. It seems as if the 24hr news cycle has made everyone's attention span too short for a bear market, as all problems are forgotten within a week. Inflation numbers are suspect, job numbers are suspect, but the market just keeps grinding up. Keep the music playing, and the good times rolling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **This week's earnings reports were pleasant, with almost *every* reporting company catching some awesome gains**! Even shithole Doordash managed to deliver some returns to investors, clocking 22% gains in a single trading session. It was a stark contrast to last week, where most reporters slid instead. I\u2019m truly sad that earnings season is coming to an end, as it has been good to me this quarter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll in all, that wraps up this week's recap! I hope you all had an awesome week, and made a fat stack of cash. If you would like a copy of these newspapers in advance, feel free to check out the Discord! I hope you all get to enjoy the nice weather and have a wonderful weekend! I\u2019ll catch you all at the casino come Monday.
