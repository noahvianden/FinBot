{"title": "SNOW and NVDA earnings. Expected moves and a look at credit spreads.", "selftext": "Nvidia and Snowflake report after the bell Wednesday. The options market is pricing just under a 4% move for Nvidia and just under a 7% move for Snowflake.\n\n**Nvidia /**\u00a0[Expected Move:\u00a0**3.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NVDA)/ Recent earnings moves: -8%, 0%, 0%\n\n**Snowflake** /\u00a0[Expected Move:\u00a0**6.6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SNOW)\u00a0/ Recent earnings moves: +1%, +16%  \n\n\nI generally lean towards credit spreads into events where vol will fall after the fact. I wanted to lay out what I generally look at as far as credit spreads, using the expected move then comparing risk/reward and probability of profit.\n\n### Snowflake\n\nAt the time of writing, SNOW stock is about $230. The 6.6% expected move corresponds to about $214 and $240 in the stock.  First I want to look at \"Selling the move\u201d entirely via an Iron Condor, with a credit put spread placed at the bearish consensus and a credit call spread at the bullish consensus:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5pr1sseceh171.gif\n\nAn Iron Condor is a credit spread that looks to make money if the stock stays within the strikes In this case, the Condor risks around $140 to make up to $110 if the stock stays between $215 and $245 on Friday\u2019s expiration. (the spreads are each 2.5 wide).\n\n## NVIDIA\n\nAt the time of writing, NVIDIA is about $625. Its expected move of 3.7% corresponds to about $605 and $652.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at an Iron Condor with credit call and put spreads at those levels:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7uml8xreh171.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=c182ffce439bfce299d33265e981e986b90ec89e\n\nThis one is 5 wide on each spread and decent risk/reward.\n\nOf course Condors are entirely neutral, credit spreads can also be used directionally by \"selling the move\" in one direction. Here's a look at how the credit spreads based on the expected move look in NVDA, first bullish, showing both at ATM spread, and also an OTM example, down near the bearish expected move:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jej3xih8fh171.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0fd5c818d0ca4272091d1676c24ac9e52fa7e28\n\nAnd the \"bearish\" credit call spreads:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebwkmgy4fh171.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bfc453c277d22beb70c5011ba93c6a09f3d1852\n\nCredit spreads obviously risk more to make less. And the higher their probability of profit, the more that needs to be risked to make less. But for those curious about credit spreads, particularly into an event where vol typically falls afterwards.\n\nThe other trade I didn't mention is an Iron Butterfly which is similar to the Condor above but has such a specific target for max gain it's almost a better trade for those with a specific price target in mind. \n\nOr course, if a stock rips higher or crashes, credit spreads and falling vol don't matter! As a credit spread can become max loss. But defining risk via a spread rather than an outright short call or put gives a calculable risk/reward that can be easily compared to debit calls/puts or spreads to determine f the risk/reward is worth the higher probability of profit.", "id": "nljpih", "created_utc": 1622042835.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "SNOW is never going to be able to please the market in the long run.

I want all the minds on Reddit to try and make some sense out of this....\n\nWhen this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!\n\nDISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?\n\nThis is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?\n\nI understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close!

Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... \n\nShould we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying?

He makes comments like \"not a chance\" and \"give me a break\" - unnecessary.\n\n2) Greenwald is setting up somewhat of a strawman argument when he refers to Tesla \"dominating the car industry\" and trying to keep competitors out. Tesla actually wants other companies to make EVs, and has offered to let other companies make use of their patents to make EVs. The highest goal I've seen from Tesla is 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, about 20 percent of a market of 100 million vehicles a year - so Tesla expects other companies to make EVs. Greenwald also seems to be implying that Tesla builds large numbers of charging stations to try to shut other EV makers out - on the contrary, Tesla is currently collaborating with another company to build a charging center with both Tesla and generic chargers, and has offered to work with other car companies to build chargers that both Tesla and other brand vehicles can use.\n\n3) Greenwald's forecast of 7 million EVs per year (for 20 years from now?) seems wildly pessimistic - 100 million by 2030 would be more plausible.\n\n4) Greenwald again seemingly mockingly asserts that Tesla has no technological advantage, which seems to show a poor understanding of the company. Tesla has a strong advantage in areas such as battery technology and cost, motor efficiency, large part casting, \"Octavalve\", etc. right now. And he (as well as many analysts) seems to assume that whatever technological advantages Tesla has now, the other companies will catch up because presumably Tesla will stop innovating. On the contrary, Tesla continues to invest heavily in R&D, and seems to use their R&D dollars more effectively than other auto makers as well - their pace of innovation may actually be accelerating, and increasing their technological lead.\n\n5) /u/space_s3x posted quotes in the May 26 daily discussion, of some really horrible calls Greenwald made on Amazon, Apple, and Google over the years - [https://old.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/nl8swa/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_may_26_2021/gzj2t5u/](https://old.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/nl8swa/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_may_26_2021/gzj2t5u/). The video characterizes Greenwald as a value investor. There are times and places where value investing makes sense, but trying to apply it to a very fast growing company (target 50%+ for many years) in an industry that is undergoing tremendous technological disruption does not seem advisable.\n\n6) Greenwald takes the approach that many analysts do of regarding Tesla only as a car company. But as others have pointed out, Tesla can more effectively be thought of as a bunch of startups in multiple industries, which have tremendous room to grow. \n\n7) Toward the end of the video, Greenwald seems to come closer to reality, saying he would not short the stock, and only adding that he personally would be uncomfortable investing his entire family fortune in the stock.
