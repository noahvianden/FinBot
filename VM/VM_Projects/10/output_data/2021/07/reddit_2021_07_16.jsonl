Go to Nvidia youtube channel and watch their last 10 uploads. What do you see? Almost no gaming! You see different business models! Business models for the future. \n\nNvidia is like apple before the invention of the iphone.

Here's how it's going so far:", "selftext": "I call this strategy \"Shake and bake.\" Max gain on this position: $1,053 ... Max loss: $247. Here's how it's going so far: [shake and bake](https://imgur.com/a/mUZBy0S)\n\n\nIf you read my last post on this, ignore this part, but here's how the strategy works:\n\n\nBasically this strategy is just trading up and down using calls and puts based on technical analysis. You've reached the end of the road with this strategy when you have a short iron condor in your portfolio. \n\n\nThe best technical setup for this strategy to pay off is for a stock to open super green. When price action starts looking stagnant, and you get the feeling theres about you be a pullback, buy an OTM put. \n\n\nWhen the stock does indeed pullback, sell a put at a higher strike than the put you bought, then take that premium you get paid and put it towards buying an OTM call. \n\n\nWhen the stock recovers, and starts shooting up again, at the point when you think the recovery is about to be over, sell a call at a lower strike than the one you bought. \n\n\nYou can get much more favorable max loss/gain by entering in one leg at a time when conditions for said leg are best. \n\n\nIt can be done in reverse order as well. If a stock opens in the red and you anticipate a rebound, you'd start this strategy with an OTM call.\n\n\nAnyways, this trade has gone well so far though. May end up closing at least part of the position early. This post was mostly to prove to you all that this strategy is legit and can indeed make you money. Let me know what you all think.\n\nHere's the screenshot again without the extra calls (I had to cut my losses when I was down $50 on those as I didn't get the move I was expecting.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 16, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 16, 2021**\n\nVolatility in the markets continued today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling for the third consecutive day after recording new intraday highs earlier in the week. The Dow Jones (DIA) also fell while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its streak of underperformance, pulling back more than 1% for the fourth consecutive day. Market participants continue to digest Q2 earning reports, mixed economic data regarding inflation, and commentary by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \n\nEver since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI & PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, which is not super surprising given the SPY and QQQ have been on a remarkable rally as of late. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.\n\nOn a positive note, according to a report by the Department of Commerce, retail sales in the US unexpectedly increased in June, despite massive supply-side constraints affecting a swath of consumer goods, most notably, vehicles. The report showed spending was increasingly shifting back to services, like travel and entertainment, an encouraging sign that the reopening of the economy is going fairly well. Retail sales rose 0.6% in June, better than the decline of 0.4% expected by economists. Retail sales in the US are up 18% from June 2020, reflecting base effects as the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. \n\nMike Loewengart, Managing Director of Investment Strategy at E-Trade Financial said, \u201c*\"*The unexpected rise in retail sales combined with yesterday\u2019s pandemic-era low of jobless claims are two more strong proof points that we are edging closer to a full economic recovery. While we are seeing consumers broadly look more towards services and activities, the expectations that people would be turning away from goods seems to have been a little overblown.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said \u201cinflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating\u201d and that the US economy was \u201cstill a ways\u201d off from reaching the threshold of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed\u2019s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell\u2019s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)\n\n**On the labor market:** \u201cConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\u201d\n\n**On inflation:** \u201cInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy\u201d.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the \u201crear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.\u201d\n* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to \u201cdecentralized financial services\u201d.

I personally think we are overvalued, in terms of stocks real estate etc... I don't think crypto is currently.\n\n My main topic of discussion-  Considering the fact that we currently are printing so much money, there is crazy inflation going around. There is also a lot of extra income via stimulus checks and other government spending to try to help the US recover. The extra income is putting billions and billions of extra money into the market, which is one of the reasons for these amazing gains we have had. That money will stop coming in eventually. The amount of retailers playing the game has increased a lot. Which is good, until it isn't. I think these things also was a major reason for the crypto crash. Anybody have any thoughts?\n\nI also just watched this YouTube video [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRlxwHmhetA&ab_channel=MeetKevin) where he also addresses these issues I was thinking of, which led me to make this post asking your opinions.", "id": "olpo29", "created_utc": 1626468358.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Your post isn't going to be popular since most people on Reddit either don't know about the second law of thermodynamics, or don't think it applies to the stock markets. Once the new money dries up the forward momentum stops, people freak out, and a self-reinforcing cascade downwards begins.\n\nNot all crashes are caused by this, but it's fairly self-evident that once there is no more new money to bid on stocks, the number of sellers will exceed the number of buyers and you know what happens then. The stock market is just as much a ponzi scheme as crypto is, except that it is slow-motion and we all sort of agree to participate in it because we don't have a better alternative. The stock market involves the extra step of earnings to justify endlessly putting more money into the system, and relies on the velocity and creation of money to keep it swirling around and around above the drain. It benefits from the government constantly increasing the money supply and rich people having preferential access to that money (Cantillon effect) to stay ahead of the inflation that it creates, including rolling retail in the markets.\n\nThis is especially true of companies that pay little to no dividends, such as Google. When you buy shares in those companies the only way you can make money is if someone is willing to pay you even more for them in the future, and that person buys the share knowing they will earn nothing from it except to be able to sell it to someone else for even more in the future. It's worth noting that around 15% of companies in the S&P 500 don't pay dividends. A more generous interpretation would be that buying shares in these companies is seen as some sort of store of value (strong companies that won't go bust so their shares are sort of 'corporate gold'), but that's not really the way that stock ownership is traditionally described.\n\nWhen you see how much the market is addicted to the Fed put and Fed commentary nowadays, it isn't re-assuring.

You would have protection on the downside, but you would also be capped on the upside.\n\nIt may be easier to see this from the [payout diagram](https://imgur.com/zwQKOx8) for your spread. Unless there's a big move to the downside or the upside, your profit/loss moves almost linearly with the underlying price, but magnified (completely linearly if you hold to expiration).

Extend the relief and the discussion around inflation becomes an even more real thing.

Essentially just limiting the financing opportunities. This in turn will just drive the principal price of the house up. So now we\u2019ve got propped up housing prices, people who want the house need to put more down to buy said house\u2026 where are they gonna get their savings? The same place I\u2019m gonna go to access my savings when I have to eventually pay off my student loans\u2026 the market.\n\n**Okay, I\u2019m interested\u2026 but what stock do I play?** ***$FXI*** why? Because it\u2019s the ETF that tracks the top 50 largest Chinese stocks in a single fund. It\u2019s used to express a single country view\u2026 similar to our good \u2018ol friend SPY, but more representative of a country.\n\n**TL;DR:** very real inflation threat triggered by student debt decision and rising commodity prices will impact the global markets; more so China due to them holding trillions of U.S. denominated foreign exchange assets and being the worlds largest consumer of copper. rising copper prices create rising production costs. couple that with red hot housing market and more $$ required for a down payment to buy housing, props up the housing price, creates a perfect storm in the Chinese market. \n\n**position & further proof:** I am long 100x FXI September $40 puts.\n\nAnd at the beginning of this week - someone laid down a $500k spread on August $40 / $42p (22,500x each). I went out another month just to buy some more time and allows me to keep adding to the position if (when) I want to get bigger.\n\nAll sources here:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/too-much-stimulus-in-the-us-may-bring-imported-inflation-to-china-economists-warn.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/too-much-stimulus-in-the-us-may-bring-imported-inflation-to-china-economists-warn.html)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tests-out-intervening-in-housing-market-to-tame-prices-11623161379](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tests-out-intervening-in-housing-market-to-tame-prices-11623161379)\n\n[https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/HGU21/technical-chart?plot=BAR&volume=contract&data=MN&density=X&pricesOn=1&asPctChange=0&logscale=0&sym=HGU21&grid=1&height=500&studyheight=100](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/HGU21/technical-chart?plot=BAR&volume=contract&data=MN&density=X&pricesOn=1&asPctChange=0&logscale=0&sym=HGU21&grid=1&height=500&studyheight=100)\n\n[https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239536/ishares-china-largecap-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239536/ishares-china-largecap-etf)", "id": "oljz0k", "created_utc": 1626451810.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Quoting early Fall Out Boy?
