Because you have two related derivatives there will be types of quasi-arbitrage (beneficial positions that arise from buying or selling both and playing the combination) that roughly links them. \n\nAnd these options are European style, which allows for the possibility of a negative extrinsic value if the true underlying has a tail event that is thought to be temporary and likely to be reversed quickly, because all that really matters is the expected value of the underlying in the eyes of the market on the expiration date. In other words, if I have an August 31 18 strike weekly call, with the VIX at 18.60, then Bid is 3.72 and Ask is 4.56 at this moment (another huge problem with trading these options), if the VIX were to shoot to 32 tomorrow, these calls would NOT rise to their supposed extrinsic value of 14. They would be below that.\n\nBecause that behavior is similar to the behavior of futures (they are  in contango almost all of the time, but typically switch to temporary backwardation when the VIX has an upward tail event) people writing articles tend to explain that they are pricing off the futures. But they would behave this way even if no futures market existed.\n\nPart of the problems arises from brokerages assigning Greeks to VIX options, like the delta. Such calculations are sheer gibberish. Stock options pricing models assume directly that the log growth rates of the underlying fit, at least roughly, a normal distribution (qualified by tail events, which can be built into a model these days). The observed log growth rate of VIX index as an underlying asset does not even remotely resemble a normal distribution (in contrast to, say, SPX, which actually does). Therefore the Greeks are stupidly meaningless, and yet there they are.\n\nOne of the problems with trading VIX options is that it is not easy to find a distribution for the underlying that allows calculation of option probabilities, as represented by the Greeks, which is why I don't play them (I do play the futures fairly heavily).\n\nSubtle, but the subtlety is everything.

Federal government outlays, residential  investment and inventories weighed on the figure.\n\nPersonal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, advanced an annualized 11.8%.\n\nThe  inflation-adjusted value of domestically produced goods and services  climbed to an annualized $19.36 trillion, eclipsing its pre-pandemic  peak.\n\nThe median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists  called for an 8.4% increase in second-quarter GDP. Stock-index futures  climbed after the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose  and the dollar weakened.\n\nEmboldened by vaccinations, federal  financial relief and a broader reopening of the economy, Americans had  both the wherewithal and the opportunity to ramp up spending on services  such as dining out. The extra cash paired with robust hiring helped  sustain outlays for merchandise as well.\n\nLooking ahead, economic  growth will be challenged by waning government support and lingering  supply and labor constraints. At the same time, the rapidly spreading  delta variant of Covid-19 present risks to the spending outlook.\n\nMore stories like this are available on [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\n\n[Subscribe now](https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/67obqkd5zdp5lj8/?utm_source=yahoo_usn) to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.", "id": "otx4g6", "created_utc": 1627563973.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "The economy grew at a much lower rate than expected, validating earlier reports that were pointing to a peaking economic recovery.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 29, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 29, 2021**\n\nDespite some volatility earlier in the week, stocks firmly rose today as market participants looked beyond slightly disappointing GDP and jobs data and the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy, which showed no changes but did indicate members are increasingly considering the potential timeline to taper quantitative easing (QE). In my opinion, the fact that markets continue to shrug off volatility to charge higher shows great relative strength and signals that market participants remain willing and able to buy dips. \n\nThe S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both recorded fresh all-time highs, closing 0.4% and 0.42% higher respectively. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is right under its own record high and closed the day 0.18% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed again, closing 0.77% higher.\n\nToday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1\n* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1\n\nMarket participants are digesting the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report, released yesterday, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nAmazon (AMZN) absolutely smashed earnings, posting probably the most impressive quarter I have ever seen. Despite this, the stock is currently down 5% after some analysts raised concerns about a slowdown in growth moving forward due to reopenings and difficult comparisons. Personally, with numbers like this, I am going to snap up any dip if it continues tomorrow. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Revenue:** $115.06 billion expected versus $88.91 billion in Q2 2020\n* **EPS:** $15.75 expected versus $10.30 in Q2 2020\n* **AWS revenue:** $14.18 billion expected versus $10.81 billion in Q2 2020\n\nIn other news, the Labor Department Weekly Unemployment Report came in higher than expected. Here are the numbers \n\n* **New Jobless Claims:** 400,000 vs 385,000 expected\n* **Continuing Claims:** 3.269 million vs 3.183 million expected\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, shares of Facebook (FB), which recently joined the $1 trillion market-cap club, fell after the company warned of a \u201csignificant slowdown\u201d in growth moving forward and suggested that Apple\u2019s (AAPL) newest iOS app-tracking update, which let\u2019s users opt out of having apps track their activity outside their own platform, would negatively impact their core advertising business. Here are the numbers\n   * **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected\\\\\n   * **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts\n   * **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected\n   * **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected\n   * **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected \n* PayPal (PYPL) also reported earnings, which were largely in-line with expectations. As a result, stock fell roughly 5% today. Personally, that move seems a little overdone to me.\n* Today was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in \u201cmeme stocks\u201d. Like I have said before, personally not touching that stock with a 10-foot pole, too many dynamics at play. But it will still be fun to keep track of.\n* President Biden on Thursday called for state and local governments to make $100 payments to every newly vaccinated American as authorities race to stem the newest wave of Covid-19 cases. \n* Trevor Milton, founder and former CEO of Nikola Motors, the truck, hydrogen start-up that turned out to be a fraud, was charged with defrauding investors.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Align Technologies (ALGN) with two target raises.

Easily could set an all time high.\n\nI actually stumbled across this security because I was trying to find a true hidden diamond  with an upcoming bullish earnings report.

Not a massive yolo that has become usual around here but this is in my retirement account. I plan to exercise the options and hold this long term. \n\nI do believe there is a strong case for a 10% return (minimum now that it is known about) just on a 2-4 week swing trade as well\u2026which is why I wanted to shed light on this little known to retail traders company.\n\nSee the links for where I gained my knowledge and check out their analysis and company information pages on WeBull as well. \n\nIf there is interest I can do a more in-depth dive so it isn\u2019t just a read all these sources I used post. \n\n\nForbes [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/07/13/strong-earnings-growth-could-help-arrow-electronics-stock-regain-recent-highs/amp/) that itself is a great in depth dd on $ARW\n\nCNN institutional ownership [recent transactions](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=ARW&subView=institutional)\n\nYahoo [finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arrow-electronics-arw-earnings-expected-190307280.html?.tsrc=rss)", "id": "otre54", "created_utc": 1627537086.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|22|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06954675912857056}, {"body": "If Digi-Key ever goes public (not gonna happen until the founder kicks the bucket) THAT is one to own.
