Also I have heard people say there are gamma risks when selling calls too close to expiry, I\u2019m not exactly sure what this means but what I know is that the longer time you sell the call the more time you have to successfully exit the position at a profit. If you sell a call a week out and during that week the stock rockets you are not profitable on that trade but if you sold it a month out and the stock rockets one week and tanks the next you could still profit from it.
