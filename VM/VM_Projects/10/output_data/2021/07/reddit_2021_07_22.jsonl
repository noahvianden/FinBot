{"title": "[DD] Douyu vs HUYA: The two biggest game streaming companies in China", "selftext": "There is one thing that you need to know about the game streaming market. China will dominate it. At least, that is the message that all the market research platforms give off! The Chinese game streaming market is currently valued at $4.6 billion dollars and expected to grow by 32% next year.\u00a0Douyu and HUYA currently control 80% of that game streaming market! 80%! It is literally a monopoly and, if you follow Warren Buffett, you know that you should always buy companies that run a monopoly. In fact, the two companies were going to merge earlier this year, but last week on 12th July, Douyu and HUYA officially announced the termination of their merger agreement. The merger was blocked by the Chinese market regulators based on antitrust grounds, essentially meaning that Douyu and HUYA would become too big. The whole merger was orchestrated by Tencent which holds a third of DOYU and half of HUYA. Tencent has been running into some issues with regulators lately so it is possible that this was another reason why the merger did not happen. Personally, I don't think that this will affect Douyu and HUYA too much. However, we have seen a massive drop in their stock price as a result which is good. It's great! Why? It creates the perfect buying opportunity! Warren Buffett always says that you should buy when others are afraid which is precisely what is happening right now with HUYA and Douyu. Investors are afraid, but the fundamentals of both companies have remained the same! The long-term prospects are the same!\u00a0\n\nLets take a look at them. First off, we've got the monthly active users. In 2020, both companies saw a big surge in users so it was expected that there would not be much of a growth in 2021. Looking at HUYA, we can see that this was accurate. Their monthly **mobile** active users increased by less than a million from 74.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 to 75.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Their paying users actually dropped from 6.1 million in Q1 of 2020 to 5.9 million in Q1 of 2021. They did not release figures for their overall users though. However, Douyu actually managed to grow their user base by 21.3% from 158.1 million in Q1 of 2020 to 191.9 million in Q1 of 2021 although they also saw a drop in paying users from an average of 7.6 million in Q1 of 2020 to 7.0 million in Q1 of 2021. Both companies attributed this to the economy returning to normal, which was expected. Did this affect their revenue though? Did they see a drop in sales? HUYA actually saw an increase of 8% in revenue to $397.6 million dollars as compared to the same period last year. Their live streaming revenues rose 5.2% to $365 million dollars and the ad revenue went up by 54.6% to $32.4 million! You can tell that they have started to monetise using advertisements! HUYA's earnings also went up 8.4% to $28.3 million dollars as compared to last year. They also had a positive net cash flow of $25.4 million which is not huge, but it is good to see that they are keeping a positive cash flow. In comparison, Douyu saw a big drop in earnings from a profit of 254 million Chinese yuan in Q1 of 2020 to a loss of 102 million Chinese yuan in Q1 of 2021. This was combined with a 5% drop in revenue, but I'm not really worried.\u00a0\n\nWhy? Simple. Douyu's userbase is growing fast. The company is still in the early stages of monetisation and right now it is more important to maintain and grow its userbase. They have two and a half times the users of HUYA. As long as they maintain that leadership, Douyu will do fine. There is another reason why. Right now, Douyu is sitting on a cash equivalents pile worth $1.2 billion dollars while they trade at a market cap of almost $1.44 billion! The company has more than enough cash to sustain its operations and this tiny loss of about $15 million dollars is nothing! They have less than $10 million dollars worth of current and long-term debt. This also means that they have an enterprise value of $240 million dollars! Their revenue for the last twelve months was almost $1.5 billion dollars meaning that their EV-to-Revenue ratio was only 0.16! 0.16! This is extremely, extremely cheap! If the company drops a bit further, they will literally trade for the cash on their books. They will essentially be a free company! When we also consider that their forward PE for 2022 is 17.8 and their price-to-book ratio is 1.36, we can tell that Douyu is a bargain right now. Douyu is currently trading for $4.45. It has literally never before traded that low! The discounted cash flow model from Finbox gives us a fair price of $9.07 dollars while Simply Wallstreet uses the free cash flow of Douyu to estimate a fair price of $16.13, which is over 360% upside! It obviously depends whether you want to be conservative or optimistic, but I personally think that Douyu can hit $16 dollars although it will take at least a year. If it sounds too optimistic to you, bear in mind that the average analyst price target is $11.12 according to Yahoo Finance. This is real. Plus, Douyu still has an insider ownership of 22.5% which means two things. One, the management is invested in the company and wants to see a higher stock price. Two, it can lead to a massive price boost later on when institutions buy in. Douyu has also reduced the amount of shares outstanding from 334 million in 2020 to 321 million in 2021, which also improves the company's metrics and makes it more attractive to investors.\n\nWhat about HUYA though? Are they also a good deal? Absolutely. Despite having less users than Douyu, HUYA is generating more revenue and earnings. They have higher margins due to better operational efficiency. Essentially, HUYA is one step ahead of Douyu in terms of monetising and optimising their business. Plus, similar to Douyu, HUYA owns a lot of cash equivalents, about $1.6 billion dollars on a market cap of $3.35 billion dollars. Their total debt is also around $10 million dollars, meaning that their enterprise value is about $1.75 billion dollars or half of their current market cap! Over the last 12 months, they made about $1.7 billion dollars in revenue so their\u00a0EV-to-Revenue ratio is 1, which is extremely cheap! Their PE is 24.5, their forward PE is 14.9 and their price-to-book is higher than Douyu's at about 2.2, but it is still cheap. HUYA is currently trading for $14.4 dollars and the last time that HUYA traded this low was during the COVID crash in March 2020. The discounted cash flow model from Finbox gives us a fair price of $40.3 dollars while\u00a0SimplyWallstreet values HUYA at $17.6, but I personally think that the higher valuation is justified given HUYA's past record and potential. Analysts also expect a higher target price of $22 according to Yahoo Finance. We can easily achieve a 50% upside in the next 12 months and perhaps over 100% after another year.\n\nThere are two main risks involved with Douyu and HUYA. One, it is the fact that Tencent owns a third of DOYU and half of HUYA. Having such a massive stakeholder owning two competitors is a red flag. Tencent will not be able to merge the two companies now so it is likely that it will sell its position in one of the companies and focus on the other, driving one share price down and another up. Also, we have the risk of regulation. Right now, neither company has faced regulatory issues on its own, but Chinese regulators could interfere if we see massive expansion or anti-competitive practices. I don't think that this will happen any time soon though, but it is something to watch.\u00a0\n\nFinally, seeing companies that are this undervalued is a red flag. Typically, I would agree. However, both HUYA and Douyu are leaders in the game streaming market, they have a massive presence, they are still growing, they have massive cash stockpiles to ensure that they can continue their operations, they are either making a profit or close to doing so. Their price crashed because of the events and fear around them, not because they are underperforming companies! This is not a financial advice, it is just my opinion, but both of these companies are strong buys in my books with Douyu being my favourite! I own both of them and I plan on buying more while they trade at such low prices!\n\nWhat do you think?

By revenue, High Tide owns the largest retail cannabis network in the country.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 22, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 22, 2021**\n\nStocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP) skyrocketed after-hours after the companies reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.\n* Shares of Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program\n* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.\n* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector. So far, I\u2019ve been unable to find the cause.\n* Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday said its board approved a 17% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend.\n* U antitrust regulators are set to give unconditional approval to Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap's (AER) $30 billion bid for General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.\n* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Ally Financial (ALLY) target raised by Citigroup from $59 to $63 at Buy.
