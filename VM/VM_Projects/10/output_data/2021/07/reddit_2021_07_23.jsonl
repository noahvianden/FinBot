{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 23, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 23, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their remarkable rally today, wildy reversing after Monday\u2019s decline to surge higher for the fourth consecutive day, with the three major indexes once again approaching record levels. The S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both rose more than 1%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) traded 0.7% higher at the time of writing. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, reversed from yesterday\u2019s session to trade 0.4% higher at the time of writing, once again proving that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips. \n\nIt seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nYesterday,  the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nMark Hamrick, Senior Economic Analyst at Bankrate said, \u201cWith the recent resurgence in COVID cases stemming from the Delta variant, the jump in jobless claims is a disappointment. Recovery is never a perfect straight line.\n\nWhile Monday may have preoccupied market participants, Q2 earning season continues and is shaping up to be another record-setting quarter, with most companies surging past earnings estimates. This week, we have seen Chipotle (CMG), Coca-Cola (KO), Verizon (VZ), Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Southwest (LUV), among others beating earnings. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Chinese stocks fell as a whole today due to fears that the Chinese Communist Party will continue to penalize its tech companies. In the latest move, the CCP brought the hammer down on ride-hailing company Didi, with reports coming that the company will be hit with a massive fine of more than $2.8 billion, which would break the record paid by Alibaba (BABA) earlier this year, and threats that include suspending certain company operations and forcing the withdrawal of US-listed shares. Didi is down roughly 50% since its IPO on June 30.\n* U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a four-month low of 59.7 from 63.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth.\n* Members of the US Federal Reserve are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week in order to debate the timeline to taper quantitative easing and the potential risks around the resurging Delta variant\n* Shares of Intel (INTC) gapped down despite smashing earnings estimates after reporting its outlook, which suggests the company will continue to lose market share to other competitors, mainly AMD and Nvidia (NVDA).\n* Shares of Snap (SNAP) rocketed up after the company smashed earnings, with revenue more than doubling compared to last year and the company raising guidance moving forward. Twitter (TWTR) beat as well but not as dramatically.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Biogen (BIIB) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $453 to $455 at Overweight.

{"title": "AMZN is 15% below fair value, PT $4,200 (MorningStar Analysis)", "selftext": "**Business Strategy & Outlook**\n\nAmazon dominates its served markets, notably for e-commerce and cloud services. It benefits from numerous competitive advantages and has emerged as the clear e-commerce leader given its size and scale, which yield an unmatched selection of low-priced goods for consumers. The secular drift toward e-commerce continues unabated with the company continuing to grind out market share gains despite its size. Prime ties Amazon\u2019s e-commerce efforts together and provides a steady stream of high-margin recurring revenue from customers who purchase more frequently from Amazon\u2019s properties. In return, consumers get one-day shipping on millions of items, exclusive video content, and other services, which result in a powerful virtuous circle where customers and sellers attract one another. The Kindle and other devices further bolster the ecosystem by helping attract new customers, while making the value proposition irresistible in retaining existing customers. Through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon is also a clear leader in public cloud services.\n\nAdditionally, the firm\u2019s advertising business is already large and continues to scale, thus offering an attractive option for marketers looking to access a vast audience with a variety of proprietary data points about those very consumers. AWS, advertising, and subscriptions are growing faster than eCommerce with the exception of the 2020 spike in online shopping. We expect these three areas to be the main growth drivers over the next several years. This is critical, as each of these segments drives higher margins than the corporate average, which in turn should allow both operating profit and EPS to outgrow revenue as margins continue to expand.\n\nFrom a retail perspective, we expect continued innovation to help drive further share gains. We also look for continued penetration into categories such as groceries and luxury goods that have not previously translated into the same level of success as other retail categories. We also see technology advancements in AWS and a bigger push to service enterprise customers as helping to sustain the company\u2019s lead there. Overall, we see strong revenue and free cash flow growth for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Risk & Uncertainty**\n\nWe believe that the uncertainty for Amazon is high and that despite being an e-commerce leader, the company faces a variety of risks.\n\nAmazon must protect its leading online retailing position, which can be challenging as consumer preferences change, especially post-COVID-19 (as consumers may revert back to prior behaviors), and traditional retailers bolster their online presence. Maintaining an e-commerce edge has pushed the company to make investments in non-traditional areas, such as producing content for its Prime Video subscriptions and building out its own transportation network. Similarly, the company must also maintain an attractive value proposition for its third-party sellers. Some of these investment areas have raised investor questions in the past, and we expect management to continue to invest according to its strategy, despite periodic margin pressure from increased spending.\n\nThe company must also continue to invest in new offerings. AWS, transportation, and physical stores (both Amazon branded and Whole Foods) are three notable areas of investment. These decisions require capital allocation and management focus and may play out over a period of years rather than quarters.\n\nContinued international expansion will likely require similar investment and management attention but will also increase exposure to different regulatory environments. Some countries have instituted or may institute protectionist policies. Even domestically over the last several years, lawmakers from both parties have increasingly focused on the amount of market power large technology companies have accrued. Antitrust, data privacy and section 230 have been repeatedly invoked.\n\n**Bull Case:**\n\n* Amazon is the clear leader in e-commerce and enjoys an unrivaled scale to continue to invest in growth opportunities and drive the very best customer experience.\n* High-margin advertising and AWS are growing faster than the corporate average, which should continue to boost profitability over the next several years.\n* Amazon Prime memberships help attract and retain customers who spend more with Amazon and reinforces a powerful network effect while bringing in recurring and high margin revenue.\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n* Regulatory concerns are rising for large technology firms, including Amazon. Further, the firm may face increasing regulatory and compliance issues as it expands internationally.\n* New investments, notably in fulfillment, delivery, and AWS should dampen free cash flow growth. Also, Amazon\u2019s penetration into some countries might be harder than in the U.S. due to inferior logistic networks.\n* Amazon may not be as successful in penetrating new retail categories, such as luxury goods, due to consumer preferences and an improved e-commerce experience from larger retailers.\n\nRead more: [https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amzn/quote](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amzn/quote)", "id": "oqbwpx", "created_utc": 1627075542.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR, but \u201cFair value\u201d and price targets are very, very different concepts.
