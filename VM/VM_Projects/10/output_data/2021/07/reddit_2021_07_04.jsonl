(My first confirmation question). Which would leave me with an initial profit of $4300. Then I would need to subtract the option price of $330. Leaving me with a true profit of $3970, right?

{"title": "Deep and far out ITM as a \"loan\" on Dividend Stocks?", "selftext": "Had an idea I was playing around with and am curious if other people had similar thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I like options as a way to supplement high yield dividend stocks.  However, there doesn't seem to be a lot of action on options for these types of stocks.  What I was thinking about is selling a very far out and deep ITM call to get capital to buy more dividend stocks.  \n\n\nExample:\n\nI bought 400 shares of IVR for $4.06 a share for a total upfront cost of $1624.  I then sold 4 calls at a 0.50 strike price that expires on Jan 20, 2023 for $3.10 a share. This gives me $1240 in premium for a net position of -$384.  I use that premium (plus some more cash) to buy more high yield dividend stocks, in this case AGNC, for $1694.  This gives me a total position of -$2078.  \n\n\nSo, for $2078, I have 400 shares of IVR and 100 shares of AGNC.  IVR is paying $0.36 a share per year and AGNC is paying $1.44 a share per year for a total dividend income of $288 per year.  Obviously those numbers will probably change, and I expect IVR to try to move back towards (but not reach) it's mean of $0.50 a share, but let's assume it doesn't.\n\nIn a year and a half, when the contracts come due, I will have enough in dividends to buy out one of my contracts assuming the premium does not skyrocket, which judging by the differences in those that expired yesterday and those that expire on Jan 20, 2023, I don't think they will.  The other three outstanding options I can roll out to put off paying them.  \n\n\nBasically, I think of this as buying rental units.  I pay cash for one unit and then use it as collateral for a loan to buy a second unit.  Using the rent from the two units, I am able to pay off the loan over time.    \n\n\nThe big bust scenario I see is if the stocks sky rocket.  That should make these deep ITM contracts more valuable, making it harder to roll out the calls, right?  However, REITs are pretty stable and prior to the crash in Feb of 2020, IVR hovered more or less at the same price through out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?", "id": "odagez", "created_utc": 1625361479.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "If they're DEEP ITM options they'll probably be exercised.

{"title": "Barrier shift consideration in barrier options hedging", "selftext": "I have a question regarding the barrier shift used when risk managing a down and in put (PDI). I'm reading Exotic Options Trading by Frans de Weert and he gave this example.\n\nTrader is long one PDI 100/70 (strike 100% spot, down and in barrier 70% spot), striked at spot = 100. Now spot is at 70.1, and the put's absolute delta (called delta from now on) is larger than 1, say 2.5 so the trader needs to buy 2.5 stocks to hedge for 1 PDI. The stock then drops to 69.9 and the PDI turns into a normal ITM put, which has a delta of 1 for simplification. Now the trader has to sell 1.5 stocks for each PDI he is long. And if he is long a lot of PDIs he cannot sell the excess delta at exactly 69.9 but much lower and make a loss.\n\nI understand it up to here. However, the author says that the trader can treat the PDI 100/70 as a PDI 100/67 and risk manage it accordingly to give himself a cushion of 3%. What does this mean ?\n\nAs I understand, European PDI with American barrier has a lower absolute delta if the barrier is lower, for the same level of spot, i.e in the example the 100/67 PDI will have a delta of say 2 instead of 2.5 like the 100/70 PDI. If the stock drops right from 70.1 to 66.9, the trader will lose less since he only has to sell 1 stock for each PDI he owns instead of 1.5. However, if the stock stays above 67, the 100/70 PDI that the trader actually owns now has a delta of 1, while since he treats it as a 100/67, he should still hedge it at a delta larger than 1, say 2.6.\n\nThis means that if he treats the 100/70 PDI as a 100/67 PDI, if the stock is above 67 and under 70, he is long 1.6 delta ?
