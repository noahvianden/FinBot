The major drawbacks  of this are: \r  \n\r  \n\\- If it\u2019s a non sheltered account, you'll have to  pay taxes on your gains\r  \n\r  \n\\- If the market rises instead, you'll miss out on upside gains \r  \n\r  \nBuy & hope types recommend diversification (sector, asset class, geographic). Equity diversification spreads losses across various sectors, hoping that some don't lose as much as others. However,  you will lose in a deep recession if you ride it out (see down 50+ pct in 2000 and 2008).\r  \n\r  \nFor example, in the 2008 bear market the three top performing SPDR sectors were Utilities (-43%), Health (-37%) and Staples (-31%). Would that have made you feel  that you did a good job protecting your portfolio?\r  \n\r  \nSome recommend stop loss orders. That's fine in an orderly correction but in a volatile down market (see 1929 or 1987), your fills could be anywhere if price gaps through your stop loss price.\r  \n\r  \nWriting covered calls appeals to some.  Writing deep ITM covered calls provides more protection but why would you? You'd have little to no upside profit potential and they would be Unqualified which means per the IRS  that you would not be able to claim long-term gains if assigned. If you write ATM or OTM covered calls, if your stock craters, you won't be able to continue writing covered calls without locking in a loss. \r  \n\r  \nCaveat? Don't monkey with covered calls if you don't want to sell the stock.\r  \n\r  \nYou could buy protective puts but that has several issues. At the current level of implied volatility, ATM portfolio protection with SPY puts costs about 11 pct a year. Puts on most individual stocks  cost more. That's a lot of portfolio drag to overcome if the stock or stock market stagnates or only moves up modestly. You can reduce the cost of put protection if you buy OTM puts but that increases the 'deductible' (loss from current price down to the put's strike price). If you buy protective puts and the market moves up, additional gains will not be protected.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are willing to make the trade off of giving away much of the upside potential gain, you can reduce/eliminate the cost of protective puts by collaring your long stock. For every 100 shares that you own, sell an out-of-the-money (OTM) call and use the proceeds to buy an OTM put. This defines a floor beneath which you cannot lose as well as a ceiling beyond which you will not profit. You can do it on individual stocks or globally with liquid SPY options.\r  \n\r  \nCollars can be structured for no cost. If you want to skew the risk graph so that you have more upside potential than downside risk, the call will be further OTM (or the put closer to the money) and the collar will have a net cost. Skewing the collar in the opposite manner (the put is more OTM than the call is OTM) will result in a net credit but potential loss will be greater than the potential profit.\r  \n\r  \nIf you do 1-3 month long stock collars and the stock appreciates toward the short call strike, With some cooperation from the underlying, you may be able to roll the collar up and/or out, protecting some of your additional capital gain. Wash, rinse, repeat. If the market heads south, collars will lose but your capital won\u2019t be decimated. In a collapse, you can roll the long puts down, lowering your cost basis. Caveat? Again, don't monkey with collars if you don't want to sell the stock.\r  \n\r  \nAny decent option book will explain option hedges in greater detail.  \r  \n\r  \nIn short, to offset losses or profit during a recession, you need to own negative correlation positions. Some other choices are:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Buy inverse ETFs\r  \n\\- Short stocks, ETFs, futures\r  \n\\- Run a long/short portfolio\r  \n\r  \nDo not attempt any of these strategies unless under the supervision of an adult.\r  \n\r  \nTransitioning to cash or quality debt during a bear market is something that any investor can achieve. As the market drops, transition to more cash or fixed income and eventually add a small portion of negatively correlated positions. Let your portfolio\u2019s declining value dictate the transition from long to short (and vice versa).
