Crashes are driven by [panic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic) as much as by underlying economic factors. They often follow [speculative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation) [stock market bubbles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble).\n\n>Stock market crashes are [social phenomena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_phenomenon) where external [economic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy) events combine with [crowd behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology) and psychology in a [positive feedback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions:  a prolonged period of rising stock prices and excessive economic [optimism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism), a market where [P/E ratios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P/E_ratio) exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of [margin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(economics\\)) debt and leverage by market participants.\n\n>There is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term commonly applies to steep double-digit percentage losses in a [stock market index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index) over a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from [bear markets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_market) by [panic selling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_selling) and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Bear markets are periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years. While crashes are often associated with bear markets, they do not necessarily go hand in hand. The [crash of 1987](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987\\)), for example, did not lead to a bear market. Likewise, the Japanese [Nikkei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225) bear market of the 1990s occurred over several years without any notable crashes.\n\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/4hb4DpH.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Wall ^Street ^Crash ^of ^1929](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929) ^| [^Great ^Depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) ^| [^Professional ^wrestling ^throws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws) ^| [^Black ^Monday ^\\(1987)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_\\(1987\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cflooas) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cflooas)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&subject=Glitched comment report&message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 66513:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1yg1hs/will_be_no_stock_market_crash_in_2014/cfloo5r)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0519622266292572}], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Prophet JamesGordon1 has spoken, peace be upon him", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "gooble-gobble, ONE OF US, gooble-gobble..", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09147373586893082}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1195954978466034}, {"body": "Thanks for sharing .
