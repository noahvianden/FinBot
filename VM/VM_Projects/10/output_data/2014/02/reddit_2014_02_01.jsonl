But I believe that the market is still wishing for cheap money and that it was a little rattled by Bernanke keeping his word. The taper and the debt ceiling, despite disclosure of such factors to the public, seem to cause fear/uncertainty/doubt in the market. The S&P dropped on the Wednesday that the taper was announced, recovered Thursday, and well, crapped out a bit on Friday.   \n2. \"The emerging economies? Come on.\" -The emerging markets are arguably dependent on cheap US currency as the world tries to recover from a downed global economy. While Turkey and Argentina might not be that big a deal, the increasing USD and shaky emerging markets may be blamed for a correction that was needed despite this recent blunder.  The rising USD and lack of global growth may be the perfect combination to encourage people to sit on cash while equities die out.

We closed the year out spectacularly.\"- We've not only closed the year out spectacularly, but we've had an epic bull run on the S&P since about mid 2011. That's quite a while. I think the influx of cheap money is largely responsible for that and that any anticipated benefits of quantitative easing will, at the very least, not be realized in the short term as investors decide that equities are overvalued and that the markets are too complacent. The emerging markets being shaky may be the red flag that gets noticed.   \n4. \"I see solid green for Monday\"-It's possible. The market's had a pretty lousy week, so perhaps my theory is too bearish and the market will shake it off as you suggest. At this point, my money's on red and there are no more bets.
