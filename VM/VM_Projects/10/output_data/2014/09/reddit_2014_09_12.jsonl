{"title": "The 15k challenge! Week #6", "selftext": "So I know I missed last week, but that's because I've been really busy with work and school. It was the first set of exams and they were all really close to each other and I wanted to start the semester off right. I got all A's and one B, so it paid off! Anyways, back to what were here for, trading. I've been focusing on trading a relatively simplistic strategy but with bigger lots. Essentially I've been looking for stocks in an uptrend, but that have take a few days of selling and trying to buy 2-3 out standard expiration calls and going with fewer trades but bigger lots. I'm essentially using options as leverage for a swing trade mentality. Plus a bonus if there is a catalyst in that time-frame. \n\nClosed positions:\n\n* 2 AMBA Sep. 36 calls - I bought these the day before earnings for 1.5 and then sold them after that weekend for 3. So a nice $300 or 100% profit there. I want to look into another long position with this company as I feel like they will benefit a lot from GPRO and any other contracts for developing video chips for police body cameras or stuff like that, but I'm waiting for it to dip back down again.\n\n* AAPL Sep. 5th weekly 100's - This was a stupid trade that I took in the heat of the moment. They expired worthless of course. That was a $180 loss that I blame my emotions for.\n\nNew positions:\n\n* 2 AAPL Sep. $104 calls - This actually went through by mistake. I tried to catch these for a daytrade last Tuesday in the morning before AAPL took off over $103, but my order never filled. I forgot to cancel it and I guess it filled in the late afternoon. The next day was when AAPL dropped almost 5%, so that was fun to find. I think there is still a chance for these to go ITM next week though so I haven't dumped them yet.\n\n* 5 AAPL Oct. $100 calls - This was the AAPL trade I really wanted to do. I picked these up last Thursday near the bottom of the day, pretty proud about that haha. I think that first weekend iPhone sales are gonna blow past any of the other versions, and the interest in pre-sales is proving that. I feel like they will pass 10 million sold in first weekend and I have a $110 price target for the end of the month.\n\n* 10 MU Oct. $33 calls - I really like MU and think that they are a great company and undervalued. I've traded them in the past and done pretty well. Actually my first ever option trade was in MU last November and I made 450%, that's how I got hooked on options. Anyways, MU was fitting my new strategy pretty well, and they have earnings at the end of this month. Pretty confident that they will post solid numbers, I'm looking for $35-36 if they do. \n\n* 1 mil shares PRPM - This is a super sub-penny stock and I know it. But the thing I like about this one is that it trades between .0001-.0003. So I buy when it hits .0001 and then set a limit order for .0002. It's worked for me once before, and my order for .0001 finally filled again. Now it's just a waiting until fill game. It doesn't have great liquidity at all, it's average daily $ value traded is less than 5k. But I view it as low risk because it literally can't go lower than .0001.\n\nOpen positions:\n\nSame as before, still holding on to OPK hoping for rayaldee news before expiry, TGT looking like it will expire worthless, GE holding until we move closer to $30, which I hope the next earnings report will set us on that path. AFOP I've tried to sell twice now and haven't gotten filled and now the trade has turned against me. So that kind of sucks, I would have made 100% if it filled the first time. Anyways, heres the part I'm sure you all most care about\n\n**Open profit/loss = ($960) Closed profit/loss = $32**\n\nWow, that looks really terrible now that I'm typing it out. I'm sure a good part of those open positions will turn around given time. GE, AAPL, & MU are the big ones right now with each value being over $1,000. All the rest are positions of ~$350 or less. So, well see how that turns out, if those 3 are winners it makes up for all the smaller losers and then some. As always, feel free to comment any suggestions, tips, feedback, criticism, confusion, whatever. \n\n\n[Week 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2eyazt/the_15k_challenge_week_4/)", "id": "2g8fxb", "created_utc": 1410554893.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Thinking about getting into MU leading up to earnings.
