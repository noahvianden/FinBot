I'm saying, from a personal finance and fiscal prudence point of view, you shouldn't be speculating.\n\nAs far as terminology goes: the bet you made was on Apple itself. To hedge is to mitigate risk, so in this case, you'd have to structure the trade or take another position that offsets the possible downside to AAPL.. the leg of the trade (or 2nd trade) that does the protection bit is the \"hedging of bets.\" Apple's own products or sales numbers does nothing to hedge your exposure to their stock.\n\nAs far as risk capital goes.. it's really hard to make a rational decision about risk when your rent / mortgage / car payment is in AAPL and AAPL is down a metric shit tonne. There's a reason why people say you shouldn't trade with what you can't afford to lose.. and putting every last dime into a stock trade without having so much as an emergency fund in place is a bit dicey. \n\nRegardless, I wish losses on no one, so I hope it turns out for you.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey man no hard feelings as I can be the same.
