{"title": "GoPro puts too expensive / arbitrage opportunity", "selftext": "I was looking to buy a put position in GoPro and noticed that an at the money put was **significantly** more expensive than an at the money call.  I'm used to those being very close in cost, and there's a principle called [Put/Call Parity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put%E2%80%93call_parity) that suggests they should be very close.\nFor example, with AAPL at $100, the October 100 puts and calls are both about $2.\n\nTo constract this with GoPro: It's trading at about $82 and the October 82 put ($9) sold for over double what the call last sold for($4.30).  After a bit of research I came across [Conversion Arbitrage information](http://www.investopedia.com/university/conversion-arbitrage/conversion-arbitrage4.asp), that suggests the following \"no risk\" strategy:\n\n* buy 82 call @ ask   $4.4\n* sell 82 put @ bid    $8.6\n* short stock @ bid   $81.62\n\nFor one contract this comes out to a profit of $420 (minus commission) on $8162 invested or about 5% profit in 21 days.\n\nHowever, when I attempt to put the trade in, I get an error \"shares not currently available to short\".\n\nAnyone know of any way around this or have thoughts on this situation?  It seems my broker doesn't have shares to short.  Is this common when the stock is rallying so much? (GPro is up 100% over the past 6 weeks).  When should I expect to see this imbalance correct itself?  Is anyone (brokers, market makets, etc) making money on this right now?\n\nArbitrage would be a nice way to get low-risk profit, but I'd also be happy just being able to buy puts for a reasonable price.\n\nThanks,\n-Stan", "id": "2hk0c3", "created_utc": 1411760266.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "This actually looks like a pretty cool way to profit off the ridiculous option prices GPRO has.  \nUnfortunately I don't think there's much you can do about you're broker not having shares available.
