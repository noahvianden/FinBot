{"title": "The 15k challenge! Week #3", "selftext": "This week was kinda meh for me. I started up classes again, so that takes some of my time away from focusing on trading, although that's probably good in the long run. I fucked up a little and I think I figured out it's from not listening to my gut instincts and trying to see things that aren't really there. I'll explain when I list each trade.\n\nClosed trades:\n\n* 2 AIG Sep. $55 calls at .70 - This was a breakeven trade after commissions. I entered at the wrong time so I was happy to get out without a loss. I also did this in my secondary account which gives me more options, but a higher commission. So I would have made at least a little had it been my main account, not much though.\n\n* 2 PLUG Sep. $4 calls at 1.75 - made about $100 on this one. I was hoping for more, but I decided to dump now to avoid the accelerating theta decay. Still about 40% though, so not bad.\n\nNew positions:\n\n* 60,000 shares of SLNX at .0025 - risky otc sub penny stock, I know. But, I've been following this for a while and this area looks to be pretty good support. I'm looking for a quick run up to .004 area maybe .005 and I will dump. It's not uncommon for this stock to have 25-50% moves in a day. If you look at it from april-may, it went fucking crazy and I watched from the sidelines thinking it can't go any higher. I don't think that type of rise will happen again, but I do think I can make a quick $100 or so.\n\n* 3 TGT Sep. $58.5 puts - This one I ignored the option activity in front of me. I guess I convinced myself that the action in the weekly $60 calls were sold to open to gather that high IV premium, although I knew in the back of my head they were buys. I was right about the content of the report though! Missed earnings number, rev number, lower margins especially in canadian division, and lowered forward guidance! And they still went up! When JKS reported an earnings and rev beat, along with increased guidance, they got hammered. Sometimes I just don't get it. \n\n* 15 LULU weekly $41 calls - This is what I was referring to ignoring my gut. I knew I should have got the $40s instead, but my greed was telling me that the breakout was going to be really strong and it would hit $41. The $40s would have been a gamble too, but I would have at least made a little instead of expiring worthless. That put me down about $250.\n\n* 3 JRJC Sep. $9 puts - This is me seeing PLUG in March all over again. Over 100% increase in just 5 days, and irrational exuberance all over stocktwits. I'll be honest, I don't know much about the company, but it doesn't seem like their \"new financial trading services\" announcement warrants an increase of this caliber. I just picked these up this morning, and I thought it would crash today to be honest, but it didn't. It had a bit of faltering, but I'm sure next week it will be going down. \n\nOpen positions:\n\n* AFOP - still holding my calls, have an open order to sell half at .75. Apparently they are presenting at an event on Tuesday, so I'm hoping that they have some good info to share and give the stock a bump. I'll probably dump these this week either way though to free up some cash.\n\n* GE - still holding the Jan. calls, and I'm looking to add to some Mar. calls as well. I'm thinking this will be big. Hopefully we'll see some of the fruits of divestment in Oct. earnings and then a steady rise throughout the remainder of the year.\n\n* OPK - still holding these calls because they are practically worthless, so I've already written them off in my head. That's about another $300, so I'm not too happy about that. I'm still up on the shares I have and will continue to hold for the promising long term prospects, but I purchased those a few months back and don't count towards the challenge. Hoping for second Rayaldee results before expiration so I can salvage something off them.\n\n* JKS - I'm getting ready to dump these, but it never seems to be able to decide which way to go intra-day. The daily chart is looking nice though, and they have been rising on pretty decent volume (except today) so I'm hoping for a touch of $30 next week. Definitely possible, because the last run from around the levels it started at went to $31. I'll continue to hold the Jan. calls though.\n\n**Current closed profit/loss = ($255) Current open profit/loss = ($75)** \n\nI think I'm gonna re-evaluate my strategy a bit. A fellow redditor pointed out some things and I think I'll start applying some of them. I'm gonna try and make a lesser amount trades, but of bigger sizing that I have more conviction in. Like GE, once I free up some cash I will be adding to that. I'm gonna try and play less earnings, especially for companies I haven't really followed in the past. I'm going to listen to my gut instincts more and stop looking for what I want to see. Hopefully that will help, I know I can't have good weeks every week, but a lot of my mistakes so far have been stupid and avoidable on my part. \n\nAs always feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, criticism, ideas, etc. I enjoy hearing your feedback and listening to different perspectives because in the end, this is as much a learning process, as a money-making challenge. Thanks for reading and following along everyone!\n\n[Week 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2dnyjb/the_15k_challenge_week_2/)", "id": "2ebv5v", "created_utc": 1408755936.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Good to see the love on GE !

Their continued efforts to divest from it's non-core competencies will be great for the shareholders and therefore stock price. It's going to improve their margins by getting rid of the 5-10% areas, and focus only on the segments that produce 20+. Not only will that mean they will get better at turning revenue into earnings, but I believe they will be able to command a higher multiple due to that as well. They've gotten beaten down recently and I think they will start to see a nice recovery from that once Oct. earnings come around and wall street sees some of the fruits of their efforts.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1816948652267456}, {"body": "I think that lowering the amount of smaller trades and sticking to your gut on fewer plays will work out better and should lead to less commission fees.
