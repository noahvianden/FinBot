The 90 call is just under a 400 dollar outlay and will give you much more bang for your buck if DIS goes to 95 next week.  And more to my original point, if DIS is trading at $80 at Jan expiry,  BOTH the 80 call and 90 call are pretty much worthless.\n\nFWIW I don't like either trade.  If I am bullish DIS, which I am not, I'd be selling put spreads, buying call spreads or perhaps I'd buy a calendar.  I might even like buying the Jan 80 as long as you also sold an OTM call that's shorter dated.  \n\nDefinitely not a troll or stupid.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I said it was safer which is true.
