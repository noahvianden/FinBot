Doing a lot of reading on stock forums I would guess most think it was a negative.\n\nBut IMHO I see it exactly opposite.   I want Larry, Sergey and Eric in charge.   I do not want people like Carl Icahn influencing the company.\n\nWhen I look at history the fall of some pretty great companies have been caused by boards wanting to make a quick buck or strategically doing stupid things.   A perfect example is the ousting of Jobs from Apple.   The story goes that the board wanted to make further investments into the Apple II as majority of revenue was coming from AII instead of investing into the future on Lisa/Mac, etc.\n\nIf you look at the beginning of Google the founders tried to sell the technology but no one was interested.   Others thought it was crazy to have such a simple site where people found what they wanted quickly and left.   The thought was that you wanted a deep, deep, sticky site where people would stay around for a long time.   Who was right?   Yahoo with huge marketshare at the time or Google? \n\nI feel that if you do not like the direction a company is taking then sell the damn stock.   It is hard for me to believe that some 3rd party would be more interested in the future of the company than the founders.   I view it as the equivalent of who has the best interest of my kids?   Me the parent or some third party that has their own agenda.   That do not really know my kids.   That has not been there since the beginning?\n\nI could give example after example where the \"Experts\" consensus has been negative on moves made by Google management that turned out to be the correct.   \n\nWhat is not clear to me is how can you dilute one class and not another that are both publically sold and keep both in relative sync?   It is different when you have the Goog/Googl class b shares as you don't expect them to stay in sync as they are not publically sold.\n\nThis aspect does worry me.   I could care less about voting but I do worry about purchasing Goog versus Googl if dilution is going to cause a large price difference.   IMHO, voting versus non voting is worth little premium.   But this other aspect maybe does.  Unfortunately I am not sophisticated enough to understand this.\n\nMy 2 cents.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "googl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I believe one of them is a stock for shareholders and the other for non shareholders.
