I fucking hate these fuckers who think that they are harmed by HFT. They don't know shit and fuck them. HFT is one of the reasons why spreads are as tight as [Margot Robbie's](http://www.mycelebrity.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Margot-Robbie-nude-wolf-of-wall-street-8.jpg) pussy vs the pussy of some raggedy ass pornstar's pussy (before vaginalplasty -I'll be nice but picture a nasty hope solo looking pussy). Now I traded on the floor and the [shenanigans](http://www.tokecity.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=165415&stc=1&d=1342716144) that took place were awesome but not all that friendly to retail: spreads were wide, size was small and brokers were expensive. So fuckoff all you jagmeoffs who whine about HFT. IT DOESN'T FUCKING EFFECT YOU. This drives me fucking nuts. Want to know why HFT is good: http://iextrading.com/insight/stats/ yeah those are the IEX states note how they don't do shit less than 1% with REG NMS in place why wouldn't they get more share if HFT was bad? yeah fuck off anti hft cunts.\n\nAs for spoofing.... what is the difference between that an IOC or FOK? This isn't a new strategy fuckers have been doing it for years\n\npeace [i'm out](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7tX40xe2cnw/0.jpg)\n\nHere is some other shit i posted on this:\n\nLast week several news stories were submitted to this thread regarding HFT and whether or not it harms the market and - specifically - individual investors. The benefits of HFT were not being represented so I put together a brief overview designed to explain how and why HFT works and whether it really effects the individual investor; here is the original post and answers to some questions posed by other redditors. As always, if you have any questions feel free to ask.\n\n--- I am not an HFT trader, I generally trade options and futures on indicies and have experience in the pit as well as on the screen. \n\nHere is something I posted last week on this subject. Some may have seen it under the circle jerk comments. As always, happy to answer any questions.\n\nHigh Frequency Trading gets a bad rap and I am afraid that curtailing the proliferation will lead to hurting the individual investor. The IEX exchange will ultimately fail as a result of prohibiting HFT and the trailing inability to execute order due to best ex.\n\nA couple of fallacies regarding HFT:\n\n1. The strategies are new. This is completely false most of the strategies that are currently being employed by HFT are not new - on the contrary - they are time tested and have been around since the open outcry years. These strategies include stat arb, pairs/relative value trades, volatility trading - all of these have been around since the advent of open outcry. New strategies are latency arb where an institutional order is taken out by HFT before hitting the open market - many consider this frontrunning but in actuality it is no different than how large orders get filled in the pits - once committed I can go do my hedge, It isn't illegal and thus not frontrunning (see below).\n\n2. The individual investor is hurt by HFT - this is significantly more false than true - HFT doesn't care about the 10 lot that you are looking to trade in MCD.... they don't because they don't make any money off of it. To the individual investor worried about HFT - limit your risk and send a limit order. (If the SEC really wanted to create a fair market they would create a rule that forces brokers to default to \"limit\" on order tickets as opposed to the more common \"market\"). But what about my mutual funds???? Traded off exchange and then reported - private negotiations for one price. These arent seen by HFT unless the order is **specifically** sent to an exchange for a fill - the trader does this because he believes it to be cheaper than executing upstairs - Cliff Asness on this phenomenon: \n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303978304579475102237652362.\n\n3. HFT frontruns orders - true and false - if a large institution comes in to buy a block they expect to give up a penny or two to the market - this is just the price of doing business. Further, many exchange rules allow you to go out and hedge once you are committed on an order. Now you may say that some are being disadvantaged because they may pay more for hedge - they do - but this is no different than how this activity played out in the pit (whoever was closest to the executing broker usually had the opportunity to get a bigger slice of the order so long as they were BBO. \"But what about them frontrunning me??\" - again, HFT is designed to pick up sub pennies - they don't give a flying fuck about your 10 share fidelity order for MCD @ MKT (use a fucking limit order retail!!!)\n\n4. HFT causes volatility in the market - I don't even know how to respond to this - more fluid markets and greater liquidity = less vol. But what about the flash crash - open outcry traders pulled quotes as well; this is what happens when the market gets crazy see the 1987 crash when HFT didn't exist. Further the order that caused the flash crash was not HFT it was a broker. Lastly, in the 1100 days since the flash crash individual and institutional investors alike have enjoyed fluid markets where orders are filled in a timely, and more importantly best fill price manner.\n\nAlso......\n\nHFT has played a part in......\n\ntightening spreads by 600% or more - in 2000 the tightest spread was $.0625 now liquid instruments trade in fractions of a penny\n\nexecution risk has been lowered as more entities are quoting in the market.\n\ntransaction costs have been lowered from $20 (at the cheapest) to free (robinhood)\n\nPeople who are screaming about HFT are likely people who don't trade or people that don't understand the benefits or how things worked in the past. Prohibiting HFT would be detrimental (percentage wise) to individual accounts for the reasons listed above.\n\n\n**EDIT: Somebody wanted clarification on these statements from another thread:**\n\n*First; from your first sentence you said it won't succeed. What is the measure you're using for success ?*\n\n1. In the past exchange success has been measured by shares (equity) or contracts (derivatives) traded. Since many exchanges are now public they go by profit or market share. For purposes of this debate I am using shares or contracts traded. So here is the short answer IEX, I don't believe, will be able to compete in the market in terms of shares traded and that they will be drowned out by exchanges with more competitive quoting standards- see exchanges have different pricing structures which draw best quotes from the entire market - for example on a maker-taker exchange where I receive a rebate for providing liquidity and if I were making a market on that exchange I will adjust my bid/ask accordingly as well as quote a larger amount of contracts/shares to maximize my rebate. On traditional exchanges where MM pay for order flow (brokers get rebates for sending orders to the floor) spreads may or may not be wider (generally the spreads are the same) but customers trade free, have priority in execution of BD/W or MM orders and are met by continuous 2 sided quotes (many maker taker exchanges do not have obligations to provide 2 sided quotes). Now reg nms requires that customers receive NBBO pricing on orders either by a MM stepping up and quoting NBBO, bettering the NBBO or the exchange sends the order away to where the NBBO is (until ISO is completed but generally customers are taken out at the NBBO due to cus. size being limited). In short other exchanges that have tighter spreads and greater size will continue to receive the bulk of the order flow and REG NMS will continue to mandate cheapest price over execution speed. **TLDR - IEX will not be able to maintain competitive 2 sided quotes due to exchange pricing and REG NMS rules**\n\n2. Point 3 is worded in terms of hedging transactions so this I apologize for the confusion. Say I am large market maker who facilitates block trades (usually a investment bank flow desk [Vockler approved]) Lets say that Vanguard comes in to readjust their portfolio and they want to buy 250,000 shares of XYZ stock - In my inventory I have 200,000 shares of stock leaving me short 50k shares. I can do two things - go out in the market and buy which will increase at an ever increasing pace as MM will raise offers while also fading offer size - after all they need to readjust or hedge their positions and given that the stock is highly volatile they may not be able to do this. I can go out to another bank and trade with them - but they will charge me a premium. I can borrow from my clients but this still costs money in terms of stock loan agreements. As you can see this is becoming a very very expensive proposition. Whatever the solution to the problem the average transaction price will likely be higher (if buying) or lower (if selling) than what the market is showing at the time. Generally these transactions - if they hit the market - are executed with a VWAP algo which will ensure best prices while also taking into account fill needs. **TLDR - you are paying for liquidity that is not in the market**\n\nOn your last point - the analogy is skewed as it relates to the market - stubhub does not offer limit orders which the market does. **TLDR - USE A FUCKING LIMIT ORDER AND HFT WILL NOT EFFECT YOU - RETAIL SHOULD BE USING THEM ANYWAY!!!!!!!!!! (not meant for op - meant for everyone who bitches about HFT)**\n\nLet me know if you have any other ?'s I know the explanation is hard to digest.\n\nand me dealing with fuckers here:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/22iijn/hft_and_you_does_it_matter_to_individual_investors/\n", "id": "2i4m7o", "created_utc": 1412284210.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "This was a good read.

W&R does stuff like that all the time and it really wasn't out of the ordinary (despite what the sec/cftc report said). Because of the imbalance people were simply not bid.\n\n2. HFT and others were selling equities, spy and other correlated assets to hedge the future's buys which then caused the market to go down. What I always find amusing about the flash crash is when people go crazy about acn and pg shitting the bed - if i were pair trading the spus or spy vs a basket it sure as shit wouldn't be hitting those two equities - [pg chart showing lack of correlation between spx and itself- obviously it swings but this is a good eyeball method](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=PG+Interactive#symbol=PG;range=5y) ACN is not a large part of the spx and whereas pg is in the top 10 it still isn't as effective as a basket - I would be hitting aapl, xom, msft and jnj\n\n3.
