Both consoles are selling well better than their predecessors by a good margin, and we're not even a year in.\n\nOn a performance note, look at the first year of the 360 and PS3 and the graphics weren't that much better than stuff on the original xbox and PS2 (at least for games that actually got released in the first year instead of getting delayed). Hell, even with just the added RAM that takes away huge limitations, putting aside the added compute power and both companies pushing into different aspects of cloud computing. Go back and look at Perfect Dark Zero or the first Madden released on 360/PS3 and they look like garbage compared to stuff released even a year or two later.\n\nThe console numbers will be fine.
