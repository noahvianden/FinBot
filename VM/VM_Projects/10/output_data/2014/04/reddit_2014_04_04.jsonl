{"title": "MU - extremely undervalued?", "selftext": "MU confounds me. Despite having a great earnings report yesterday, the stock is down ~3% as I'm writing this. I know there is a sell off in the tech sector today, but in my opinion the tech sell off is because of sky high valuations of certain tech growth companies like AMZN, FB, TWTR, etc...\n\nNow, I'm getting my information from Yahoo here and I'm not sure how quickly this info gets updated. I'm not sure if this P/E ratio is based off of Q1 2014 earnings or the Q2 earnings report released yesterday. As you can see, MU's P/E is closer to the S&P 500 than tech stocks with sky high valuations:\n\nFB - 93.80\n\nSPY (S&P 500) - 17\n\nMU - 13.80  (but might be lower than this, depending on how quickly yahoo updates their page... I'm not sure)\n\nWith that said, analyst's median price target for MU is $30 (again, according to yahoo finance).\n\n\nJuly 2014 $26 calls on MU are going for ~$1. I think this is a very attractive price/strike. How does /r/wallstreetbets feel about this?\n\n", "id": "227abe", "created_utc": 1396629353.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "MU was a great buy under 15. It is a fair buy at this price. I'm sure it could head up from here but it all depends on how the big shareholders are going to exploit the options to maximize returns and earn on volatility. I think the biggest reason it failed to move after earnings and seems to be range bound for now is because that is the best solution for options sellers. \n\nAt this point, I doubt any new money manager will throw in big money for a stake large enough to dry up the static volume and move up the share price.\n\nIf you are so bullish on them, you are better off buying time-value with your options. Go into 2015. If you are right, you will have enough time to profit multiple-fold. If it goes up next month, you will still get lots of time value back for your 2015 calls. Whereas your july calls will give you less and less extrinsic value the deeper in money it goes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That's true. I actually opened up a position in MU several months ago when MU was trading around $20 for some Jan 2015 calls. I'm up about 40% on them. I originally planned on holding these calls until the stock hit $30. I'll stick to that plan. Thanks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "As someone who has spent the last year trying to time the market moves through options I feel I can atleast tell you that it's a losing battle. Option sellers are the big guys, they control the game. The short term options always look so attractive because of giant % returns on big moves. The thing is-- the same kind of big returns can be achieved with less risk in longer term options. \n\nIf you are counting on a 20-30% stock move, then july options might give you 400% returns vs 2015 calls' 300% return but 2015 will allow you to control your exit points and temper your fear/greed which will only improve your returns. Who knows, maybe by 2015 MU will be over 40. It is definitely one of those stocks that can go another 50-100% from here on out.\n\nI have no skin in the game.
