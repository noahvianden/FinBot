This returned **-25%** since someone mentioned it in the post.\n\n\n**Selling ITM Puts on VXX** was another strategy. VXX itself returned **-13%** over the time period. If you sold a -75 delta put on VXX, you would have received $565 in credit, and lost about $1050 at expiry, resulting in about a **200% loss** for selling ITM puts.\n\n\n**XIV** is a short volatility ETF. It returned **+13.41%** over the time period.\n\n\n**Long ATM Straddle**: SPY 190 Jun 21 Straddle was purchased for $450. The put expired worthless, while the call expired ITM by $600, resulting in about a **+33%** gain.\n\n\n**VIX JUN FUTURES**: /VIX JUN closed at 13.90 on May 23. It expired this week at 12.35, resulting in about a **-11%** unlevered loss.\n\n\nHappy Friday, and Happy New-VIX-Low!
