{"title": "Advice on buying some AAPL stock?", "selftext": "Hey guys. My dad and I were interested in buy some sexy Apple stock. our plan is to buy 4 shares (around $2400) and wait till after the stock split, when we'll then have 28 shares. \n\nI wanted to see if you have any advice about this. I have never bought stocks before so although I've been reading a lot about it, I am kinda clueless. I made an account on Etrade and so far, I don't see anything bad about it. Is it really $10 per trade, no hidden fees involved? or is there something I am missing?

It's an  illusion trick that companies attempt to pull on unsuspecting investors. Don't fall for it.\n\nSet a price target and a stop loss limit. You MUST be disciplined to when you hit that target. Don't chase a stock on its way up, and don't panic when it drops a little bit. Keep to your targets.\n\nStock tend to suffer a drop immediately after a split but may have a small bounce back up a few days afterwards. A 7:1 split is a bit unusual, so I'm thinking it'll cause lots of volatility and be shaky for the few days surrounding the split. I'd actually take advantage of that volatility rather than going in right now, pre-split. All the potential gains from the split announcement would be calculated in by now, as you can see the rise from ~$530 to where it is today at ~$600. That's a relatively big gain, and I'd imagine most of that would probably be given back after the split (unless they come with with tremendous news between now and then). So I expect it to settle around $550 by the end of June, at which time we should hear more about their up coming products (iphone 6 or whatever) and then we can decide where it'll go after that.\n\nI'd suggest you hold off and seriously reconsider your entry price point.\n\nPS.
