Since we are now in the requirements gathering phase, we are open to suggestions as to what features should be implemented for version 1.0, so please give us some input on what would help you be a better trader :).

Not only does it do everything, it has a built in scripting interpreter to let you write in anything they haven't already thought of.\n\nThey also include service that breaks down the source s of a company's income.  For example, what percent of Apple's bottom line is iPhone sales.  It then let's you tweak the number to see what the stock price might do as the number changes.\n\nWhat could you guys do?  If you're stock oriented, make fundamental analysis easier.  As good as TOS is, it's mainly data driven.  Mostly technical analysis.  If you provide a way to plainly see where one company stands compared to its peers,  That would be useful.\n\nIf you plan on taking on options, TOS already has it.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "MAC SUPPORT^^^^", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Don't use silverlight for anything!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21077054738998413}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15695811808109283}, {"body": "What does a stock market software mean? \n\nA trading platform?

Quantopian has the best idea but execution isn't the best. In house we have something similar to zipline which is much better but still has its limitations. Commercially prodigio has tried the software was terrible. TS is loved by many but too clunky for my intraday trading needs and I've noticed some of the data coming through he platform doesn't match what the exchange is publishing. ToS is again limited in this regard especially when it comes to backtesting and live trading (again don't have much experience with it) and I've never used ninja.\n\n>Screening\n\nFinviz does this right\n\n> Analysis\n\nno comment on this one as I don't use fundamentals.\n", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Trading - definitely with other brokers.\n\nScripting - we need to think this in detail, to see if we can come up with something that a regular person (non-developer) can use.\n\nScreening and analysis - hopefully we can implement those on version 1.0 of our product.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "our in house solution is built with a very nice gui with the ability to write custom python.
