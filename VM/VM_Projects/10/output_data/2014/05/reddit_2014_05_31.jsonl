{"title": "What's the point of trading options?", "selftext": "I'm not saying it's bad to invest in options, but i'm asking for the point of TRADING various option strategies when the market's always trending. \n\n\nJust by looking at the chart of SPY on D1 timeframe, it's clear that it's been a bullish trend for almost 3 years now. So why is it that many traders will trade volatility, iron condors, ect...when it's simple as just buying and holding? \n\nCorrect me if i'm wrong, but if the market is trending bullish like it is right now, why exit your position or do all these fancy trading strategies? \n\n\nThe reason why I ask this is because i got out of my  AAPL trade today with a 1:3 ROI, so it did pretty well. As i was exiting, i was wondering to myself \"Why am i evening exiting this trade? I have no confirmation that it'll go down, so why am i not holding?\" \n\nMaybe this is a stupid question, i don't know. \n\nEDIT: Before someone says it, yes i realize that the market doesn't trend 100% of the way and that there are numerous retraces. \n\nEDIT2: Sort of confused at the downvotes seeing how this is a valid question on an Option trading thread.

This is assuming the trader is correct about the direction of the market.\n\n... sounds like you need to wrap your head around risk and money management a little better first.\n\n\"returns\" can be just a matter of exposure and risk. So arguably, nearly any instrument can 'return better' than the market given enough risk taken on..\n\nSince you used the term \"ROI\", then yes, explosively more on the return side vs the capital put up to take the trade. But saying this isn't fair, since I know the spirit of what you were asking is more like: \"given equivalent risk..\"\n\nOptions get one advantage here that stocks can never have, you can define your risk down to the penny if you so wish (long calls/puts, you only risk the premium you pay.. with spreads, you are able to hard limit your downside by accepting a cap on the upside.) With stocks, even with a stop loss, the business risk factors make nothing guaranteed. You could wake up one morning and see your trade down 50%+ thanks to horrible earnings, cooked books, hidden losses, etc.. your stop loss won't help here, it will just trigger and sell your shares at the next available market price, be it a few cents or few dollars lower than what you hoped to be filled at.\n\nThen again, you can also define your risk as unlimited and lose way more than you ever expected (or even have in your account) with options as well (selling naked options on their own or as part of a combination.) It all depends on how you structure your trade (and what types of options combinations/strats your broker lets you trade, often broken into \"levels\".)\n\nReally though, your questions and framing make the case that you should spend some time (if even just 20 minutes) reading up on options in general.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI'm assuming the trader is only going to be correct ~50-55% of the time with their directional trades. You can point out the perma-bull market we're in thanks to the FED and co.   ..but in the end, even fools make money during bull markets, and people are still going to take silly risks thinking they can't lose given the bull market we've been in... \n\nThe take away isn't that options are better than stocks... (I fear by the tone of your posts and replies that you're viewing this as a big 'us' vs 'them' between stocks and options...) they are just another tool to express your opinion of the market, as they add other dimensions to the trade (like time and volatility..)

With purchases of the underlying you're either a buyer, seller, or neutral. You can modify the quantity of your shares, but that's really it. With options you can take all of the positions of the underlying, you can incorporate spreads with regards to volatility and time itself, you can modify the quantity of contracts, the expiration date, your greek position, and so much more. There is more room to find something that makes sense to you. For me, options just seem like an extremely profitable operation to get involved in along with my actual investments.
