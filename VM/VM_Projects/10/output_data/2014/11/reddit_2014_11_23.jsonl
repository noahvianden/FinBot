Hopefully we see  a close below 160's - I have some put debit spreads for .90c (2.5$ wide, pretty cheap!)\n______________________________________________\n\nLong Haul\n\nPBR- Looking for a confirmed reversal then will step in depending on IV/Rank\n\nHAL- Looks like this shit company spawned from Satan has a double bottom./ Again just waiting for confirmation\n_____________________________________________\n\nTrying to make sense out of why WMT is 85$ with crazy momentum but NFLX is Zero for the year...
