If I did have an opinion, my personal directional guesses tend to be about the same odds as coin flips. Like I said, it is best to decide on exit points before putting on the position. There is no right or wrong to any reasonable plan, because they are so many different trading styles. Some traders scalp for quick pennies, some like to go for a lower win percentage, but bigger winners. Some like to close trades quickly, some like to let short options expire (hopefully worthless). Again, no right or wrong way. There are success and unsuccessful traders at any almost all parts of the curve.\n\nWhat was the plan before you got in? Stay with that plan. \n\nAdvice? Trade small. Don't make things so complicated. Don't ever do a credit spread for that small an amount again, even a nickel credit is probably too small to make it worth it on a $1 wide spread. Your best case on the put leg is break even after commissions (negative after exchange fees) and that's if it all expires. Worst case a huge loss.
