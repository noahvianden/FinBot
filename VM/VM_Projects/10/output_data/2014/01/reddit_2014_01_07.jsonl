Those guys have great incentive to get off of gas and diesel and if a company can make on that fits their budget, its going to do well.  TSLA only sold 5500 cars last quarter.  Thats not a huge amount.  These guys have a standing bus order for non-electric vehicles and are going to introduce their eBus at a major tradeshow in February.  This new production only started in February so they have made great progress.  Maybe in two or three years time you'll sing a different tune.  They have a long way to go to get there, but its possible.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20348595082759857}, {"body": "Well SA is filled with lots of writers who have an agenda or didn't you know that.  Just take a look at the BS some of the people wrote about UNIS and you'll see what I am talking about.  The company is just starting to ramp their revenues.  How did TSLA's financials look the first few years?  The company is about to introduce their eBus line at a major show in Las Vegas.  Financials are what startup financials look like.  They had some missteps, but now are on an upward growth climb. They anticipate sequential growth.

I want people to know about a company I think has great potential. Anybody who posts has an agenda.  You don't have an agenda yet the first thing you brought up was a negative article from some unknown author on SA, yet in the same breath you say what the CEO says isn't worth anything.  Seems a little hypocritical. ", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "That was exactly my point though. Everyone has an agenda and that shouldn't be used to discredit an argument. \nI didn't bring up the SA article, someone else did. I had a look over and it seemed pretty thorough. I'm just not interested in such companies and was offering my $0.02. I didn't say CEO's comments are worth nothing, I just noted that if anyone should have an agenda, then it should be the CEO you should discount for his claims. He has more to gain from positive coverage of his company.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Why would you think that an SA author doesn't have as much to gain or lose as a CEO?  Having an agenda is having an agenda.  You say it was a thorough analysis, but did you look at what the company has done and said in comparison.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't thorough.  A CEO has a lot more at stake both personally and legally.  The SA has no legal responsibility whatsoever and can say basically anything, no different than a tabloid.  As long as there is a kernel of truth, you're ok.  You have to take both with a grain of salt.  ", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You are not getting the point. I don't really care about SA author or CEO, I was just being the devils advocate. You were trying to discredit an article because the writer has an agenda according to you. If you want to discredit the article maybe you should find particular points that are misrepresented. It would work better than speculating on the next Tesla. There is no comparison between an penny stock and a $15B company (over-valued or not).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I get your point and you aren't getting mine.  I just said that the author had an agenda and zero credentials.  You certainly can make a comparison between the two companies regardless of valuations.  Thats like saying you can't compare the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees because the Yankees are valued 1000x what Houston is valued.  You are overly simplifying this based solely on stock price and marketcap.  They are both in the eVehicle industry.  One is already building vehicles for sale, the other is just getting their first one completed.  Does GACR have a long way to go, sure it does. Could it be the next TSLA? why not?  I'm not trying to discredit the SA author because that would give him too much credibility.  Rather I'll let what the company does stand on its own. I'm not worried about what the price of the stock is tomorrow or a couple of months from today.
