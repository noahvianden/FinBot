I know there are extensive options guides all over the internet, but to someone new, they're not always easy to find. It also helps to see these guides in addition to hearing others explain how puts work and the risks associated with them. Hearing the same information in multiple places and in multiple ways does wonders for understanding that information.\n\nAt an rate, OP, the biggest risk for buying any options is that a large portion of the time, you can end up losing everything you put into them. If your option doesn't get into the money (or above your strike for calls or below your strike for puts) by expiration, it expires worthless. \n\nThis risk can also be a benefit though. Unlike shorting a stock, buying a put option means you can only lose the money you paid for the option. When you short, you can have a theoretical infinite loss if your short thesis is wrong. \n\nThere's a lot more to look at for buying options too, so I'd encourage you to research that as well.
