{"title": "Would like to know when to take my profits!", "selftext": "Hello!\n\nSo right now I'm currently trading options. I'm fairly new to this. But one of many questions that I have is... When do I take my profits? So far I bought a contract for 2.03 and right now it's at 2.88. I spent around 220 dollars in total, and I have a profit about 90 dollars.\nI sometimes feel that I \"gamble\" during profit taking times. Maybe it's lack of knowledge that leads me to continue to \"believe\" that I'll be making more profit, but in reality it's a straight up guess to be honest. I know I should educate myself more, but I just wanted to know, when do you take profits? Whether it be stocks or options? Also, is there a topic in trading called \"Profit Taking\"? If there is I would like to really look into that topic.\n\nThanks always!\n\nThis is what I've posted in /r/investing. I noticed after someone posted that I haven't even stated whether it was a put or a call.\n\nSo to be specific I am paper trading and after learning a little bit about options, I decided to buy an option just to see what would happen. I'm still very inexperienced in options, but I happened to by a AAPL 96 call at 2.03. I ended up selling it already at 3.10, but my main question is when do I take my profits. I'm sure today was luck, but is there a theoretical time when I should be taking profits?\n\nAnd about my trade today, what happened? I don't even know where to find how much I paid for my option contract on the ToS platform...
