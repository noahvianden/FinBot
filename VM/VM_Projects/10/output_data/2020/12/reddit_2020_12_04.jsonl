They are carving out a different niche in electric vehicles making school busses and commercial trucks. Lion\u2019s school busses take on traditional school bus makers such as Blue Bird (BLBD). Lion\u2019s trucks take on models from companies such as Paccar (PCAR) and Navistar International (NAV). Many of Lion\u2019s trucks are targeted at applications such as waste hauling and utilities.\n\n> Most of the traditional products Lion competes with are powered by diesel fuel. But electric vehicles make a lot of sense in commercial, fleet applications. Those vehicles, for starters, are driven more than passenger cars so the benefits from cheaper electricity for charging versus diesel accumulate faster.\n\nAlso:\n\n> Lion has had early traction selling its products and says the company has firm orders in place for several hundred trucks and buses in 2021, and sees up to 6,000 orders from its current pipeline. Customers tend to purchase a handful of vehicles at first, test them out in working conditions, then scale up their orders based on that experience. Existing customers include Amazon.com (AMZN), Waste Connections (WCN), and Molson Coors (TAP).\n\nAnd:\n\n> [Shares of the reverse merger company], which will become Lion, rose 7.4% Monday after the deal announcement.

{"title": "This thought keeps haunting me since I started investing", "selftext": "(This mostly refers to the first \"general\" picking of possible growth stocks apart from any fundamental or technical aspects, please consider this post in that way)\n\nWhen I started screening stocks in the past and also while keeping track of them right now, I had the weird feeling that most real growth stocks had their explosive gains when they were priced at a fairly \"smaller\" amount (around pennystock to \\~$25 range) than the ones priced in the 3-4 digit range. \n\nAs an example: Stock 1 is priced at $5 and Stock 2 is priced at $500. My mind keeps telling me that it's way easier/normal/more likely for Stock 1 to grow 400% to $25 than for Stock 2 to grow 400% to $2500. Which is basically stupid, because they both had the same growth.\n\nOn the other hand it just feels to me that there are almost no higher priced fast growing stocks than alot of cheaper priced stocks that are growing rapidly. And this just feels a little bit weird to me, because there are also not that many stock splits happening for those higher priced stocks..\n\nIf you think about it, most of the higher priced stocks already had their huge gains in the past (because most of them didn't have an IPO that high and also started as pennystock or in the 1-2 digit range) and they turn into a more \"established\" stage. Like how could you expect them to grow another 400% in the future??\n\nIn conclusion, how could one buy a stock priced $500 (started at $50) with the hope for it to be a growth stock (which is funny, because it already was one) instead of buying a stock priced $10 which didn't have such rally yet and is expected to grow in the future. So, what's the reason, alot of people still  buy a highpriced, already well-established and kinda saturated stock, that had it's huge gains in the past, expecting them to have such high gains again? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe honest,  would you really buy amazon now with the expection that it doubles again from $3200 to an crazy amount of $6500, while it almost doubled from $1700 since the beginning of this year?\n\nPlease let me hear your thoughts on that, I'm really curious \ud83d\ude00", "id": "k6ilm9", "created_utc": 1607078270.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "You\u2019re operating under the assumption that stocks only go up. \n\n$5 stocks are way more likely to go down or nowhere then a $500 blue chip", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42629897594451904}, {"body": "Amazon, Apple, shopify, Tesla, Berkshire, google... all of them have had stock prices of $500 or more at some point and are now several multiples higher than that.

I have many databases, containing things like ISP data, security footage, text messages, GPS data, voice recordings, credit card transactions, emails, public records, and satellite images. I need a way to connect my datasets to generate insight, which in the case of the NSA means spying on someone.\n\nPalantir sells the software to do that. It works in multiple steps.\n\n1) It uses my datasets to create a knowledge graph where the nodes are all people, places and things in the \"universe\" and the edges indicate their relationship. It's like a social network, but in addition to connections to my friends, family, and coworkers, there is also an edge connecting me to my phone, my home, my car, my preferred Wendy's, etc.\n\n2) Using the connections in that knowledge graph, it can create a coherent and complete timeline for a given person by piecing together data points from my whole data ecosystem. This requires machine learning and AI to extract signal from unstructured data like images and text, and the use of pattern matching to de-annonymize data by linking it back to specific people.\n\nThe end result: Reconstructing a model of the past by connecting all data breadcrumbs left along the way, and then predicting the future based on past events.", "id": "k6oaha", "created_utc": 1607099767.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "The more important question I want answer is \"what is Palantir\" instead of \"what does Palantir do\"?\n\nDoes Palantir require heavy consulting (people) to implement their services or is Palantir a more of a pure software/SaaS play?\n\nThe stock only recently went up after one of the analysts put PLTR in the software/SaaS category which normally gets awarded a higher valuation. \n\nHowever, I keep reading articles where Palantir consultants are required for deployment.

It's 57 pages long, and describes Tesla's efforts and achievements in having a positive impact in multiple areas.\n\nTesla makes a particular effort to be environmentally proactive, including vehicle emissions, factory emissions, full life cycle emissions, recycling, etc. - see pages 6 to 19.\n\nOther impact areas discussed in the document include product impact (encouraging widespread use by cutting price, supercharger network, etc.), active safety features (crash avoidance), passive safety features (crash safety), fire safety, cyber security, Tesla disaster relief projects, making the grid more resilient through storage, solar power, supply chain (responsible material sourcing) \"people and culture\" (employee safety, ergonomics, financial and health benefits, diversity and inclusion, workforce development, and so on. The report has several pages of appendix, describing metrics, sources, and methodologies for the numbers claimed.\n\nThe diversity and inclusion section is on page 44, with a statement of their position and what they're doing about it. The Employee Resource Groups they support are Black at Tesla, Intersectionality at Tesla, Latinos at Tesla, LGBTQ at Tesla, Veterans at Tesla, and Women in Tesla. Their claims are \"Forbes Best Employer For Diversity 2019\", \"HRC Corporate Equality Index 100% 5th year in a row\", and \"Military Friendly Employer 3rd year in a row\".\n\nRegarding discussions of \"only hiring the best\", Tesla appears to believe they can help with the diversity and inclusiveness of their workforce by recruiting (making people aware that there are jobs available), and by working to make the working environment friendlier to the various groups, making good candidates in the various groups more inclined to apply to work at Tesla.\n\nSome of the TSLAQ like to claim that Tesla is willing for their employees to die from COVID-19 in order to make as much money as possible. I would note that Tesla has had considerable experience protecting from COVID-19 starting very early in the pandemic, implemented safety protocols at their factories that were reviewed and approved by the local governments, and according to the numbers released so far they appear to have been fairly effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 among the employees. I will be interested to see what information on this will be included in the future 2020 impact report.\n\nMy overall impression of Tesla on \"impact\" is that they very much want to do the right things, and that they put a lot of effort into it.\n\n(I have no idea where Interactive Brokers gets their data.

These are the advantages that come along with them: avoid gamma risk, increase max profit, decrease max loss, increase the range of profitability by going out further in strikes to collect a decent amount of credit and the added ability to manage a losing spread with ease. \n\nThe only issue with selling 45DTES is that theta decay on the spread is rather slow and contraction of IV doesn\u2019t have nearly as much of an impact as it does on a short strangle or even IC.

Yesterday,  have popped in over ~150% gains in the week of the merger (including substantial dips). \n\nArko Holdings LTD. is an Israeli-based company which owns over 3000 retail stores in USA over 20+ states, and looking for further business expansion next year.\n\nMy DD is based off their positive financials and revenue growth over COVID which leaves more hope for the future of brick&mortar stores, and they operate in convenience / groceries, which reminds me of $USFD (US Foods, spiking ~80% in the last 2 months), and a little of foreign companies like OZON (Russian e-commerce retailer similar to shop or amazon), gaining 20% in the last two weeks since IPO, due to foreigner companies doing US business/stock exchange.\n\nMost importantly, last 2 SPAC mergers in QS and LAZR, are looking fire hot right now in their valuation increases, while both are in the EV bubble, Arko is already well established, and for a company about to merge at NAV, they are grossly undervalued. Arko Holdings trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at ~76 USD, while remaining at ~10 USD NAV on NASDAQ.\n\nHYAC + Arko SPAC will likely pop in the coming days, get it in while you can.\n\nTLDR: New SPAC merger between HYAC and ARKO HOLDINGS sitting at NAV($10), very high upsides due to people on the EV train/bubble and not looking at other companies with established financials and growth - recent mergers in QS and LAZR indicate potential pops with low downsides.

Arko Holdings is very solid if you track their history and will grow over time.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's your own DD, make your own speculations.

{"title": "FEAC (DraftKing guys) and why it\u2019s good for a short-term 30% return.", "selftext": "FEAC is a SPAC being used to send the company Skillz Inc public. A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagle\u2019s CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. \n\nSkillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely haven\u2019t heard of most of the games Skillz\u2019s represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I can\u2019t seem to figure out. \n\nNoteworthy Facts:\n1. Forbes named it on its list of the next \u201cBillion dollar start ups\u201d. CNBC named Skillz the \u201cglobal leader in eSports\u201d. \n2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. \n3. They expect user growth to get into the \u201chundreds of millions within the next two years\u201d. \n4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slone\u2019s success. \n5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. \n6. Working towards being incorporated into Peleton bikes. \n\nSkillz checks the box on financials. The rest is up to interpretation. The important take aways for me here is that it\u2019s backed by a guy with a great eye for gaming and a company that has somehow added gambling to these games. I also am seeing little talk about it on stock forms (only 2 posts on WSB in the last 3 months) and the general media for a company that is getting high marks from some major hitters like Forbes and CNBC. It\u2019s been on a steady rise since it officially announced its IPO on Monday, so don\u2019t expect a 100% return, but it\u2019s in no way done. 2 rocket ship emojis \n\nPositions: $50k stock. \nSelling 50% at $20, 25% at $22 and holding 25% long term.", "id": "k6wimt", "created_utc": 1607125525.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "I bought FEAC two weeks ago, now that it\u2019s showing up on WSB I\u2019m tempted to sell.", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42326122522354126}, {"body": "DD after it\u2019s already shot up.
