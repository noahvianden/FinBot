{"title": "My rules for putting on iron calendars / double diagonals", "selftext": "tldr;\n\n0. Only pick underlyings that have weeklies available\n\n1. Use 3 year weekly ATR (average trading range) around ATM to pick the long legs; legs are always OTM\n\n2. Use 1 year daily ATR around ATM to pick the short legs; legs are always OTM\n\n3. *Always* keep at least one strike between your short leg and ATM; roll if it \"tests\"\n\n4. Sell short leg as close to 21DTE as possible; roll 2 weeks out as close to 10DTE as possible\n\n5. Long leg should be at least 180DTE when initially putting on trade; roll at 45DTE\n\n6. For put diagonal, *always* do a ratio (sell fewer shorts than longs) so a market dislocation doesn't kill your portfolio\n\n7. For call diagonal, sell 1:1 to longs until the cost basis is reduced to 0\n\n8. When cost basis is 0, sell a smaller ratio of shorts to longs for *cash generation* and start looking to roll the long leg further out to continue the trade\n\n\nDetails...\nI try to pick stocks that are sideways or have a slow grinding trend. I have a proprietary way of picking the names, but I primarily look at how long it would take to \"pay off\" (i.e. reduce cost basis of long leg to $0) and only pick names that can pay off a 180DTE long leg within 120 days (assuming all conditions are perfect) using a 7DTE weekly. Then, I may still buy a long leg that is even further out (360+ DTE) because the name meets my minimum premium requirements.\n\nI buy long legs at least 1 3yr weekly ATR away from ATM. My short leg is then sold out 1 1yr daily ATR away (subject to rule 3). This means the majority of my diagonals start out inverted (short inside of long) so a swift movement of the underlying guarantees a loss. This is why it's important to pick names that don't move quickly. :)\n\nUsually, the first time I roll the short leg I have collected sufficient credit that the *second sale* guarantees a scratch or small profit even if the underlying moves rapidly. So it's a high risk for the first two weeks and then that risk dissipates rapidly after the first roll. By third roll, that risk should be gone.\n\nTheta decay behaves differently when the strike is ATM versus OTM (or ITM), so I prefer to always have one strike between my short and ATM so that strike is treated as OTM. When the underlying tests the strike next to my short, I look to roll out one strike and 1 week for even or a credit. Note that the volatility smile near ATM makes this easier since the further out strike is \"higher up\" the smile than the one I'm closing, so a credit is almost always available. Avoid names with a \"smirk\" or frown because this is harder / impossible to do.\n\nIn my analysis, the OTM short legs really start burning theta at 21DTE (hmmm, where have I seen that number before? heh). I target selling 24DTE exactly so that I can roll at 10DTE. I don't want to hold the short closer to expiration than 10DTE since gamma risk starts accumulating *very rapidly* at that point (really at 7DTE but I like some more buffer). Some names with very low IV don't lose a lot of value until last 7DTE, so I *may* make an exception in a few cases, but my line-in-the-sand is absolutely 5DTE, no further exceptions. Of course, the rolling rules apply if the short gets tested.\n\nWhen I roll, I again target that 24DTE (20-30DTE is always achievable). Note that this requires weeklies so that there is always an option chain for 2 weeks / 14 days out. Monthly-only names would require rolling to about 40DTE which I don't want. I like the flexibility of the weeklies and the ability to do a 1 week roll if a short gets tested. *Easier to be nimble* with weeklies. I will likely test one iron calendar with shorts sold at 60DTE and rolled at 30DTE to compare; this test will likely require revising how I choose my short leg since I'll be in the trade longer.\n\nNote that I don't care about the delta of the short leg. Applying these rules means it is always a lower delta than its paired long which is good enough.\n\nOnce my longs have been paid down to $0, I move to only selling a fewer number of shorts versus those longs and/or I move the shorts *outside* of the longs to lock in a gain if there's a swift move. The cash generation is nice. On a 700DTE LEAP that gets paid off in 120 days, you have 500 days of potential cash generation. As the longs get closer to expiration (e.g. under 60DTE), look to roll them further out in time. The underlying will likely have moved so it's no longer centered between the long calls & puts, so try and roll the strikes too to recenter.\n\nTo guard against crash scenarios, my put calendars are *always* ratio'ed. My point of max pain is usually a 20% down move and then the put calendars start making money again. Note that swift down moves pump the vega on the *long leg* more than the short, so there are other benefits to the ratio. Ideally you'll own some \"left tail\" insurance via standalone long UVXY calls or something. The calendar itself is incomplete protection. The ratio mitigates the loss but does not eliminate it.\n\nFor the call diagonal, I maintain 1:1 ratio. I am not worried about waking up to a 25% rally in any of my names. If that happens, it would likely be limited to a single name (merger, acquisition, miracle cure, etc). If the *entire market* has moved up 10-20% overnight, then hyperinflation has probably taken hold or benevolent aliens have given us cool tech. I'm not worried about it.\n\nLastly, I really treat both diagonals as a single position to be managed. The call and put diagonals work synergistically. If one gets run over, I take off the entire position for a gain and then look to try again. If this happens, it usually means the name is too volatile because I wasn't able to roll away from the move quickly enough. AAPL recently (this week) did this with that crazy move from $123 to $133 in 2 days.

They are the second largest gold producer and in the top 15 for copper production\n\nThe two pillars of owning $GOLD are:\n\n1. inflation hedge\n2. bad news hedge\n3. **liquidity bubble implies money flow into funds rather than out of the system!  Hence, why puts are irrelevant in a liquidity bubble.**\n\nThe reason you should buy them as a hedge are because they produce a 400KT of copper, so their cost of production of gold is the lowest in the industry.\n\nIn fact, last quarter @ 3.00 /lb copper and 1900/oz gold they had a free cash flow of 1.2 Billion USD in 1 quarter!\n\nCopper has gone up to 3.50/lb and expect to hit 4.00 going forward because of the EV boom.\n\nOther than their FCF, what makes $GOLD a compelling call buy is that gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and risk.  But now we have a liquidity bubble, so fund of flows will eventually move into gold.\n\nCurrently the fund of flows are QQQ > IWM growth into value.  Eventually, they'll move from value into inflation hedges (commodities/mining stock and gold).  This is why you want to buy $GOLD LEAP as a hedge and start positioning into it before the market makers (MM).\n\nRight now, everyone is owning EV or ARKG but when that changes, they'll look for alternatives, but with stock prices at an All Time High, you'll likely see them chase gold by the middle of 2021.", "id": "kivg4v", "created_utc": 1608738623.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Crashed and then after a week rocketed like no other commodity this year.
