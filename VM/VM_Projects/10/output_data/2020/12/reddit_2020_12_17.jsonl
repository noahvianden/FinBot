As stupid as some of these tips are they have helped me for the last 6 years in my retirement accounts. Also helped me to capitalize this last year with the 5k I had on hand\n\n* **Buy and Hold**\n   * People who tell you differently are wild. No need to short, do options, etc. I have achieved 120%+ returns in my 401k since I started investing 6 years ago doing only this.\n* **Picking stocks - for me I do three things**\n   * *I subscribe to news that will tell me about great companies* and then I look deeper into them.\n   * *I ask myself if the 'opportunity' for this company is greater than 10x* their current market cap, someday down the road. 5 years, 10, 20. Pretty simple question, not looking for a ton of analysis here. Just want to believe convincingly that they will be significantly larger down the road.\n      * ex. Amazon has a 1.6 T market cap. I bought some last month, I would say yes, they could certainly 10x from here. You could argue this, but for me I keep it simple.\n      * I will look at similar companies with similar customer bases to bolster my thoughts on the company. Will also ask friends who use the product if it isn't something I use at my company.\n   * *Are they 'executing' as a company.*\n      * This one is more financial related but again, pretty simple. Normally I will look at revenue growth and speed of revenue growth related to their market cap. 10-20x depends on growth used to be a good figure. It is now not since many stocks are very expensive now.\n      * Ex. AirBnB is an 80B market cap company right now. Their revenue is 4.8B for the year. Growing roughly 30% year over year.\n      * There are other metrics you could look at like customer stickiness, multiples, profitability, etc I usually for my own sake go through the equity report by morningstar (they are unbiased0 unlike other research firms. But I don't think most people need to do this.\n* I do these things but I have a 'philosophy' I sort of follow. Have loved E-commerce, software and any high margin businesses. Companies that I don't buy are ones that I feel could be easily replicated or made irrelevant if they don't adapt and invest into R&D. I also don't like companies that could potentially\n   * Ex. DocuSign seems to be great but I have never bought them. I feel a similar service could easily be placed into SFDC, Dynamics, and other software that we use. Will this happen? Probably not, but it tarnishes my answer to will they 10x as a company and there are too many companies I am more interested in after. Even if it were replicated by large software providers I can't say that it would largely affect them as a company.\n\nI own around 30 stocks/ETF's in my own 401k portfolio. Here is my performance on my mobile this year just buying on what was deemed the worst two days since 1987 in the stock market, only had 5k extra money to spend.

That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big \u201cShake-out\u201d points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It\u2019s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or \u201ccross\u201d. \n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1.    Portfolio fit \u2013 Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n\n2.    Liquidity Check \u2013 If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance \u2013 look for \u201cAverage Volume.\u201d Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest \u2013 this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n\n3.    IV Percentile  \u2013 Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it\u2019s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it\u2019s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it\u2019s current volatility is low \u2013 and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n\n4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n\n5.    Strike Price \u2013 First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity \u2013 delta \u2013 to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well \u2013 higher intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6.    Expiration \u2013 Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta \u2013 a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date \u2013 your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7.    Position size \u2013 This is important \u2013 BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It\u2019s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8.    Future moves \u2013 Think beyond what\u2019s going on with a stock than just in the current day \u2013 unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don\u2019t rush your entry \u2013 You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I\u2019d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.\n\nThis is a write-up i did today to assist beginners AND experienced traders with understanding everything that needs to be understood in the markets.

Volatility has the ability to jump many fold in a matter of minutes, or collapse within a day.
