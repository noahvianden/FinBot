{"title": "My Plays For 12/24/2020", "selftext": "**My Plays For 12/24/2020**\n\nI used the RSI, Stochastic, MACD, Volume Profile, and the 10-50-200EMA Lines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$ACCO:**  New channel that has a new support area which is awesome. Can easily drop to the 50EMA line for a new buy in location. Stoch is oversold.\n\n**$ADC:** Is it a channel, or a triangle? We will see but this is a great buy in price. If it dies, buy in near $62 for easy profit, but can easily run another 10%. \n\n**$AEP:** Great support area, Stoch and RSI are oversold as well. If it doesn't live go long around $79 for an even better value.\n\n**$AMH:** Very easy to see ascending triangle. Buy in any time now, and it should blast up soon for an easy 7-20%. Riding both EMA lines as well, Stochastic oversold.\n\n**$AMRX:** Showing life at the POC Volume Line. Right above all 3 EMA lines, as well -- so this is an extremely strong support area. Go long for some easy money.\n\n**$AOS:** Channel Up play right at a support. May drop to the 200EMA line though, so it has plenty of buy in areas but this one is very strong to go long.\n\n**$ARCT:** If you like run ups this is a technically sound one. Channel up, 50EMA, support a few dollars away/ Bullish Divergence and Stoch oversold should be a good play.\n\n**$ATO:** What a beautiful deal here, can't get too much lower. Stoch shows Divergence and RSI is actually oversold. Great setup!\n\n**$BTG:** Channeling up, strong support area, and over the 50EMA. It is beautiful set up overall.\n\n**$CGEN:** Ran up like I called, now pulling back, this is a strong support area lined up with the 50EMA line. Stoch is oversold, so it has volume ready to roll.\n\n**$DD:** Simple channel up again, above the 50EMA line, but the Stochastic is very oversold, so it has plenty of room to run. May drop to $63 for a resistance retest though.\n\n**$DOC:** Showing higher lows, and still running. POC Lines is very strong support area, and at a good value. Stoch and RSI almost oversold so we may see it dip just a little more. \n\n**$DOCU:** Similar to $DOC, it has room to run down as well. Stoch is almost oversold, but this is basically an ascending triangle -- and it has signs of blasting soon!\n\n**$EMP:** Low risk, low reward triangle but could be a very calm 5% to win. Price action is beautiful otherwise.\n\n**$FR:** Ascending Triangle which I love, and it is neat trend line and support area. It has room to run up though, but I think it may take a day or two of red, then it'll take off. \n\n**$NG:** Support area, mixed with channel up, Stoch over sold showing divergence? Love it go long.\n\n**$OXLC:** Channeling up very well, but may drop to support area near the 200EMA as well. I think it will keep running up, just a matter of when.\n\n**$SXC:** Old trendline resistance becoming a possible support? Love it. Partnered with the 200EMA and support area as well, Stoch oversold and so is RSI, gonna be great!\n\n**$UMH:** Support test here, Stoch oversold as well.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 28th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks ready to close out powerful 2020 as risks loom in January  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/24/stocks-ready-to-close-out-powerful-2020-as-risks-loom-in-january.html)**\n*****\n> At the close of trading next Thursday, the bull market will be ready to run into 2021 but probably at a slower pace.\n*****\n> January is the month that Wall Street tradition says sets the tone for the year \u2014 \u201cso goes January, so goes the year,\u201d as the saynig goes. This January could be challenging, with the spreading pandemic slowing the economy and the important Georgia Senate run off elections on Jan. 5.\n*****\n> On Jan. 20, Joseph Biden will be sworn in as president.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s a market that\u2019s on end-of-year auto pilot,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. In three of every four years, the market sees an end-of-year Santa rally, but Stovall is also waiting to see trading in the first five days of January for signs of how the market could trade in 2021.\n*****\n> If the market is higher in the first five days, history shows the S&P 500 has been up 82% of the time for the full year with an average 12.5% gain, he notes.\n*****\n> \u201cThere are things we could worry about in January. If they were real worries, the market would be reacting already or treading water already,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cWhat spooks me is the market is setting itself up. It\u2019s a correction in search of a catalyst, and we don\u2019t know what the catalyst is just yet.\u201d\n*****\n> Some strategists expect a pullback early in the year, but the consensus is that the market ends 2021 higher. The average expectation for the S&P 500 at year end 2021 is 4,056, according to a CNBC survey of strategists.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market has gotten pricey, and there are signs of froth. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 companies is at a 41% premium to the average multiple of 16.7, going back to the year 2000.\n*****\n> \u201cI don\u2019t feel strongly that the first few days of January has to set the direction for the market for the balance of the year,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cIf in fact [stocks] do rally, it\u2019s more of a sign of strength. But if they suffer a hiccup, I wouldn\u2019t throw in the towel.\u201d\n*****\n> The outcome of the Georgia races is a wild card for stocks, and it could trigger a market reaction no matter what the outcome. Should there be a surprise and Democrats win both seats, the Senate would be split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. That would leave Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to cast the tie-breaking vote.\n*****\n> Some strategists say the market could sell-off if Democrats win, since investors fear the party would have the votes to pass tax hikes that Biden favors. On the other hand, a GOP win could spark a relief rally.\n*****\n> But Stovall said the market could rally on a Democratic victory if investors were to consider the prospect for a bigger infrastructure and stimulus package favored by Democrats.\n*****\n> Arone said uncertainty about the current $900 billion fiscal stimulus package approved by Congress this past week could become a concern, if President Donald Trump decides to veto it or not sign the bill.\n*****\n> The president criticized the package and said individuals should receive more than the $600 that would go to many adults and children as part of the relief.\n*****\n> The bill extends aid for millions of Americans on unemployment, and those benefits run out Dec. 31 unless it is signed.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019re up against deadlines, as opposed to it just being a political thing,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cThere are actual deadlines on benefits that are expiring. Because of the deadlines, the market assumes it will get passed.\u201d\n*****\n> But the concern will hang over the market until it is resolved.\n*****\n> In the four-day holiday week ahead, trading is expected to be quiet. There are few economic reports; jobless claims on Thursday will be watched closely. In the following week, the December jobs report is expected to show a weaker labor market, and some estimate only about 100,000 jobs or fewer were added.\n*****\n> # 9-month old bull\n> The S&P 500 heads into the final week of the year with about a 15% gain for 2020, but from the March low the index is up about 65%. The bull market turned nine months old this past week.\n*****\n> According to CFRA\u2019s Stovall, that nine-month gain is more than twice the average nine-month gain of 32.2% for all bull markets since World War II. In the remaining course of the bull markets, their average compounded growth was just 20.3%, showing a slowdown in the rate of gains.\n*****\n> \u201cFollowing these typical jackrabbit starts, bull market advance rates typically slowed, posting smaller compound annual rates during the remainder of their bull-market runs,\u201d Stovall noted. Based on past bull markets, he said the returns could slow during the rest of this bull run to about half of their current gain.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/64y0qGa.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Nat4VGY.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WktvGzP.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/VUZMLCY.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Be6WI7r.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BPpZr4W.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/48psUsy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Qf2qTsd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BGZdWlr.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D4bZ3po.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UotpMSF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Santa Claus Rally Started Today! First Leg of January Indicator Trifecta\n\n> We have stood on Yale Hirsch\u2019s shoulders and combined his #SantaClausRally (SCR) with his #JanuaryBarometer (JB) and our #FirstFiveDays \u201cEarly Warning\u201d System (FFD) to create our \u201cJanuary Indicator Trifecta.\u201d\n\n> Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch (97 years old and counting!), discovered and named both the \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d and the \u201cJanuary Barometer\u201d in 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d began today on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is the first indicator of our \u201cJanuary Indicator Trifecta\u201d for the market in the New Year. Years when the \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.\n\n> The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive as shown in table below. In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year.

Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real Santa Claus Rally is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official Santa Claus Rally is set to begin Thursday, December 24.\n\n> So how likely are these seven trading days to be higher? Well, there isn\u2019t a single seven-day combo out of the full year that is more likely to be higher than the 77.9% of the time higher we\u2019ve seen previously during the Santa Claus Rally. Additionally, these seven days are up an average of 1.33%, which is the second-best seven-day combo of the year. Do you believe yet?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Blog-chart-2-12.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cWhy are these seven days so strong?\u201d asked LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhether optimism over a coming new year, holiday spending, traders on vacation, institutions squaring up their books before the holidays\u2014or the holiday spirit\u2014the bottom line is that bulls tend to believe in Santa.\u201d\n\n> The LPL Chart of the Day illustrates how the Santa Claus Rally has performed over the past 20 years. Usually these seven days are higher, which leads to strength in January. But what stands out to us is that the times Santa didn\u2019t come, January was lower each time. Now do you believe?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-chart-3-12.23.20.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n> Let\u2019s take a closer look at what happens when things don\u2019t go according to plan. Remember, Yale Hirsch told us, \u201cIf Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d This is because the New York Stock Exchange is at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets.\n\n> Going back to the mid-1990s, there have been only six times Santa failed to show in December. January was lower five of those six times, and the full year had a solid gain only once (in 2016, but a mini-bear market early in the year). \u201cConsidering the bear markets of 2000 and 2008 both took place after one of the rare instances that Santa failed to show makes believers out of us. Should this seasonally strong period miss the mark, it could be a warning sign,\u201d explained Santa Claus believer Detrick.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.23.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Housing Inventories Keep Dropping\n\n> Yesterday's Existing Home Sales data from the National Association of Realtors for the month of November continued to impress. As discussed in last night's Closer, Existing Sales came in at 6.69 million SAAR. Although lower, snapping a streak of five straight months of increases, sales continue to come in at some of the highest levels since 2006. With sales running at such a strong clip recently, inventory numbers have been nothing short of remarkable: there are only 1.32 million listed units nationally with 1.12 million single-family homes listed. Both respective readings are the lowest levels of the past two decades. Even with declines in volumes, the ongoing collapse in inventory levels has driven the number of units in inventory down to 2.37 months' sales (only 2.25 months for single family homes), a new record low. We should note that implied new listings have indeed risen. They stand in the mid-6mm SAAR range, the highest since 2007 but still about 20% below the 8mm range that they hit in the mid-2000s. While prices are still extremely high, they did drop sequentially on the month thanks most likely to a shift in mix towards lower value homes.

{"title": "Which Tech ETF to buy", "selftext": "In the past years I did invest in standard ETF (70 % World and 30 % Emerging Markets). Now I would like to try out ETF and shares that are more focused in certain sectors and technologies. I'm interested in cloud computing, information technology as a whole and clean energy. Many ETF in these sectors had a tremendous growth in the past 12 months. Though that does not guarantee the growth will continue. Still I think that cloud computing and IT has a big potential in the long term as it will get more important. Clean energy could get more important over time as well as more and more countries starting to take the change serious. Not so sure about short to mid term developments though.\n\nI picked following ETF to cover these sectors. Note that I am from Germany and many US based ETF with an US ISIN are not considered as it is more difficult/expensive to get them here and it makes proper taxation more difficult. \n\nCloud Computing:  **First Trust Cloud Computing UCITS ETF Acc**\n\n[https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFD2H405#overview](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFD2H405#overview)\n\nThis one covers big players like Amazon, Microsoft, Google.
