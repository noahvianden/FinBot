Today as of now 9:15 am it is starting to look very positive for any options traders attempting to profit on the put/call gamma imbalance trades I have highlighted in the previous post.\n\nGood Luck if you take on the mean reversion strategy today!! :)\n\nWatch the video Watch \"Synthetic Futures Mean Reversion 2 (Redo Noise Eliminated)\" on YouTube [https://youtu.be/ln29nhGPShQ](https://youtu.be/ln29nhGPShQ)\n\nFollow Traderfirstyear - [https://stocktwits.com/traderfirstyear](https://stocktwits.com/traderfirstyear)\n\nFor Additional Traderfirstyear [https://www.reddit.com/r/Traderfirstyear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Traderfirstyear/) \\- for more analysis prohibited posting in [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) (mods let me know if I can keep this statement?)\n\nCondensed version ;\n\n(1.) Buy Puts Now on QQQ, SPY, & DIA (if you want to buy on individual equities with high betas go for it)\n\n(2.) Sell your Puts on QQQ, SPY, & DIA at 3:45 pm. Be very cautious of a market rebound around 3:15 pm. This rebound happens from time to time and if it does you want to exit your put positions at 3:15 if no rebound you hold the puts until 3:45 pm and sell.\n\n(3.) Buy Calls at 3:55 pm today (if you are unable to do the Puts just focus on buying calls at 3:55 pm) The market will likely revert higher at the open tomorrow.\n\n(4.) Make sure to pay attention to an accelerated sell-off going into the final hour of trading. Market makers should be off-balance, but following quadruple witching, there may not be enough of a gamma imbalance. However, the market is free to move and is tilting to a lower faster sell-off into the afternoon.\n\nIf you are looking to take on the highlighted trade here are the instructions - (watch the video) or read directions\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bo6s0u/putcall\\_gamma\\_options\\_traders\\_make\\_100\\_return\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bo6s0u/putcall_gamma_options_traders_make_100_return_in/)\n\nTrading Revolution is here :)\n\nPrevious Post as a reference [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/dcamoj/today\\_as\\_of\\_1000\\_am\\_it\\_is\\_starting\\_to\\_look/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/dcamoj/today_as_of_1000_am_it_is_starting_to_look/)", "id": "kag04m", "created_utc": 1607609817.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe he should have put more exclamation points in his headline.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16036421060562134}, {"body": "It did not very fast reversal in the first hour of trading", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I couldnt move fast enough in the first hour.

However the global pandemic and great management decisions led to AirBnB getting this high.... And this very reason is why you must stay away, for now. \n\nAirBnB is driven by renters, homeowners and landlords being able to sublet or rent there rooms for those traveling. Simple as that. The Uber of hotels. In theory. However MANY renters agreements prohibit this type of behavior and more and more municipalities are banning AirBnB because at its root it is unregulated hotels. Regulation is vital in this industry because of customer safety, rights and most importantly lawsuits.  The un-uniform nature of AirBnB might seem appealing at first however it is very likley that by 2030 many regions ban it entirely to both protect the hotel industry and also the consumers. Personally I am a big fan of the AirBnB style but it is a clear future legal nightmare. \n\nIt\u2019s current evaluation is not only inflated but highly risky. While they handled the pandemic better than most traditional recovery stocks they were also given an opportunity (they rightly took advantage of). Under normal circumstances the government\u2019s of many areas almost surely would\u2019ve begun announcing ordances and reviewable of AirBnB months ago but due to the pandemic obviously these are not the e priority. With a company like Facebook being targeted recently tech giants are not safe. \n\nThis is key. Everything is stacked against AirBnB longterm. It is defiantly a good company and now was the PERFECT time to go public but beware, once the ordances pickup AirBnB could very while need to change their entire business model.\n\n\nThis is all speculation. But I will dive a bit into my own personal conspiracy, the money gained by going public\nCould very well be used to fund said new business model as they will have more cash on hand then they know what to do with. \n\nMy personal price target is $50-$75 range. Anything above $80 is absurdly risky until we have clarity on the longterm position of the company. This is a good company but this risk needs to be know. \n\nPlease note I hold no share in the company nor am a pro. I just see a lot of hype and by jolly 150 on day 1 is insanity.

{"title": "A I R B N B IPO!", "selftext": "Airbnb has priced its IPO at $68 per share. \n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos6](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-expected-to-price-ipo-above-56-to-60-a-share-range-11607527468?mod=hp_lead_pos6)\n\nIn all likelihood, the stock will open much higher than that. I think Airbnb is a great potential long term buy given that it's IPOing at the worst possible time for travel industry in general. This was the toughest year for Airbnb. Contrast this with DoorDash which had the best year because everyone was avoiding going out. Wall Street is short-sighted. It only sees 2020 revenues and makes foolish decisions. You can be smarter than that. Would you want to invest in a company about to become a travel behemoth and had the worst possible year and and only has good things to look forward to or would you invest in a food-delivery company whose pandemic-fueled, covid-inspired best year is already behind it.\n\nAirbnb has already received a couple upgrades before the IPO. \n\nBarrons had good things to say about it: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/airbnbs-ipo-will-be-hot-why-its-stock-will-be-worth-the-price-51607120966](https://www.barrons.com/articles/airbnbs-ipo-will-be-hot-why-its-stock-will-be-worth-the-price-51607120966)\n\nI am not a big fan of Scott Galloway but he wrote a neat article on Airbnb and its valuation: [https://www.profgalloway.com/airbnballer](https://www.profgalloway.com/airbnballer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was also impressed with how Brian Chesky handled the Covid pandemic and how Airbnb stepped up to help healthcare workers. Even during fires in states like California, I have seen Airbnb step-up to help first-responders and evacuees. Before the pandemic hit, Airbnb was expected to IPO at over $50B valuation. A conservative firm like Airbnb was valuing Airbnb at $53B - $65B back in 2018.\n\n[https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/3q-2018-morningstar-pitchbook-airbnbs-network-effect-offers-investors-a-unique-stay](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/3q-2018-morningstar-pitchbook-airbnbs-network-effect-offers-investors-a-unique-stay)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the pre-Covid era it was one of the rare profitable startups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know where it will open but anything under $100 is worth a very serious consideration. Just my 2 cents. Just an FYI, I wanted to post this discussion on Investing or Stocks as well because I am not sure if the audiences are the same.

{"title": "John Maynard Keynes and the theory of YOLO", "selftext": "Well, my little YOLO lovers, it turns out that one of the greatest economists in human history, John Maynard Keynes was an OG WSB-level retard who thought he figured it all out (just like all of you). You could probably say he was an early 1ronyman, which means we are not alone and all blessed here.\n\nIn 1919, at the age of 36, after he published such profound studies as *Indian Currency and Finance* and *The Economics of War in Germany *, Johnny decided to give it a shot and make some $ as a speculator. As the true retard, Keynes traded on high leverage and you might even say that his broker was legit mentally disabled as he granted him a margin account to trade positions of what's worth almost $2,000,000 with just $200,000 equity (inflation adjusted but I might be a bit off. anyway, it was x10).\n\nBy that time he had already spent a lot of time studying economics which directed his interests toward trading international currencies and by 1920 he made something around $1.2M on francs and lost $500k on USD. In a rush of emotions, he went on a shopping spree in Rome and probably bought a lot of Gucci stuff. \n\nBeing a happy man and inspired by his success, he put on his helmet and YOLO'd everything on the USD going up and the Deutschmark going down. But pretty soon he realized that his long-term economic predictions didn't work very well with short-term currency trading on high margins (maybe he also indulged in box spreads?). USD stayed flat for a while and the Deutschmark began a 3-month rally. So if in April he was sitting on net profits of almost $1M, by the end of May he did a backflip and landed on a $1M loss. He thought it was Wendy's but his brokers asked him for a minimum payment of $500k to keep his account open. He had to borrow his way out of it and eventually got the money to continue trading. \n\nand apparently that's how the phrase \"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\" was born. The true OG WSB member coined it for us all.
