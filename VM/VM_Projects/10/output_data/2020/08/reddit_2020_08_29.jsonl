You can invest any amount you want. Invest money that you wont need, that you are ok loosing. Some brokers allow fractional shares, not sure about Canada, be sure to google brokerages you can use and if they allow fractional shares. If you want to grow your portfolio. Invest how much you are comfortable with, watch it grow, and when you learn more, are more confident, add monthly, quarterly to grow.\n4.

In my opinion TSLA is overpriced now, might want to wait after stock split and if it drops buy.\n5. You want to find few select company that you think will go really good in the timeframe you want to invest. You want to buy when the price is low and hold when its high. Only sell stock if you think the company changed fundamentally, like for example a competitor emerged, their quarterly earnings are plummeting, their subscriber count is going down.\n6.

{"title": "Regarding the future and self driving cars", "selftext": "It feels like there is a lot of priced in speculation in today\u2019s market regarding autonomous vehicle and their impact on various industries. Specifically around Tesla and Uber. I believe a lot of the expectations and assumptions are AV tech are misguided and fail to properly consider the impact government regulation will have on the economic value of this technology. \n\nLet\u2019s start with Uber. Even before this pandemic, Uber was in bad shape financially, consistently losing money every quarter ON TOP of dealing with negative brand image. A narrative I\u2019ve heard time and time again is \u201cDon\u2019t worry, self driving cars will come soon and will be much cheaper for them than the drivers are now.\u201d \n\nI think at BEST, we are still five years away from seeing any serious uptick in self driving cars on the road, and realistically it\u2019s probably more like 10 to 15 years. So Uber has many, many more years ahead of it in which it will need to deal with its expensive drivers. \n\nAnd when the tech is finally ready on a large scale, how exactly is it going to be cheaper? Safer sure, but cheaper? Let\u2019s put the cost of developing tech or licensing on the shelf for now, and just think about the legal costs of compliance. As it stands, Uber has insanely complex compliance challenges operating in markets all over the globe, and these challenges are likely to become more complex with the introduction of AV, resulting in even higher compliance costs for them! \n\nOn top of this, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t even be allowed to use self driving cars in their biggest markets! NYC will probably ban self driving cars outright, because that\u2019s just what they do with this kind of thing. Expect other large cities to follow suit. \n\nThis is a good segway into the Tesla side of things: Tesla. Lots of people say \u201cTesla isn\u2019t just a car company! It\u2019s a tech company!\u201d So let\u2019s look some of their best tech: self driving cars. \n\nTesla isn\u2019t the only one in this space, there\u2019s also Google, Uber and others. Cars and road safety is one of the most heavily regulated segments of society not just in the USA but other developed nations. But let\u2019s just think about the USA for now. As this technology matures I think it\u2019s very likely that the NHTSA will mandate technological standards and inter-compatibility across the industry. This means that a large part of the value of the tech, the exclusivity part of it, could go out the window once these companies are forced to start sharing with each other and work together. Not saying it kills the value, not at all! But it does mean the value takes a big hit. The government won\u2019t be the only ones pushing for this, insurance companies will too. Insurance companies aren\u2019t going to care about who gets to profit most from what tech, they are just going to want it to work to the highest safety standards possible and will work with the government to push that agenda. \n\nOverall I think def driving cars represent a good value proposition. But the idea that the tech is going to be a limitless money printer is simply misguided. Car saftey is one of the most heavily regulated areas of society, and that\u2019s not going to change with the AV \u201crevolution\u201d. These regulations are going to put safety first, and will likely mute some of the profit potential some investors are hypothesizing about with certain companies. \n\nPlease share your thoughts respectfully! This is not meant to be diligent research or \u201chaha look I proved it\u201d just my own thoughts opinions based on my experience and observations! \n\nTLDR: People love speculating on the profit potential for self driving cars but seem to not properly consider the impact inevitable government regulation will have on the way the tech comes to market.", "id": "ij0h1s", "created_utc": 1598736087.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Who are the two lidar spacs?

I think it again goes down to lowering COSTS and making these vehicles more affordable to the public. As more drivers integrate, and AV owners already do, even just a bit, not even full autonomy, in their driving, then it's gonna be part of the norm. Our society as a whole will see the benefits of the technology. Pressure is of course gonna be on the government to regulate if concerning issues arise. But as long as it shows efficiency, I don't see why governments will be so against it. And in terms of insurance, tesla will take care of that according to them, they know insurance companies won't know how to. And tesla doing that shows how confident they are with their technology. Because being the insurer and the manufacturer, they have to be the most reasonable and transparent of how capable these vehicles are. If anything, they will be the one working closely with the government to properly regulate their AVs.
