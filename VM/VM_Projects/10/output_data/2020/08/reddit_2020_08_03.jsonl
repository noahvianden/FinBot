For example you say it's possible Tesla might get 50-70% of the total EV market. What are the largest market shares of any car company in history? What are the most monopolistic companies which there have been without being broken up? Because I think these numbers are so high they're weakening your argument, which I think is broadly right. \n\nAgain you talk about the car market potentially growing but you don't attempt to quantify this and that's core to your thesis. \n\nFurther the main interesting questions about stocks, I think, are \"is there demand for your product?\", which you address, and \"can you make it profitably?\" which you don't. I think Gali has been talking a lot recently about how autopilot might push Tesla's profit margins to really high levels, on the most recently earnings call Zach talked about \"low double digit operating margins\" (I think it was operating margins) and Ark Invest, who you mention, are also bullish on margins. \n\nSo yeah I think to get a richer picture you could do with more detail and more coverage of the issue of margins, as that shapes the future a lot too. \n\nWhat you've done so far is really impressive, especially as you're just starting out. Keep working on it, I wish you all the best in learning about this stuff, I think you've got the confidence and ideas to make a good shot of this.\n\nIf you learn a little bit every day in a decade you'll be a real master of this stuff.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for this feedback.

I think the revenue for the company is only the fees they get on each transaction, so for a $100 transaction they might get $1 or less of revenue. So they are measuring different things.\n\nYour focus on margins and breaking down the different parts of their business is great. Also what you said about the international stuff is nice. \n\nThe main point I'd make is it's worth thinking about \"what is a fair price for a stock?\"\n\nFor example take Apple, they are obviously an amazing company however are they overpriced? If the best sports car in the shop is $10m and a good sports car is $50k the latter might be a better thing to buy, even though it's worse.\n\nMy personal opinion is that \"the value of a stock is it's discounted future cashflows.\" Meaning work out how much profit the company will make in the future and then discount that back to today. \n\nAnd, this is Gali's perspective and I really like it, the key process is to work out \"who has the technology which will define the future.\" For example with Tesla, as you were saying, they are making the best electric cars, electric cars will define the future, therefore Tesla is going to make a lot of profits in the future and, if you discount those back to today, you end up with a good estimate of the value of the company.\n\nI think it's really worth you digging into the question of what makes stocks valuable and coming to your own conclusions on it. For example I would pay $1 for a share of Tesla, I wouldn't pay $1m for a share, so somewhere inbetween there is a number where this switches and that's the thing to try to understand. \n\nFor example you talk about how the stock price has moved in the past. Personally I think that doesn't matter at all. For example it's totally possible for the price today to be too high now, or too low, or to swing around wildly, the market is very irrational. Future gains don't predict future gains. If a company announces a new piece of tech their price could 10x over night, that's totally reasonable if it represents future profits that tech could create.\n\nI think personally the thing to focus on is what the business is going to do in the next 5-10 years and to understand that. I think you do a good job of this aspect, you talk about how large the global payments system is and how much room they have to grow. Moreover you talk about how AI can give them an edge in small business loans which is again a large market. That's great, that's the sort of thing which will define the profits which will define whether it's worth owning the stock or not. \n\nAnyway yeah I hope that's helpful. If you really master the fundamentals everything will flow from there. And I think you're taking the right approach, as Gali says, each time you look at a company you learn more about how businesses work in general and you get roll that knowledge on to the next one.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.044323090463876724}], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2924213707447052}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4185473322868347}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5247334241867065}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Title rule: post titles must match the title of the submitted content exactly, no editorializing.

{"title": "AVYA finally turning around? I'm probably just retarded", "selftext": "Avaya Holdings Corporation is a company that provides Telecommunication and Cloud based services. That\u2019s right, this is another Rona earnings play. For Q2 Avaya gave a mostly doom and gloom outlook for Q3, revoking Q3 and Q4 guidance citing economic uncertainty for the remainder of the year. More interestingly, they were able to leverage cash holdings to significantly improve their financials during the quarter, and could be poised to have a blowout quarter.\n\nDuring Q2, Avaya took the downturn as an opportunity to use 330MM of their allocated 400MM to buy back 29 million shares as agreed upon in 2019. Additionally, they lowered their bullshit Goodwill to 624MM, a 30% reduction to 1476MM. Now I don\u2019t remember much from the few times I went to ACCT201 in 2012 while half-drunk, but there are only two reasons my tiny little brain can come up with for doing this. You\u2019re expecting a significant increase in revenues in the near future to bring debt-to-equity back up, or you\u2019re hoping to blame Covid for your poor financials and expect things to get better in an L-shaped recovery. \n\nAnalysts currently project EPS of 0.79, only slightly above Q1 2020 when Rona was still contained into a Chinese wet market \u2013 when they had 29 million more shares. That alone should be an EPS beat. On top of that, analysts projected a 1% decrease in revenue YoY. I believe this is too conservative. If the earnings report is to be believed in just the two previous months they added 2 million remote agent licenses and added 1200 customers with 100 competitive displacements. They beat Q2 at 0.54 and that was only a couple of weeks into the shutdowns. JP Morgan gave this an Overweight rating and price target of $16/share after a call with the VP on June 15th. I think they are going to crush earnings after this major shift to telework.\n\nTLDR: AVYA sells subscription based work from anywhere services. Earnings is on 8/10 pre-market, and they may be poised to soundly beat estimated EPS.\n\nPositions 8/21 12.50C and 8/21 7.50P\n\n\nI have no fucking idea what I'm doing.

{"title": "A Long Term Trade: PowerFleet (PWFL)", "selftext": "For many industrial businesses \u2013 like transportation and logistics companies \u2013 the most important asset is their fleet of cars, trucks, planes, forklifts, cargo trailers, and more.\n\n**PowerFleet (Nasdaq: PWFL)** is transforming the way these valuable mobile assets are\n\nmanaged and optimized.\n\nA result of the merger between two niche players in the industry \u2013 U.S.-based I.D. Systems and Israeli firm Pointer Telocation \u2013 PowerFleet is a global provider of \"fleet management\" solutions. These solutions consist of...\n\n1. Hardware that remotely captures real-world data.\n2. Highly profitable Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") products that catalog and interpret those data. We like the SaaS model because it's extremely \"sticky\" (meaning its customers tend to renew their subscriptions year after year), boasts high margins, and is capital efficient.\n\nUtilizing the Internet of Things (\"IoT\") \u2013 networks on which smart devices connect to each other and a central database in real time \u2013 these products track and analyze everything about a company's transportation fleet... including where the vehicles or equipment are, what they're carrying, what the temperature is, and how fast they're moving.\n\nPowerFleet's full suite of solutions enables customers to improve efficiency, transport goods more quickly and securely, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 cut costs. It also gives them a much greater understanding of their supply chains. Instead of having to rely on a foreman's line of sight to make sure their operations are running optimally, PowerFleet customers can simply open up a computer and see exactly what's going on at every level of their businesses.\n\nPowerFleet faces some stiff competition from rivals with deep pockets and large-scale operations. For the most part, these competitors are the original equipment manufacturers.\n\nFor example, Crown Equipment \u2013 one of the top five forklift manufacturers in the world \u2013 does more than $3 billion in forklift sales annually. Much of that includes products with fleet-management capabilities that it builds and sells directly to customers.\n\nIf a business only uses equipment from Crown, it makes sense to purchase fleet-management solutions from that OEM as well. But the OEMs seem to offer this technology because it's what their customers want, not because they're best-suited to provide it.\n\nSo if the business wants to use multiple equipment vendors (a \"mixed fleet\"), or if the vendor it  chooses doesn't offer fleet management, or even if it simply wants a better solution than the vendor offers... PowerFleet is there to fill the gap.\n\nEssentially, PowerFleet is the \"Switzerland\" of fleet management. It's completely neutral and manufacturer-agnostic. As the trends and catalysts we'll discuss next really begin to take hold, this will be a key differentiator.\n\n**PowerFleet's Winning Formula:**\n\nPowerFleet combines IoT macro tailwinds with...\n\n1. A business model that gets better as it gets bigger.\n2. One of the world's largest and deepest-pocketed customer bases.\n\nFirst, let's look at its \"razor and blade\" model...\n\nPowerFleet's hardware sales (the initial \"razor\" purchase) beget its sticky, high-margin, capital-efficient SaaS business (the recurring \"blades\").\n\nSecond, PowerFleet's customer base gives it a huge advantage over the competition. Companies like Ford (F), Starbucks (SBUX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Walmart (WMT) already rely on PowerFleet for IoT solutions. And now, on its first-quarter earnings call, PowerFleet coyly noted it had won a contract with the \"world's largest online retailer,\" Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAs the \"Switzerland\" fleet-management provider, PowerFleet has far more opportunities to win contracts with these big customers than the OEMs do. The OEMs generally pitch for an entire contract of big-ticket items, such as providing all the forklifts for a firm's warehouses. But when a customer like an Amazon buys an entire fleet of forklifts, it's focused mainly on getting all that equipment for the best possible price \u2013 not on the added fleet-management solutions.\n\nPowerFleet, on the other hand, can pitch its products and services to the Amazons of the world as a complement to their existing infrastructure. After spending millions on heavy machinery from multiple OEMs, customers don't mind spending a little more with a different company to improve their return on the bigger investment.\n\n**Two for the Price of One:**\n\nWhen I.D. Systems and Pointer Telocation announced their merger last year, they were valued at $114 million and $118 million, respectively.\n\nWithin two months of the merger closing, the new company's share price rose nearly 50%. But in March's wave of indiscriminate panic selling, PowerFleet's shares got crushed along with everyone else. They gave up roughly two-thirds of their value in five weeks.\n\nAnd its market cap fell from $250 million to just $137 million. As a relatively new firm, PowerFleet is not yet consistently profitable (although Pointer was profitable on its own prior to the merger). But it has decades of experience from its parent companies and brings in more than $100 million in sales each year, roughly half of which comes from a high-margin SaaS business. There's no way PowerFleet should trade for less than I.D. Systems and Pointer Telocation's combined standalone values.\n\nFor some reason, the PowerFleet story has seemingly been forgotten by the investment community. Shares have recovered more than 50% off their lows but are still down 50% from their pre-pandemic highs.\n\nPowerFleet has many avenues for growth and a built-in margin of safety given the recent sell-off. This confluence of growth and value is an anomaly we don't expect to last for long. If we get in now and stay invested for the long term, we could see life-changing gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: BUY/HOLD shares of PowerFleet (Nasdaq: PWFL)**", "id": "i30ib9", "created_utc": 1596473211.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Highly leveraged residential REITs to soar?", "selftext": "Due to all this money printing it looks inevitable that inflation rates will greatly increase. This should mean the dollar value of \"inflation resistant\" assets such as precious metals and properties should also increase with the rate of inflation.

{"title": "PFSI (PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.); A dd", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards and autists, I have a DD that might not be as revolutionary as the \u2018TSLA infinity squeeze,\u2019 but it\u2019ll make all of you money so maybe, just maybe you can afford snort cocaine on your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s yacht.\n\nBackground;\nPennyMac Financial Services, Inc. is a specialty financial services firm with a mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing of United States residential mortgage loans\n\nHIGHLIGHTS;\nThe operating environment for PFSI remains favorable with strong origination profitability. This will allow PFSI to continue to generate high ROEs and grow book value which should result in continued appreciation in PFSI shares\n\nGain on sale remains attractive:\nThe second quarter will be a strong quarter for mortgage banking profitability given the combination of sequentially higher volumes and an elevated gain on sale margin. The primary-secondary mortgage spread (a proxy for GOS) remains elevated today and should continue to support strong mortgage banking profitability. Our estimates assume a moderation in the gain on sale from current levels over the next several quarters; this could prove too conservative in the near-term based on current trends\n\nPFSI's very impressive revenue growth greatly exceeded the subsector average of 32.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 174.6%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share\nThe company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector and the overall market, Pennymac Financial Services\u2019s return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the subsector average and the S&P 500.\nThe gross profit margin for Pennymac Financial Services is rather high; currently it is at 60.80%. It has increased significantly from the same period last year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 39.09% is above that of the subsector average.\nPowered by its strong earnings growth of 543.10% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 100.12% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, PFSI should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.\nPennymac Financial Services reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, Pennymac Financial Services increased its bottom line by earning $4.89 versus $2.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($9.90 versus $4.89).\n\nPennymac Financial Services is a holding company.\nThrough its subsidiaries, the company is a financial services firm with a mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing residential mortgage loans and the management of investments related to mortgage market. The company\u2019s segments are: production, which performs mortgage loan origination, acquisition and sale activities; servicing, which performs loan servicing for both newly originated loans the company is holding for sale and loans the company services for others; and investment management, which represents the company\u2019s investment management activities, which include the activities associated with investment asset acquisitions.\n\nPennyMac Financial Services, Inc's operating earnings yield of 20.8% ranks above 98% of the other companies in the Ford universe of stocks\n\nPennyMac Financial Services, Inc's earnings have increased from $2.70 to an estimated $10.02 over the past 5 quarters, they have shown strong acceleration in quarterly growth rates\n\nTL;DR PFSI has outstanding fundamentals and technicals (it is garbage for those who don\u2019t know) with signals hinted at breaking out on Q2 earnings as they outperform not only the indices but those in their sector as well.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and smd\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\n100 8/21 45c\n\nSources;\n\nhttps://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=130&documenttag=PFSI&c_name=invest_VENDOR\nhttps://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=20034&documenttag=PFSI&c_name=invest_VENDOR\nhttps://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/reports/viewreport?id=1452&documenttag=CSFBW50_1027442&c_name=invest_VENDOR", "id": "i33t2o", "created_utc": 1596483224.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "**I am a bot and identified and tracked the following options picks within this post:**\n\n|**Ticker**|**Strike**|**Type**|**Exp**|**Recorded Premium**|**Recorded Stock Price**|**OI**|**Volume**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**PFSI**|**$45**|**BUY CALL**|**2020-08-21**|**$4.63**|**$48.75**|**1250**|**81**\n\n[Realtime ROI](https://www.pickmojo.com/pick/ckdex46tqia210774ypii7gcz) | [Track Record](https://www.pickmojo.com/user/Zentryl/) | [Bot Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/pickmojo/comments/he9ghu/options_picks_tracking_bot_information/) | Leaderboard: [Week](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-week-reddit), [Month](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-month-reddit), [All](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/top-reddit) | [Exit this position](https://www.pickmojo.com/reddit_redirect)\n\n**^(*My owner is monitoring these posts, reply with feedback!
