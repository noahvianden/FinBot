They usually push for strict fiscal control since it belongs to a group of countries with very healthy economy and low debt. The economy itself is thriving and it\u2019s based on services, technology and clean energy (except for Shell but even them are getting into the game). The Dutch themselves are intelligent, highly educated and very entrepreneurial from a young age. They like to invest and take risks and innovate. Let\u2019s not forget that they were prolific merchants and *practically invented partial ownership* (shares) with the **Dutch East India** company listed on the first ever stock market. They also know how to run up a good bubble or two (ahem, see **tulips**).\n\nAmsterdam is considered to be a startup hub alongside Berlin and Paris and now with Brexit it will probably be more important than London. Eindhoven has the best robotics and AI departments in the area, Delft is a very good university and overall the government likes to stimulate growth.

{"title": "7.4% Risk Neutral* Trade - Can't go Tits Up", "selftext": "Simple merger arbitrage trade. $TDOC and $LVGO are merging. LVGO share holders are going to receive 0.592 shares of $TDOC and $11.33 in cash. As of this writing, TDOC is at $192.1 and LVGO is at $116.4. The fair value of LVGO per the agreed merger price, however, should be $125. That's a differential of 7.4%.\n\nTwo ways to play this: You go long LVGO and hope to capture that differential as the deal gets approved by the shareholders of both companies. OR, you make your trade risk neutral by shorting the same $value of TDOC shares that you go long LVGO (long LVGO, short TDOC) so that market factors are inconsequential (also recall that your LVGO shares turn into TDOC if/when the merger goes through and LVGO ceases to exist as a ticker). \n\nThe risks for this *\"risk free\" trade:\n\n1. The deal doesn't go through. There's obviously healthy skepticism of the deal to begin with, which is why TDOC shares are down over 30% since the deal was announced. Shareholders of both companies (full disclosure: I was long BOTH companies PRE MERGER) are upset because there was a lot of momentum behind both names, and that seems to have been hindered because of this deal, which is really bringing the valuation of the sector as a whole under the microscope. However, since both boards have approved the deal and given that management for both companies is well liked, I think there's a very slim possibility the deal doesn't go through (also, the ownership structure of the two companies makes me think they have enough votes).\n\n2. LVGO has agreed to a breakup fee of over $500mm if the deal does not go through that will be payable to TDOC if LVGO shareholders protest. Given LVGO's balance sheet, I don't really see that being worth the 7.4% differential between the two companies, but that's a VERY subjective call. \n\n3. Time to close the deal. Generally, merg-arb trades are judged by the time your position is open. Remember that you're going to pay a carry fee for being short TDOC (depending on your broker, this could be inconsequential or matter quite a bit). So, the 7.4% is PRE interest/trading fees. But generally, you also benchmark your return against a risk-free rate. But given how low interest rates are at this point, and the fact that this deal is relatively uncomplicated, I wouldn't expect it to close beyond Q4 of this year. So yes, the longer the deal takes to get shareholder/regulator approvals, the worse the relative return, but I think you're getting more than fairly compensated by the 7.4% return. \n\nWhat's NOT a risk:\n\n1. If you enter into the pair trade, share price movement of the two companies (assuming the deal closes). \n\n2. Antitrust review - I've done quite a few of these trades over the years, and the closest ones for me, personally, were AT&T/Time Warner and Microsoft/LinkedIN.

There are three parties that generally need to consent to a M/A deal: the board, the shareholders and the regulators. We already know the regulators and boards are not an issue. \n\nAll that remains is the shareholders. Both companies have large institutional share holders (early money PE and ETFs for the most part). Both companies also have representatives of these institutions on their boards. In fact, PE guys (that will bring significant voting power) facilitated the deal in the first place. I think there's a slim chance that the deal falls apart, but obviously I could be wrong. \n\n>Also if the deal falls through and teledoc increases you have a lot of downside risk, no?\n\nCorrect. However, by far and away, the pressure has been on LVGO and not TDOC to reject the deal. LVGO also reported a blow-out quarter the same day this deal was announced. If the deal gets rejected, a big chunk of share price action is going to depend on which party does the rejecting. And right now, I can say with absolute certainty, that it's the LVGO shareholders that are unhappier of the two. Secondly, LVGO is also growing faster and their runway to their TAM is a lot larger than where TDOC is at this point. At the end of the day, though, both companies are going to take a hit if the deal is called off because management has been so emphatic that they will become competitors if they don't merge. That's also partly why I think shareholders may grumble, but the deal gets done anyway. \n\n> I think the very price drift we see between the shares should essentially be capturing the risk of the deal not going through. Your thesis is it overstates the risk. Is that essentially true?\n\nYes, but it's more than that. Don't believe that the market is perfect. There have been numerous instances that even futures markets throw up huge arbitrages that don't get filled in immediately. If you trade bonds, you'll see slight inversions in sovereign EM debt all the time purely because of technical factors such as liquidity at times. Also keep in mind that for a big chunk of institutions, they're going to be forced into analyzing the deal for a while before they can act. SO, a lot of times, especially for smaller companies such as these, you're going to see large institutions go neutral (just hold their positions and not buy/sell) until they finish a full review. And so a lot of the trading that's going on right now is retail led. M&A arb funds are not the power they once were. I think 4-5 years ago, any number of arb hedge funds would have closed this gap a lot quicker. \n\nHaving said all that, the arb did get cut almost in 1/2 through the day. As of close, all that's available is 3.8%. At one point during the day it was 7.8%. \n\n>With a 7% return you have room to further hedge against the deal falling through and teledoc mooning by buying options I suppose. Would you recommend this (for someone who approaches this kind of thing pretty systematically)?\n\nIn addition to my short TDOC and long LVGO position, I also have call options in TDOC. That is, as you mentioned, for hedging purposes, but also for directional purposes (in that, I believe the merits of the deal will come through). \n\nAdditionally, the latter half of last week was just terrible for small/mid-cap growth companies. A lot of that was idiosyncratic, but there was certainly a rotation out of tech after both GS and JPM came out and said now's a good time to rotate into cyclicals because of vaccine hopes. I don't think that thesis plays out this quickly.
