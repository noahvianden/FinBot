{"title": "Some interesting news in the stock market this week", "selftext": "**Barrick Gold** $GOLD jumped 10% on Monday after Berkshire Hathaway filings showed Mr Buffett\u2019s  firm had purchased around $540 million of stock.  Depending on what news you follow you could take this as;\n\n* a u-turn by Warren Buffett on his previously held skepticism on gold, or \n* a negative outlook for the US economy (from the man who said never bet against America) or\n* (perhaps more likely) a relatively small position in a strong company trading on a cheap valuation.\n\nBarrick Gold is one of the largest mining companies in the world that has seen its stock price rise 50% this year as the gold price has risen 33% from $1,500 per oz to close to $2,000.  However, Barrick Gold has a break even gold price of just $950 per oz meaning that its profit per oz has just doubled from $500 to $1,000.  That should boost profits significantly.  Barrick already looked very reasonably priced on a trailing PE of 11.71 with close to zero net debt.  If the gold price stays close to recent levels, even for a few quarters, it will look like a bargain.\n\nOn Tuesday the S&P finally managed to close above its previous all time high as **Home Depot** reported an impressive top and bottom line beat with comp sales and earnings rising 23.4% and 27% respectively. **General Motors** also got a boost from Morgan Stanley who followed other firms in valuing $GM\u2019s electric vehicle business at around $20bn compared to the firm\u2019s current total market valuation of $40bn.  That makes a spin off a potentially lucrative option and follows GM\u2019s CEO comment last month that \u201cnothing was off the table\u201d.  Deutsche Bank went further to say spinning off the EV business could release a \u201cmassive amount of value\u201d that could be potentially be worth up to $100bn.\n\nOn Wednesday, **Intel** CEO Bob Swan said the shares were well below their intrinsic value and announced a $10bn accelerated stock repurchase program.  The stock is down 20%  since the company announced delays to its 7 nanometer production technology.  That drop does look overdone as the medium term impact of the delays should only hit around 5%-10% of revenues while IoT, online security, automated driving and numerous other businesses should continue to grow rapidly.  Investors appear worried that Intel\u2019s glory days are behind it and that the stock is about to go the same way as IBM.  However, even if that were the case, Intel still looks cheap with a trailing PE of 9.0 compared to IBM\u2019s 14.0.\n\nOn Thursday, numerous analysts jumped to **TJX\u2019s** support saying that the long term story had not changed.  Disappointing results on Wednesday saw the stock drop close to 20% on the week to close at $51.68.   However, Wells Fargo rates TJX stock overweight with a $70 price target and said the \"squishy\" near-term will give way \"over the long-term as a flood of inventory enters the off-price marketplace in the wake of 2020, ultimately pushing margins to all-time highs,\". Guggenheim\u2019s Robert Drbul reiterated a Buy rating and $65 price target on Thursday and said that investors should use \u201cshare price weakness as an incremental buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nFinally on Friday Hindenburg Research published an alarming report that alleged **GrowGeneration's** management team had \"extensive ties to alleged pump & dump schemes, organized crime and various acts of fraud.\"  GrowGeneration has responded saying it intends to take action against Hindenburg.  It said the statements were false and defamatory and \u201cdesigned to provide a false impression to investors and to manipulate the market to benefit short sellers\u201d.  I don\u2019t know which version is correct but I did notice this disclaimer;\n\n\u201cHindenburg Research makes no representation, express or implied, as to the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any such information\u201d\n\nI know these disclaimers are pretty widespread but what is the point of reading research by a firm that refuses to stand over it. \n\nOn that note here is my own disclaimer;\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

TSLA is doing its own thing in my opinion\n\nFew things come to mind:\n\n1. Stock split will have to happen soon in AMZN, I actually feel their plans might have been derailed with AAPL and TSLA stock split plans\n2. MSFT & AMZN have a very diverse business portfolio and are less dependent on singular product sales like AAPL & TSLA longer term however with the ways things are in the world MSFT, AMZN and AAPL are very much positioned to capitalize.  The jury is still out on TSLA for me.\n3. I think after stock splits of TSLA, AAPL the smart money moves to MSFT and AMZN, and their price movement in the last couple of weeks is impacted by the capital needed for investors to build their positions in AAPL and TSLA.  This is clearly indicated by the volume development in the last month AAPL and TSLA(\\~+27% for both in the last month) v MSFT (\\~+0.6%) and AMZN (\\~+5%) in the last month.\n\nThe magic numbers: if AMZN or MSFT were to hit $2trn MKT Cap (not unrealistic), then their share price would need to be: :\n\n\\- $4K (AMZN) - increase of 18% from today.\n\nTo be more competitive in pricing AMZN will need to look at a possible 1:20 stock split\n\n\\- $265 (MSFT) - Increase of 20% from today.\n\nTo be competitive in pricing MSFT will possible be looking at 1:3 stock split if they were to proceed, but this might be a year or so out.\n\nLooking at the speed and monumental increase post split announcement of AAPL and TSLA ... imagine what will happen if AMZN did a split...
