{"title": "Short Ideas - Who's knocking on Chapter 11's Door?", "selftext": "We are net-long as always with some small diversified hedges but we want to play the downward move a little better this time in order to preserve the capital. We can say we have been pretty fortunate to pick great companies at attractive prices so far, but we want to be able to do the opposite as well.\n\nSo since there is no bi-partisan with Congress on the next stimulus, the market is not pricing the risk of no-deal correctly.\n\nThe VIX is at at 22, which by any standard makes the market too calm to realize any black swan event that could hit at any moment.\n\nLast week, some traders from JPM (belief based on number of calls sold) tried to hurt GLD. GLD did not even flinch and recovered more than half of the downward pressure in the next three days. Bridgewater and Buffet (buying into gold miner Barrick Gold - GOLD) did not bulge on their positions and Buffet even sold JPM and other banks as evident by his recent 13F filing with the SEC. Buffet even bought Store Capital Corp which we think would be his biggest mistake this year and in 2021.\n\nFor all of the companies below, it would be nice to go through the financial statements and figure out the structure of their debt. As in, look at scenarios and model how much their revenue and earnings needs to fall before they will have trouble servicing their debt. We hope we can upload this document here with all of our short ideas in the coming 2 weeks.\n\nShort Ideas for Q4:\n\nREITs (shopping centers) - Welltower Inc. (WELL), Store Capital Corp (STOR)\nWe are seeing many for-lease signs and vacant spaces all across shopping malls in the city where we are located. We don't think things will go back to normal for shopping center and plaza operators.\n\n2) Apartments REITS - MAA (MAA), Equity Residential (EQR) Camden (CPT), UDR Inc. (UDR)\n\nDebt-to-Equity:\n\nMAA - 0.751\n\nEQR - 0.795\n\nUDR - 1.402\n\nCPT - 0.911\n\n3) Retail (Restaurants)?\n\n4) US Oil Industry Targets?It will be very-lucrative if we can find the right losers in the oil industry.\n\n5) TSLA - big run up, not much good fundamental change, too much hype.\n\nTesla is an example of when toxic marketing creates a false image for a company.\nEVs are not anything revolutionary. Even self-driving cars are not a revolutionary product worth hyping over. Tesla is a 1-to-1 example of color television hype in 1960s, where Motorola and other companies in the color TV market were overhyped and their stocks soon crashed after the hype bubble.\nAutomobile demand is down significantly in Q2-Q3 2020. (Numbers to come soon)\nIt would be nice to predict the next Hertz or Chesapeake Energy bankruptcies. So leave comments to let us know who you think will be the next zombie company to fold.\n\nAlso any idea on how the safest way to short these companies would be.
