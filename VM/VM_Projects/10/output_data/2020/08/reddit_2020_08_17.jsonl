{"title": "Making an Electric Supersonic VTOL with 400 Wh/kg Batteries (Performance and Physics)", "selftext": "# Prelude\n\nIn case anyone haven't heard yet, Elon Musk has an idea for an electric jet [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuG2AVFB-g0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuG2AVFB-g0) \n\nSo I did some (a lot) of physics calculations running scenarios for what kind of performance you can get in an electric jet using 400 Wh/kg batteries, half the mass being batteries. Most of the aerodynamic variables are just ripped from the Concorde, so it's that kind of aerodynamic shape this is valid for. If anyone wants to look at the equations used, they're in the notebook linked at the end. \n\nBut being basically an electric Concorde with some not yet developed propulsion system, it should carry around 100 passengers. For the air intake area I assumed an area equal to 4x Boeing 747 engines, each with a fan diameter of 198 cm. (radius 1 meter, so 4 \\* \u03c0 = 12 m\\^2 total area).\n\n# Results\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/287oo2awnlh51.png?width=2330&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc9bca6cdbc0b50b502393009985134a81ff01ec\n\nCould be easier to zoom in with external link [https://i.imgur.com/EnctYGo.png](https://i.imgur.com/EnctYGo.png) \n\nThe only values I would really watch here is the [Lift-to-drag ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio) (L/D), and Flight Range, that wiki link also have some extra comparison values.\n\nDARPA's Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2, has a L/D of 2.6 (at Mach 18), while the Concorde had a L/D of 7.5, that would probably be a safe range of what's possible to engineer together. Higher speeds generally get worse L/D ratios. \n\nObviously if batteries improve to say 800 Wh/kg, you just get double the range in all above scenarios. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nMach 4 at 110,000 feet sounds kinda fun, should be possible with a L/D of 5.7, if you double battery density to 800 Wh/kg over the next 10 years you can go 4,000 km in about an 1 hour with that. \n\nLA - New York is 4,000 km, so it could just about do that. New York - London is 5,600 km so that would be a stretch, there's a possibility you run out of power in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean if you try flying that route with this.\n\nHow the propulsion system works? I have no idea, you just need to add the energy somehow, run a 47 MW resistor heat up the air and throw it out an nozzle would probably work. Most likely you would want some kind of electric scramjet,  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzpfgl0lplh51.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=17669d04fb41ed82b2fa38604ce82ac026202980\n\nInstead of a combustion adding the energy, you supply the energy via batteries...somehow. For the calculations to be accurate the combined inlet would have to be 12 m\\^2 in order to collect enough air in the thin atmosphere (around 0.7% of ground pressure). The 125 kg air per second would be need to accelerated from 1233 m/s (Mach 4) to 1510 m/s, which should take 47 MW of power, at 100% efficiency. \n\nAccording to the propulsive efficiency of Jet engines the ideal efficiency is 2 / ( 1 + Ve/Vin), this is based on energy & momentum conservation. But for our case that ends up being 89.9% efficient, it's close enough for the difference to not really matter. But in reality the engine power will have to be around 10% higher than aero drag according to that though. \n\nSince scramjet types of engines don't really work below Mach 1.0, you would probably want some secondary propulsion system to handle take-off and landing via basic rotors or something. That would make the whole thing a VTOL. Hopefully take-off and landing, accelerating will be such a small part of the overall journey it doesn't really matter the energy usage difference. The almost 40% of the battery being used up to ascend you also regain on the way back down, similar to regenerative braking, well you just glide instead of burning the engines as hard. \n\n**Can Tesla do this within 10 years? Yes.** \n\n**Would this be Technologically viable within 10 years? Yes** \n\n**Cost Viable? No idea**\n\n**Should Tesla do this within 10 years? Probably not, stick to EVs/Energy and have it done in 15 years maybe.** \n\nNotebook: [https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/05de4882-0235-4255-a860-c442919fdef0](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/05de4882-0235-4255-a860-c442919fdef0)", "id": "ibl1u2", "created_utc": 1597692642.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "With SpaceX working on earth to earth flights I see any electric jet he'd work on as designed for short-medium haul flights.\n\nIt'd be too big an engineering challenge, and expensive, to get scramjets working only to compete with the Starship which is already looking current-aircraft price competitive.\n\nAn additional issue for them, probably the biggest, is going to be landing with the weight of batteries the same as taking off.

I'd much rather deal with fixing the reliability and durability on rockets than engineering an entirely new propulsion system at the same time as an entirely new airframe and landing gear. It's much much simpler.\n\n>Is 3 hours fine to travel anywhere in the world, or do you need to get it done in 30 minutes? \n\nGiven the option I'm going to take 30 minutes every time. Who wouldn't? There's probably not  even going to be any price savings from the slower journey even if you consider the development cost and the lower utilisation time of the aircraft alone.\n\nI like the idea of a non-scramjet battery electric plane for short to short-medium haul flights, but from medium to long distances rockets seem to make the most sense to me right now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The 3.2% is the total fatality rate across all spacecrafts that ever carried humans into space. \n\nIf you work out a similar rate for every person who's ever been on an airplane vs how many has died on an airplane...well\n\n\"The total fatalities due to aviation accidents since 1970 is 83,772\"\n\nI cba finding total number of airline passangers, but just in 2019 it was 4.54 billion passengers (some duplicate, but that applies to astronauts as well). \n\nall time deaths / all time missions to 100 km = 3.2% dead.\n\nall time deaths / 2019 airline passengers = 0.00185% \n\nIf you want to compare today's space travel with 1930s fatalities, well deaths only really started going down and volume up in the 2000's and 2010's, that's 70 years of development left for space travel before it's safe and reliable enough for mass transportation. \n\nIt is interesting you would rather work on improving durability, reliability of rockets than developing a new propulsion method.

I think in North America it would be a slow build but a more viable business model for growth and expansion.\n\nI do agree that other continents like EU and Asia could be a potential market. However, I'd assume the Chinese in particular would just knock-off the design through one of their brands like Li Motors or Nio. If they haven't started already lol. \n\nAs an investor I would think the FUV could market better as a tuk-tuk alternative in India, Brazil, or Thailand given the smaller road sises v the population density. I'm uncertain if any of the aforementioned economies would want to import the FUV (import tax during a pandemic), much less would have the infrastructure needed to support charging.\n\nI was an engineer for 3 years (up until last Tuesday when I got laid off) If the two of us, just two random theta options investors on Reddit can see the fundamental flaws and figure out better markets and business models for the FUV than the manufacturer would suggest to me that they will be in trouble as a business sooner or later lol. \n\nThanks for the dialogue.

Since most of their products are the backbone to a lot of the cloud services businesses & consumers use and given the recent push towards cloud and digital transformation because of coronavirus, they have stated in earnings call that they expect increased demand and continuous growth. At the very least, their stock should follow the same trajectory of other cloud service providers such as Microsoft.\n\nCurrently, the stock price has been pretty stagnant but the P/E ratio is around 9, which is oddly low for a company that competes with AWS and Microsoft, in addition to providing more niche services. The P/B ratio is insanely good as well, with nearly $30B in assets, they are essentially a classic value stock.
