The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n> \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n> \u201cIf [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n> \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n> \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n> The S&P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n> Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n> First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak\n\n> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 13th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=corMYre6O0E))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.15.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NIO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$FCEL** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$FDX** \n> * **$CRWD** \n> * **$HUYA** \n> * **$NBEV** \n> * **$BE** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$YY** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$MUX** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$TME** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$CVSI** \n> * **$ACRX** \n> * **$ACN** \n> * **$GES** \n> * **$WPRT** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$GIS**\n> * **$CPRX** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$DRI** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$ZTO** \n> * **$BAX** \n> * **$LEN** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$WSM** \n> * **$TCOM** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$REI** \n> * **$DBI** \n> * **$CTRA** \n> * **$GPL** \n> * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n> **NIO Inc.

{"title": "Fundamental Analysis: Norwegian Cruise Line, Coronavirus, and Bankruptcy - Feedback requested.", "selftext": "I just finished a book on value investing/fundamental analysis, and this is my first attempt at fundamental analysis. Would you please give your feedback? Sorry, it is rather long. If this is not the best subreddit, let me know and I will post it elsewhere. TLDR: NCLH is probably going to be bankrupt if the coronavirus takes more than a few months and if we go into recession.\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to determine if one should purchase shares in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), which have dropped 80% since the Feb 19th peak, on the expectation that it will recover its stock price after the coronavirus passes, or if one should not purchase any shares, on the expectation that NCLH is going to go bankrupt. \n\nWe assume that if NCLH does not go bankrupt, it will recover its former stock price, and thus the scope of this analysis is limited to whether or not NCLH will go bankrupt. The purpose of this assumption/scope is because the author doesn't know much more than how to calculate a current ratio.\n\nThe current ratio of NCLH is abysmal, about 15%, meaning they have almost more than 7x the current liabilities ($3.58B) as they have current assets ($0.537B). However, it turns out that NCLH, as well as its competitors Carnival and Royal Carribean, all have always had current ratios this bad. Why haven't these companies gone bankrupt many years ago? Because they all have high revenues and use huge portions of revenue to pay down debt.\n\nWe assume that coronavirus will lead to a 100% drop in business - no customer is willing to pay, at any price, for the privilege of being locked away on a cruise ship in port for a three week quarantine period. Revenue will plummet to $0 for some period of time until countries stop quarantining cruise ships and until consumers regain confidence.\n\nNCLH has $3.58 billion in current liabilities. They can reduce this by $0.536B in current assets, leaving about $3 billion that need to be paid off within the year; otherwise, the company must file for bankruptcy protection.\n\nCan NCLH start selling off long term assets to cover the rest of this $3 billion? No. NCLH has $17 billion in property, plant, and equipment. It stands to reason that the majority if not all of this $17 billion is in cruise ships. The only people interested in purchasing cruise ships are Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Cruise line, both of which are in just as bad shape as NCLH in terms of of awful current ratios and and no revenues due to the Coronavirus. Even if the competitors could purchase $3 billion in assets from NCLH, it would be harder for NCLH to recover its full February 19th stock price as fast as possible, after losing almost 1/6 of its long term assets.\n\nThe final unknown here is how long until the threat of coronavirus passes. If consumers feel comfortable going on cruise ships in a few months, or even in half a year, NCLH should be able to receive enough revenue to pay down the rest of this $3 billion in current liabilities, or otherwise refinance their debt. If however the coronavirus takes longer than a year, creditors may be unwilling to refinance the loan.\n\nMoreover, even if coronavirus passes in the next few months, it's possible that we are tipped into recession and consumer spending will be dramatically lower this year than it has in the past.\n\nWe conclude that NCLH has a high chance of going bankrupt, and that purchasing NCLH is a high risk, high reward maneuver. If corona virus passes within a few months and the economy quickly recovers, NCLH may well rapidly regain the February 19th stock price. However if it takes half a year for corona virus to subside and/or the economy is in shambles, NCLH will probably go bankrupt.", "id": "fipn2d", "created_utc": 1584220360.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "The premise of revenue going down to 0 is a bit too pessimistic I think.

This will be solved soon, it might feel clunky to begin with and it will constantly get better but...\n\nIt's the start and the end of the journey, that is, the pick-up and drop-off that I think will require more work and training of the neural net. This is why the Tesla Network needs to launch with human drivers first to help gather the additional data that they require to make the leap to fully autonomous taxis. \n\nLet me explain. \nThe pick-up problem. When one orders an Uber (other ride hailing Apps are available) and one drops the pin on the map, how often does the pickup occur exactly at that pin? You see the car coming and you make eye contact with the driver, give them a wave, 'hey it's me' you may even point and direct them to an appropriate spot on the side of the road where they can stop for a moment as you enter the vehicle. My point being, you're interacting with and essentially controlling  the vehicle before you get inside it, the robotaxis will need to learn human mannerisms and they'll need to be able to understand non-verbal cues. \n\nThe drop-off problem. The vehicle arrives at the destination coordinates but there's no where to stop safely. In a human driven vehicle a negotiation occurs, 'I can't drop you off exactly where you want so I'll drop you off there *points* instead'. You agree and the journey ends smoothly. The robotaxis need to not only understand speech, which they already do, but they will need to negotiate and understand nuances of tone. How often have you said to a driver, 'hey just stop there *points* I'll hop out quickly.' Where the drop off is clearly in a dangerous location but you've both decided it can be performed safely if you do indeed hop out quickly. \n\nTL:DR \nThe pick up and drop off part of a Robotaxi journey involve understanding human behaviour, speech and mannerisms. \nHuman driven taxis often break the rules of the road and put their passengers in danger by performing pick-ups and drop-offs at the side of high speed roads. \nRobotaxi network will be clunky to begin with to avoid these situations and will have to have no-go pick up and drop off areas to avoid these issues.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I think pickup and drop off problems and coordination like you mention, can be solved with giving the user some control through the app.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5075558423995972}], "tickers": ["tsla", "ups"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "We usually do not allow SeekingAlpha articles because they do not offer much evidence or thought, however I looked through this and the author seems to be fair and provides factual information giving credit to both Tesla and the competition.\n\nApproved, but if other mods want to remove it that's fine too.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I trust your judgment :)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10882222652435303}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I like the article.

{"title": "AMT - American Tower Corporation - Overvalued & Heavily Levered", "selftext": "AMT is a REIT that operates wireless and broadcast communications real estate, including wireless towers and distributed antenna systems. It is one of the leading owners and operators of telecommunication towers in the U.S., India, Africa and Latin America. One interesting fact is the bulk of its towers are located overseas, but the company still generates the majority of its revenues in the U.S.\n\nOver the past few years, this stock's growth has greatly benefitted from the rise in spending on the wireless carrier infrastructure. As companies invested in more leases for towers this REIT stock's price boomed into a bubble. Going forward though, the outlook is super grim now that COVID-19 is taking widespread effect in the USA which AMT heavily relies upon.\n\nMany analysts have lowered or cut their outlook and shifted towards a HOLD or sell rating.\n\nWhen it comes to insider transactions there's nothing but steady dumping for the past few months. Their EVP & President, multiple directors, SVP of Finance, EVP Chief Admin & more have steadily sold millions in shares since Oct.\n\nInvestment Thesis:\n\nAMT operates within the tower business. This tower business is very capital intensive, and returns are typically not good unless or until the tower provider can secure multiple tenants on the tower, a feat made more difficult for a competitor by the limited pool of potential customers. In the U.S., for example, the big four wireless service providers generally make up about 90% of the segment's revenue.\n\nWith COVID-19, global supply chains have been disrupted and people have been quick to discount the value of companies affected such as Apple, Microsoft, and the like of many tech companies are down at least 20%+. However, the long ripple effect that will be displayed has yet to be fully priced in when companies cut their spending levels.\n\nFor example, many wireless carriers are being forced to push back on 5G expansion plans. Earlier this month, Mobile World Congress 2020 was canceled \u2014 a tradeshow where new smartphones are introduced and where deal-making goes on. This is problematic when AMT earns only a 3% return per tower when there is only one tenant.\n\nThe International Data Corporation (\u201cIDC\u201d) updated its projections on IT spending showing growth dropping rapidly. Basically, this market research firm expects corporates to further reduce or postpone their non-essential technology investment plans.\n\nThe Sprint & TMobile merger creates another reason for there to be reduced demand for wireless towers, as Consolidation from four to three major U.S. carriers, and further consolidation internationally will reduce tower revenue as carriers eliminate redundant networks.\n\nOverall, it is clear that these carriers begin to cut back on spending and less aggressive efforts to grow internationally. It will dramatically hurt the cash flows AMT is receiving.\n\nLastly, there is a long-term risk since American Tower perpetually controls only 31% of its U.S. land, leaving it largely subject to landlords and leases. Since American Tower owns its towers, changes in land control could be complicated and costly.\n\nWe can already see the stock is nearing financial distress levels. When looking at recent financial strength we can see it on a steady decline. The Current Ratio has moved from 0.81 in 17, to 0.51 in 2018, now to 0.47 as of Dec of 19. This is due to an increasing amount of leverage and debt the company is taking on to pay the operating expenses as it struggles to attract tower tenants. Currently, it has over $21b + of current debt which it will be unable to pay in a few months given the lack of cash flow it will have.\n\nTL-DR: Slowing demand for wireless communications and data processing will hurt tower demand forcing American Tower Corporation to reduce its dividend as it faces a lower credit rating, higher costs of capital, all caused by its massive debt levels.\n\nWhen this happens, investors will sell off the stock causing its price to drop dramatically in the upcoming few months.", "id": "fiqr2v", "created_utc": 1584224601.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "I think you're looking at this wrong.
