These are strategies with a short convex profile and in particular Equity, Vol Targeting strategies use realized volatility as a component to buy (leverage add equity exposure) or sell (deleverage reduce equity exposure.) These strategies profit when realized volatility is below 12 (persistently), so the longer we are below 12 (think October 2019 to January 2020) these strategies buy stocks on leverage. Once realize volatility moves above 12 they start to adjust their exposure to equity holdings. Adjust meaning they simply start to sell.
