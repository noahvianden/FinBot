The S&P 500 fell 7% to 2764. And the Nasdaq Composite slid 6.9% to 7987.\n\nAll 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were down, led by energy, which slid 10%. Financials were down 3.3%, and materials were down 2.6%.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s decision over the weekend to instigate[ a price war ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramco-shares-fall-below-ipo-price-for-first-time-11583663747?mod=article_inline)as it escalates a clash with Russia sent oil prices down by the most since the Gulf War in January 1991. Crude prices, along with U.S. government bond yields, are typically viewed as key barometers of economic health and confidence, said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at private bankers Arbuthnot Latham.\n\n\u201cThere has always been an assumption that when the oil price collapses the world is going to become a darker place, whether that is driven by the demand side or supply side,\u201d Mr. Perdon said. The latest tensions put the oil market in somewhat uncharted territory with pressure in terms of both supply and demand as the coronavirus epidemic threatens to sap businesses\u2019 appetite for energy.\n\n \n\nThe plunge in crude added to two weeks of turmoil in equity and credit markets as investors have grown increasingly concerned about economic growth stalling. It also raised fresh concerns about the risks tied to heavily indebted energy companies in the high-yield market, and the fallout for other companies if broader credit markets tighten.\n\nU.S. government bonds, which have already rallied to unprecedented highs, extended gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to bond prices, dropped to 0.431%. The 30-year yield fell below 1%, reaching 0.866%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Monday it will increase the amount of [very short-term loans ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-increases-short-term-funding-to-keep-lending-markets-stable-11583756069?mod=article_inline)it has been offering to money markets amid the widening market rout. The move underscores the growing concerns about funding constraints and liquidity.\n\n\u201cThe fear today is about a global recession,\u201d said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, a hedge fund-management firm based in New York. \u201cIf Russia does not come back to the table soon, investors worry the default risk and credit spreads widening will lead to tighter credit and even a recession.\u201d\n\nPublic-health authorities are escalating efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, leading to a drop in business activity and curtailing global trade. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has exceeded 110,000, with over 3,800 fatalities globally. At least eight American states including New York have declared states of emergency as infections spread to new parts of the U.S., and Italy quarantined some 17 million people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a falling knife situation,\u201d said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be buying on a day like today.\u201d\n\nBrent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, shed 23% to $35.01 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures dropped 23% to $31.69 a barrel.\n\nAhead of the opening bell in New York, U.S. energy producers were among the hardest hit. [Chevron](https://quotes.wsj.com/CVX) and [Exxon Mobil](https://quotes.wsj.com/XOM) dropped over 15% in premarket trading. Smaller energy companies plummeted even more, with [Devon Energy](https://quotes.wsj.com/DVN), [Occidental Petroleum](https://quotes.wsj.com/OXY) and [Marathon Oil](https://quotes.wsj.com/MRO) stocks dropping over 30%.\n\nRising defaults among U.S. energy producers may make it harder for companies in other sectors to access credit markets, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThat ultimately is the negative aspect to lower oil,\u201d said Viktor Hjort, head of credit strategy at BNP Paribas. \u201cThere is a real risk, and that is tighter credit conditions.\u201d\n\nThe price war between major oil producers is \u201cthrowing petrol on the fire\u201d at a time when investors are struggling to understand how deeply the outbreak will impact global supply chains and consumer spending, according to Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank.\n\n\u201cWe have got a massive demand decline brought about by the virus and now you\u2019ve got headline inflation going through the floor: all combinations that say we need to do more easing,\u201d Mr. Graham-Taylor said.\n\nStocks in the European energy sector led markets lower in the region, with [BP](https://quotes.wsj.com/BP) plummeting over 20% in London. Anglo-Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell, Norway\u2019s Equinor, Italy\u2019s Eni, the U.K.\u2019s BHP Group and France\u2019s Total were also among the big decliners.\n\nThat led the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index down over 6.6% with key equity benchmarks in the U.K. and France entering bear-market territory.\n\nForeign-exchange markets also faced [renewed volatility ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-turmoil-cascades-through-currencies-11583739387?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3&mod=article_inline)on Monday, as steep drops in oil sparked a flight from commodity-linked currencies. The Russian ruble lost 8.3%, while the Norwegian Krone dropped 2.8%.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, the S&P/ASX 200 index in Australia dropped 7.3%, suffering its worst day since October 2008, during the depths of the global financial crisis. That puts the gauge close to bear-market territory, which is typically defined as a peak-to-trough decline of more than 20%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index closed down 5.1%, its biggest daily drop since 2016, while the benchmark stock index in Shanghai dropped more than 3%.\n\nThe Japanese yen, which often rallies in times of market stress, surged 2.9% to trade below 103 to the dollar, at its strongest levels since 2016. Gold, which is also normally considered a haven asset during times of turmoil, edged up 0.3%.  \n\n\n\u201cWe are in uncharted territory now,\u201d according to Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics. \u201cUp until last week, what we were seeing was bond yields lower, stocks hurt and riskier currencies getting hit, but the idea was that if good news were to come all these moves would revert.\"", "id": "ffuz4j", "created_utc": 1583761972.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "And so it begins...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think the FED still has cards left to play.

The solution was to tax BIK cars based on an elaborate formula. While the car is purchased for employees 'for free', this BIK tax charge has to be paid by the employees from their income.\n\nThe news here is that this BIK formula became very EV favorable in 2020 in the UK, which will likely generate even more Model 3 sales.\n\nThe common time frame when new car models are added to corporate catalogues of BIK-eligible car models is ~March (you cannot just buy *any* car) - so another nice spike in UK deliveries definitely looks possible in Q1 and Q2.\n\nThe other good news is that this BIK change was known in 2019 already, so there's probably quite a few buyers who deferred their car purchases to Q1'2020, to take advantage of the new BIK rules.

{"title": "The Financial System is Broken", "selftext": "There has been a lot of hype recently about the Eurodollar and the repo maker in this sub recently and while I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert I been doing some research and I wanted to share this video that I found that explains a lot of what people are talking about:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=vhm3XXQqwmk\n\nThe video goes through and explains how the repo markets work as well as the Eurodollar. Recently we have entered an inflection point in the repo markets as of May 29 of last year. Since then the expected inflation has been decreasing and central banks all across the globe have been cutting rates. The recent outbreak of the corona virus is just the feather that broke the camels back.\n\nAlso, since 2008 the global financial system, that had relied on mortgages as collateral in the repo market, has had a shortage of prime collateral because no one uses that anymore. In order to fix that issue the banks have tried to incorporate other types of collateral into the system which has introduced risk. \n\nThe most important takeaway from the video is that the central bank is the end of the line lender because they do not know what is going on in the global financial market. Because no one truly understands the global system, no one has been able to identify the root cause of the 2008 financial crisis and resolve it. Therefore, what happened in 2008 could happen again.\n\nI still need to do more research but puts and shorts are what we need to do.", "id": "fflu54", "created_utc": 1583712586.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "i agree comrade... time to abolish the profit motive and the wage system and enact an equitable system in which everyone is reimbursed for the value they produce\n\nedit: to be clear, this unironically", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "unironically what", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "did i stutter", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1305244266986847}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3040917217731476}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06964491307735443}, {"body": "Stopped reading at \"I been\"", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.006716670468449593}, {"body": "Only read the headline but FYI, Robinhood is not the financial system.\n\nJust kidding, I read it.

{"title": "Some words of encouragement for those forced to to posses diamond hands: a secret sauce strategy going forward.", "selftext": "I know many of you, like myself, are trying to soothe the worst case of blue balls ever known to man. Haven\u2019t had a good tease like that since the Internet dial-up era. Definitely planned on trading in some tendies for a fresh pair of new boots to scoot in, butt say la vee.\n\nButt it\u2019s time to look ahead and capitalize on the question we\u2019ve all be asking: \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been priced in yet?\u201d Well, I had some time to think after that double double, extra cheese. The writing was on the wall...literally. I was in the bathroom stall at work and someone had carved \u201c judgement day 03/09/2030\u201d into the door. A little cynical, I admit,  butt what if...\n\nThe revelation hit me like a ton of shitting bricks: the next recession isn\u2019t priced in...like at all. Oh, that gave me chills.\n\nGod, I felt so stupid. Here I was placing orders for same-day trades. Orders that were never executed. Why? Some people say it was the circus breaker. Others said it was the daylight cost avoidance. Personally, I think it was destiny. The universe\u2019s way of telling us that we are called to greater heights...and Robinhood is our guardian angle. Sure, we could take our prophets now...the easy way out. Or, we could invest in a sense of pride and accomplishment and set our sights on the distant future: 2030. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t know what judgement day will consist of. I\u2019m not a profit. Maybe it\u2019s WW3 in full effect or maybe it\u2019s just every \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b measuring dick sizes in a community circle. Butt I do know that whatever happens, it\u2019s going to spin the global economy into another recession. And you can quote me on that. \n\nSo how do real guys realize real gains? We target the tiggers (MSFT, SPY, TQQQ, etc) that are going to be most affected by a widespread catasstrophy. How will we execute? Well, this is where the plan really shines. We continue doing what we\u2019re already doing butt...butt...we extend our expiry dates into 2030. See, Robinhood has built a state of the ark trading platform that doesn\u2019t. \n\nleverage machine learning but instead maximizes human error. Butt before you send a nasty email to support, understand that in doing so, it\u2019s harder for Skynet to control if the programming logic isn\u2019t written correctly. (look up a one \u201cKyle Reese\u201d on LinkedIn. Robinhood programmer. Coincidence. I think not).\n\n\nIf the restroom Banksy is accurate, and we do experience a global event, the market will undoubtedly once again experience elevated hypo-elasticity reversal. You can expect the same exact shit to occur. Stocks going up and down, up and down, every goddamn day. Butt we shan\u2019t worry, cause we will have been sitting on SPY $300 puts for ten years. Time decay my ass.\n\nSo here are my positions so I don\u2019t get banned.\n\nMSFT $2,030 p 04/09/30\n\nAMZN $1.50 p 4/17/30\n\nHOOD $556 c 3/08/30 (trust me)\n\nTLT $101 c 5/18/30\n\nAMD $0.0009 p 4/09/30\n\nSPY $300 p 6/17/30\n\nAdditionally, TSLA is trading at $7 in Muskcoin (crypto)\n\nAgain, the beauty of this plan is that you don\u2019t have to change shit in terms of your day to day trades. Just choose the option that ends in 30 not 20 and Robinhood will take care of the rest. Just sit back and relax and sometime between now and 2030, Robinhood will execute your orders, you impatient fucks. \n\nKeep your head up, champ.
