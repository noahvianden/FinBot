{"title": "QE Doesn't Take Effect Immediately!", "selftext": "All the good news you're hearing about unlimited QE in the media doesn't really help the market with liquidity (except the sentiment of course) or take effect, in the sense it's supposed to, immediately! It takes several months or few years at least to fully solve the liquidity crisis on the ground.\n\nHere's what actually happened last time the Fed pulled the QE trick during the 2008 recession. Even though the banks got enough liquidity support from Fed, they didn't actually start loaning out to common folks immediately as they were supposed to, but instead they were hoarding cash for a long time to cover for any write-downs on potential defaults. The situation did not improve until 2011.\n\nSource - [https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-federal-reserve-3305974](https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-federal-reserve-3305974) (read the last paragraph - where the following excerpt is pulled).  \n\"To combat the financial crisis, the Fed got creative. It bought\u00a0mortgage-backed securities\u00a0from banks directly as a way to pump\u00a0liquidity\u00a0into the financial system. It also started buying\u00a0Treasuries. Both purchases became known as\u00a0quantitative easing.\n\nCritics worried that the Fed's policies would create\u00a0hyperinflation. They argued that the\u00a0Fed was just printing money. But banks weren't lending, so the money supply wasn't growing fast enough to\u00a0cause inflation. ***Instead, they hoarded cash to write down a steady stream of housing foreclosures. The situation didn't\u00a0improve until 2011. By then, the Fed had cut back on quantitative easing.***\"\n\nThere are multiple sources and it's super easy to confirm this, if you looked it up yourself.\n\nIf you ever watched the tv movie Too Big To Fail, in the end someone who works for Treasury secretary brings up the very same question about the willingness of banks' to loan out after receiving liquidity. It's a great movie to watch if you haven't already, especially at this time.\n\ntl;dr: Anyone who has still puts (at least a month out) can relax a bit.

In Asia the positive move from yesterday translated in gains in the Japanese market, up by +4%. South Korea went up half that, +2% and China was mostly neutral. Europe started in the red and has added to their losses as trading continues. At 8 30AM ET, most markets around down over 4%, with the British FTSE leading the way, down over 5%.\nAt the same time Oil is adding to the declines from yesterday, now down another 2%, trading just over 22$ a barrel. The US dollar is up 0.3% after it had a very bad day yesterday going down 1.5%.\nUS futures are also pointing to a sharp decline, all of them down around 3%, with the Dow leading the way, down -700 points.\nThe Coronavirus outbreak is still spreading fast, with more cases reported in almost all countries that have infections. Last night the USA became the number one country by total cases overtaking Italy and China. Yesterday was very alarming on a day to day bases because there was a big spike in daily cases in the World. On Wednesday we had 40000 new cases, while yesterday there were over 60000. If this trend contuses we could see over 1 million cases by early next week.\nIn the US there are more places considered hot spots, with New Jersey overtaking California in second place (behind New York).\n\nToday will be a very volatile day again, not just from normal trading, but also it is Friday. The last three Fridays we sow giant moves during the last hour of trading. But in the previous weeks, the market was oversold during the week and on Friday we saw spikes, as shorts covered their positions. This week we could see the opposite move. As there was a lot of buying this week, we could see long positions being covered or sold, taking down the market sharply.

{"title": "Vanguard - Expectations for recession: Sharp but hopefully short", "selftext": "[Expectations for recession: Sharp but hopefully short](https://investornews.vanguard/expectations-for-recession-sharp-but-hopefully-short/)\n\n\n\u201cOur Global Chief Economist shares his expectations for the potential depth and length of a U.S. recession.\nTranscript\n\nGreg Davis:  There\u2019s been a lot of concern around the R word \u201crecession\u201d. What\u2019s your team\u2019s thoughts in terms of the likelihood that we\u2019re going to enter a recession and what you would be looking out for?\n\nJoe Davis:  Well, unfortunately, Greg, you know the U.S. economy is going to enter a deep recession. You know, the nature of the efforts to contain the virus has also led to closures or suspension of a lot of business activity, particularly in the service sector. And so our estimate is that the economy will contract, on an annualized basis, perhaps as much as close to 20%, which is significant over the next several months. It would be the largest single quarterly drop in our history since at least World War II, at least since records have been kept. Consumer spending will particularly contract in leisure, hospitality, restaurants. We\u2019re already seeing that, and it\u2019s not going to be news.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the nature of the shock and how quickly it has hit, many businesses have effectively a cash vacuum because revenue is dried up, and because of that, unfortunately, the unemployment rate is going to really rise rapidly in a very short period of time. The biggest, probably sharpest increase we\u2019ve ever seen. Now again, I\u2019m not trying to scare investors. It\u2019s just it\u2019s going to be a profound, sharp fall.\n\nNow the one positive is that, again, this is based upon what we anticipate in not only fiscal response but hopefully the nature of the need for containment dissipates as the virus does. That is our baseline assumption. If that occurs, then towards the end of the summer of the U.S. economy is actually growing again, which would mean that the recession, although it will be very deep, ironically, could also be the shortest in our history.\n\nGreg:  Which would be great news.\n\nJoe:  Which would be great news. Now we would climb out of it. It would take a little bit of time, but I think again, part of this has been, the ability of consumers and businesses to pursue economic activity rather than the willingness. And so that would dictate all else equal, the recovery should be so much stronger and certainly stronger than coming out of the fiscal crisis in 2009 and 2010.\u201d", "id": "fq296q", "created_utc": 1585332935.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "Vanguard strategy = basically crossing our fingers it's gonna be short", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Yup", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05468501150608063}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35727396607398987}, {"body": "TLDR their guess is as good as mine", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18944962322711945}, {"body": "> Now again, I\u2019m not trying to scare investors.
