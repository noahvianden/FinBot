{"title": "Call/put question", "selftext": "Hi I am new to trading but have some knowledge. I just was wondering if someone could provide a very basic example of a call or put situation. Say I wanted to put down $100 that TSLA was below $1,000 a month from now. First off could I do that, what potantial profit could I get if it was below, and would that be a call or put?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any feedback", "id": "hbs1br", "created_utc": 1592532535.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Call options are options that make their $ on the stock being above a certain price, called the strike price.\n\n Let's say I think AAPL will top $355 before October 16th, 2020. I can buy the AAPL $355 call dated for expiry on October 16th, for a premium of $24.63. (This is a real option contract) Every options contract is worth 100 shares, so to enter the trade I need to put up $2,463. ($24.63x100).  (This is assuming I did it tonight)\n\nTo calculate the price Apple needs to hit for you to go breakeven, you take the premium of the option ($24.63) and add it on to AAPL's share price. It's best to do this when the market is closed, because Apple is a very liquid stock. So in my scenario, I would need AAPL to hit $379.63 (share price + premium) to hit breakeven. \n\nNow, if AAPL does not hit the strike price on October 16th, my option will expire worthless, and I lose the $2,463 you put up. Since you would have theoretically sold me the call, you'd pocket the $2,463, and those are your max profits. \n\nNow for the put example. Puts are the polar opposite of calls.\n\nLet's say I am bearish on AAPL, and I think it'll fall to $335 or lower before October 16th. (This is also a real option contract.) I can buy the AAPL $335 put option dated for expiry on 10/16/20.\n\n To enter this trade, I'd have to put up $2,008.00 (premium is currently $20.08, so $20.08x100 = $2,008). Now, here's the difference. Instead of adding the premium to the strike price to determine my breakeven, with puts, I subtract the premium from the strike price to get my breakeven.\n\n So using the example above, I would need AAPL to fall below $314.92/share to have my put be in the money. $335-$20.08=$314.92.\n\n Now, let's say AAPL blows up to $375 a share, and October 16th rolls around, and your option expires worthless. You lose the $2,008 you put up to enter the trade. (This is also assuming I make this trade tonight) \n\nNow, for your example.\n\n>Say I wanted to put down $100 that TSLA was below $1,000 a month from now. First off could I do that, what potantial profit could I get if it was below, and would that be a call or put?\n\nYou'd have to find a option that has a $1.00 showing for the price to enter the trade (which would be near impossible to find) Remember, all options are worth 100 shares. ($1.00x100=$100) Your potential profits are capped at Tesla going to $0, and you'd be buying a put. Let's say you bet wrong, and TSLA tops $1050/share by the expiration date you selected. You'd be out $100, because you bet wrong, and that's how much you put up to enter the trade.\n\nNow, this is not factoring in the effects of the option Greeks.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Ok I think I got it.

That gives you a limited window for a higher probability to profit. The kangaroo market currently won't support most long term investments due to pumping and dumping. The one stock I believe will have a high possibility for long term success is ABML, they are going to continue to develop their lithium processes and will probably be a relevant industry player in the supposed american independent from china new economy.

No one knows when or if the market will drop. Look at the 2009-2020 bull run, the longest in US history. Believe it or not, there were skeptics from the very beginning, and many people questioned the market every stop of the way until it\u2019s eventual crash. Don\u2019t believe me?

{"title": "How I use technical analysis: candlesticks", "selftext": "There have been several questions lately in this subreddit ad well as the investing one regarding how to learn about and use technical analysis in the markets.  So I thought it would be helpful to post some examples of how I use technical analysis to make decisions.  Where possible I will try to include actual trades I've made, but I won't have too many of those because short term trading only makes up a small portion of my portfolio and I often use TA to interpret price movements and develop plans without necessarily making decisions based on that interpretation.\n\nThe first example I'm going to talk about is the benefit of using candlestick charts instead of line charts.  As I've said in other posts, one of the benefits of candlestick charts is that they give you way more information than other types of charts, and actually give you insight into investor psychology.  I'm not going to go over the basics of candlesticks because you can get that with a quick Google search, but here is an example of how you can use candlesticks to help you in your trading.\n\nFIrst is a line chart of Pinterest (PINS), one of my long-term holdings ([https://flic.kr/p/2jdk3xv](https://flic.kr/p/2jdk3xv)).  The two circled locations on the chart highlight key reversal points.  The first circle looks like a breakout and if you were making decisions based purely on the line chart, you might decide to go long on that breakout - and then watched as the price reversed and then fell off a clip during the COVID crash.  The same is true of the second circled spot, but in reverse - what looks like a breakdown on the line chart was actually a false breakdown and the price reversed strongly from that point.\n\nNow look at a candlestick chart of the exact same period: [https://flic.kr/p/2jdnPG2](https://flic.kr/p/2jdnPG2).  The candles in this chart relay information that you can't get from the line chart, and would have provided strong clues of the impending price movement.  At the first circle we see the price gap up, which is a very bullish move.  However, the intraday movement denoted by the candle turned very bearish.  What that candle shows is that the price initially rose a bit higher than the gap-up price, but then subsequently dropped and closed at the low of the session.  That is a very, very bearish signal.  What it shows is that after the initial gap-up, there wasn't sufficient demand to push the price higher, or even keep it at that level.  Selling pressure increased throughout the day, pushing the price lower and lower.  A drop into the gap on subsequent days was not surprising at all given this signal.\n\nAs for the second circle, what we see on the candlestick chart is a very common bull reversal candle called a hammer.  When this candle appears after a pullback or drop in price, especially when it does so at a key price level (like the 50 day SMA here), it indicates a higher likelihood of a rebound.  Unlike the bearish candle in the first circle, this hammer candle demonstrates that after an initial drop in price, the stock eventually hit a level where the demand pressure started to push the price back up.  The fact that the price closed near the high of the day, creating the hammer candle, illustrates that demand was strong enough throughout the session to keep pushing the price higher.  Thus, what looked like a breakdown on the line chart was actually a bullish signal on the candlestick chart.", "id": "hc4p1g", "created_utc": 1592587060.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Pure voodoo", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No, it isn't.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14153285324573517}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.015119537711143494}, {"body": "Have a look see at TrendSpider.com.

The way candlesticks work is they represent the price action of the day in one nice little visual.  There are two basic components to a candle (1) the body, which is the rectangle; and (2) the tail, which is the little stick poking out of the top and/or bottom of the body.  The body of the candle reflects the opening and closing price of the session.  The tail represents the intraday high and low.  If the prices closes below the opening price, you get a dark or red candle (depending on the charting software you're using).  If the price closes above the opening price, you get a clear or green candle.  Generally speaking, dark/red candles are bearish and clear/green ones are bullish.  The longer the body of the candle and the smaller the tail, the stronger the signal.  For example, a long clear/green rectangle with no tail is a very bullish candle because it reflects that price opened at a certain level, never dropped below that price the entire session, climbed well above the opening price, AND closed at the high of the session.\n\nNow, candles by themselves aren't usually meaningful signals in themselves.  A lot depends on factors such as the size of the candle, where it appears on the chart relative to the candles that came before it, what the candle immediately after it looks like, whether the candle is part of a larger pattern, and corresponding volume that session.

Game changer for In-App advertising?", "selftext": "Apple are getting ready for a mobile advertising land grab on $ZNGA, $FB, $SNAP, $TTD, Criteo, Rubicon Project and LiveRamp\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/programmatic/apple-may-call-time-on-idfa-so-whats-next-for-in-app-advertising/\n\nApple is widely expected to make a policy announcement over its mobile ad targeting tool at it\u2019s developer conference, WWDC, starting next Monday 6/22.\n\nPeople in the know are expecting Apple to revoke the IDFA (Identity for Advertisers), which would have a tectonic impact on the $45 billion in-app advertising market. \n\nThe move would follow suit with Apple\u2019s recent policy changes and tracking restrictions for the Safari browser (link: https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/apples-cookie-blocking-update-causes-publishers-more-pain/ ). \n\nApple\u2019s primary reasoning is likely to be a user centric, privacy-by-design approach, however the move would also lead to Apple \u201ctaking back control\u201d over in-app mobile advertising across iOS devices. \n\nAccording to Adjust, the mobile ad specialist: \n\u201cThe Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) is a random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user's device. Advertisers use this to track data so they can deliver customized advertising. The IDFA is used for tracking and identifying a user (without revealing personal information), allowing advertisers to access aggregated data.\nThe aggregated data can then be used to discover information such as which in-app events a user triggers. The IDFA can also identify when users interact with a mobile advertising campaign, provided the channel offers IDFA tracking and the advertiser tracks users who interact with as successfully. If this occurs, the IDFA can identify whether specific users click an advert for payment and attribution purposes.\u201d (link: https://www.adjust.com/glossary/idfa/) \n\nIDFA is a persistent identifier that can be accessed by both first parties, such as app developers, and their monetization partners. Some argue that this method of tracking users is much more invasive than a third-party cookie, and withdrawing it as a way to identify iPhone users would significantly impact in-app mobile advertising.\n\nThis could mean that Apple controls revenue streams for app publishers who rely on IDFA like $ZNGA (ie. companies who generate passive revenue from programmatic advertising and don\u2019t often have an alternative ID like logged in email address data). Apple would have an advantage over smaller,  publisher focussed AdTech companies like Rubicon Project and even bigger players like $FB with the Facebook Audience Network (FAN). \n\nApple would dominate app monetization, which is currently a fragmented space filled with monetization AdTech partners taking 5% - 15% of revenue. As competition decreases, Apple\u2019s revenue share could increase to c. 30%, taking dollars out of the pockets of app publishers and AdTech. \n\nApple\u2019s role as gate keeper with control over IDs would heavily impact companies that rely on IDFAs as part of their proprietary identity graphs. These include media buying companies like The Trade Desk $TTD and Criteo, along with Identity Data specialists like LiveRamp.\n\nThe media buying companies would lose access to a persistent ID, which reduces their capability to gather and store targeting data along with their ability to optimize for performance & ROI. They would also end up paying inflated prices if Apple is the primary source of media in a less competitive market. Advertisers would likely get more efficient pricing, reliable targeting and attribution by going direct to Apple. \n\nFinally, Apple would control attribution. Tracking which people see an ad and convert (via IDFAs) is really important for companies like Facebook $FB and $SNAP to prove the effectiveness of their ads, especially for app advertisers who are driving downloads & installs. Most measurement is done by companies like AppsFlyer, Tune or Kochava, using IDFAs. \nWithout the ID, attribution would rely on logged in data like hashed email addresses. \n\nWhilst some app publishers can incentivize people to log in and share data, many apps don\u2019t have a compelling reason for a customer to log in. Think about casual gaming or infrequently used utility apps. \n\nEven for Facebook, Snap, Twitter, Pinterest etc. there would need to be new investment / R&D to create attribution workflows with Apple, or to create safe spaces for brands & platforms to share anonymized hashed emails. \n\nSome mobile / advertising context from Q1 2020:\n\nRubicon Project mobile revenue was $21m, 58% of their $36.3m total revenue. \n\n$FB generates almost all of its revenue from advertising. In Q1 2020 $17.44 bn out of $17.74 bn came from ads. \n\n$TTD is generating most of its notable growth from mobile. \nTotal Mobile (in-app, video, and web) spend grew 38% from Q12019 to Q12020. \nMobile Video spend grew 74% from Q12019 to Q12020. \nMobile In-App spend grew 55% from Q12019 to Q12020\n\nGoogle made a similar announcement on 13th January, about killing off 3rd party cookies in Chrome, which are used for targeting and tracking. (Link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/digiday.com/media/google-plans-kill-off-third-party-cookies-chrome-within-2-years/amp/) \n\nFollowing Google\u2019s announcement, by the end of Jan 20:\n\n-  Criteo slid around 20%, dropping 30% rapidly and then recovering temporarily. \n\n- LiveRamp slid around 10%, despite being one of the stronger plays for offsetting reliance on cookies. Their play is weaker without persistent IDs like IDFAs\n\n- TTD got off lightly, sliding around 8% by the end of Jan. Wall Street has bought the story that TTD are a connected TV company but in reality, most of their advertising revenue is still mobile and desktop, relying of cookies and IDFAs for targeting.\n\nConsidering Chrome browser wouldn\u2019t really impact FB, SNAP, Zynga etc, I expect more media, AdTech and mobile publishers to get caught up by Apple\u2019s announcement.", "id": "hc3yvw", "created_utc": 1592584695.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "Play here is both Apple, Google long assuming this strategy is monetizing the access to user data shrouded in 'privacy concerns'.
