{"title": "To fellow fresh meat investors like me and to receive help from more experienced ones.", "selftext": "I'm a 20 year old who is still relatively new at investing given I started at around April during the huge crash. Yes, I know, \"Oh boy another one if these new kids thinking the crash will make them rich.\". And I'll do my part and say, yes part of me felt like that, but I had already been interested in getting into the stock market way before except that I was at a level way lower than inexperienced. In all honesty, I have about 40% mentality of a good trader/investor and 60% mentality of a bad trader/investor. However, surprisingly I've been slowly opening my own eyes and learning little by little.\n\nFor a little background, I decided to practice in Investopedia for a little bit to familiarize myself in the slightest with the market. I was actually doing fine. Did a little research on some stocks I thought about way before, and they all actually were going the way I was expecting them too. Eventually I get a broker that fits with me, I decide to only start with $500, could've used more, but this is what I considered my expendable money.\n\nFast forward to today. For context, during the most recent rally my account was up almost 20% not a lot in $ amount but nice percentage wise. Then yesterday's crash came \"unexpectedly\" and now I was only up a little over 10%. Obviously I was a bit unsettled, but not super panicked. And it just made me recall a few trades I've done since where my emotion got part of me because I exited during the stocks rise and it rose even higher. \n\nI ended up thinking to myself. My account has only ever gone under my original deposit ONCE. And its was for a max of a 5 dollar loss which is $495. I then said, hey, calm down. Your account is STILL up 10%. Losing money is technically not the same as losing profits. Emotions really get the best of you when it comes to the market. Minimizing them while still acknowledging them is the best thing to maintain your account as stable and profitable.\n\nSo with all this, fresh meat, what has been your experience with the market this year? You experienced people too! But I have a question for you guys, how do you guys make research of a company and all their info like, earnings, P/E ratio and all that confusing stuff, less tedious?

{"title": "Bloomberg Loves Us", "selftext": " Retail money is taking a bigger share of volume. Small-account trades,  those with $2,000 or less in investment, have increased to 2.3% of the  total, up from 1.5% at the beginning of the year, data compiled by  Goldman Sachs show. A similar trend showed up in the options market,  with one-contract transactions surging to 13% from roughly 9%. They\u2019re  relentlessly bullish. The smallest of traders bought more than 14  million speculative call options in the week ended June 5, according to  Sundial Capital Research. That\u2019s a record, by far. \n\n Traders are taking to chatrooms to hype stocks and brag about their  winnings, reminiscent of the late 20th century. Users of a Reddit forum  called r/wallstreetbets, or \"r/WSB\" for short, have shown an [astonishing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market)  capacity to move prices. Back in February, companies including Virgin  Galactic Holdings Inc. and Plug Power Inc. went berserk after being  mentioned on the board.\n\nIn hindsight, maybe there was a bubble back then -- one that  burst on Feb. 19. Shares of Virgin Galactic and Plug Power both peaked  that day after eye-popping runs. So too did the S&P 500, before the  benchmark began its $10 trillion plunge. Four months and an equity  round-trip later -- the Nasdaq 100 reaching 10,000 for the first time --  much of it has been re-inflated. Tuesday, a post on the r /WSB cited  Sundial data showing small-trader call buying made up more than 50% of  total volume in the week ended June 5, the most since 2000. \u201c**Good job**,\u201d  it read.", "id": "h8biw7", "created_utc": 1592068616.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": ">I will say 40% now.\n\nLie.
