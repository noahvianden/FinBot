{"title": "Possible modified wheel?", "selftext": "I'm pretty new to selling options as I've mostly been buying options, but I had an idea for tweaking the \"wheel\" strategy a bit. I'm probably super wrong about this and probably overlooked something, so please let me know what you think!\n\nFrom what I understand, the regular wheel strategy starts with:\n1) selling 14-45 DTE OTM puts (with 70ish % probability OTM) and collecting premium on the put writes. Eventually when you do get assigned, your cost basis should be low due to the premium collected, and so you are long 100 stock at a decently low price if you didn't get assigned right away.\n2) Then you sell covered calls above your cost basis to collect premium continuously with OTM calls writes or just closing out the wheel with an ATM call write. \n\nWhat I am proposing is kinda like the wheel but completing the cycle quicker. The strategy consists of:\n\n1) selling an ATM put or a near-current-share price OTM put that expires in a week in the hopes of being assigned. To get assigned you would need the stock price to go below your strike price. This can be dangerous because the stock could start plummeting and then you gotta sell quite a few covered calls to lower your cost basis sufficiently, so this is a major consideration in picking a stock to trade. However let's pick a stock with high IV such as CCL as an example. CCL is at 22.39 right now and the closest expiration to sell puts is June 12 with the closest otm/atm option being a 21.5 put with 1.50 premium, or essentially 100 CCL shares at a price of 20 if assigned. To get assigned I need CCL to fall (22.39-21.5/22.39) 3.97% and stay above my break even of 20 and not fall (22.39-20/22.39) 10.67%. There is quite a buffer as you can see since I have downside protection with the high atm/otm premium from the recent high IV spike in CCL. Three things can happen now once I sell this put contract: \nA) the stock rises in price and I'm never assigned the shares, so I collect the premium and try again to sell another ATM/close OTM put option\nB) the stock falls below the strike and break even price, so I would have to sell covered puts to lower my cost basis of the 100 shares. If it is a decent stock though, the stock probably will bounce back up, especially with stocks like CCL that are still at a discount compared to their highs prior to the crash. This is the worst scenario as you'll have to spend time for the stock to recover (and therefore have your cash locked up in the stock), possibly face risk the stock never going back up, or just have to spend lots of time selling covered calls to bring the cost basis down, which is why I recommend choosing a stock with good financials and higher IV so that premium you gain from the put sell will be higher and consequently provide more downside protection.\nC) the stock falls below our strike but stays above our break even price in which case we can move on to the next step of the modified wheel\n\n2) With our stock's price being above the breakeven cost of the 100 shares, we have some options as to how to setup the covered calls. The usual way to do it in the regular wheel is to keep selling otm calls until you get your shares called away, but you profit from lowering your cost basis via premium collection and selling the stocks at a higher price. The problem I saw with this was that the stock could always keep falling. As you recall the stocks price should be above the breakeven price before selling covered calls, but what happens when you sell an OTM covered call and then the stock dips below the breakeven price? You would collect the premium from the covered call, but you're losing money from the declining stock price. To combat this, I think it's better to sacrifice some profits that you could get from selling OTM calls to sell deep ITM calls instead. With a stock as volatile as CCL, I could expect >3-5% drops in a day in stock price, and so I would have an actual chance of my sold call to fall below my breakeven and therefore lose money. I could instead choose the amount of protection I want, by choosing to sell a call strike x% below the breakeven. The more safe I play/further below from the breakeven price I go, the less I will profit since deeper ITM calls have higher intrinsic value and less extrinsic/time premium. So after choosing the deep ITM call to sell, I would sell the stocks to the call buyer collecting the final total profits, which would be the call write premium minus the breakeven price of the 100 shares. \n\nOnce again this is all theoretical and don't recommend this to anyone, but I just wanted to see if this would be a viable option/tweak to the traditional wheel strat.", "id": "gyl6uk", "created_utc": 1591565925.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "The first rule of my wheel strategy is to ONLY use stocks I\u2019d be OK holding longer term.

But yeah it's selling ATM puts and then selling deep ITM calls.

Definitely riskier to sell ATM puts and so I'll try it out on a cheaper stock to \"test run\" it for a bit. Most people sell like 30 dte put options and take 30-50% profits in 1-2 weeks, but they sell more OTM leading to less premium collection.
