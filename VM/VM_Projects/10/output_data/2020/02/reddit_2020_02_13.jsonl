The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with the settlement with the SEC described above. On December 4, 2019, the SEC (i) closed the investigation into the projections and other public statements regarding Model 3 production rates and (ii) issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts including Tesla's regular financing arrangements. Separately, the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matters related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates.

Last year, AMD got HPE, Lenovo, VMWare, Google, Twitter, AND Microsoft. Not only that, Intel is supposedly responding by dumping funds into RnD in order to update the Lake architecture.
