Don't wanna get fucked by something you didn't know about before you put money in. \n\nTo answer your question though it is incredibly unlikely that NVDA hits 350 by March 6. It would not have to hit 350 in order for you to profit, however -- but, a call that far out of the money is not gonna move much even if NVDA does jump a bit.\n\nFood for thought.

This virus unrestrained could remove \\~.75% of the 65 year and older [population](https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/world-demographics/).  \n\nCurrently the Corona virus has a mortality rate of [3.6%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) of those up to 60 years old and north of [8.0%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) for those 70 years and older while having a mortality rate of less than [1%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) for those younger than 50.   \n\nAlso, it's almost twice as likely (1.7% vs. 2.8%)  to take out Grandpa than Grandma allowing for a gentler future maternal world.   \n\nFurther, in the US in 2017 [$990B](https://www.ssa.gov/budget/FY19Files/2019BO.pdf) was spent on social security benefits with roughly $118B going to survivors.  Assuming we take out Grandpa and account for disability insurance, Corona has the opportunity to remove 6M of social security's 60M retirement claims in 2018 with an age targeting pandemic. \n\nTaking the average monthly SS payment of [$1,471](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/social-security/articles/what-is-the-maximum-possible-social-security-benefit) against those 6M this represents an annual budgetary savings of  $105.1B.  The budgetary gap between expenses and non-interest income for SS in 2019 was [$81B.](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html)  Corona immediately puts Social Security in a good position if we simply do Chinese Take out.\n\nBut wait there's more... 36% of all healthcare spending occurs on those above the age of 55 with an average annual spend of [$10,676](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-expenditures-vary-across-population/) by those age 65 and older.   Or looking at that same 6M people this represents another annual savings of $63.9B. \n\nSo really, if you think about it... Corona isn't going to hurt our economy in the long run...  Wuhan Market Panic is going to save our social spending in the US and throughout the world and repatriate that stagnant capital from the Baby boomers back to us Autists.\n\nNow who want's some Panda Express?", "id": "f6j5f7", "created_utc": 1582153367.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "What if China is getting their population immune before they release second generation of beer virus?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "corona rime", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11355476081371307}, {"body": "Could call it Corona Xtra", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Corona sugarfree where you get diabetis whit it", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4654935598373413}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17076997458934784}, {"body": "The next one is Red Stripe...
