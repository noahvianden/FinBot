{"title": "Traderfirstyear - NVIDIA BEAR & Deep In the Money Short Call (Short Volatility strategy) to Fund addition Puts on Equity Indices - Irrational Algorithmic Exuberance Stocks do not go up in perpetuity & large delayed correction is coming Profit from IT!!!! :) Trade Good to May 2020", "selftext": "This Market has reached a point of irrational exuberance and is completely unsustainable given the Global Economic Outlook for 2020 and into 2021. (watch TSLA Short Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6wmKqEQn8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6wmKqEQn8) ) - To fully understand the NVDA Trade Idea\n\nThe following Catalyst can be summed up in one formula based on the slowing growth in the US Economy - = Current Account = US National Savings - Investments (watch the economic forecast vid [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_lt5b\\_l7Tmk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lt5b_l7Tmk) )\n\nThe excessive run-up, algo driven, Federal Reserve QE Lite, excessive multiple expansion, and run-up in the first half of the year is likely to end in a very messy meltdown. Feel free to respond if you disagree, but this is presenting a great opportunity for traders who see this most recent upside push as completely unsustainable. If you liked to disagree feel free, but please limit the name-calling and state your difference in opinion, but for now, any traders wanting to take a risk on calling the TOP can do so via this trade on NVDA. I am suggesting both Writing against NVDA that you may hold or taking a step further out along the risk curve and writing naked against NVDA stock you do not hold. The latter of the two ideas is extremely risky but given the idiosyncratic ups and downs in the price of this stock may prove to be extremely profitable over the next 180 days.\n\nTraderfirstyear - $NVDA Trade Buy Write or Naked Write is back on as the meltdown will be within at least 180 days. This trade is good until May 2020 - Why? NVDA valuation is stretched & it is a high beta stock with a very high implied volatility. Traderfirstyear - Outlook Negative for 2020\n\nTrade Idea - Sell $NVDA Deep in the Money Calls at Strike of $200 with a contract expiration date of 1/15/2021\n\nTheme #1 you're a Hedge Fund that bought the stock 6 months ago and have a healthy profit. You're willing to part with the shares at $200 dollars a worst case.\n\nHowever, you also want to fund a larger leveraged short against the broader market. You collect $417,850.00 in premium, which is a fraction of your notional risk, which is 1,346,450 (based on today's prices) - You have no problem locking a 50% profit on NVDA if your shares sell at $200 dollars\n\nYour break-even 283.60 a share on $NVDA anything below this price your short (write) is profitable.\n\nCollect the Premium today and build a 417k Put portfolio on $SPY, $DIA, $QQQ\n\nAs always Good Luck on the Trade\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2\\/26\\/2020 10:15am Trade NVDA Idea](https://preview.redd.it/1rua88bqbaj41.jpg?width=1001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70472868b646e4bf1d26765e46b9a85b001880a6)\n\n[2\\/26\\/2020 10:15am Trade NVDA Idea](https://preview.redd.it/z3lcdcbqbaj41.jpg?width=880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=081f1927c557645db76429466a1f4e5db274f02b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2\\/26\\/2020 10:15am Trade NVDA Idea](https://preview.redd.it/jcvlbcbqbaj41.jpg?width=388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d16e4ac24aead603b84a473b8aac27d6bd10d425)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2\\/26\\/2020 10:15am Trade NVDA Idea](https://preview.redd.it/aabdkabqbaj41.jpg?width=334&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77ede1fbaa62efff4c1f35a93f8b3cebe1dc35aa)", "id": "f9uoy7", "created_utc": 1582730164.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Im new to options and here to learn.

I adjusted the formula accordingly (- so, for me,  =index(googlefinance(B$1,\"price\",$A3),2,2)  -) and can get the correct results to display but unless I drag and drop the formula one by one (like drag and drop the formula to one cell and wait for that cell to display the correct information before dragging and dropping the formula to the cell underneath), half the cells will just read \"#N/A\". I know if the correct formula though because if I go back to the cells reading \"#N/A\" and redrag the formula from the cell above I *can* get the correct results to display. I say \"can\" because it sometimes takes me 4 or 5 attempts of draging and dropping the formula above - and even then, many results only display correctly for about 30 seconds before reverting back to \"#N/A\". And then, even when I do drag and drop the formula one and time, I still often times get the error message and have to play around with dragging and dropping for 15 seconds or so before getting the correct information to display.
