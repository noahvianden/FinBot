{"title": "Making my largest play to date on PSTH", "selftext": "I bought AAPL calls leading into the event which netted me a cool 29% gain on my entire portfolio and after bleeding out on the AAPL calls I didn't sell before the event (or retardedly bought afterwards trying to swing trade) I am down about $4k. I had $9k in buying power left and decided to scrub Papa WSB for some good DD and then did a little bit of my own DD afterwards. I have landed on **1/15/21 25c for PSTH.**\n\nI played the SPAC game previously and learned two things. The first, from HYLN, was that regardless of how people value the company being acquired, the thought that it could be some monster is always going to pump the stock. This is evidenced by SHLL trading between $45-$50 consistently and HLYN, today, trading at ~$28. The second thing I learned, from DPHC, is that a SPAC will go up or down without reason, but seems to have a lot of AH whales that like to stabilize the price and increase their load when it does dump.\n\nThus, it makes me confident that risking my biggest play on a SPAC is going to be a safer bet than playing Tech or something that could be directly affected by the overall market or Stimulus concerns.\n\nThe reason I am choosing PSTH is because A) I need a SPAC that has name recognition and trust in case things start going south so I can unload my position on someone else and B) the leader of PSTH is Bill Ackman who has significant hedge fund and merger experience. He made $1 BILLION dollars merging Allergan, but also lost $3 billion on Valeant (both in 2014). His estimated net worth is still growing and Forbes estimates it at $2 billion as of today. I myself like to take risks in life and so I believe in Bill to come through with a good company. Some people are theorizing it will be Stripe, but I'm not smart enough to figure that out or make predictions on who it will be. I am just here for the potential gravy train.\n\nThe calls are still pretty cheap, but I will say that the stock is at its ATH as a warning to anyone reading. It might correct downwards if news isn't broken within the next month, but I will still hold. My predictions are they will announce something in December and the stock will jump to close to, but never touching, $30. I will be exiting this position whenever it gets up there.\n\n**TL;DR** Join me!

GME stock has risen\u00a028% since last Wednesday, and its year-to-date gains are\u00a0close to 88%.\n\n**What Happened**: On Tuesday, in a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000090266420003611/p20-1849sc13g.htm) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\u00a0the company disclosed that Richard Mashaal\u2019s hedge fund firm, Senvest Management LLC, purchased over 3.6 million common stock representing a 5.54% stake in GameStop last week.\n\nThis followed the consumer electronics and gaming retailer entering into a [multi-year partnership](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft) with tech giant **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: [MSFT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT)) last Thursday.\u00a0\n\nThrough the deal with Microsoft, GameStop hopes to improve customer experience by leveraging Microsoft's expertise in cloud computing. Additionally, the esports merchandise retailer has also announced payment plans for the upcoming models of Xbox consoles, including an Xbox All Access program.\n\n**Why Does It Matter**: In September, there were reports that Entrepreneur and GameStop investor Ryan Cohen\u00a0held strategic discussions with the company\u2019s management. Cohen was keen to expand the e-commerce segments beyond consumer electronics and video games, and position the company to take on e-commerce giant **Amazon Inc** (NASDAQ: [AMZN](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AMZN)).\n\nCohen is GameStop's largest individual investor with 10% holdings and **BlackRock Institutional Trust Company** (NYSE: [BLK](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BLK)) is the biggest institutional investor with a 15.31% stake.\n\n**Price Action**: At the end of Tuesday\u2019s after-hours, GME stock was quoting at $12.58 per share.", "id": "jb4ks5", "created_utc": 1602694638.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "This company is like the video shops in the first decade of this century.

{"title": "Why should I buy Tim's AAPL dip and how should I play it?", "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I'll save the time and complaints for some of you but the end result is leaps. If this is to gay for you then you're more than welcome to skip this post.\n\nA lot of you are disappointed in this new iPhone  presentation. As history shows AAPL's stock price usually drops the day of their new iPhone reveal. I really don't know what people were expecting but this iPhone launch is very bullish. It's the best one made in a while. The prices are great and the new subscription packages will help revenue. Everyone expected 5G and the leaks took away from any real surprises\n\n**So why should I buy the dip?**\n\nLet's take a quick look at the price action for the last 11 AAPL events 60 days after the iPhone reveal. In only 2 of those years AAPL's stock price saw a decline in those 60 days. The first instance was in 2012. The iPhone 5 did not meet investors expectations and this is seen to many as the worst iPhone release. The second instance was in 2016 for the iPhone SE release. So this iPhone was the first of two phones released during the year. This was seen as the most affordable version released before the iPhone 7 six months later. Many investors were waiting on the newer and better model. On top of this AAPL also underwent an inventory correction related to the mismatch of the iPhone 6s and SE.\n\nBesides those 2 events, AAPL's stock has mooned the 9 other times. For those 9 events AAPL sees an average of a 9% increase in stock price 60 days after the event. The two best years being in 2009 with a 16% increase and last year with a 17% increase. Now for those who are getting ready to comment \"bUt wAs a PaNdEmIc aNd EleCtIoNs PrIceD In\" please stfu. We know the pandemic won't affect it's stock price and the elections can swing in either direction. 11 AAPL events is a substantial sample size and with AAPL's new releases it is hard to see how it's price won't go up much higher.\n\n**Other reasons to be bullish:**\n\nPotential stimulus, New AAPL subscriptions, Wider range of iPhone models, Christmas around the corner, Tech is king, Becky, for you TA nerds current cup and handle, and of course Stonks only go up.\n\n**How Should I play this?**\n\nDon't buy anything shorter than 60 days exp. Jan calls are best to avoid theta burn and to let Christmas FOMO drive the price up. Jan calls with a strike of $125 or $130 look pretty good. High volume and very affordable premium. If you're feeling bullish and poor go for the $140C.\n\nTL:DR: Buy AAPL calls at least 60 days out. 01/15 $130C", "id": "jaux9u", "created_utc": 1602654414.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Or you know, just buy Tim Apple because it's fucking Tim Apple.", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Still have my shorts printing, I suggest you wait a day or two", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09602564573287964}, {"body": "The young people are going nuts over the new phones on social media.
