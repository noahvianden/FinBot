{"title": "Post earnings opportunity", "selftext": "NFLX was knocked down after hours to just under $500. This is a great example of taking advantage of an earnings move without needing to expose ourselves to the binary event itself. When there are moves like this, it\u2019s important to look through the earnings call transcript to see why. After checking it out tonight, I\u2019m still overall bullish in the stock and will take a look at a long position in the morning after the open. \n\nThere are a few considerations for DTE. Shorter term will see more exposure to expanding IV with a higher potential to require management. I like to look at 2-3 weeks out to balance overall credit and IV exposure. \n\nThere are a couple ways to play the trade out. We can open right after the open: more volatility or wait a few hours to let some of the volatility bleed out for a slightly less dynamic play. I like to watch how it opens and gauge the markets reaction to see how much short pressure is there and based on that, choose if I want to enter quickly or wait until later in the morning. \n\nFor now, I\u2019ll be looking at something 14-21 DTE at a .20-25 delta. I like the product long term so i will be building in a potential scaling trade. So I will enter at roughly 70% of my max allocation for the position and look to scale in on a subsequent 5% drop after entry. \n\nThis is a favorite way to play earnings on companies I like without taking place in ER itself. \n\nErik", "id": "jf6z9l", "created_utc": 1603258311.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "I like this idea.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 21, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report. The Stock was up 30.88% at the time of writing.

The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. DEA Assistant Administrator Tim McDermott said, \u201cPurdue Pharma actively thwarted the US\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance and prevent diversions. The devastating ripple effect of Purdue\u2019s actions left lives lost and others addicted.\u201d This is one of the most significant blows dealt by the US government against the opioid epidemic. \n* Nokia (NOK) and Greener Acres Canada disclosed on Wednesday an agreement to upgrade Canada's utility pole infrastructure to smart, eco-friendly poles across the country.\n* Renewable energy giant Iberdrola, through its U.S. subsidiary Avangrid, will acquire PNM Resources (PNM) which is New Mexico\u2019s largest utility.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 21, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report. The Stock was up 30.88% at the time of writing.

The money will go to opioid treatment and abatement programs. DEA Assistant Administrator Tim McDermott said, \u201cPurdue Pharma actively thwarted the US\u2019 efforts to ensure compliance and prevent diversions. The devastating ripple effect of Purdue\u2019s actions left lives lost and others addicted.\u201d This is one of the most significant blows dealt by the US government against the opioid epidemic. \n* Nokia (NOK) and Greener Acres Canada disclosed on Wednesday an agreement to upgrade Canada's utility pole infrastructure to smart, eco-friendly poles across the country.\n* Renewable energy giant Iberdrola, through its U.S. subsidiary Avangrid, will acquire PNM Resources (PNM) which is New Mexico\u2019s largest utility.

{"title": "MSFT as the biggest part of your portfolio", "selftext": "MSFT is big part of the Technology industry. Microsoft's market cap is $1,686.5 billion. It makes up 5.95% of VOO the vanguard SandP 500 ETf and 10.78% of QQQ the Nasdaq 100 ETF. It has many products that make up a big part of the world such as Github, Azure,Dynamics 365,LinkedIn ,Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox and all of their stores that sell computers and laptops. Their Moat is being heavily diversified among many industries that will continue to grow and succeed in the future. Revenue in Q4 2020 was $38.0 billion and increased 13% from Q3 2020. Of that Revenue in Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion and increased 6%. Some highlights in this industry was Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5% driven by Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 19%,   Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 6% and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 42.7 million,  LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and  Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% .   Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%. This shows that the cloud or Azure is growing massively as the Industry is still very new and growing rapidly very year. Revenue in More Personal Computing was $12.9 billion and increased 14% with an interesting point of  Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% . The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.\n\nNow we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86. They have debt but their total assets outweigh their liabilities. MSFT share holder  equity is $118.304B which is very good for them. \n\nFuture Growth and my price target for Microsoft \n\n Cloud computing service is a market which is somewhat new but is rapidly expanding. Microsoft Azure is about a third of MSFT revenue but it will grow faster and faster as the  cloud computing service market grows. It is currently worth about $371.4 Billion in 2020 and it is projected in 2025 to be  $832.1 Billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 17.5%.  Also MSFT will continue to supe up the next generation Xbox with new gaming studios and Xbox exclusives. MSFt is also trying to get into the 5G business and it has also created a strategic partnership with Starlink which will give many people faster internet which will MSFT in the long term. MSFT is very stable and increasing on markets that grow very quickly and that will add to its MOAT and it will continue to grow.
