{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Oct 1, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**\n\nStocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. \n\nThe three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities\u2019 third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.\n\nIt seems traders are expecting September\u2019s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.\n\nFor the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.\n\nThe labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks\u2019 report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September\u2019s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we\u2019ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. \n* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerbeg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.\n* As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near record low interest rates.\n* The Mark Zuckerberg-led company said in a statement that the advertising restrictions would be in place between Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. The latest policy change targets any ads that question voting methodology, delegitimize any lawful method of voting or voting tabulation, or make claims of widespread voter fraud, as per Facebook\u2019s statement.\n* New Ford[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24F&src=cashtag_click)(F) CEO Jim Farley starts today. He's taking the reins from outgoing CEO Jim Hackett. Farley has the challenge of leading Ford out of the pandemic, improving margins, and managing an industry-wide transition to electric vehicles, per[ ](https://twitter.com/WSJ)the Wall Street Journal.\n* Jefferies analyst Brent Thill initiated coverage of Snowflake[ (](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SNOW&src=cashtag_click)SNOW) with $250 price target and HOLD rating.\n* Nikola (NKLA) shares surged on Thursday, one day after the company said its production timeline and factory plans remain on track amid widespread investor anxiety regarding the company\u2019s business as well as its planned deal with General Motors.\n* Bed, Bath, and Beyond (BBBY) reported better-than-expected second-quarter EPS and sales results. The company also reported net sales from digital channels grew approximately 88%.\n   * EPS of $0.50 vs 0$0.23 estimate\n   * Revenue of $2.69 B vs $2.60B\n* Workday (WDAY) was upgraded by Citigroup $C from $218 to $265 and NEUTRAL to BUY. currently at $215. \n* Shopify (SHOP) reiterated by the Royal Bank of Canada at $1,250 BUY. Stock is currently at $1,022 so still bullish. This has been a great stock, and well-positioned!\n* ROKU had a target raised by Citigroup (C) from $180 to $220 at BUY. Stock is currently at $188\n* Enphase (ENPH) energy, solar power continues to be hot. Bank of America (BAC) initiated with a target of $93 BUY. Stock is at $82 so very bullish\n* Boeing (BA) had its target set by Goldman Sachs at $225 and BUY. Stock is currently around $165\n* Digital Turbine (APPS), had its target raised by B. Riley from $23 to $40 at BUY. This stock has been a Monster and is well positioned into the new corona economy. Watching this one.\n* Amazon (AMZN) got a target raised by Pivotal Research from $3,925 to $4,500, an extremely bullish indicator.\n* BBBY up 25%, RKT up 13%, W up 9.1%, ETSY up 8.1%, ENPH up 8%, PINS up 7.5%, STM up 8.1%, CHWY up 6.9%, TTD up 6.4%, Z up 6%, PTON up 5.5%, ROKU up 5.5%, NFLX up 5.2%, TWTR up 4.4%, TSLA up $.4%, OSTK up 15%, EXPI up 13%, FVRR up 7.8%, UPWK up 6.9%, CROX up 5.5%, COTY up 5.2%, CAR up 9%, MAXR 6.6%", "id": "j3gh9a", "created_utc": 1601583732.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "You are the real MVP (:\n\n\\-taboo", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3304436504840851}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04689742997288704}, {"body": "team RKT blasting off again", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Brings me back\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12316014617681503}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1815110743045807}, {"body": "The most paramount takeaway I received from that synopsis is to avoid purchasing FB until after the election has concluded. \n\n\\-taboo", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4575583338737488}, {"body": "GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08858635276556015}, {"body": "Thoughts on $OSTK?

BABA has a 33% stake in Ant Group. This is one of the most anticipated IPOs in history (in Asia at least, little mention of it in the US and Europe).\n\nEarnings are on Nov. 6.

Several people pointed out that there is an IV crush right after Singles Day (which is true), but the PRC government must post high consumer spending numbers.
