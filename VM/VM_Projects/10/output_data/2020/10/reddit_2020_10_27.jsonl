Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.\n\nIn the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a \u201cmanageable level.\u201d He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.\n\nWith a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. \n\nYesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, \u201cThe Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,\u201d adding that \u201cprogress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.\u201d Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. \n\nNext Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R).

{"title": "Here's how I'm getting Infrastructure exposure ahead of the election...", "selftext": "Got asked on another post to do a deep dive on how I'm getting exposure to infrastructure ahead of the November election. This is far from exhaustive so please feel free to offer additional thoughts or \\*thoughtful\\* critiques/countervailing narrative.\n\nI'll offer two elements of analysis:\n\n1. A rationale for why I believe infrastructure is a smart bet and the general investment timeline I'm working toward\n2. Specific stock and ETF picks that I think are likely to grow with the undertaking of a national infrastructure project\n\n# It's Infrastructure Week in America, but for real this time.\n\n\"Its infrastructure week\" has become something of an inside joke for political enthusiasts in the past few years as the [Trump administrations efforts to advance an infrastructure deal have been repeatedly derailed by political turmoil](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/donald-trump-infrastructure-week/index.html). During the 2016 campaign, a prominent commonality between the insurgent campaigns of both Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and then-businessman Donald Trump was an infrastructure spending package totaling upwards of $1 trillion. Infrastructure spending is broadly popular and supported by both parties elected's as both an effective tool in the economic stimulus toolbox and a worthwhile investment as America's highways and bridges age. Legislative leaders on both sides of the political aisle have signaled their openness to bipartisan collaboration and its a smart bet that any administration will make it a priority next year.\n\nWith all of that said, the next element of my analysis assumes two things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Joe Biden will win the election. Emotions run high whenever folks offer an assertion like this but what you should know is that [Wall St is positioning itself for a Democratic sweep.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/27/wall-street-biden-blue-wave-432710) I'll say ad nauseum that of course, Tump has a *chance* to win the election. However, most of the major forecasting models place that chance between 7%-12% which AGAIN is NOT the same as 0%. The smart money is preparing for the most likely outcome, regardless of what MAGA world might believe about the polls and Nate Silver. With that in mind...\n* It probably doesn't matter who wins. The contours of an infrastructure deal under Biden define my investing strategy but a second Trump term will likely deliver some sort of infrastructure package anyway. As I see it, the main differentiator is the extent to which we should expect investment in \"green\" infrastructure that include things like grid efficiency upgrades, EV charging stations, and renewable energy projects.\n\nAll of this to say, infrastructure and infrastructure-as-stimulus is likely to be funded in the neighborhood of $1-$3 trillion in the next 24 months. There are a lot of politics at play here that eat up space, but if you want a breakdown of the dynamics and specific proposals being considered I can follow up with more context.\n\n# Investing for Infrastructure Growth\n\nI'm expecting an infrastructure deal that expands federal spending through the federal highway act and block grants to municipalities, continues the expansion of 5G, expands \"green\" infrastructure, and spearheads the first serious investment in rail in over a century.\n\nA few disclaimers\n\n* I should note that with one exception, I am limiting my exposure to infrastructure to around 8% of my total portfolio which is particularly aggressive for my risk profile. More on that exception below.\n* You should do your own due diligence because no analysis is objective and your investment goals and profile differ greatly from mine\n* You can find a lot of this information and analysis with pretty limited research and follow up on it by doing a deeper dive on each pick to suit your interests. This is very much supposed to be a guide to help you think about the players in this space and not at all a framework to blindly invest in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CAT - Caterpillar - Heavy Equipment Manufacturer**\n\nCAT is a key heavy equipment provider across the globe. Despite some tough times in the past two quarters, their stock price has largely recovered from the frenzied selloff in March. In a 48 month timeframe, we'd expect to see consistent growth in sales from their 2020 low points.\n\n**USCR - US Concrete - Industrial Scale Concrete Provider**\n\nDespite some recovery, USCR is still down almost 50% from its 2019 highs after getting slammed in March. The companies fundamentals however are very strong. Signaling their confidence, company management bought the dip contributing to a $400 million cash raise with just $32 million in debt. I'd expect to see some sustainable growth here as infrastructure talks leave the runway.\n\n**UNP - Union Pacific - Railroad/Railway Operations and Procurement**\n\nIts no secret that Uncle Joe loves trains. So much so in fact that investment in rail is a fixture of his [infrastructure plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/#). Railways essentially operate as monopolies, positioning UNP to reap most of the reward from any major investment. Whats more, they've maintained steady (if not particularly strong) returns throughout COVID and offer a solid 2.3% dividend to make holding some worth your while.\n\n**ERIC - Ericcson - Telecommunications**\n\nWith the 5G race well underway, I'd expect to see funding for 5G expansion either tied directly to an omnibus infrastructure package or as a standalone provision. Ericcson and Nokia are the only two telecomm companies besides the infamous Huawei that can deliver, a factor thats been driving Ericcson returns. Already a favorite for investors that want a piece of 5G action, Ericcson also offers a modest 1.3% dividend.\n\n**AMT - American Tower - Cell Tower Construction/Management**\n\nAMT is already the biggest player in cellphone tower space, with a bulk of their holding in the American markets. Still, they're rapidly growing in South America and India and are another key piece of the growing 5G framework in the United States\n\n**PBW and ICLN - ETFs - Clean Energy**\n\nIf you even tangentially follow this sub you've probably seen a lot of hype for ICLN and PBW (including from yours truly). Clean energy ETF's are coming off something of a sugar high, but even Wall St is willing to pay a premium for exposure. Together, these ETF's cover a mix of domestic and international clean energy solutions that are poised for substantial growth in the next decade. Its likely this growth will be catalyzed by not only major \"green\" spending in a Biden infrastructure package, but key policy choices (like extending solar tax credits) that will boost the entire industry. I'm also looking forward to the ChargePoint IPO sometime in 2021, as I'd like to get some money into EV charging networks specifically.\n\n\\--\n\nThere are of course some other pieces here that I've avoided due to controversy (looking at you TSLA).

And it's silly to impose a value on something that doesn't exist and never has.\n\nI have FSD and it's not full autonomy and I don't give a flying donut.  It does what it does and it's highly valuable and I wouldn't live without it.   Do I give a flying donut that the next version will be better but not allow me to sleep when my car is driving?   No.  It's an asinine assumption that we will flip a switch and go mass full driverless next year.\n\nAnother dumb assumption is that that all the hardware is equal.  \n\nA Tesla has the hardware when you buy it and there's a million Tesla's on the road.\n\nEvery other automaker is locked in a zero sum game of warring segments to capture \"best in segment.\"    Tesla's aren't competing in segments.   Tesla is absorbing buyers leaving the ICE thing behind because they're antiquated steampunk contraptions with no future and crappy economics.\n\nWhich leaves BEV's as the sole recipient of the new driverless technologies.  Which nobody but Tesla has a mass solution for.    VW claims mass production starting.   But their segment is the low cost segment with no driverless partnership.

A generic \"mega mall\" with all your typical stores like JCrew, Macy's, food court, etc. Then, instead of the typical car raffle, there was this gigantic space ship there on display.

On the rear of the giant machine, as if I was looking into what would be a spacecraft's gaping asshole, I saw it:\n\nSpaceX\n\nI never knew of SpaceX until I diagnosed with autism from reading wsb. Now I knew that this was Papa Elon's baby, and I wanted to take it for a ride. I circled back to the front of the spacecraft and I couldn't believe my eyes. It was Elon, standing there in the flesh. He must've implanted his neural link into my brain because he was grinning, eyefucking me while the walkway up the spacecraft opened up. I followed him in, and he gestured me to sit in the pilot's seat.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he said.\n\nI looked at the main controls and saw a foot pedal along with two things: a steering wheel and a big, red button that read: RETARD. I looked over to Papa Elon. He licked his lips as he nodded his head. My cock got hard. I looked back at the controls and pressed the red button. The engines powered on. My heart began to race. I took a deep breath and pressed on the foot pedal.\n\nSome beeping noises started, and shortly after, the space craft engines began to roar. The acceleration was full speed and I crashed straight into Dick's. The engines failed. My neck hurt from whiplash. Papa Elon disappeared from the co-pilot's seat. I felt so alone. I was crying now.\n\nI looked at the puddle of tears on the floor and saw Papa Elon across the reflection of my tears. There he was, grinning again.
