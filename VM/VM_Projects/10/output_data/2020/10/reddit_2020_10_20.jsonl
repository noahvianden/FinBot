Obviously, the idea is the OTM Premium will be profit and will be much larger over the long term than any loss earned from exercise. \n\nI'd like to combine this with two other things\n\n1.)

Using the portfolio value to secure puts that can be sold on high value stocks like AAPL, MSFT, or NVDA. This is like running a straddle on SPY, except I've divorced the downside risk onto another stock's movements. In other words, since I'm using SPY to secure the Put, even if the Put becomes assigned for a stock like AAPL, all I need to do is sell some of the SPY, and use that to purchase the shares of AAPL. The amount of puts need to be sold such that if all the Puts were to be excercised, that total amount of liquidity cannot exceed my Drawdown value, because obviously I need to cover the Put if that were to happen. The intent is that, hopefully, SPY and AAPL won't both crash at the same time. However, considering March, that is possible.\n\nRecap; buy stock with margin, sell very OTM calls secured by stock, sell OTM Puts secured by Portfolio value in a different stock, collect twice as much premium, enjoy being rich.\n\nI plan to do this with Interactive Brokers due to their tiny, tiny margin rates.

Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 20, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today, with market participants hoping that lawmakers may succeed in coming to an agreement for more stimulus in the near-term. \n\nStocks lost some momentum in the last hour of market, but still ended the day higher overall. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.21%, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.35% up.\n\nOver the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a deadline for today to reach a deal with the Trump administration for an additional round of stimulus before the November election. However, in an interview today, Pelosi downplayed the importance of the deadline she had set, signaling that she is willing to keep talks going. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that this day was a day that we would have a deal, it was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step. Hopefully by the end of the day today, we\u2019ll know where we stand.\u201d In other words, if a bill is to be voted on and passed before the November election, terms need to be agreed and the bill written soon.  Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama responded saying, \u201cYou never know what's going to happen around here at the last minute but it's getting to be toward the last minute and the clock keeps ticking away. I\u2019m not optimistic about doing anything.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Pelosi are set to continue discussion regarding stimulus today at 3 p.m. easter time, as both officials make a push to come to an agreement very soon. Discussions between the pair have been ongoing for weeks but unfortunately very little progress seems to be made, grappling with disagreements on issues including state and local funding and liability protection, per the Wall Street Journal. Let\u2019s hope they are able to come to a decision. \n\nPres. Trump also supported the idea of a large, comprehensive stimulus package  saying \u201cI want to do it even bigger than the Democrats. Not every Republican agrees, but they will. I want to do it even bigger, because this is money going to people who did not deserve what happened to them.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Justice Department filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Google (GOOG) alleging that the company has unlawfully suppressed competition to maintain a monopoly in search engines by cutting off rivals from key distribution channels.

{"title": "U.S. to Accuse Google of Protecting Illegal Monopoly", "selftext": "> WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department plans to accuse Google of maintaining an illegal monopoly over search and search advertising in a lawsuit to be filed on Tuesday, the government\u2019s most significant legal challenge to a tech company\u2019s market power in a generation, according to officials at the agency.\n\n> In its suit, to be filed in a federal court in Washington, D.C., the agency will accuse Google, a unit of Alphabet, of illegally maintaining its monopoly over search through several exclusive business contracts and agreements that lock out competition, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak on the record. Such contracts include Google\u2019s payment of billions of dollars to Apple to place the Google search engine as the default for iPhones.\n\n> The agency will argue that Google, which controls about 80 percent of search queries in the United States, struck agreements with phone makers using Alphabet\u2019s Android operating system to pre-load the search engine on their phones and make it hard for rival search engines to become a replacement. By using contracts to maintain its monopoly, competition and innovation has suffered, the suit with argue.\n\n> The suit reflects the pushback against the power of the nation\u2019s largest corporations, and especially technology giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. Conservatives like President Trump and liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren have been highly critical of the concentration of power in a handful of tech behemoths.\n\n> Attorney General William P. Barr, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. He pushed career Justice Department attorneys to bring the case by the end of September, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. Mr. Barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.\n\n> The lawsuit  may stretch on for years and could set off a cascade of other antitrust lawsuits from state attorneys general. About four dozen states and jurisdictions have conducted parallel investigations and are expected to bring separate complaints against the company\u2019s grip on technology for online advertising.\n\n[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html)", "id": "jepv22", "created_utc": 1603201853.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Bullish on google, still holding the shares.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38531434535980225}, {"body": "$GOOG sitting up 1.15% at the time of writing, clearly investors aren't particularly spooked by this.

I have recently been riding the Green Energy/Tech waves up and would like to rotate a little into some more unloved stocks with decent potential.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume the next phase of the pandemic (next 6 months or so) could be the release of a vaccine and the huge challenge of distributing it to the masses. \n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to mass vaccination is the lack of medical grade glass used in manufacturing vials. Of current interest to me is Corning Inc (NYSE:GLW), who in 2017 finished development of Corning Valour Glass which is said to be superior to Borosilicate containers (which are currently used most widely). \nIn May 2020 Pfizer signed a multi year deal to be supplied with Corning\u2019s Valour Glass, and a month later Corning received $204mil from US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to expand domestic manufacturing of Valor glass vials to hold COVID-19 vaccines.

{"title": "Dead Money", "selftext": "Who else has dead money in their portfolio? Here\u2019s a few from my portfolio:\n\nGILD: aside from some run up early on in the pandemic, Gilead has done nothing but drop this year. I was able to sell some covered calls on price and IV spikes on the headlines regarding remdisivir and other potential treatments. Been holding and adding since 2015, average price ~ $80 per share. If it ever gets back into the $75 range again, I\u2019ll start selling covered calls with an $82.50 strike. Fortunately, I\u2019ve been able to abate most of my losses from the dividend payout and covered call premiums I\u2019ve collected over the last 5 years. \n\nT: everyone\u2019s favorite dead money stock. I have held AT&T on and off for the last 10 years, and I initiated a new position in 2017 for the dividend at around $38. My plan was to run the wheel strategy on this, I got into 200 shares through assigned puts and sold a few covered calls against my position while watching it slowly drop to $30. It\u2019s sitting below $27 now and I\u2019m selling $29 calls just hoping to get assigned and take the loss. AT&T is beloved for the dividend ($2.08 annually or 7.7%) but its FCF per share ($1.52) doesn\u2019t cover it. This is a classic yield trap, in my opinion. I would love to see them turn it around and pay off that debt, but I\u2019m not getting my hopes up.  \n\nXOM: I know Exxon Mobile is getting a lot of love in r/stocks lately because it\u2019s been beaten down so much but take it from someone who has owned it since 2008: it\u2019s dead money. I believe it will recover from here, but it\u2019s got a long way to go to get back to my $84/share average. Even if I tally up every dividend that I\u2019ve received over the last 12 years, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover my unrealized loss on this position. The dividend is probably going to get cut folks, so if you\u2019re buying this it shouldn\u2019t be because of the yield, it should be because you believe in an oil recovery and can afford to wait. It will come back, but they have to get their financial house in order first. \n\nKSHB: KushCo was my \u201cpick and shovel\u201d play in the marijuana gold rush, unfortunately it didn\u2019t pan out. They diluted the shit out of the common stock by using it as a fund raiser, and they got burned on Chinese tariffs and poor planning. They failed to adequately anticipate demand and ended up having to air freight a bunch of product out of China to fulfill orders, which I believe hurt their competitive position by allowing leaner companies to fill the demand vacuum. I hope they come back and I\u2019m willing to wait, fortunately I don\u2019t have a huge stake. \n\nWhy don\u2019t I just sell those? The problem is they\u2019re all long-term losses, and I don\u2019t have enough long-term gains to offset, I would be capped at $3,000 pretty quick. All my gains this year are short-term resulting from option selling. I also don\u2019t really need the money, fortunately, so I am just bag holding and waiting to see what happens. If any of these start to approach my cost basis I\u2019ll start selling covered calls. If any of these get assigned, I\u2019ll take the money and buy SPY, which is what I should have done in the first place. Stock picking is fun, but I would be light years ahead if I had simply bought SPY or some other broad market ETF. \n\nSo, what is your dead money?

AMD has to go up 24% in a month to 10% above all time highs for you to break even.  You're willing to bet 130$ of your very small capital to do that? Why? \n\nConsider: sell a 105c 11/20 to make it a spread.  This keeps your cost to play at around 50$ so leaves you the opportunity for a 10 bagger.  It's still stupid, but much less stupid.\n\nAlso consider: For the same price as your moonshot, you can buy a 84/89 call spread.

Check out the estimated returns grid on this pretty Christmas options calculator: [http://opcalc.com/fXT](http://opcalc.com/fXT) I've put in your calls. And then remember that this doesn't even price in a post-earning IV crush. So if you want that dark green, AMD needs to moon even faster than this graph suggests.\n\nIf it goes up 12% to ATHs/91 in one week like you're suggesting, by the 10/30 you'll get +90% gains disregarding crush. SICK.\n\nNow compare it to the one for the same priced spread I mentioned: [http://opcalc.com/fXR](http://opcalc.com/fXR) If you get 91 by the 30th, you'll get gains of 75% disregarding crush. ALSO SICK.\n\nWhat if on 10/30 it's up a modest amount to 85.5? -2% call vs +30% spread.\n\nWhat  about if it's flat(81.75)? -45% call vs -4% spread.\n\nWhat if it... DOWN? 75.5: -80% call vs -50%  spread.  \n\nYou get the picture. In almost every situation other than MOOOOON you are better off with the spread, since selling a spread will counteract a lot of the theta burn and IV crush.  In fact, you can see AMD has to do at least 10% or better on 10/30 to start beating the spread. Without the spread, your position will be completely fucked if anything unexpected happens or the market as a whole decides to sell off.  Can you think of anything that miiight be making the market nervous right now?  Do you really think AMD has momentum to cause it to moonshot past ATH's right now?
