{"title": "Option Contracts Watch list for this Week - SNAP, SPY, SQQQ, NVDA, WKHS, CGC", "selftext": "I've been posting [AI based predictions for option contracts](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) every day. From all the contracts our [bot](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) posts, I select the best ones and post them manually here. Continuing that trend, here are some good contracts that you can trade along with my two cents.\n\n# $WKHS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3esmak4i44y51.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=639ff4344ef257d2aa46b5788c4a918dc87260da\n\nThis came in from our AI tool on Friday. Volume is higher than the OI and the price action is about to be on a strong support ([https://i.imgur.com/2Nnv7k8.png](https://i.imgur.com/2Nnv7k8.png)). This is also a longer term contract so I would consider it quite safe. Stop loss would be right under the $15 level.\n\n# $CGC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qh5yyut44y51.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=c63e9673098140a1f7f6ba087ba03e81f6b90337\n\nConsidering all the marijuana news last week and legalization of so many things, this did not close well at all. The price is right at the resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/9vpVVny.png](https://i.imgur.com/9vpVVny.png)) so you have a stop loss if it crosses above it.\n\n# $SNAP\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tszz1t4b4y51.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceca3516d088e2b0bce710c210f5e1ba65f4fc8d\n\nSNAP has been doing wonders for some days now. It broke resistance on Friday and the attached contract went up 30%. However, if we see a dip at 43.2$ level, that would be a great opportunity to buy the contract with a stop loss at around 42 maybe. ([https://i.imgur.com/dAiLEOw.png](https://i.imgur.com/dAiLEOw.png))\n\n# $SPY & $SQQQ\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yn4j2jib4y51.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c538ebdbbb249411787af6b8ed799ebc39cab82\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93p6hfwub4y51.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=4af1e67800e2ffc23ec18c82b55a609bda5c725a\n\nThese two are just for hedging purposes. The $SPY one has a long expiry so theta won't kill you. The bid ask average is also not that high. You can also go with the $SQQQ one by extending the expiry to 2-3 weeks more as it has already expired.\n\n# $NVDA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rousil02c4y51.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dbd634d88b230c7e8ebc160d4f0d7c242567b53\n\nThis contract is already [up a 100%](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot/status/1324729997198766080) after it was posted but I think it might have more room especially considering the price is right at the last resistance. If it can break the resistance level, this would be an excellent setup given there's no resistance after that ([https://i.imgur.com/vRSUP60.png](https://i.imgur.com/vRSUP60.png)). Patience will pay here.\n\nThat would be it. I hope you folks have a great weekend ahead.

Typically there will be the least amount as expiration nears, so I would wait to manage to day of.\n\nThis is hardly a PMCC, and this is horribly set up. There should be no upside risk, that is one of the benefits of a diagonal. Next time, your short strike should be debit paid + long call strike. In this case, since you paid $13 for your 115c, you should be selling at least the $128c. This will always ensure you turn a profit or breakeven.\n\nFor a PMCC to work, you need to get something deep ITM. You need a deep ITM option because it has little extrinsic value (compared to ATM or OTM), so any of the premium collected will offset the long option's decay. \n\nLower delta and shorter time frame (while enhances theta returns), is more of a short gamma play than anything. If the market moves heavily against you, your shorts will increase in value way faster than your long dated options, and if it's set up poorly, you will be forced to eat a loss. \n\nWait until the end of the week (hope AAPL dips below your short call), and manage.

Thanks for sharing this!\n\nIs there a difference between closing out the position and opening a new one vs rolling? I guess if I re-enter the trade either way, I will not be able to claim this as a loss for tax purposes per the wash sale rule, isn't it? Or maybe because I bought the long call recently too, even that would fall under wash sale rule and prevent tax loss harvesting?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Just to clarify, it isn't so much about a PMCC being deep in the money, it's about paying little for extrinsic value. The easiest way to describe this is to look for ITM calls that have a breakeven near the current price of the stock, then look at the premium.\n\nFor example, RKT 3c 1/2022 and 5c 1/2022 have roughly the same amount of extrinsic value. 3c is going for $18.40 and the 5c is going for $16.40. There is no extrinsic advantage of getting the 3c as you are paying for the same amount of extrinsic value with the 5c. I would enter the 5c as it has a lower cost to entry. \n\nI am unsure if there is a difference. The reason I am suggesting a change is so you can rebalance your greeks. Get yourself a high delta and low theta on your long, and sell calls that will always break even. ATM options have the most extrinsic value, so if you purchase a LEAPs that the breakeven is near ATM, you can short an ATM option for an aggressively defensive set up (cap your upside/no risk to upside, but greatly reduce your cost basis).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That makes sense.
