Thanks for the reply. I had been looking at strangles on SPX. But not sure of that would be the right way to go. As seems like I'd have to risk quite a bit of capital for maybe 500$ a week. Is there a specific delta range and vix correlation that one should work within to minimise the risk? \n\nPMCC, I hadn't thought about that. What's the exist strategy if you short call goes in the money?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "For strangles, I recommend selling slightly farther out in time (30-60 DTE) in order to collect more premium, have better breakevens, and more time decay relative to directional exposure. The 30 Delta Jan 15 SPX strangle is selling for about $10k credit on about 80k capital (which is probably too big for a 200k account, I wouldn't do more than 10% of your account per strangle)\n\nStrangles are best sold when IV is high and/or contracting, and people typically choose their strikes at anywhere from 15-30 Delta. For management, most close at 50% of max profit, and some rebalance trades that have gone against them by rolling the untested side in for a credit\n\nIf you decide to hedge strangles, you need long Gamma and Vega exposure, which is best achieved with long strangles (lol). The trick is to sell strangles with a lot of Theta and buy ones with relatively low Theta, but there are other approaches to long Gamma. If you want to skip the Gamma hedge, limit your risk through size and stay in the farther expiration (30-60 DTE, never past 20 unless you're desperate on a loser), and hedge Vega with calls on a volatility product like the VIX\n\nFor PMCCs, if you set them up so that you're paying less than 75% of the spread width for the trade, you have no risk to the upside. So if the short call goes ITM, I typically close out the trade if I've reached my profit target (10-20% RoC), or if I haven't I'll roll it to the next expiration, potentially adjusting the strike", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "As far as the capital requirements on SPX, you're right to some extent.

I've been playing the EV SPACs for a hot minute and there's a few that are primed and ready to rip. No idea what Fisker will do, i just know it's up +100% since end of Oct and I don't see any reason why it's going to get above $26 by eoy. What I'm trying to say is you can do better, throw your dollars of fomo desperation at these US companies and double down on your autism.\n\nI do hold positions in the following 3 SPACs below but only one offers options right now, the other 2 have warrants but you hoodies are SOL there (long stock positions should still be good gainers though). I've pored through shitload upon shitload of EV SPAC DD the past 2 weeks and I believe these 3 have a lot of upside in both the near and long terms. Please feel free to enlighten me on others and lend me your thoughts\n\n\n\nLightning eMotors (GIK) - Colorado based, these guys are fleet electrification similar to XL Fleet/PIC,  install electric powertrains into Ford and Chevy chassis and sell them along with charging station and infrastructure. They said in Oct that they doubled their storage, capacity, and employees to meet new and continuing order demand, and going public via Gigacapital3 Inc. These guys are currently valued at about $1B and have way more to show than some of these EV companies who literally haven't put out a damn thing, and their market cap is under $350 mil. Again they are producing now and will continue to grow, this should be an easy 3x bagger into June with exponential revenue growth hitting over $1B by 2024. They have warrants under GIK/WS exercising at $11.50.\n\nRead more https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/lightning-emotors-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-gigcapital\n\n\n\nLuminar (GMHI) - Orlando based lidar company, have deals with Daimler, Volvo, and now Mobileye (bought by Intel 2017). This merger to take these guys public will make lidar prodigy/Luminar founder the youngest billionaire in the US. I've seen valuations around $5-$7B for this guy so don't let Papa Elon scare you off from Lidar, it's going to be used broadly and Google is going after it too. Current market cap under $700k. Warrants are GMHIW and good for $11.50 after the merger and they have options\n\nRead more https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/amp/\n\n\n\nMicrovast (T-H-C-B) I have high hopes for this one When these guys ink a deal it's going to steal the hype from Quantum Scape and probably immediately poise them as global top 5 EV battery mfrs. Valued at at least $2B, under $450M market cap, $100M revenue 2020. I think these guys are gonna be right there with Quantum Scape developing solid state lithium batteries.
