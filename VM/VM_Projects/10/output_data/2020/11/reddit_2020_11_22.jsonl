Keep in mind, you\u2019ll want to take action as quickly as possible in order to prevent forced action in your account.\n \nIf no action is taken within a reasonable amount of time, Robinhood's brokers will act to cover short positions to help reduce risk.

One of those was a 'serious' adverse event, but Regeneron did not reveal details of what happened to the patient, who received a low dose of the drug. \n\nREGN-COV2 is comprised of a duo of therapeutics in a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies (hence REGN-COV2's distinction as a 'polyclonal antibody'), which are clones of antibody that attacks a specific antigen.\n\nThe company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.\n\nThe FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.\n\nTrump spent three days at Walter Reed after his infection in early October, where he received a variety of experimental treatments, including an antibody therapy from Regeneron.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies treatments are also being developed by Eli Lilly and other companies.\n\nThe drugs mimic antibodies that the immune system naturally produces to fight off viruses and other pathogens.\n\nTrump later credited the experimental drug therapy with aiding his recovery.\n\nTrump returned to the White House on Monday October 5 after spending three days hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Maryland for coronavirus.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody cocktail is considered experimental because clinical trials are ongoing and it hasn\u2019t been approved for the market by the FDA.\n\nTrump was able to receive it through the FDA\u2019s 'compassionate use' provision, where unapproved drugs are administered to seriously ill patients who have no other treatment options.\n\nWhile Regeneron has shared promising results of the treatment, which cut the viral load of COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, there is no evidence the drug cut the risk of death or 'cured' patients.\n\nThere also is no way for the president or his doctors to know that the drug had any effect.\n\nLast month, Bill Gates said Trump was wrong to call monoclonal antibodies treatment a 'cure' for COVID-19, but says it\u2019s the most promising therapeutic in research for now.\n\n'The word \"cure\" is inappropriate because it won't work for everyone.

{"title": "Metrics for Determining Stock Picks", "selftext": "I'm a relatively new investor (22 M) who began buying individual stocks this March. While I still keep the majority of my investments in an S&P 500 ETF and dollar-cost average into it every week, I wanted to see what people think about how I analyze my individual stock picks which in general I want to be more risky than my ETF. Some of the criteria I look at includes: \n\n1. Revenues/Earnings: I am usually more interested in if a company is growing revenues year-over-year versus earnings. The newer the company, the less I am worried about its EPS and P/E ratio. \n2. Market Cap: Do I see potential for the stock's value to continue raising or does it feel like the company is grossly overvalued relative to its revenues/earnings? \n3. Industry: I like to buy companies where I can see a growing/expanding industry or if there is a specific catalyst that will propel the stock forward over a certain time period (ex: oil stocks when Covid goes away).\n4. Analyst Ratings: In general I trust the consensus on the analyst's buy/hold/sell ratings and their price targets. My opinion is they probably know more about the stock as it is their job to evaluate companies. \n5. Volume: I usually don't like stocks with a super high volume because I feel like they are very volatile and a lot of the trading is from pump-and-dumpers or day traders. Exception is if it's a huge, well-established company that has had high volume for awhile. \n\nOverall I've earned more relative to the overall market since March and my current holdings include AMZN, BABA, SHOP, AVGO, DKNG, CRM, PTON, FANG, APHA.
