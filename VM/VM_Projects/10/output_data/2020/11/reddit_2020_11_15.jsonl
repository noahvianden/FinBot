{"title": "Do brokers get pissed if you frequently get assigned on purpose on vertical spreads without enough capital? Is this considered freeriding?", "selftext": "I realize this sub is about collecting premium off of theta,, but I was thinking of buying a few ATM  iron condors on NIO next week since the WSB idiots just finished pumping it into oblivion.\n\nI'm basically buying the iron condor as a poor man's straddle and trying to get assigned on the short and long legs on either side of freezing? Im only making like pennies on the dollar and just barely breaking positive after the brokerage fees. (Luckily my broker doesn't charge assignment or exercise fees)\n\nI definitely don't have enough capital in my account to be able to purchase 100 shares of NIO at one strike and sell them at the higher strike.\n\nDo brokerages get pissed over this? I looked up the definition of \"freeriding\" which can get your account a 90 day suspension,, and this sounds an awful lot like freeriding, but then isn't this the point of vertical debit spreads? To act as a synthetic alternative to buying a call or put option outright because you don't have the capital to purchase a call or put option without collecting credit on a further otm option?\n\nEdit: I've learned the answer.\n\nThe answer is, the broker will\n\n1)  usually sell the short option of your position, and/or the long option prior to close, which means you won't realize the theoretical max profit of your position because it likely won't sell for the full width of the long and short legs. The broker doesn't have any obligation to get a good price on your spread when they liquidate it.\n\n2) if your broker doesn't close it and both legs are in the money and the long leg of your position gets auto exercised and the short leg gets assigned to you, depending on the price of the underlying shares you would gave a MASSIVE margin call and the broker would have the right to liquidate all of the assets in your account in an attempt to cover your margin call, and you would be unable to trade out of any positions or fix any positions in your account until the following trading day.\n\nThe broker can do either of the two above options and doesn't have to warn you, or make any attempt to be nice about it.\n\nTLDR: even when purchasing vertical spreads or iron condors, don't hold till expiration. Don't abuse TD's policy on $0 assignment and exercise fees to avoid paying commissions to close your multi leg option positions by purchasing hundreds of cheap ITM vertical spreads 5 DTE just because you can. \n\nDon't be an idiot. \n\nTD Ameritrade will not thank you for it.\n\nEdit:\n\nI heard back from TD and it turns out most of the time it is actually completely fine if both legs of your vertical spread are ITM at expiration and both get exercised. The broker just handles the exercising of the contract automatically and you don't need to have enough capital in your account to handle the exercise.\n\nHOWEVER whoever bought the short leg of your spread COULD for some reason ask their broker not to exercise the long leg at expiration in which case your account actually would be left with a long/shott stock position which would result in a margin call.\n\nFURTHERMORE option contract holders can actually still exercise their contracts until 4:30 pm central time so if the underlying moves during after hours trading such that the short leg is ITM at expiration, and the contract holder asks their broker to exercise, and you sold your long leg before market close, you would be left with a short/long stock position and possibly face a margin call.\n\nBUT having said all of this, the vast majority of the time if both legs of your vertical spread are ITM at expiration, you do not need to worry about liquidating the spread prior to close to avoid a margin call.

It also edged up an investment in Tesla \ufffc (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.\n\nCalpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.\n\nA short seller\u2019s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers\u2019 deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.\n\nNIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.\n\nJ.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company\u2019s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.\n\nCalpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.\n\nThe pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.\n\nZoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.\n\nCalpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.\n\nTesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday\u2019s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.\n\nThe electric-vehicle giant\u2019s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.\n\nSource: https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2102889962897/largest-us-pension-bought-up-ev-stocks-nikola-and-nio-and-zoom", "id": "juufzo", "created_utc": 1605477486.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Fuck calpers yoloing my pension money on NKLA of all things.....", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Lol that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.
