Those funds essentially need to copy the S&P500 exactly and based on the total value in said funds they will collectively need to add 116M shares of Tesla.  The only thing I don't know is if they have to add them on Dec. 21 or can do it a bit before and a bit after.  No idea what the leeway is here.  One has to assume that if you're an investor and buy an index fund that said they will mirror S&P500 and all of a sudden you find that they are holding Tesla (which isn't yet in the index) you have good reason to be pissed that they are gambling with your cash.  You likely have grounds for some legal challenge too. So when do they need to buy?\n\nSecond, there is benchmark funds.  These use the S&P500 as a benchmark for their own performance and have some wiggle room to buy more or less of certain shares or even stuff not in the SP&500, right? The managers need to decide how much of Tesla to buy, as I'm sure they will want their own fund to somewhat track the index even if it's not exact.  They don't want to be wildly out if Tesla surges or tanks.  If all of these funds purchased the shares they need to be equal weight to the index, they collectively need 167M shares.

This would increase Oracle's value immensely, as it is a business deal closely related to working with the governments (smells kind of political) and to be able to wield TikTok in the American market would be comparable to the new snapchat or instagram or vine. It seems like a really great app (100 million users), and once hands transfer over to an American company (fingers crossed?) the tech market would probably be disrupted to some degree as well, as it's comparable to Facebook buying Instagram, which many people are pissed at for mishandling American's data....\n\nOh, plus the Don gave it, \"his blessing.\"\n\nI don't do calls or anything, but I might put a good chunk of change into it soon.\n\nTo be updated.", "id": "jv18cd", "created_utc": 1605504117.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Oracle is trash.

This will provide traders structural opportunities to profit from selling elevated convexity into the market via Put Write/ Call Write Strangles, which are 5% out of the money. Traders will assume the role of Insurance Companies for two weeks selling premiums via writing policies and keeping the profit at the end of the two weeks. Profit from it\n\n**Brief on Trading Suggestion**; We will temporarily be in a period of reduced swings up and down (lower realized & implied volatility)\n\n**The rationale for the Trade;** The market will remain relatively range-bound over the next few weeks. This will present traders with the perfect opportunity to profit from selling volatility back into the market. A low return environment and possible negative curve (with Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion acting as a useful backstop) invite investors to re-engage temporarily in seeking to exploit timely carry trades by selling volatility back into the market.\n\n**The Risk for the Trade**; The risk is any large increase in realized volatility, which causes the equity market to move up or down greater than 5% to 7% this week. This would create substantial problems to the right or left side of the distribution curve.
