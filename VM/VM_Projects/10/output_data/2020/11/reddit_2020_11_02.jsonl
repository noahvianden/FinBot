{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 2, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**\n\nStocks opened today\u2019s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.\n\nAfter an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.\n\nOn Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).\n* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single\u2019s day is a counter to Valentine\u2019s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it\u2019s held on Nov 11. This is the world\u2019s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, a major indicator for China's manufacturing sector, rose in October, showing that domestic demand is holding up, reports said over the weekend.\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) upgraded by Morgan Stanley (MS) to $175 OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $131\n* Alibaba (BABA) target raised by Keycorp from $330 to $350 OVERWEIGHT.

{"title": "The beautiful sight of an infectious disease stock bubble deflating and investment in the real economy springing back to life", "selftext": "[finviz heatmap (full stocks)](https://imgur.com/73jvrvF)\n\n[finviz heatmap (Sectors/ETFs)](https://imgur.com/C8X09jz)\n\nToday we see green lighting up all across the economy as investors that have been holding cash made an initial foray into stocks as the possibility of a Blue Sweep strengthens. All of the out of favor stocks that desperately needed some investor support received injections of capital today\n\n\u2022 Industrials as a sector  \n\u2022 Infrastructure as a sector  \n\u2022 Consumer stocks (not just pantry goods and delivery foods)   \n\u2022 Health care stocks (not just research biomedical & vaccines)   \n\u2022 Financial stocks (and not just investment banks)  \n\u2022 Small cap, mid cap and large cap, all gained value  \n\u2022 Value stocks, as an equities class, finally saw investor support  \n\u2022 Base materials & industrial metals (needed for industrial activity)  \n\u2022 Energy (old energy, renewable energy)(needed for industrial activity)  \n\nObviously, the money didn't come from people selling off safe haven stashes of gold, as gold (also a metal with industrial uses) was up today with all the other commodities. It appears investors who have been hoarding cash were injecting investments into the markets today, in part. Additional investment money, in a move very beneficial to rebalancing the markets, obviously came from the coronavirus pandemic stock bubble stocks, where, as excessive investment capital, it hadn't been doing anyone much good. The top-heavy lumps of red attest to the needed lancing of that boil that has been distorting markets and starving hard-up companies of capital needed to survive the Winter in better shape.\n\nNotable names in [industrial engineering](https://imgur.com/undefined) and [industrial speciality stocks that advanced the most are](https://imgur.com/gpnluuD): Honeywell, Emerson Electric, Trane, Flowserve, Curtiss-Wright, L3 Harris. Basically all the stocks in the index did very well and most did better than 3% gains today, which the sector much needed. I expect to see significant rebound-recovery gains in those two sectors in coming weeks/months.\n\nThere will be plenty of articles detailing and analyzing today's gains, but the advances conform to my observation last week that specialty industrial technology firms was an area of strength during last week's falling markets and they sprang into the lead as a sector today. Expect a solid rebound in industrial speciality companies going forward as they regain the 10-40% valuations lost earlier this year. Except for EV stocks, Asian stocks, which were also an area of strength last week, lagged the market leaders today but didn't fall into red. Renewable energy stocks were mixed during a solid energy sector advance that saw more old energy rebounding from lows than clean energy growth stocks advance today. \n\nIt was a very welcome sight to see money and investors that had been stagnating in bubble stocks some out of the shadows and light up the economy today with some needed investment capital.", "id": "jmw390", "created_utc": 1604350864.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that TSHTF if there it's close/contested. \n\nThis time the risk of bad polling is equally high but the way polls are being factored in by analysts is a little more cautions than last time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Why don't people understand that polls don't give rock solid predictions.

{"title": "The future of Investing on r/wallstreetbets", "selftext": "Hello WSB. From the gay bears to the retards, from the autists to the boomers, I think I speak for all of us when I say I love a good picture of people\u2019s stock portfolio going from $200 to $500k(rags to riches) as much as I love a $10 mil to $40 (eat the rich!). But I think we can all agree that this community has the power to be much more than that. In a time when politics is turbulent, friends are distant, and families only exist on a screen, a lot of us can agree that the world is not moving in a direction we like. But that path does not have to continue. We can change it.\n\nWe have the power to invest our money as a collective unit and shift the economic trajectory of the world for the better.\n\nThis is the state of affairs as I see it.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nInvestor side\n\nInvesting is more accessible than it has ever been, but that accessibility has also led to instability. WSB amongst other investor \u201cstrategies\u201d has made \u201cget rich or die trying\u201d the narrative of the NYSE. The stock market and Robinhood are just another dopamine slot machine with a knob to be turned a la Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, any company that monetizes your attention. The capital swings steered by WSB and other new investors have shown an ability to shift the market enough for industries to notice, but we have yet to encourage companies to make changes towards a common goal. \n\nStock market Side\n\nThe stock market currently functions to incentivize rapid growth rather than sustainable business plans and continue to improve upon themselves with time. From the massive explosions in the valuations of Apple and Tesla to the massive IPO and inevitable bust of companies like Uber, Peloton, and Fitbit, modern investment strategy seems to follow companies that we think other people think will do well. This pushes companies to tout false narratives of growth and unchecked consumption of resources by these companies (energy, water, labor, land, etc.\n\nThe Political Side (US)\n\nIf you are from the US, you are likely tired of hearing that this election is \u201cthe most important election of our generation\u201d. This is not about who anyone wants to win, it is about the amount of influence we have over these candidates. Regardless of who the next President is, the state of the economy, and by (some) extension, the stock market will shape the way they view, regulate, and interact with the market\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThe solution to these problems seems apparent to me and I hope you see it too. Now, more than ever, we should be trying to utilize this powerful capital and steer politics with our wallets. Companies are in a position to pivot and respond to markets, politicians are listening to the people, and we have enough combined capital to have SOME effect on the market. This does not mean putting all your money in FAANG or TSLA because they keep climbing. It means doing research, diversifying into stable ETFs, and investing based upon your expectation 10-20 years from now. I can not tell you what that future is, but I think we can all agree it is different from the present.\n\nCall to action\n\nThis is where everyone can play a part in this. My hope for this post is that it is a space for healthy conversations about what the future of our planet can look like and what investments can help put us there. I do not expect everyone to have the same view for the future, but I do hope that we can all better understand how our views and our investments can align. As people post recommendations of their worldviews and the ETFs that fit into that, I encourage others to weigh in on the pros and cons of that ETF or that market as a whole. Next, I expect participants to vote when a good point is made. THIS IS KEY. A vote does not mean you agree or disagree with someone\u2019s point, it means that their statement adds another data point to the discussion and others should consider it. Downvotes should be used to combat misleading, false, and damaging content, not content that does not support our views.\n\nWith that, I hope we can all start investing in the future, for the future, regardless of what that future looks like to each of us.\n\nDisclosure\n\nFor the sake of transparency I should state that my investments are as follows:\n\n* 22% S&P\n* 38% Big Tech (Includes RSUs)\n* 21% BioTech and Pandemic related (includes ESPP)\n* 4% Alt food\n* 15% Alt Energy\n\nI hope to change this to a more future-oriented portfolio", "id": "jms906", "created_utc": 1604339137.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "And you expect me to read all of this when I can\u2019t even read 1 page of a book without falling asleep yeah nice try retard", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14358927309513092}, {"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
