{"title": "Some interesting news in the stock market this week", "selftext": "**Growth Stocks (Medifast and Cardlytics)**\n\n**Medifast** $MED, the weight management company, presented at the ICR conference on Monday and restated its goal to double in size every 3-4 years and targeted 2021 revenues of $1,000 million (2019 guidance $700-$710 million)  That\u2019s reassuring after a disappointing Q3 when the company was hit by a credit card fraud.\n\nThe stock dropped 29% after those results which seemed a little harsh since the issue was fully resolved, revenues still managed to grow 36.5% and guidance for the full year forecast 40% revenue growth and 26% EPS growth.  It\u2019s not as if Medifast was trading on a big multiple.  The stock has since recovered from the post release drop and then, as it is now, trades on around 2x trailing revenues and 20x trailing earnings.  Pretty reasonable for a growth stock.\n\nThe problem is is that Medifast has been tarred with the same brush as Herbalife and other multi level marketing schemes which use agents to promote sales.  However, the model is quite different. Medifast sells direct to the customer.  Its agents don\u2019t get discounts or handle stock.  That means Medifast isn\u2019t artificially boosting sales by recruiting and selling to its own agents.\n\nA few years ago the company was a quiet and essentially family run affair.  That was until Dan Chard was appointed in 2015.  Formerly the President of Global Sales and Operations at Nu Skin he was the right person for the job.  He developed the Optavia Diet brand and put in place the direct marketing business model. Sales exploded from $273 million to $689 million in less than four years.\n\nWith a product that works and a growing level of demand (driven by obesity) coupled with a capital light highly scalable business model and effective management, Medifast looks very attractive.  The company also has a potentially huge global opportunity but only recently moved to grow internationally with expansion into Hong Kong and Singapore 2019.  Europe and South America and Australia would also make excellent markets.\n\nCEO Dan Chard\u2019s comments this week suggest the bright outlook has not changed.  2021 targets for revenue of $1,000 million and 15% operational margins remain.  That  would generate net income of $115 million if we apply the current effective tax rate.  The $115.58 stock price at Fridays close would represent a forward earnings multiple of just 11.7 (TTM PE 19). With a strong growth forecast, the stock looks cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cardlytics** $CDLX reported preliminary Q4 revenues this week that were up 44% at $69 million and thrashed estimates of $59 million.  The digital advertiser uses a proprietary native bank advertising channel that enables marketers to reach consumers through their trusted and frequently visited online and mobile banking channels.\n\nHowever Cardlytics\u2019 main advantage is the use of purchase intelligence outside the banking channel to boost advertising effectiveness. It\u2019s not difficult to see why knowing what customers have bought in the past is a good predictor of what they will buy in the future.  The company claims that its return on ad spend (ROAS) is 10x the industry average at $30 for each $1 spent.\n\nThe stock price has risen 22% since the announcement but (valued at 11.3x revenues) still looks reasonable compared to peers such as The Trade Desk (valued at 21x). With a huge ROAS advantage, it seems likely that strong growth will continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value Stocks (Samsung, Signet and Fluent)**\n\nFool.com reported that this is an exciting and pivotal time for NVIDIA. The company remains at the forefront of gaming and is well placed to thrive in the new frontiers which lie in data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive applications.  However, if the valuation at 35x forward earnings is too much for you (and you don\u2019t mind looking abroad) then perhaps **Samsung Electronics** ($005930.KS) is a better buy.\n\nSamsung has a dominant position in memory chips and memory demand is exploding with the roll out of 5G and applications in artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The company is currently trading on just 9x last years earnings. Additionally, net cash (including short term investments) is equivalent to a remarkable 25% of its total valuation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Signet Jewelers** $SIG stock price jumped 40% on Thursday after the company reported a significant beat and raise. The company, whose outlets include Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared, said comps were up 1.6% as a 13.5% growth in digital sales helped offset a 0.2% decline in brick and mortar sales.  That\u2019s encouraging as it seems jewelry buyers switching to online channels prefer to buy from names they know and trust.  The retailer still faces headwinds but its valuation doesn\u2019t look expensive.  EPS guidance was raised to $3.42 to $3.56 from $2.99 to $3.26 meaning, even after the recent price jump, the $29.52 stock is valued at just 8.4x earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fluent, Inc**. $FLNT announced on Tuesday that it expects to exceed its previously provided guidance for full-year 2019 with revenue now anticipated to be $280.8 - $281.8 million, representing growth of 12% and an increase from previous guidance of $265 - $267 million.\n\nThe company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them. A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent and the company has already reportedly started testing in the UK.\n\nThe news this week is an important development for Fluent whose stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 60% (with a valuation of 0.8x sales and 1.1x book) from the years highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice.\n\nIn fairness, management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform remains very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable).\n\nThe recent results support that thesis and suggests growth should accelerate once the headwind of exiting non core businesses passes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider (RumbleOn)**\n\nBoth the CFO and a director at **RumbleOn** $RMBL each picked up $114,000 of stock on Tuesday following $90,000 of purchases by the CEO last month.  (Warning RumbleOn is a high risk nano cap stock)\n\nMake no mistake RumbleOn is tiny with a market cap of just $16 million.  A development stage e-commerce platform that facilitates consumers and dealers to buy, sell, trade, and finance pre-owned recreational vehicles. It primarily focuses on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other powersports and also provides third-party financing services.  However, it is growing rapidly leveraging its capital-light network of 17 regional partnerships and disrupting the old-school pre-owned vehicle dealerships.  Thats a massive and highly fragmented market with around $1 trillion of sales.\n\nRumbleOn expects to achieve its first quarter of EBITDA profitability in 2020 and have a full year of EBITDA profitability in 2021. That seems reasonable given recent growth.  In November Q3 results reported revenues of $220 million compared to just $19 million in 2018. Last week the company reported preliminary results expecting full year 2019 revenue range to $837.7 million to $840.7 million compared to $156 million in 2018.  Margins are tight but the company is moving swiftly from dealers to consumer sales which are almost three times as profitable.\n\nRumbleOn CEO Marshall Chesrown said \u201cWe are pleased with the progress we are making\u201d going on to add \u201cWe continue to expect an acceleration in unit and revenue growth in the first half of 2020\u201d.\n\nThe company is a high risk development stage nano cap with dilution being more of a certainty than a risk.  However its fast growth suggests it is resonating well with users and, if it is even slightly successful in winning a small share of the huge vehicle sales market, current stock holders should do very well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to be informed of updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.
