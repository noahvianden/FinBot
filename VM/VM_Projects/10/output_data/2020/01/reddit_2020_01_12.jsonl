What do you think?", "selftext": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340\n\nABSTRACT: By employing leverage to gain more exposure to stocks when young, individuals can achieve better diversification across time. Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies?both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments. The expected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 19% higher compared to 100% stock investments. The expected gain would allow workers to retire almost six years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement by 27 years.\n\nSome key things to discuss (in my view):\n\n- We're taking young investors 20-40s only. If you are retiring in 10 years I'm sure you'd delever.\n\n- There are ways to leverage that don't involve borrowing money. Example: SSO.\n\n- Do daily balancing costs offset the gains? The article above gives a clear explanation of why they DONT. If you think they do (which is a very reasonable position), tell us where these authors make a mistake.\n\n- There's a huge psychological element. There's sure to be a 25% crash in the next 20 years. Seeing your entire retirement go down 75% might be a reason not to do this. However, let's suppose you ARE psychologically ready.
