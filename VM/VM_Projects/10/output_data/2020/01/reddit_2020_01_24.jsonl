{"title": "In response to other articles, the longest bull market in history makes no sense to me.", "selftext": "Hello friends,\n\nFirst off as the title states I think there will be a correction in the near future. Take this with a grain of salt but this is only my opinion but we have multiple bubbles brewing. I always advise dollar-cost averaging but I would also recommend holding a healthy amount of cash. Now I am leaning towards cash because the market is strange to say the least. \n\nWhen the correction happens, it will be catastrophic. I know it will impact everyone but I believe it will hit millennials and 60+ the hardest. \n\nBelow are the bubbles I see:\n\n\n60+ effects: Health care costs: Health care inflation rates have outpaced wages for decades. This will affect everyone but mostly older adults because it is the time in their lives that they typically need care. A larger and larger % of their money is dedicated to costs each year. Why is this bad? As the elderly run low on money more and more will slip into poverty. This takes money out of the market/economy and will begin to stress the medical system, especially Medicaid which is gradually lowering benefits.  As Medicaid begins to fail/reduce benefits/reduce payout the medical institutions will have to learn to recoup the cost from another source, AKA the rest of us not using the services. Combine this with the exploding aging demographic the current infrastructure is in danger. The premiums for the average family are already over 1200$ per month, + whatever deductible, + plus bullshit out of network expenses. To me, this is the scariest bubble we have over the next 2 decades. \n\n\nHousing: effects millennials and 60+: How does this affect both? Home prices have also been outpacing inflation consistently. On top of this, the average new home built is significantly larger and more expensive. This restricts a lot of new home buyers (typically age 25-35) from entering the real estate market. Homes have historically been one of the primary sources of family\u2019s net wealth as they age (equity grows via inflation/down payment). On top of this because younger adults are being restricted from buying homes they are forced to rent, which further delays them because rentals all over the country have also been steadily increasing in rates. Meaning younger adults are losing out on years of a crucial long-term investment. Here is the kicker though, many adults retiring were expecting to sell their homes and downsize. This process of transferring wealth potential to younger generations is eliminated because the younger generation does not have the money. Now the retiring adults are stuck with a home with higher expenses until they can sell at a rate lower than they expected. \n\n\nSchool debt: This will affect mostly younger adults <35: This basically builds on the two above. National student loan debt is close to $1.5 T (T = TRILLION). Young adults with education are typically defined as the middle class because with the education they have higher earning potential. Due to the increasing student loan debt, many are unable to take the \u201crisks\u201d and \u201copportunities\u201d the older generations could afford to take. Student loan debt not only restricts them from homes, but it also delays many from investing in the markets long term. Which is devasting long term if you invested 500$ monthly at 8% for 30 years starting at 0 you have 750k$ if you had 40 years of growth it is $1.75M that is a 1,000,000 difference\u2026\u2026. Basically, the demographic which would typically support the economy/market is being severely limited. I WILL CAVEAT THIS if you go or went to school for a degree which had no earning potential and came out with massive debt I am sorry, but that was just stupid on so many fronts on your part, and mostly your fault.\n\n\nOil: Effects everyone: Our global economy is based on oil. Oil is already struggling due to demand being too low and supply too high. As global sentiment continues to decrease towards the industry and new innovative technology is released to replace oil the demand will further deteriorate. What is going to happen is the big companies like OXY, EXXON, BP, CHEVRON, etc will survive and absorb some smaller entities. However, many of the less profitable sectors will erode leaving ghost towns and 100,000 of thousands of people out of work. The industry that takes its place will be a shell of itself. Cities across the country are already starting to ban 1-time use plastics.\n\n\nWages: effects all: Combine all the above with wages being stagnant over the past decade. \n\n\nYet again take my advice with a grain of salt: However, we are now in the longest bull market in history with unprecedented growth. This is why I am invested in cash, total market index funds, and individual stocks with a strong dividend.\n\n\nTLDR: The medical sector, student debt, homes prices have been increasing and hinder growth, major market players being disrupted, wages stagnant all lead to an economy which is not going to be sustainable long term.\n\n\nI'll edit grammatical errors tomorrow when I wake up, wrote this in response to an article stating they don\u2019t understand the current market surge.", "id": "et6y61", "created_utc": 1579849914.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "Why is the next correction such a boogeyman for people?

{"title": "An idea for what Tesla China design center is going to design after all", "selftext": "After seeing the news about GM and Honda unveiling a self-driving car with no steering wheel or pedals, something hit me. What if the design center in China isn't going to design a smaller, more affordable alternative to Model 3, but rather a minivan type vehicle designed to operate without a driver.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this to be the case. Firstly I recall Elon making a comment sometime back regarding a smaller, more affordable car. I can't find the source, but what he said was something like \"There won't be need for a more affordable Tesla, because of ridesharing becoming mainstream\". This means, that unless Elon's opinions have changed, he doesn't think a compact model is needed.\n\nThe second reason is, that FSD is actually right around the corner. Elon even responded on Twitter \"soon\", when asked when it will be released. However there isn't really a car on Tesla's selection, that would be designed purely for being a robotaxi. Something similar to Cruise Origin would therefore make sense. If this vehicle is revealed in some time during 2021-2022, then the urgency for such a vehicle could be much higher, as FSD would've been out for a long time, and would probably be already quite reliable.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, and yes I know the recruiting notice had a picture of a compact car on it.

If his thesis is correct, Steves said Intel would simply be riding a \u201crising tide\u201d that\u2019s lifting all data-center competitors, and he expects rivals Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.12%  and AMD to keep outperforming Intel by picking up share.\u201d\n\nWhen Micron reported earnings in December they announced the bottom of the semiconductor market. And, they believe with their recent expansion in sales that the market it finally turning up due to 5G. With 5G more things are going to go into the cloud than we have now and new businesses will be born from this. You need data centers to power this. Micron makes the drives to hold the data for the data centers. AMD and Intel make the CPUs to process the data. \n\nIntel reported 1 billion in growth from the cycle turning out. Analysts are shrugging their shoulders because the conference call said they will experience a down turn in the second half, which is strange for a company that just beat by 1 billion. The banks grilled Intel about this and they answered that it is due to competition and they made their numbers \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\nAMD has released beefy 64 core processors so much cheaper than Intel and on 7nm technology, which Intel said won\u2019t have until 2021. This is why AWS and Azure and even Google Cloud are buying so many of these processors. They get better margins for their investors and they get better efficiency.
