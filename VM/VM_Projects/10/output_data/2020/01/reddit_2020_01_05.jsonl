They say you should hold the stock and wait for it to recover but the truth is that it might take years to recover, and then it might not even reach the same price again. The reason you diversify is so that it doesn't tank your whole portfolio\n\nExample:\nIf your whole portfolio is in 1 industry, and something shakes the industry i.e. minimum wage increases drastically and suddenly labour driven businesses all take a huge financial hit. Then the value of your entire portfolio has now decreased and you lost money. So if you have 2 $100 stocks in that industry and they decrease by $20 then you lost a total of $40. \n\nNow same scenario but you have stock 2 in a different industry that is less labour intensive. Stock 1 -$20 and stock 2 only -$10. So a total loss of $30. Less than before. \n\n\"But that's not alot\" you think, and yes for 1 stock it isn't, but now take that by x10000 and it is a huge loss.\n\nSomething like a minimum wage change is most likely not going to change, so for businesses in heavy labour industries, smaller businesses wills be wiped most likely and larger companies might be able to save themselves and then it will be years until they maybe recover and reach that same level if the company didn't fold already. \n\nBasically, it's the old \"All eggs in 1 basket idea\" - basket breaks, all the eggs are gone.
