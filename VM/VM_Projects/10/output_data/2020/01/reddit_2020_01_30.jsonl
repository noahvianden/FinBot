I was sort of interested in what effect it would have going into a recession or significant slowdown. Here is what i think it does, it leaks more liquidity into the system, but doesn't change the typical underlying issues associated with the typical end of an economic cycle. For example we have had two adjustments take place, the first, a slow down in investments and the second, today, a slowdown in consumption. These are all typical symptoms of a pending slowdown in growth falling below trend. I do not think QE cures those symptoms, but like you, I think it just inflates asset prices. Whether housing, equities, bonds, & etc. \n\nI think the Federal Reserve has a global responsibility to reign it in and let the adjustment process work. If it means stocks need to correct 10% or 20% so be it. I think if we continue down the path of cutting rates, expanding the balance sheet, it is going to engender significantly more risk taking, more reaching for yield, more exposure to short gamma in institutions and retail investment portfolios. There is no evidence given the way the system is currently setup this doesn't end with a massive adjustment in prices. \n\nFor example Bank of France and John Law circa 1700's - Similiar type of liquidyt driven asset bubble (not exactly similiar, but focusing on just the massive amount of liquidity) it eventually runs it's course and cannot go on into perpetuity without very bad unintended consequences. For example we can take the medicine now and accept a 10% or 20% correction in prices or we can allow it go on further. If we do, we have China opening their capital account and another 600 to 800 billion dollars flooding into the US portfolio channel. If this were to happen the prolonged dollar strength would completely ruin the investment made since 2008 in the oil/chemical/ and export sector.

The rest of the Model 3 manufacturing processes are running as expected. Due to strong initial customer response in China, our goal is to increase Model 3 capacity even further using existing facilities. We have already broken ground on the next phase of Gigafactory Shanghai. Given the popularity of the SUV vehicle segment, we are planning for Model Y capacity to be at least equivalent to Model 3 capacity \n\n Berlin-Brandenburg \n\n> We are moving forward with our preparations near Berlin   \n>  \n> The first deliveries from this factory are expected in 2021 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FSD :** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Tesla vehicles have driven over 3 billion miles in Autopilot mode \\[...\\] As our fleet grows, Autopilot miles increase exponentially, adding yet more data to our neural net. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> All Tesla vehicles with our FSD computer have been updated with new software that can better detect new details in their environments  .  Understanding the environment is key to enabling our cars to react to traffic lights and stop signs and take intersections through city streets. We are currently validating this functionality before releasing to customers, and we look forward to its gradual deployment \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVehicle Software : \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> In Q4, we launched premium vehicle connectivity in the US for $9.99 (plus tax) per month \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> We also introduced in-app purchases, where our customers can buy various software updates, such as basic Autopilot, FSD, acceleration boost and additional premium features. Software will continue to play a growing role in our business model. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Battery & Powertrain :\n\n> Due to continued engineering progress of the Model Y AWD, we have been able to increase its maximum EPA range to 315 miles, compared to our previous estimate of 280 miles. This extends Model Y's lead as the most energy efficient electric SUV in the world.  \n\n**Energy Business :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Energy storage deployment reached an all-time high of 530 MWh in Q4, which included the first deployments of Megapack \\[\u2026\\]  Since the introduction of this product, the level of interest and orders from various global project developers and utilities has surpassed our expectations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> In 2019, we deployed 1.65 GWh of energy storage, more than we deployed in all prior years combined. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Solar :** \n\n> In Q4, we deployed 54 MW of solar, 26% more than in the prior quarter. Where offered, subscription solar has grown significantly in Q4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> In Q4, we continued to ramp both Solarglass Roof production as well as installations \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> After organizing several roofing company training days at our training homes in Fremont, we already demonstrated dramatically shorter installation times versus previous versions of this product. Solarglass tiles are made in our Gigafactory New York, and we are hiring hundreds of employees at this facility \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Outlook :**\n\nVolume :\n\n> For full year 2020, vehicle deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Both solar and storage deployments should grow at least 50% in 2020 \n\n  \n**Cash Flow :**\n\n>We expect positive quarterly free cash flow going forward, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp of new products. We continue to believe our business has grown to the point of being self-funding.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Profitability :**\n\n> We expect positive GAAP net income going forward, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp of new products. Continuous volume growth, capacity expansion, and cash generation remain the main focus. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Production :**\n\n>Production ramp of Model Y in Fremont has begun, ahead of schedule. Model 3 production in Shanghai is continuing to ramp while Model Y production in Shanghai will begin in 2021.

We try to create a product that is superior every way without any preconception of how such a product should look. So, it really just from a standpoint of : What's the most badass futuristic *armoured personnel carrier* , that, you know kick the ass of any pick-up truck, basically. That's the goal. we want it to look like something that just came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand is incredible. We have never seen a level of demand as---  we have never seen anything like it basically. I think we would make as many as we can for many years \\[ I don't understand what he is saying\\] It's gonna to be nuts. And I think actually the product is better than people realize even . They don't have enough information to analyse how awesome it is.     \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you look back 10 years for today , to 2010, we will produce approximately a thousand times more cars in 2020 that we produce in 2010. A thousand. And we have also solarglass, solar retrofit, powerwall, powerpack, you know... all these things do . so, where will we be in 10 years ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extend we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus. At this point, we are excepting an one to one and a half week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but it's limited as the process contribution remain n early stages.                                                                                                                          \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It would probably make sense to enabled car sharing in advance sort of drive robotaxi fleet. Because Full Self-driving is a approved by regulators. so, it's probably something that we would enabled before the sort of robotaxi fleet is enabled.\n\nSupercharger at Airport ?  Sure !\n\nTesla Insure Insurance would expand in other locations. We are spending our time for the regulatory process to expand in other locations\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould we see a discount on Tesla Insurance if we use Autopilot ? sure\n\n>  \n>  \n>Insurance will be a major product for Tesla overtime\n\n FSD Feature Complete by 2019 end, could you provide an update ?\n\n>I mean to be precise, I said I was hoping it would be feature complete by the end of last year. we got pretty close. You know, it's looking like we might be feature compete in a few months. \\[\u2026\\] What isn't obvious regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of Autonomy \\[\u2026\\] We are only  beginning to take advantage of the Autopilot hardware, the FSD hardware. \\[\u2026\\] A really fundamental thing is moving to video training, so in term of labelling . Labelling with video and all 8 cameras simultaneously . In term of labelling efficiency arguably a 3 order of  magnitude improvement in labelling efficiency.\n\nStarlink Implemetation ?\n\n>Well it's only something that could be happening in the coming years. There's no plan for this year. the purpose of Starlink high-bandwidth connectivity for home and services , I guess aircraft and boat. The antenna for high-bandwidth is about the size of a medium pizza which you could put on car but I think is more bandwidth you will really need\n\nWhen Starlink Implementation happen, how would it affect user experience ?\n\n>Well I think most part of all we will just use cellular connectivity, just use 5g \\[I don't understand\\] in the cities something like that, but if you are on the country side and there is no good cell connectivity then you could connect with Starlink Internet \\[\u2026\\] I don't think about it very much\n\nCybertruck Production and cost :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We don't comment on the detail numbers \\[...\\] The demand is supperior of wat we could in space of 3-4 years, something like that. The thing we are going to be really focus on is increasing battery production capacity because that's very fundamental cause if you don't improve battery production capacity you end up just shipping one volume from one part to an other and you haven't actually make produce more EV. That's part of the reason why we have not really accelerate  production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then accelerate the production of the semi will mean producing less Model 3 and Model Y.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It would make sense to do it \\[ Battery Investor Day\\] at the end of this quarter \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think there are some things that would differentiate it \\[Y and 3\\] but not we wouldn't talk about it on this call.

I buy 1 morgan stanley call because they were looking good imo. I wake up to their ER and my fucking badass little call made me $350, it was a 300% gain. I fucking locked in that fucker and felt great for the rest of the day, divied up my portfolio and I decide to try puts with my gains. I buy a few puts and low and fucking behold, my big boy gains went down the drain by friday. So that friday (last friday) I decide well fuck, epidemics are scary so i'll just go in on SPY puts. Monday was great, I coulda locked in a 30% gain on it, but no I got fucking greedy and decided to hold for the big dip on tuesday. I spend literally 14 hours straight watching the futures rise and fall until the market opened green and I fucking blew it. I freak out for the rest of the day and browse wsb until I made a realization. The only problem i'm having is that I bought fucking piece of shit puts in a Fed Market.\n\nSo this morning I see AMD dropping like 10 billions and I decide to do it, I bought the fucking dip. That 1/31 call made me $100 fucking dollars by the end of the day.\n\nAnd there you have it, i'm never buying puts again. Why the fuck would anyone in their right mind put money on value going down, while the fed is putting your money on value going up, it's fucking nonsense.\n\nI got fucked by the fed's giant swinging bulldozer bull dick and it changed me as a human being.\n\nOnly calls from here on out, because in this fed market the stonks ONLY go UP!  \n\n\n  \nEdit: Well fuck and now all the futures are red and tomorrow is when corona beats sars in infections total.
