{"title": "Some Interesting news in the stock market this week", "selftext": "The market hit new highs this week as the number of news stories picked up considerably.  Despite the lofty levels, a number of the releases identified some cheaply priced value opportunities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value stocks**\n\nOn Thursday **PVH Corp** $PVH (the owner of global brands including Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein) announced a new regional president for its fast growing Asian business and raised its guidance saying it now expects full year EPS of at least $9.45 (compared to its prior view for $9.43 to $9.45).  Not a huge increase, but with the stock down 25% from year highs and trading on a TTM PE of 11.8 it looks cheap compared to peers such as Tapestry (14.7x), Ralph Lauren (20.9x) and VF Corp (29.5x).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stage Stores Inc** $SSI, the rural department store operator, dropped 10% on Friday after a remarkable run up in the stock over the past two months. It follows a difficult period for the retailer as the company\u2019s profitability had been affected by the retail apocalypse.  To offset negative trends it had recently begun transitioning a number of its stores to an off-price model in an attempt to boost margins.  \n\nHowever, in September the company announced the decision to transition all 783 stores to the off price model by the end of 2020.  A clear signal that the transition was going well.  Subsequently, Q3 figures in November reported comps up 17% (with the 89 converted stores revenues growing 40%). \n\nThat\u2019s a remarkable improvement.  CEO Michael Glazer said on the November 21st earnings call;\n\n*\u201cI want to share with you the incredible excitement that is going on here at Stage Stores. We are absolutely thrilled with our third quarter results. And on nearly every key financial metric, the third quarter of 2019 was a record setting.\u201d* \n\nThe stock price has rocketed after touching a low of $0.55 during the year, but is still only a third of the price it traded for in 2015.  That still looks cheap with a market cap of just $250 million compared to trailing sales of $1.6 billion and full year EBITDA guidance of $37.5 million.  Importantly, with the remaining 90% of stores on target for transitioning by Q3, there is a real potential for the company to increase revenues significantly leveraging fixed costs and boosting margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Wednesday, strip club operator **RCI Holdings** $RICK reported sales up 10.1% to a record $47.8 Million with same store sales also increasing 0.7%. However it did little for the stock which was down 5% on the year and down 20% from this years highs.  \u201cHighs\u201d may not be the best word for RCI which is trading on just 11.5x trailing earnings and just 7.6x current year estimates.  \n\nThe company has been hit by dissatisfaction regarding governance that has resulted in the resignation of its auditor and a formal investigation by the SEC into related party transactions.  That\u2019s the type of news no investor wants to hear.  However, for investors that accept that strip club industry executives are not always the same as your typical Wall Street executive then the current valuation looks attractive. RCI Hospitality enjoys high growth, high margins, strong cash flows, and a regulatory moat that protects its business and profits.  The industry remains highly fragmented and there is a huge potential for growth through acquisitions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Growth Stocks**\n\n**SmileDirectClub** $SDC announced on Monday that it was launching a new line of oral care available exclusively at Walmart. That is good news but surely the bigger story is that this $4 billion company is disrupting a huge market. \n\nIt is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide. That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion with SmileDirectClub's current market cap amounting to a tiny fraction of that.\n\nThe company is high risk and speculative.  It faces challenges from the dental lobby, state regulators and a class action suit.  However when considered against the huge potential opportunity and cheap valuation, it looks like a tempting gamble. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso on Monday **Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico** $PAC reported passenger traffic increase of 11.4% for December.  Nothing new there.  Mexican air travel is a growth industry and PAC is the leading Mexican airport operator with diverse operations in strategic locations.  PAC has recently agreed its 5 year development plan with the Mexican government including healthy rates and no meaningful changes to capital expenditures. That takes away some uncertainty and the stock has risen 36% this year.  Trading on 18.1x next year\u2019s forecast earnings, with favorable long term trends, it still looks very reasonably priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pharmaceuticals**\n\nI**ntra-Cellular Therapies** $ITCI dropped after reporting a public offering on Wednesday that would dilute existing shareholders by 21%.  That\u2019s larger than expected but shareholders shouldn\u2019t really complain.  The stock soared before Christmas after the company reported FDA approval on Monday for Caplyta (lumateperone) for treating schizophrenia. Intra-Cellular Therapies expects to launch Caplyta at the end of the first quarter of 2020 making it the first commercialized asset of Intra-Cellular Therapies.\n\nThe stock is up 100% over the past year with a market capitalization of $1.6 billion but that looks reasonable compared to a TAM of $7 billion.  Additionally ITCI is expected to seek approval for other neurological diseases, including treatments for Alzheimer's, depression, and bipolar disorder.  That would open up a potential $25 billion market for Calypta. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSMBC Nikko initiated its coverage of **Dermira** $DERM with Outperform rating and $21 (39% upside) price target. Dermira has tripled since October when the company published positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its new eczema treatment, lebrikizumab. 44% of patients treated with lebrikizumab exhibited 90% skin clearance. Thats similar to recently launched eczema treatment Dupixent. However, unlike Dupixent, lebrikizumab also proved to be effective at reducing chronic itching (pruritus) which is often a significant issue for eczema sufferers. It also had less of an impact on the immune system.\n\nDermira received a $1.1 billion bid from Ely Lily on Friday that looks low.  There are nearly 7 million eczema sufferers in the US with currently untreatable conditions and the total addressable market for Dermira is estimated at $5 billion. Given its commercial advantages, regarding pruritus, Dermira should take a significant share of this if it can successfully transition from Phase 3 trials to FDA approval.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn contrast to Dermira, **Sorrento Therapeutics** $SRNE jumped 40% to $4.76 on Friday after receiving a non-binding bid from a private equity fund for $7.00.  \n\nSorrento has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).\n\nThe $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying \u201cthe offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.\"  The $7 bid, binding or not, suggests other parties may very well agree.  Either way, management clearly think the company\u2019s value is well in excess of Friday\u2019s close at $4.76 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider buying**\n\nBoth the President and CEO of **Hersha Hospitality Trust** $HT picked up around $400,000 of stock on Tuesday.  Hersha is a small hospitality REIT focusing on quality hotels in \"gateway cities\" clustered on both coasts of the U.S.  The two executives already had significant holdings but it\u2019s a vote of confidence in the business after a difficult period competing with Airbnb that has seen the stock price fall 50% over the past five years.     \n\nIn a November interview CEO Jay Shah said the company will be benefiting from some tailwinds in 2020 as a number of properties that were closed from hurricane Irma have now reopened and that Miami is forecast to be a top growth market in 2020.  When asked about the competition from Airbnb, Shah said that many municipalities are cracking down on illegal rooms with additional regulations resulting in some markets seeing Airbnb rentals fall by up to 50%. \n\nHersha\u2019s stock price is down 23% over the past year.  Its trading at a 40% discount to book value with an 8% dividend yield and payout ratio of just 55% of AFFO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally**\n\nAn article in Fool.com on Wednesday highlighted **Valens GroWorks** $VLNCF as one of the top marijuana stocks to buy.  A rare combination of revenue growth of 200% (expected in 2020) with a forward PE of just 8.0. \n\nValens processes cannabis and hemp biomass to produce the resins, distillates, concentrates, and targeted cannabinoids being used in edibles, infused beverages, and topicals.  That puts Valens right in the middle of some of the hottest trends in cannabis. Its customers include all of the main Canadian cannabis producers, including Canopy Growth, HEXO, Organigram, and Tilray with most being tied into multi year contracts.\n\nCannabis extracts, edibles, and non-edible derivatives could generate Canadian sales of close to $6 billion by 2025 according to projections from Ernst & Young.  While the potential for international growth also exists, especially in the US, Europe, Latin America and Australia.\n\nWith a market cap of just $400 million, Valens looks like a bargain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

A better strategy would be to begin a normal put position on a non-leveraged security and if that goes bad then throw some puts at the leveraged ones.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market\u2019s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market\u2019s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events \u2014 the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.\n*****\n> Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.\n*****\n> The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.\n*****\n> Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.\n*****\n> \u201cI think earnings are going to be a good component,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cCompanies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we\u2019ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won\u2019t be as bad as it could have been. It won\u2019 be strong. We\u2019ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.\u201d\n*****\n> According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.\n*****\n> Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran\u2019s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.\n*****\n> The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.\n*****\n> \u201cIf the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there\u2019s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises\u201d it could be negative, Arone said. \u201cThere\u2019s skepticism already. If there\u2019s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.\u201d\n*****\n> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. \u201cI think they\u2019ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,\u201d he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.\n*****\n># Economy\n> Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.\n*****\n> Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n> \u201cThe holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.\n*****\n> There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed\u2019s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n> LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. \u201cIt seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,\u201d said LaVorgna.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CmRDJ3H.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HlaBE2S.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Mo3s1ZX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4GkiL8Z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wA851N3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nbY9KQS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vGlTvp3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v0Lf7h.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lm2IGKk.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YDrQkZN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VzMB0Wn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/V8ea808.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/HXQ4K2F.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years\n\n> Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&P 500\u2019s performance during January\u2019s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&P 500\u2019s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6fef4ad5d96054008c1e22c647ef89b/f40a371ec0746e08-6e/s500x750/7ef3526f7c7aa39a8e897b65d44ba23869993cbe.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3c8ee058fc90aa22adb4e5a8985e306/f40a371ec0746e08-73/s500x750/a78a5931f9321df2ca4938803b6adba45329fa6c.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5741ff34a0d07dd0833b196609574b9/f40a371ec0746e08-77/s500x750/282a979aced717ffa33f2e4ebf6cac6eb92e0118.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 378 Days since Last 10% S&P 500 Correction & Still Counting\n\n> There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.\n\n> S&P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fbda173e8dc370504a0f606427f62e1/ed8a77a7fe8ca133-e0/s540x810/8954d23b3dc93b4653c4fbb6e79bc909488fdeec.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events\n\n> It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.\n\n> S&P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.\n\n> As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we\u2019ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.\n\n> \u201cNo doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.\u201d\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.\n\n> A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/geopolitical-events-and-stock-market-reactions.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling\n\n> The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.\n\n> Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we\u2019ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.\n\n> We did some research and found that when S&P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn\u2019t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cShould you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don\u2019t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year\u2014like 2020\u2014the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren\u2019t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-first-five-days-of-2020-could-have-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# \"Take my crude, please\"\n\n> Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**\n\n> When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-WTI-Declines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dow 29,000?\n\n> By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.\n\n> The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-DJIA-29000.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 10th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9wEbsG4rHc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fim7EDbAptk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$DAL** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$INFO** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$PPG** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$LMNR** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$WNS** \n> * **$SJR** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$SCHW** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$OGI** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$BBCP** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$HWC** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$PRGS** \n> * **$EGBN** \n> * **$OZK** \n> * **$BEDU** \n> * **$PBCT** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$INDB** \n> * **$VOLT** \n> * **$BMTC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zi8Gzi5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/2sH0ItO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/acnOb3c.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e3hO4am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 1.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/duE2t8W.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I9iQ8f1.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pQtl1r8.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lXhI0YM.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jpODGmg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NYyWxgm.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJ8xHj2.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nsBUIFM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $136.07\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.
