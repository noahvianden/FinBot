{"title": "Some interesting news in the stock market this week", "selftext": "**Value Stocks (Bed Bath and Beyond, Subaru and Express)**\n\nBarron\u2019s round table last weekend highlighted a couple of interesting opportunities, namely Bed Bath and Beyond and Subaru. \n\nAfter years of poor performance, that has seen the stock price fall by 80%, **Bed Bath and Beyond** ($BBBY) appointed a new CEO Mark Tritton in October last year.  Mr Tritton has an outstanding track record, having previously helped turn around Target and Nordstrom.  His speciality is improving merchandise and reducing the cost of private label.  \n\nThat\u2019s particularly relevant for Bed Bath who have seen their margins fall to just 3%.  If Mr Tritton does what he\u2019s demonstrably good at and implements better sourcing, cost-cutting, and sales growth -- then margins could double, earnings should grow to about $4 to $5 a share and the stock could rise from $16.35 on Friday to $45 or higher.\n\nThat sounds very achievable on paper.  However, what makes it more interesting is that Mr Tritton is backing himself with an equity heavy package.  Instead of looking for cash he has taken $1 million - $2 million in cash with the remaining $8 million - $10 million in stock.  That means his interests are aligned with stockholders and that he sees upside in owning shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso highlighted by Barron\u2019s was **Subaru** ($FUJHY).  Subaru is one of the lowest-cost car producers and yet one of the most profitable, with 9% margins. \n\nIts stock is very cheap (trading at nine times next year\u2019s earnings, with a 5.4% dividend yield and 30% cash-to-market cap) because the market is concerned that volumes are about to peak.  However the economics look good.  Subaru\u2019s cars are taking more market share (4% in the US) and consumers are shifting to sport utility vehicles which cost more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nElsewhere, clothing retailer **Express** ($EXPR) shares jumped 20% on Wednesday following plans to shutter 100 stores by 2022.  The move is expected to cut costs by $80 million and boost profits by $15 million annually.  Additionally,  over the same period, operating lease obligations are expected to drop by $85 million. \n\nThese are both significant amounts for Express and should provide a significant boost to its $80 million trailing EBITDA.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that the stock price rose 20%.  However Express\u2019 valuation still looks incredibly cheap -- even after the increase. Its enterprise value is just $142 million with a market cap of $309 million, $167 million of cash and no debt the enterprise value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Growth Stocks (Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet and eHealth)**\n\n**Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet** ($OLLI) shares hit a 52 week low on Tuesday before rebounding.  However, as of Friday\u2019s close, the stock was still down 40% from the all time highs set in May last year. \n\nI am not surprised the stock is rebounding.  The company had a bad start to the year in Q1 and Q2 as poorly-timed inventory decisions led to an excess of out of season goods and rapid expansion led to some cannibalization of sales.  However Management\u2019s assurances that set backs were temporary proved to be true as strong Q3 results in December beat expectations. Net sales increased 15.3%, operating income increased 22.0%, adjusted net income increased 28.3% and the company reaffirmed full year guidance.\n\nLonger term, the potential for growth is very good. The company has 345 stores in 23 states and plans to increase its store count nationally to over 950.\n\nThe stock is currently trading on 26x trailing earnings. That looks cheap for a fast growing \u201coff price\u201d retailer with big plans that is (once more) executing well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShares of **eHealth** ($EHTH) jumped 27% on Friday after the online health exchange provider announced that preliminary Q4 revenue will be between $257.5 million and $259.5 million with earnings between $53 million and $55 million (c.$2.34 per share).  Consensus estimates were for Q4 revenue of  $194.9 million and EPS of $2.15. \n\nBusiness is picking up for eHealth and the trend seems likely to continue.  An ageing U.S. population, with the 65+ population expected to increase from 40 million in 2010 to 80 million in 2030, will mean more people buying private health insurance to enhance Medicare for decades to come.  Additionally, its likely that those purchases will be made increasing online, where eHealth has established itself as a leader in a very fragmented market.\n\nThe stock is priced on 50x 2019 estimates but with 50% growth and a bright outlook the valuation looks very reasonable.\n\neHealth CEO Scott Flanders said, \"We remain excited about the Medicare market opportunity and significant growth potential ahead of us and are looking forward to sharing our outlook for 2020 as part of our fourth-quarter earnings release next month.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pharmaceuticals (TherapeuticMD)**\n\n**TherapeuticMD** ($TXMD), a commercial-stage biopharma focused on women's health, jumped over 20% on Tuesday after it was reported that JP Morgan had taken a 7% shareholding.  \n\nThe company has three drugs on the market (Imvexxy, Bijuva and Annovera) with combined peak annual sales estimated at $1.85 billion.  Be that as it may, TXMD is still in the early stages of building demand with trailing revenues of just $40 million.  \n\nThe investment by JPM is important as the company burns through its $155 million of cash and investors look for signs that management is capable of delivering commercially.  Reassuringly JPM\u2019s move follows recent purchases in the past six months of $300,000 by the CEO and $400,000 by the company President.\n\nConsiderable risks remain with TherapeuticMD and its plans to develop commercial sales.  However, I would say that with a market cap of $672 million compared to forecast peak sales of $1.85 billion, the rewards should significantly outweigh the risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

{"title": "Some thoughts about the resurfaced \"autopilot should not be called autopilot\" FUD campaign", "selftext": "Since some of the usual suspects are bringing this up again, maybe the following information can be useful for some in arguments. I try to compare Tesla autopilot with general aviation autopilots to make a case that the word is actually pretty accurate, if not that it undersells the abilities. Note this is for general aviation, i don't know enough about commercial or military aviation.\n\n# Autopilots are dumb\n\nIn general aviation autopilots have pretty much zero artificial intelligence with one noteworthy exception that i come back to later. They have well tuned algorithms that blindly follow instructions. You can either directly enter an altitude or direction or use a series of waypoints that it will follow one by one. You can recall standard approaches that are again just a series of waypoints. Some autopilots can handle speed (auto throttle), but that's not common and almost brings you into the small plane commercial aviation world. They are predictable in what they do but they won't prevent you from being stupid. You can program them to fly you into the terrain and they will happily do so. If you have a better type of autopilot if will give you a warning but it will still keep going. You don't want them to be smart, because that makes them unpredictable. They are just another tool in the cockpit that help you offset workload. You can think of them as another control device as an alternative to your yoke/stick.\n\n# What is the equivalent in the car world?\n\nThat's really hard to compare with existing systems in cars because even adaptive cruise control or a simple lane keep is smarter in that it can react to changes in the outside world. It can stop when the car in front of you stops to prevent damage. It can react to changes in the lane that you did not anticipate. If you wanted to construct the equivalent of an aviation autopilot you could combine cruise control (not even the adaptive one) with a system that receives GPS data and moves your steering wheel to follow map waypoints blindly, without reacting to outside information. It would assume there is open terrain and no roads because it could not even follow roads with enough precision. Automated agricultural machinery probably comes the closest to aviation autopilots, but i guess they are even more sophisticated using outside sensors to avoid crashes with obstacles.\n\n# So what's the exception?\n\nGarmin has recently introduced a system that is called \"Auto Land\". It's made for emergency situation where the pilot is suddenly incapable of flying the plane. It's like a big red emergency button that instructs the systems to take over full control of the plane and asso reacts to outside changes. It will check for the nearest suitable airfield, check for weather and do radio broadcasts. It will approach the airfield, land the plane using radar sensors and once on the ground hit the brakes and turn of the engine. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyYxbiZ1FCQ), it's quite impressive. This type of autonomy in aviation is only acceptable because the alternative to an incapacitated pilot is just so much worse that it almost guaranteed lead to casualties.\n\n# What's your point?\n\nCalling Tesla's system 'autopilot' is underselling it's abilities, it's not over promising. Autopilots have always been dumb, predictable tools that take workload of the user and have never been designed to work completely unsupervised.

{"title": "Stock Market Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020.\n\n# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**\n*****\n> With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.\n*****\n> The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.\n*****\n> Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed\u2019s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.\n*****\n> There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.\n*****\n> Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.\u201d\n*****\n> Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.\n*****\n> \u201cYou could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cWe had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.\u201d\n*****\n> # Earnings roll out\n> There are more than 135 S&P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald\u2019s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.\n*****\n> Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.\n*****\n> \u201cComing into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.\u201d\n*****\n> Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there\u2019s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.\n*****\n>#  Fed is big story but won\u2019t say much\nThe Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it\u2019s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.\n*****\n> \u201cThe big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that\u2019s going to be the key messaging,\u201d said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cI think the data has been okay. There\u2019s really nothing new there. The only thing that\u2019s really new or interesting is going to be what\u2019s going on with the balance sheet.\u201d\n*****\n> The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.\n*****\n> Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.\n*****\n> Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed\u2019s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.\n*****\n> For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. \u201cThe intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed\u2019s target range, \u201d he said.\n*****\n> Besides the technical move, they \u201cmay be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> # Economic data\n> There\u2019s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter\u2019s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.\n*****\n> New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Jh9TsGk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PC0Wzg3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HbDh9Vc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mbOqHih.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vvAjRp1.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H2E0IGA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EzxkRa0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D9nkFqV.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ueyg2Ui.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xc2z54D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mFxq4a0.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XjxVPqW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uiduXrQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n> A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid\n\n> Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.\n\n> As of yesterday\u2019s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA\u2019s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.\n\n> In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday\u2019s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&P 500.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40266be6ec0ea5254acf28b7b6d1382f/9bf6345fd07e4a41-a7/s500x750/adacad5fc51e44798ccb9e3f4f840aeb1cf88bad.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64ed8994efe5e18c82cdb0e191844380/9bf6345fd07e4a41-00/s500x750/da09894ccf7e9c51f7a3814ee73a4a9e65fefeca.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/71145fa04257eb5aad5eec7945276aa7/9bf6345fd07e4a41-02/s500x750/48e6c017697fc7e130ffcdabcb46093f3c28522b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another Look At Election Years\n\n> Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&P 500 Index hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.\n\n> We\u2019ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we\u2019d take another look at this impactful year.\n\n> The S&P 500\u2019s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.\n\n> \u201cStocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n> From a quarterly view, the S&P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That\u2019s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/quarterly-return-012220.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Recession Watch Update\n\n> As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it\u2019d be a good time to check on LPL Research\u2019s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.\n\n> As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn\u2019t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle\u2019s continued durability.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:\n\n> We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It\u2019s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.\n\n> We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.\n\n> \u201cWe remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUWzJw_T-Y))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HXyp_tGZDQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$AAPL** \n> * **$TSLA** \n> * **$AMD** \n> * **$AMZN** \n> * **$MSFT** \n> * **$FB** \n> * **$BA** \n> * **$GE** \n> * **$MA** \n> * **$T** \n> * **$V** \n> * **$SBUX** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$MCD** \n> * **$LMT** \n> * **$MMM** \n> * **$DHI** \n> * **$PFE** \n> * **$UTX** \n> * **$KO** \n> * **$UPS** \n> * **$S** \n> * **$NURO** \n> * **$HMST** \n> * **$VZ** \n> * **$HCA** \n> * **$XLNX** \n> * **$ARNC** \n> * **$XOM** \n> * **$CAT** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$GD** \n> * **$PHM** \n> * **$NVR** \n> * **$PII** \n> * **$SALT** \n> * **$BIIB** \n> * **$NOW** \n> * **$ANTM** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$ALK** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$MPC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BhyYBqu.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/LryC0HR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/UJ0XUOn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4WIKCya.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 1.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZqdHlAC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uNAMC1F.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yyFyqKK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGue9UL.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D7CJT4Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gAvYCNR.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RKvojKG.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1aQuGJs.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5YpKIPM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.31.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0KJmsx.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Apple, Inc. $318.31\n> **Apple, Inc.

{"title": "Markets and the Never Ending \"Data Dependent FED\"", "selftext": "Fellow Autists, I have some news for you. You may not like it, you may not want to hear it, but Stonks only go up. Here\u2019s Why.\n\nThe whole thesis and backbone of this post relies on one very simple fact that you will start to see if you pay attention. There Is nowhere, absolutely nowhere else, to put your cash into these days. Equity markets are the only place generating any form of reasonable growth these days. If markets get scared and sell off, it will be quick and no more than a 5% correction. This Corona Virus is creating an excellent opportunity to buy into once things settle down and the news cycle finds something else to report. Fund and asset managers have to put their money somewhere. They can not park it in any form of debt securities currently due to artificially low rates, and astronomically high financial inflation at the moment.  \n \n\n*A look At Yield curves and what it means.*  \nFirstly, I very strongly recommend visiting the following website and comparing rates and yields and their difference between maturity dates through this interactive chart. It\u2019s a great conceptual resource.\n\n[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-LongTerm-Rate-Data-Visualization.aspx](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-LongTerm-Rate-Data-Visualization.aspx)\n\nSecondly, as you can notice the yields are both extremely low historically speaking, and the difference between yields of long and short maturities is tightening. Remember when Repo operations blew up over night because their were sooooo many Short dated T-Bills in the system that banks were overloaded and bloated with them. I think that this is a pretty big \u201caccident\u201d if you consider the fact that Repo issues were mostly caused by the FED themselves, but one thing that did come out of this \u201cAccident \u201d was the suppression of short dated T-Bill yields. (Supply & demand) The Fed could buy T-Bills out of the system but that would lead to higher T-Bill yields and the Yield curve is already pretty precarious at the moment, so instead Repo is Here to stay.\n\nAs it is, I would not be surprised to see the Yield fall even more and the curve flatten out dramatically. The FED is acting highly irresponsibly right now and is under massive amounts of political pressure which is causing them to be extremely short sighted in their decisions. The FED would rather shoot itself in the foot later, than finish the race with a stubbed toe.\n\nInvestors are also shorting the Yield due to risk and uncertainty measures. **NO ONE** likes the fundamental valuation of the markets right now. Everybody knows everything is wicked expensive metric wise, but as I said where else are you going to put your money? So these investors buy equities and then hedge or overweight on non-correlated or  inversely correlated assets (See the epic rally of gold as of late)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Inflation and the \u201cData Dependent\u201d FED*  \nNews flash: Inflation is already here. The way the BLS calculates inflation these days is asinine and archaic. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but essentially the CPI numbers are very much a poor metric of modern day inflation. Financial asset inflation is through the roof right now and is projected to grow due to the extremely high concentration of wealth gaps developing. The corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and years of record profit keeping have greatly helped to overweight the top players in the financial games of America with absurd amounts of free cash. Most of the time it\u2019s even cheaper to simply take on debt to fund operations than it is to simply put your cash to use since the debt rates are so low. I\u2019m sure you know this but if you need a reminder, look at corporate debt levels and balance sheets. Again, more money in the system for any class of goods, inevitably leads to higher inflation. There is a considerably slower rate of increased monies in the systems that normal people participate in, compared to the systems and purchases that corporations participate in. Any asset that is not a hard common physical good, a common service, or something commonly purchased by average people, has experienced massive inflation over the past few years.\n\nThe FED is 100% data dependent at this point in time. They want to see rising inflation, but they never will. At least not in the models they use. They currently have a never-ending excuse to keep rates low, and things overheated in the market, and with such political pressure coming from the white house, they certainly will.   \n \n\n*How To Profit:*  \nFirstly, you continue buying equities. Secondly you buy Gold and US debt securities. Everything in this market will trend higher, for the reasons I\u2019ve listed. It\u2019s very, very, unusual to see this happen, but it has been over the last few months, and will continue to do so. Thirdly (and this is a weird one) Overweight yourself on Utilities and consumer defensives. The clamoring for real \u201csafe\u201d equities has just begun. We are in the final stages of this FED made artificially induced shit storm that we call the markets. You can expect to purchase safe havens assets and \u201csafer\u201d equities and receive a premium from their sale once shit really starts to hit the fan. Unfortunately, you have to keep playing bull gang for the time being. There is no way around that, but you can play it a bit smarter than continuous AAPL calls. There is a high probability of a mean reversion back to volatility in markets as price discovery becomes more competitive. Especially once the Curve inverts again. I also expect that this entire market is wholly, 100% dependent on rates and the FED. If the FED raises rates we are done. Full bear market. Everyone knows this, no one is prepared for it. If the Fed cuts rates (which has already started to be priced in based on market polls) we continue along our merry way. At this point in time, if you are a true autist, you should stop playing Earnings calls, and start playing FED meetings and minutes releases. The economic data, the corporate data, the market sentiment, the fundamental valuations, none of it matters.
