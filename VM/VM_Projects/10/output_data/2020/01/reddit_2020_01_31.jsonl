I only listened to it once, though, so could be mistaken.\n\nBut if this is the case, it's a great rewrite to have because it will take much less processing power to understand what moves are the safest in a given situation.\n\nThat said, it is a considerable effort to run through all the training, debugging, testing, etc. over again. But we can expect this type of thing to happen again and again, regardless of how significant or insignificant a change is. They'll just have updated systems shadow whatever the existing system is be it on their desktops with existing data or shadowing live data as we ride around. Once they feel it is ready, they roll it out to some of their cars, and once that's ready they gradually roll it out to everyone.\n\nThough considerable, it's quite standard in the industry to do this. Iterating on systems and improving them over time is a cornerstone of software as a service. No matter how many times they iterate on FSD it won't be perfect, but they're committed to improving it for a very long time I'm sure.\n\nEdit: Just saw the [Clean Technica Article On Autopilot rewrite](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/31/tesla-autopilot-mystery-solved-hw3-full-potential-soon-to-be-unlocked/) \\- I hadn't even really considered they basically did the rewrite to take advantage of HW3.
