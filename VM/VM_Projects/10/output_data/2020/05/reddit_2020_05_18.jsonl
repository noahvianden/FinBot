The difficulties around this are obvious:\n\n* How many people will allow their cars to be used by others?\n* How many consumers will trust these cars?\n* How will the legislative rollout look? Roads are different everywhere so even if the US goes quickly, Tesla needs to be able to do language recognition on English, Chinese, Spanish, Dutch, German, etc, and work through every edge case.\n* US has maybe 40-50% of Tesla's, so if they solve that that's a huge benefit, but it might take another year or two to get elsewhere\n\nBut V2G... man that could be huge.\n\nIf Tesla can operate as an arbitrage stabler of the grid, if we assume that a powerwall right now returns about half it's value as a backup and half as an arbitrage agent, then each powerwall might deliver something like $3k in arbitrage value over 5 years. With a Tesla vehicle being \\~75kwh, this is the size of 5 powerwalls, and maybe able to deliver $3k in arbitrage value per year, assuming 100% plugged in time and 100% cycle usage. \n\nIf instead they retain a 30% lower capacity on any sitting vehicle and vehicles are plugged in maybe 2/3 of the time, we could see approximately $1,500 in arbitrage profits per vehicle per year.\n\nThen Tesla could add backup storage as a software unlock, for perhaps a cost inline with a powerwall (you've already bought the hardware), for easy calculations let's call this $10k.\n\nSo while a robotaxi might have delivered an extra $50k in value over the course of 5 years, to maybe a third of the fleet in the next 5 years ($16,666/car), V2G technology could return $17,500 per car to Tesla over the next 5 years.\n\nV2G could literally be as big as robotaxis over the next 5 years, assuming it goes global and everyone has a place to plug in for half the day.\n\nI knew cars were a trillion dollar opportunity, I knew storage was a trillion dollar opportunity, I knew robotaxis were a trillion dollar opportunity.

{"title": "READING CPB CALLS", "selftext": "TITLE MEANT TO BE \u201cRE-ADDING CALLS\u201d\n\n\n\nWassup fellow autists. If you recognize me I'm the retard that advised everyone to buy CPB calls last week. Well I got out Thursday at a 70 percent profit and now CPB is down 2.5 percent as a pullback due to being green for 5 fucking straight days.  The situation right now is that people are panicking that CPB had a pullback, but stocks do not only go up lol. Also the chart shows that CPB is known for pullbacks.\n\nReasons for this trad not being a complete gamble from company perspective\n\n1. CPB is a food and snack provider of the following foods such as goldfish, milano crackers, prego sauce, soup (no shit).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lb05vlsbijz41.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cba10587eef0df3cc8065c0ff3a81649e73d86f\n\n2. Their last earnings was early March which does not accurately show the panic buying in all of our nearby grocery stores. Next earnings are on June 3rd therefore making this play viable with a less than 30 percent IV. \n\n3. From the technical aspect of this trade, the RSI looks to have pulled from 70 (overbought) to 56 which should only be thought of as a pullback. Also the MACD line looks a little choppy but all of this will change with one green day. From analyzing the chart it seems pullbacks last at most 2 days. I still entered 75 percent of my position today in-case of a major dip, but the calls are so cheap it literally can't go much lower. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Photo for you autists that are illiterate](https://preview.redd.it/y7m79w4zijz41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3242818281dbb7479c14218be40df4c0d3f29bc1)\n\n4. 5 year chart shows a crash around 2017, a slow demised death, until 2019 where their products started picking up and now COVID is also ramping up sales. Not to mention how they have beat earnings 6 times in a row. Think to keep in mind here is that this stock does not move much on earnings itself, but moves fast in anticipation of it. This is where us autists start cashing out.\n\n5. I FUCKING KNOW VOLUME IS LOW. I do not know why you autists care so much about volume on a play where earnings are more than 2 weeks away. No shit volume is going to be low on a play where earnings are 2 weeks away... volume comes with price action. Remember that. This play picked up volume when I first swung this and lost volume on a red day, today. It's expected to see low volume and price on a day where people are panicking... \"Buy high, sell low\"- Buffet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: This is a COVID play that is not getting much attention and had a recent pullback.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**POSTIONS: 6/5 56.5c     6/5 56c  6/5 55c**\n\n**Be careful of some spreads... get in at a nice entry point and you'll make big.** \n\n**What I have previously swung... 6/5 55c from .55-1.05     6/5 56c from .3 to .55, 6/5 56.5c .3 to .45**", "id": "gm3kxs", "created_utc": 1589815784.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "After losing everything I have I scrambled enough money together to make this one last play", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30691710114479065}, {"body": "Up 23% on 53.5c.

{"title": "Large Mall Stocks are skyrocketing today with no event impact and zero news. Jump in before the big \"V\" shaped recovery swing in the next couple weeks. DD", "selftext": "**UPDATE:** Went to a $MAC mall \"tysons corner\" and there are lines for the shoe stores that seem to have 15-30 people in them, as well as a small line at the 711. \n\n\\------\n\nI had made a thread about the top major mall stocks before, and people decided that despite them being among the first shopping outlet/strips to open as states recover, and having important property deals, including government contracts, that they would have slow growth, if any, and that people would be to \"scurred\"  to go to major malls.\n\nMultiple images and videos of lines at malls later, as well as pent up demand, we now see today malls not only surprising opening high at pre-market but souring throughout the day, even now.\n\n***Current rate as of this post:***\n\n**$MAC:** Up 12% and climbing.\n\n**$REG**: up 12% and climbing\n\n**$KIM:** Up 12% and counting\n\n**$SPG:** Up 10% and climbing.\n\n**$PEI:** Up 9% and climbing.\n\n**$SKT**: up 7% and climbing.\n\nThese are the big boys jumping up right now setting up for the big recovery.\n\nAs i predicted, the set-up for the big swing is coming and there is now a short window to jump in or you'll be forced to jump through the FOMO gates. **Here are some upcoming events that will be happening within the next few days to couple weeks and why you should jump on malls now:**\n\n1. SPG's taubman buyout still happening.\n2. MAC and REG are on the way to have more government tenants move in.\n3. Part of PEI's loans will be forgiven\n4. Tanger helped several of it's clients get forgivable and SBA loans and have now gotten more of their rent paid as well as some rent ahead of time.\n5. PEi, and Tanger are in the middle of acquisitions and partnerships on new projects that will be funded.\n6. MAC and SPG lawsuit against city that cancelled contract project is pretty much a victory just waiting for the gavel.\n7. (rumor) Pent up demand has sales reaching holiday levels in consumerism for SPG, MAC, and Tanger, **scattered press announcements from all 3 about mall performance (numbers and sales) expected from all 3 across the next couple weeks, which will correlate with rising stock prices.**\n8. Mac and Pei have managed to operate effectively with reduced overhead that they realized they didn't need until the virus struck, which has greatly reduced operating expenses that used to bleed money for both (more so mac).\n9. Rumored whole foods partnership and Amazon store partnerships to open new WF/Amazon retail in malls owned by MAC and REG, including delivery and distribution centers.\n\nSPG is still a wild card, it'll swing back, but I don't know if it will be consistent until we hit June because it swings all over the place, while the other malls are stable. So if you bet on exp before June you may end up in a good or bad position so I'd just take that in June, the others seem to be following similar consistent patterns so a may exp will likely be safer with them.\n\nI expect most of these to Swing back to at or close to their pre-sars2 highs by the first week of June, and possibly higher after that as the news of mall performance trickles out.\n\nNow how long the recovery will last is the only question. I think that up until September is guarantee, and only with any return of Sars2/corona after late sept do I think the malls may be screwed again. IF not, than I expect the malls to hold up for the rest of the year until after the holiday season, where in January they will correct back to their pre-covid stay at home declines again.\n\nSo the malls will be making money for several months so this is the time to jump in, DD.", "id": "gm48ln", "created_utc": 1589817847.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the bread line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Investors are no long scared, bond market not scared with credit spreads way down. That is not to say there aren't consequences, as the mispricing of risk will have long-term consequences like lower productivity and innovation, SPY gives no shits about that.\n\nHigh unemployment only contributes to bear market if corporations don't earn money, leading to a death spiral of layoffs and less profits, aka deflation. With Fed dollars in play what corporations would have lost are being replaced by Fed dollars through the Treasury. Why do guys think ecommerce sites that sell fucking t shirts and mugs (ETSY and SHOP and AMZN) are going through the roof, because those unemployed people ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY. There is zero chance that the Fed will suddenly cut this off, look at what happened after 2008, this shit will run for years since companies that hire a lot of poor people but don't contribute much to the stock market, like the entire airline sector, small businesses, are still in deep shit, so fiscal policy will be as loose as bears anus for years, yes even if the Dems win (shit like HEROES act).\n\nWhy short dollar? Rates are near zero but low oil prices and some level of fear is still around holding dollar up. When oil come back, fear goes away, yet rates are STILL at 0, which will be likely, you get something like 2008 to 2014, after which rates climbed back up so did the dollar.\n\nThis is NOT a pair trade, this is a balls deep trade on economic policies.\n\nRisks: printer stops and investors become pussies again.", "id": "gmc7v3", "created_utc": 1589842248.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for your contribution WSBshitposter, your name checks out.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06090589240193367}, {"body": "Right flare: Fundamental Shit", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07893595099449158}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You right it does matter it = Spy calls", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0952354148030281}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01844889670610428}, {"body": "Yea I blew 45 k on high risk bets; I was gonna spend on a cement truck, oops looks like more risky behavior is my only way out of this one...", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21903109550476074}, {"body": "There is a bigger risk of deflation before the inflation hits.
