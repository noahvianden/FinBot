I was a young and decently paid new investor with no knowledge of investing but knew I want to get into the game. So I said NFLX would be the starting stock point.\n\nThe year, late 2015 (November). I had a Netflix account for some years now, my family and friends all had Netflix accounts, and I started thinking, \u201dhmmm...maybe, I should buy some stock in NFLX?\u201d \n\nNow, as a new investor, if I saw a stock over $50, I wasn't buying because, in my eyes, I\u2019d already missed the boat (I don't think like this now). NTFX was trading around $100-$125 at the time wayyyy to rich for my blood, but I had a feeling that it was going to continue to go up. \n\nSo I opened a Scottrade account, watched some YouTube videos on how to buy stocks, and told myself, \u201dSelf: If NFLX drops below $100, I'll invest $5000.\u201d So I watched the market like a hawk for the next few months waiting on my opportunity.\n\nMy time... Or what I thought was my time:\n\nFebruary 7, 2016, I was watching television and saw that NFLX had some \u201dbad press\u201d which was they were raising their price for $5.99 to 6 or $7.99 a month, and investors thought it was a bad idea, so they started selling. The price went from $125 to $82 at the lowest.\n\nNow I'm jumping with joy because it dropped below the $100 mark and I was going to buy $5000 worth... well, that was the plan anyway. When I logged on to my account, I only bought $1000 worth or 11 shares for a total of $951. I was too afraid to buy the 5k worth because I wanted to have the money in my account. So instead of having 50+ shares at a fantastic price, I ended up with 11 because I was too scared and cheap.\n\nI still own those 11 shares of NFLX and have made 4k in profit. I still kick myself for not buying more when I had the chance. I could be sitting on 20k plus in profit in four years right now. \n\nThe moral of this story is to trust your gut!

{"title": "Please Critique my Weekly Call Strategy", "selftext": "Greetings Thetagang! I have been a longtime lurker and have been absolutely loving this sub. I continuously scour these threads every morning and couldn't be more thankful for such a knowledgeable and welcoming community. \n\nOver the last few weeks, I have been continuously selling two covered calls on Boeing (200 shares or roughly $27,400 in assets). I am very risk averse, and try to gain anywhere between .50 and 1% a week. For the most part, I have been fairly successful and have only had to initiate a roll once. Here is my question as I want to ensure I am being the most efficient with my planning.\n\nWe all know that Theta is the rate of time decay. Generally starting to accelerate within the last month, and ramping up exponentially within the last few days. If Theta decay occurs over the weekend, is it not in our best interest to SELL next weeks call on Friday, right before close rather than on Monday morning?\n\nLet me give you an example, if you have a BA call option that is about to expire out of the money, the premium price is now at -.98% and near worthless. Is it not better to REPURCHASE the call you sold, and then immediately sell a new covered call that expires next Friday? You would essentially be locking in 3 additional days of theta. 1) The last hour or so of the closing Friday, And 2) Theta for all day Saturday and Sunday.\n\nLets use some real examples to better illustrate my question.\n\n1) If I were to sell a Covered Call on BA today currently at $137.5 a share, and my intention is to lock in 1% premium by weeks end, I would sell a covered call for $146. It appears this is a .238 Delta with theta at -0.24 per day.\n\nIf selling covered calls, is it better to let them expire, OR purchase them back with the intention to keep more premiums?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks Thetagang!", "id": "gpg58x", "created_utc": 1590280666.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "So I think first I'd say theta doesn't actually behave like you describe for all options, only ATM ones.

I don't know exactly when, not sure if anybody really knows, but it's accounted for and I don't think you gain any edge by doing your proposed plan of closing and opening as far as weekend theta.\n\nThat said, I definitely think that closing short options before they fully expire is a good thing and improves your risk posture and win rate.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "From my naive test it's priced in by Thursday.
