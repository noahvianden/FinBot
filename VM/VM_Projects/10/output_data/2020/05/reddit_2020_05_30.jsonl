{"title": "Selling Naked Puts - Finding good Trades", "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI\u2019ve been trading options for quite a long time with all of the major brokers and have it set at level three approval almost everywhere. I stick to a pretty common strategy though in that I essentially just sell naked puts.  It fits my bank and risk tolerance.\n\nMy general strategy is in a volatile market, that I can determine more often than not when an OOTM Put has gotten a bit too high based on how far the stock is likely to fall.\n\nGenerally I\u2019ve been playing airlines lately and safely making $200-$500 a week on a $10k bankroll .\n\nAAL is a favorite because I can usually sell a $8 or $9 put for .15 or .20 (10 contracts) and let them expire worthless at the end of the week.  Obviously this works as long as the bottom doesn\u2019t fall out of the stock, but I have general plans in place to stop me from losing too much. I usually cut my losses at 2X of the option price, but a few times I\u2019ve gotten stuck after hours.  I was able to play $15 HPQ and sell the puts for .22 and buy back at .10 this week for instance.\n\nAnyway, all that to say I\u2019m having a hard time finding new stocks to follow which have higher weekly OOTM put values to increase my profit potential roughly 5 days before expiration.  I know the risk goes up here because it generally indicates that the stock will swing in price more or that there is significant uncertainty in something like earnings.\n\nI\u2019d like a tool/site/report to tell me about (I think) high IV puts, Below the market, below $20 a share, with volume, with an actual Bid/Ask spread that\u2019s reasonable.  The high IV report on E*TRADE is mostly worthless because it can\u2019t filter right.\n\nThe screeners I\u2019ve tried always get stuck showing the no bid stocks rather than better choices.  I suspect that in doing it wrong.\n\nAm I just being obtuse here and there\u2019s a better way to screen for what I want ?  \n\nThanks in advance", "id": "gt8vgx", "created_utc": 1590816859.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "You can use https://fdscanner.com\n\nSet a pctOTM range, open interest and volume filter minimum of 50, slowly increase the pctOptionStrike filter to get the highest yielding options.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32095372676849365}, {"body": "There\u2019s easier ways to make a similar return by going out a few weeks or more and managing early.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1367044597864151}, {"body": "I look at the volatility report on market chameleon and sort by IV30 highest to low.

Google pin risk just so you\u2019re aware of this particular risk with spreads.  Simple version:  If the stock price is between your strike prices at expiration and you get assigned on your short position and the stock tanks after you can no longer exercise the long leg, well, your max loss is no longer defined by your credit spread.  It\u2019s up to you to manage your position in light of pin risk, maybe you\u2019re okay with it, maybe not.\n\nEdit:  Thank you for the Gold and good luck trading!  <3", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You do deserve the gold for bringing pin risk up. Can you advise on what\u2019s the best course of action to take if the underlying is trading at a price between the 2 strike prices and we are approaching expiration?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!  It kind of depends on the underlying and what your outlook is moving forward.  Just remember that when your short leg is ITM, you're at risk for assignment, particularly in the last week leading up to expiration.  Here are some quick thoughts.  The times and stuff below assume a standard monthly option that expires on Friday and can only be traded until 4:00 pm ET on the day of expiration.\n\nYou could instruct your broker to exercise the long put despite it being OTM and just take your max loss defined by the credit spread, but this is a strategy that should only be employed after normal market close on the day your option expires.  Remember to monitor after hours trading.  It's important to recognize that stocks move outside of option trading hours (i.e., normal market hours) and so even if your long put at 4:00 pm is OTM, it could become ITM during after hours trading so you could monitor and instruct your broker to exercise (the same is true for the stock hovering slightly above the short put strike price, that person might be monitoring as well and surprise you with assignment).  It depends on the facts surrounding the stock's movement and your outlook at the time.  For example, if you think the stock is going to plummet in the next trading day, that would be one reason to consider instructing your broker to exercise the long put if the short put is ITM but your long put is OTM.\n\nBrokers have different rules regarding exercise/do not exercise instructions:  TDA will accept instructions received from 4:30pm-5:00pm ET on a reasonable efforts basis.  Instructions can be sent between 5:00pm-5:30pm ET but TDA offers no guarantees on accepting such late instructions.  Note that most brokers will auto-exercise if your long put is at least $0.01 ITM but they use the stock's closing price, not the stock's after hours trading price information in determining ITM status.\n\nIf you're bullish on the stock, you could accept the pin risk and if you get assigned with your short leg OTM, then so be it.  The less volatile the stock, the safer this approach is.  Once you have the stock from assignment, you could sell or hold it based on your outlook.  If you hold it, consider selling a covered call but just remember that limits your upside.  And covered calls are not always the answer, if the stock tanks after assignment, you might be looking at selling a covered call at a strike price below your basis in the stock.  Depending on how acceptable assignment is to you, you could even consider closing your long put in the put credit spread for a profit.  But this all depends on your outlook because closing your long leg obviously converts the risk-defined strategy into a naked put which is not risk defined.  If you do close the long leg, be aware that your broker will only allow you to do that if you're approved to sell naked options because it converts your position into a naked put.\n\nIf you're looking to avoid pin risk, you could (a) instruct your broker to exercise the long OTM put after your contract is no longer trading and take your max loss (discussed above), (b) close your position for a loss and move on (i.e., use the buying power in a new trade unrelated to managing the loss from closing your position), or (c) try to roll your spread out to a later month for a credit, for even, or to reduce your loss (i.e., close it for a loss and then open a new spread, where the credit that you receive on the new spread defines whether you are at a net credit, even, or loss relative to the spread you just closed for a loss).  There are more sophisticated plays as well.  For example, you could short 100 shares in anticipation of the assignment on the short leg and close out of the long position but this could be dangerous in the event that you are not assigned on your short leg.  As another example, instead of rolling spread for spread, you could roll your losing spread into just a short naked put.  Obviously that opens you up to more risk but it would give you the ability to select a lower strike price and what not.  As another example, you could buy a put that expires in a week out or so just to cover a short term decline in the event that you get assigned (if you go down this path, close out of your long put in the spread).\n\nNotwithstanding all of the above, don't lose sight of the fact that taking the loss and moving on isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Otherwise said, you can put a lot of work into saving/salvaging/managing a trade and tie up buying power to do it when, at the end of the day, it might be more efficient just to take the loss and use the buying power elsewhere.

{"title": "Play results from this week", "selftext": "I've seen it suggested to keep a trading journal.  As a new trader I feel that has helped me stay focused even if I'm using simple text files.  I've also tried to start making a very basic plan before every day starts, so I can note if I do anything outside the plan (e.g. screw myself over by buying weekly options).\n\nHere are the results this week.  Feel free to share yours if you would like.  This is partly in case anyone wants to give me feedback, and partly because explaining my thought process and results helps me get a better grasp on learning to trade, I hope.\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\n* Bought calls on NVDA and it massively tanked from $360 down to $330.  In particular I bought some only like 3 weeks out at a ridiculous premium, and unless it goes back to $365 this week I will likely lose significant money.  I've bought some low calls and sold them higher to make up for it while I wait, but that has been a very stressful lesson in how I should probably only invest a fraction of my portfolio in any particular play.\n* Bought 2-week-ish put on BABA in case of bad China news, got the opposite effect.  I'm hoping for a dip early next week to reduce the losses or do better, but I'm prepared to lose that money.\n* Not necessarily a negative, but I got some cheap last-minute NVDA and SPY puts near Friday close as hedges in case something took a dive on me before close (nothing did and I lost the premiums, but it was intentional as the investment was small).\n\nPOSITIVE EARNINGS PLAYS (bought and sold calls in all cases, closed out positions):\n\n* Played TD earnings, 90% profit during the runup.\n* Played DG earnings, 3% profit since it did not runup as fast as I wanted, and I got uncomfortable with the risk.\n* Played BOX earnings, 10% profit (didn't get the runup I wanted, had to hold through to get the profit).\n* Played COST earnings, 20% profit.\n* Played CRM earnings, 27% profit.\n\nPOSITIVE GENERAL PLAYS:\n\n* Sold DKNG call for 35% profit (yes that could have been higher, but I like taking profits).  I am looking for more chances to get calls on DKNG.\n* Sold a CODX covered call or two, closed at profit and resold, and rolled up at least once.  CODX keeps staying steady but I am hoping for a run to like $22 before I finally bail on that company.  It served me well for the last month or so.\n\nLONGTERM PLAYS:\n\n* Monitoring PLAY, may try the wheel on it.\n* Opened very long calls on JPM.

This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.\n*****\n> \u201cWe saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.\u201d\n*****\n> Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.\u201d\n*****\n> Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. \n*****\n> \u201cThis cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we\u2019ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,\u201d he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn\u2019t always signal positives. \n*****\n> \u201cOn average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Emanuel said the S&P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.\n*****\n> But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. \u201cWhen we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \n*****\n> The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  \n*****\n> \u201cThese stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there\u2019s a change in progress on a vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> President Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.\n*****\n> Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter\u2019s stock hardest.  \n*****\n> Emanuel said technology\u2019 is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.\n*****\n> In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jgJsTbC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cn1jSFW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/TMD5don.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lMnJorQ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kHa6HqT.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZZOjRw4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FigEirb.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MjWiE2F.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wh12Zf4.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8t94L91.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yC7JiMI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nzEoxkl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.\n\n> # Equities\n\n> US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe S&P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhich would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn\u2019t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.\u201d\n\n> The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.\n\n> Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.\n\n> Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n> # International Stocks\n\n> The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng\u2019s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong\u2019s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.\n\n> The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.\n\n> European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.\n\n> # Fixed Income and Commodities\n\n> Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.\n\n> Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.\n\n> Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.\n\n> Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.\n\n> # Looking Ahead\n\n> Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.\n\n> On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday\u2019s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Breadth Surge\n\n> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.\n\n> Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy\u2019s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday\u2019s close, 96% of the components in the S&P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.\n\n> Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cBreadth surges like we\u2019ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June\u2019s First Trading Day\n\n> According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA\u2019s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/277f4afe57244973b48e6bc7c0844a6d/0d36c25bfef3f384-d6/s500x750/96efe19dba3ae99c075a91a11e892ad69fa23e56.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3cdaccd662828f8641c2e822c6df281/0d36c25bfef3f384-33/s500x750/6406f9afe4080788669a930cbe8dd4fb4a52ec28.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month\n\n> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37b672810df8d9c17e4fc69d49aaa9e8/439e24c2bd089fd0-d8/s500x750/5dc0af4ea6dbde69f39defca04e69534e9ac2eb7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# May's Top Performing Stocks\n\n> After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.\n\n> This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.\n\n> Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.\n\n> In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052920-Best-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991\n\n> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-SP-Above.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm\n\n> The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.\n\n> Equity fund flows remain negative. While there\u2019s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.\n\n> Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-Flows-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$CRWD** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$WORK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$ATHM** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$TTC** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$APPS** \n> * **$GOOS** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$HHR** \n> * **$DCI** \n> * **$EXPR** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$CMD** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$ESTC** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$CNK** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$BBW** \n> * **$NGL** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$ENS** \n> * **$SCWX** \n> * **$PD** \n> * **$EVRI** \n> * **$PLX** \n> * **$YEXT** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$SAIC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D4J2yE.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 6.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QTN7mSn.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 6.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j1DpFQy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ij1xmhw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EIpBZjj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvne0Pg.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lE0Nrw2.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wyHcBay.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iZigl8T.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b2NLnrm.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.5.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $179.48\n> **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.\n\n# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**\n*****\n> The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.\n*****\n> The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China\u2019s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. \n*****\n> President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump\u2019s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.\n*****\n> \u201cHovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.\n*****\n> \u201cWe saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.\u201d\n*****\n> Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.\u201d\n*****\n> Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. \n*****\n> \u201cThis cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we\u2019ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,\u201d he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn\u2019t always signal positives. \n*****\n> \u201cOn average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Emanuel said the S&P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.\n*****\n> But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. \u201cWhen we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \n*****\n> The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  \n*****\n> \u201cThese stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there\u2019s a change in progress on a vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> President Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.\n*****\n> Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter\u2019s stock hardest.  \n*****\n> Emanuel said technology\u2019 is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.\n*****\n> In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jgJsTbC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cn1jSFW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/TMD5don.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lMnJorQ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kHa6HqT.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZZOjRw4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FigEirb.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MjWiE2F.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wh12Zf4.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8t94L91.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yC7JiMI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nzEoxkl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.\n\n> # Equities\n\n> US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe S&P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhich would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn\u2019t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.\u201d\n\n> The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.\n\n> Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.\n\n> Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n> # International Stocks\n\n> The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng\u2019s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong\u2019s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.\n\n> The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.\n\n> European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.\n\n> # Fixed Income and Commodities\n\n> Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.\n\n> Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.\n\n> Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.\n\n> Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.\n\n> # Looking Ahead\n\n> Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.\n\n> On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday\u2019s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Breadth Surge\n\n> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.\n\n> Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy\u2019s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday\u2019s close, 96% of the components in the S&P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.\n\n> Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cBreadth surges like we\u2019ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June\u2019s First Trading Day\n\n> According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA\u2019s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/277f4afe57244973b48e6bc7c0844a6d/0d36c25bfef3f384-d6/s500x750/96efe19dba3ae99c075a91a11e892ad69fa23e56.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3cdaccd662828f8641c2e822c6df281/0d36c25bfef3f384-33/s500x750/6406f9afe4080788669a930cbe8dd4fb4a52ec28.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month\n\n> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37b672810df8d9c17e4fc69d49aaa9e8/439e24c2bd089fd0-d8/s500x750/5dc0af4ea6dbde69f39defca04e69534e9ac2eb7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# May's Top Performing Stocks\n\n> After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.\n\n> This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.\n\n> Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.\n\n> In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052920-Best-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991\n\n> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-SP-Above.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm\n\n> The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.\n\n> Equity fund flows remain negative. While there\u2019s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.\n\n> Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-Flows-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending May 29th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yq2wWitWyw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.31.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRlTe36oZRw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$CRWD** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$WORK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$ATHM** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$TTC** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$APPS** \n> * **$GOOS** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$HHR** \n> * **$DCI** \n> * **$EXPR** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$CMD** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$ESTC** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$CNK** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$BBW** \n> * **$NGL** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$ENS** \n> * **$SCWX** \n> * **$PD** \n> * **$EVRI** \n> * **$PLX** \n> * **$YEXT** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$SAIC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D4J2yE.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 6.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QTN7mSn.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 6.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j1DpFQy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ij1xmhw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EIpBZjj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvne0Pg.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lE0Nrw2.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wyHcBay.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iZigl8T.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b2NLnrm.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.5.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $179.48\n> **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

The Soros bets have been placed and it is more than clear they are undermining everything in the American economy.   The shorts have loaded the boats last week and sucked in the retail buyer who believed the bottom was in the market on March 23 when the Fed announced trillions worth of market saving life support.   Billions in loans to companies and payments to families were essential life savers and the Bulls put their hand on the scales to tilt in their favor firmly.\n\nCue the retail buyer.  The coast was clear and the retail buyer sat on the sidelines watching his 401k recover so much that he even decided to add personal money to his retail account in addition to his retirement account.

{"title": "So I fucked up today.", "selftext": "Hey y'all! This is a cautionary tale, one of a trading day that reinforced many important lessons for me. It's not a winner (yet at least!) but I think it's as important (in fact more important to acknowledge one's fuck ups than one's wins.\n\nToday I shorted a pharma stock (ADAP) that had a pretty significant boom in premarket. There was no volume and few strike prices on their options so my usual preferred method of shorting was not available. I decided to short sell the stock and planned my entry.\n\nThe first part of the trade went very well, I made a tidy profit when the stock tumbled at open (as I predicted it would) and my trailing stop kicked me out. I could have taken this profit and enjoyed my day.\n\nObviously I did not do that. I FOMOed into selling the same size position when it looked we were going to break another resistance level. The trade quickly reversed against me and I had foolishly removed my stop, leaving me with little liquidity in my margin since most of it was tied into longs.\n\nSo I spent the entire day buying and selling this stock to raise the average on my short and realize as little of a loss as I could, while avoiding a margin call. A few times my excess liquidity was about 100$. Obviously I lived a lot of emotions I could have avoided by not being dumb.\n\nI ended the day with a slightly larger position than I started with, a decent liquidity cushion and a decent prospect for profit. My stops are in place right now to exit the trade altogether if it goes against me and I have placed several profit takers as well. I was lucky to have a mid day reversal that made this juggling possible at all.\n\nSaid juggling erased my gains and left me with about a 5-6% realized loss. Otherwise it would have been 20%.\n\nSo here's a few lessons I learned/were reinforced for me:\n\n1. Never remove your stop when either trading on margin, shorting or day-trading (really on any dicey position). That shit is your lifeline to fighting another day. Removing it in the hope it'll pass and bounce back down is trading on emotions. Much better to let it kick you out and re-enter at a time of your choosing even if it means realizing a small loss.\n\n2. Do not re-enter on FOMO and especially not when the volume (either up or down) is still creating a lot of volatility. Wait for one or two of those short candles. I've gotten fucked by re-entries more often than not.\n\n3. Obviously, make sure your stop and your available liquidity line up when in margin intensive positions (shorts, options, etc.).\n\n4. Don't trade on emotion. Make up your plan and execute it (writing it out actually helps) and if it doesn't work, accept you were wrong and cool off before playing that position or another risky position.\n\nThis was half to get it off my chest and half to help out anyone who's ever been in my shoes, so thanks for reading if you did!", "id": "gta7fj", "created_utc": 1590823663.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "You are trading with too big of a position, if one trade can wipe you out.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "It sounds like he's only trading with a few thousand dollars tbh", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That particular position was about 5k (500 shares) which is pretty much my day trading budget.

I keep about 15-20% of my available liquidity unencumbered (with the rest being long positions that I am fine watching fluctuate) which is normally fine because I only use options/day trades on half of that and am normally disciplined with my stops.\n\nThe main issue is that I removed my stop out of FOMO and thus the ability to cap my max risk (1-2% of the account normally) so with shorts being margin intensive, it was eating through my buffer real fast.\n\nAdmitedly, the whole re-entry was botched and probably the position size as well.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "With how high volatility is right now, your greed was the mistake.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 1st, 2020.\n\n# **Expect more shocking economic data in the week ahead with the unemployment rate set to near 20%  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/expect-more-shocking-economic-data-in-the-week-ahead-with-the-unemployment-rate-set-to-near-20percent.html)**\n*****\n> The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.\n*****\n> The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China\u2019s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. \n*****\n> President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump\u2019s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.\n*****\n> \u201cHovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n> Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.\n*****\n> \u201cWe saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.\u201d\n*****\n> Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.\u201d\n*****\n> Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. \n*****\n> \u201cThis cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we\u2019ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,\u201d he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn\u2019t always signal positives. \n*****\n> \u201cOn average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Emanuel said the S&P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.\n*****\n> But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. \u201cWhen we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \n*****\n> The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  \n*****\n> \u201cThese stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there\u2019s a change in progress on a vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> President Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.\n*****\n> Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter\u2019s stock hardest.  \n*****\n> Emanuel said technology\u2019 is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.\n*****\n> In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jgJsTbC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cn1jSFW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/TMD5don.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lMnJorQ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kHa6HqT.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZZOjRw4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FigEirb.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MjWiE2F.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wh12Zf4.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8t94L91.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yC7JiMI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nzEoxkl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.\n\n> # Equities\n\n> US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe S&P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhich would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn\u2019t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.\u201d\n\n> The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.\n\n> Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.\n\n> Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n> # International Stocks\n\n> The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng\u2019s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong\u2019s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.\n\n> The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.\n\n> European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.\n\n> # Fixed Income and Commodities\n\n> Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.\n\n> Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.\n\n> Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.\n\n> Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.\n\n> # Looking Ahead\n\n> Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.\n\n> On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday\u2019s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Breadth Surge\n\n> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.\n\n> Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy\u2019s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday\u2019s close, 96% of the components in the S&P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.\n\n> Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cBreadth surges like we\u2019ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June\u2019s First Trading Day\n\n> According to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA\u2019s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/277f4afe57244973b48e6bc7c0844a6d/0d36c25bfef3f384-d6/s500x750/96efe19dba3ae99c075a91a11e892ad69fa23e56.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3cdaccd662828f8641c2e822c6df281/0d36c25bfef3f384-33/s500x750/6406f9afe4080788669a930cbe8dd4fb4a52ec28.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month\n\n> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/37b672810df8d9c17e4fc69d49aaa9e8/439e24c2bd089fd0-d8/s500x750/5dc0af4ea6dbde69f39defca04e69534e9ac2eb7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# May's Top Performing Stocks\n\n> After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.\n\n> This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.\n\n> Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.\n\n> In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052920-Best-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991\n\n> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-SP-Above.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm\n\n> The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.\n\n> Equity fund flows remain negative. While there\u2019s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.\n\n> Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/052820-Flows-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$CRWD** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$WORK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$ATHM** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$TTC** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$APPS** \n> * **$GOOS** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$HHR** \n> * **$DCI** \n> * **$EXPR** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$CMD** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$ESTC** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$CNK** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$BBW** \n> * **$NGL** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GHG** \n> * **$ENS** \n> * **$SCWX** \n> * **$PD** \n> * **$EVRI** \n> * **$PLX** \n> * **$YEXT** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$SAIC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PTfOn4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D4J2yE.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 6.1.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QTN7mSn.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 6.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j1DpFQy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ij1xmhw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EIpBZjj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tvne0Pg.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lE0Nrw2.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wyHcBay.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/iZigl8T.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b2NLnrm.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.5.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Zoom Video Communications, Inc. $179.48\n> **Zoom Video Communications, Inc.
