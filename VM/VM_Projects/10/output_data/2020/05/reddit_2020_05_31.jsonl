{"title": "Thoughts on My Portfolio", "selftext": "**Equity 70%**\n\n1. HSBC MSCI World UCITS ETF (GBP) (HMWO) (85%)\n2. ISHARES III PLC MSCI WORLD SMALL CAP UCITS USD(GBP) (WLDS) (15%)\n\n**Commodities (10%)**\n\n1. Gold Bullion Sovereign Coins (5%)\n2. iShares Physical Silver ETC (SSLN) (5%)\n\n**Cash 20%**\n\nI chose HMWO and WLDS because I want to 'own the world'. They give me diverse global exposure to large, mid, and small cap. Together they give my c.60% exposure to the US.\n\nShould I add iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (Acc) (GBP) (CSP1) to give me greater exposure to US large cap because it seems to dominate everything? I was thinking of reducing the proportion of my portfolio that I have in cash (down from 20% to 10%) by buying enough CSP1 to give me between 65% and 70% exposure to the US. Do you think the US market is going to be increasingly volatile over the next 6 months (coronavirus, 2020 Pre. Election, US-CN relations falling apart and the coming of Cold War II (if it isn't already here), and the race riots)?\n\nI hold physical gold because it is the ultimate safe haven, a good hedge, and I will always have it if there is a major crash and if SHTF I can barter with it! Seems like US-CN relations are going to breakdown much further. The dollar's dominance will be challenged. Gold will rise...\n\nSilver is at an all-time low, especially when compared with gold. It's also a good hedge.\n\nI don't have any emerging markets because China dominates these. I think China will be hurt much worse than the US in Cold War II. Also, I think India-China relations will breakdown further as India rises. And India is not very stable internally. Also, places like India and Latin America have not yet seen the worst of coronavirus so now probably is not a good time to be investing in them in any case.\n\nI'm 27 years old and currently studying (I will finish next year).\n\nReally keen to know what you all think...", "id": "gu0gx2", "created_utc": 1590936847.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.38, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "You are quite young, and if I were you I would invest 10% in risky / future / disruptive equities.
