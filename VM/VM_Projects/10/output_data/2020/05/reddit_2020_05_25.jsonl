{"title": "5/25/2020: Weekly Wrap-up & What to Expect", "selftext": "Stock prices were propelled upward last week due to two key announcements. Last Sunday, Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank still has plenty of ammunition to help the markets and economy. Then, Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) announced positive data on their COVID vaccine on Monday morning. This combination of news drove the S&P 500 increase by 3.2% over the course of the week. With all this good news, can we expect more? Here are the details:\n\n1. **On Sunday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed is not out of ammunition 'by a long shot', driving premarket trading.** Last Sunday, on \"60 Minutes,\" Jerome Powell told the interviewer that \"we're not out of ammunition by a long shot,\" referring to a large sum of unused funds that have been allotted to fight COVID. Simply put, Powell plans on continuously infusing money into the economy to attempt to save small business from closing and permanently reducing the number of jobs available. Index futures traded significantly higher the same night.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. **The next morning, Moderna released positive interim P1 data for their COVID vaccine, pushing stocks further upwards.** The morning after, Moderna announced positive data on their COVID vaccine. The biotech company demonstrated generation of anti-COVID antibodies in patients without significant side effects. The company plans on starting their pivotal P3 clinical trial in July, which, if successful, will lead to a much faster economic recovery with everyone's concerns of infection put at ease.\n3. **On Thursday, over 2M Americans filed unemployment claims, but investors remain optimistic over economic reopening.**\u00a0As usual, the announcement of an additional 2.4M Americans filing for unemployment claims did not shake the market. Through our small sample size of consumer research, we have found that many are not working because of high unemployment benefits during COVID. Restaurants are worried about reopening because there may not be enough supply of workers to hire from in order to reopen their shops successfully. While more continue to file for unemployment claims, investors are confident that many will be able to sustain on government support and will reengage with the economy as it reopens.\u00a0\n4. **To date, all but three states have either reopened to a degree or plan on reopening soon.** The final three states that have yet to open and do not have set plans to open are Illinois, Delaware, and New Jersey. As the weather gets better, more people are out and about waiting for takeout at their favorite local restaurants and eating the food in grassy public areas. So far, the U.S. government has not identified any spikes in COVID cases in states that have reopened.\u00a0\n5. **With states reopening and the weather improving, airport travel jumps to a two-month high, indicating economic activity.**\u00a0With summer around the corner and COVID concern dying down, travelers are getting back into the air. This Friday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a two-month high in airport travelers. While this number is still down 88% from a year ago, increase in air travel demonstrates confidence in ability to combat COVID.\n\n**With the Feds' confidence in the economy and Moderna's exciting vaccine announcement, where does that leave the markets?**\u00a0WX Capital was confident that positive news would outweigh negative news in May, but now that positive news is relatively commonplace, we believe the market may recover at a much slower pace. We expect a successful economic reopening with limited spikes in COVID cases and believe that vaccine development for COVID is more of a matter of when rather than if. We also believe that biotech will likely be the industry with the greatest return potential in the near future.", "id": "gqchri", "created_utc": 1590419004.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "So is Moderna a pump and dump scam or not?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Frankly, it's not a pump and dump.

{"title": "Is it possible to anticipate every market correction only by taking into account the performance of Treasury Bonds and utility company stocks?", "selftext": "I saw the idea in [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-crisis-investing-strategy-one-signal-driven-gains-michael-gayed-2020-5). I will put the text in the end in case you want to read it and the premium shield stops you.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's imagine that we can only invest either in **TLT** or **SPY**. Buying **SPY** = take the risk, buying **TLT** = avoid risk. When we switch between these two states we always sell an entire position in the previous state (in other words it's either one state or the other).\n\nTo make it clear: **the goal is to anticipate every single market correction AND miss as few as possible opportunities of taking the reward from risky investments (stocks).**\n\nBy \"anticipate\" above I mean to switch to the \"Risk-off\" state.\n\nSo, the dude in the article says that he does it by observing \"*the performance of utility-company stocks and Treasury bonds (Most major crashes, corrections, bear markets, periods of market stress are really preceded by strength first in utilities and Treasurys)*\". This fella is allegedly a hedge fund manager who jumped out from the stock market in January into treasuries (yes, it was a few weeks too early, but obviously we cannot consistently predict the correction/bear market perfectly due to random shit like Trump tweets, investors sentiment, etc.) and got back to risk in early April. Obviously, this move was great and he was able to beat the market (even though he doesn't have some crazy-ass returns like Renaissance Technologies).\n\nI wonder if there is an effective way to achieve the goal I described by somehow using price movements of **TLT** and **IDU** (iShares U.S. Utilities ETF). To me it kinda seems logical (liquidity goes into defensive financial instruments), but at the same time I doubt it can be *that* simple.\n\nThe dude from the article says that the strength in utilities and treasuries *\"is not some random correlation. The causation there is really about the demand for capital. It's about interest rates.\"* To be honest, I don't really understand this claim and if I saw it on this sub, I would most likely assume that the person who said it is an autist. But since this guy has made some real tendies and I sit 100% in cash from January, I'm more likely to assume that I could be an autist myself.\n\nCan someone explain the logic behind this claim? In my view when **TLT** goes up it means that interest rates are expected to go down which is good for raising cheap debt for businesses (to make it grow), and therefore good for the economy, and therefore good for the stock market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking forward to your bright thoughts in the comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the text from that article:\n\n>Gayed is a portfolio manager for Toroso Investments and runs its ATAC Rotation Fund. The fund looks at the performance of utility-company stocks and Treasury bonds and essentially asks a yes-or-no question: Is it a good time to take a risk?  \n>  \n>He checks the answer once a week. If the answer is \"yes,\" Gayed goes all in on stocks with a handful of index-tracking exchange-traded funds to grab the gains. If it's saying \"no,\" all of the fund's assets go into a handful of Treasury bond funds, which should rally if stocks fall.  \n>  \n>\"Most major crashes, corrections, bear markets, periods of market stress are really preceded by strength first in utilities and Treasurys,\" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview. \"It's not some random correlation. The causation there is really about the demand for capital. It's about interest rates.\"  \n>  \n>The key is that those assets rally even before the volatility shows up. And in January, with utility stocks outperforming and Treasury prices rising, Gayed's signal started flashing \"no\" \u2014 time to shift to the bond ETFs. He made his move and waited, knowing that if the market was going to drop, it would probably happen in two or three weeks.  \n>  \n>For six weeks, nothing happened. It wasn't a surprise. The signal has given plenty of false alarms before. Some investors would be frustrated that they were giving up returns because of a mistaken indicator, but Gayed compares it to slowing down on a rain-slicked road: a good idea even if you don't get into an accident.  \n>  \n>But at the six-week mark, the market nosedived and a historic plunge began. The value of Gayed's bond ETFs soared. In early April, his signal flipped back to \"yes,\" and he went all in on large-company stocks.  \n>  \n>As of May 21, the ATAC fund had returned 36.4% this year, according to Morningstar. The typical fund of its type, in the tactical allocation class, is down about 8.5% this year.  \n>  \n>The fund also surpassed the broader market and its peers in 2015 and 2017, putting its returns in the top percentile of all tactical allocation funds over the past five years and earning it a five-star rating from Morningstar.  \n>  \n>Returning to his driving analogy, Gayed says his indicator shows him dangerous conditions. Even if those conditions don't end with a crash, it's smart to react to the rising risk.  \n>  \n>\"While I may not know the exact mile marker I might crash my car, I do know the conditions that favor an accident,\" he said. \"I know when to slow down, when to play offense, when to play defense.\"  \n>  \n>He plays defense with either long- or short-duration Treasury ETFs. Even when there isn't a big rally in Treasurys, he still gets some returns. And his approach to offense is only a little more complicated. Based on momentum signals that tell him which group is performing best, he'll invest in emerging markets, large caps, or his current choice, small caps.  \n>  \n>He takes on some leverage to do that, investing 130% of the fund's assets in the right group for that moment. According to Gayed, that's a smart move because when utilities and Treasuries are lagging the market, volatility is likely to fall and leverage isn't dangerous.  \n>  \n>\"When volatility is falling, you tend to have more under reaction in momentum, more persistence, more consecutive up days, which is exactly what you want when you're levering up an asset class,\" he said.  \n>  \n>Like many fund managers who try to protect against disaster, Gayed said he worried that a lot of investors aren't hedging their bets properly. He often asks peers what part of their portfolio they hate \u2014 and if they can't think of anything, they're doing it wrong, he said.  \n>  \n>\"You're going to hate the portion of your portfolio that's not working, that's not going up when everything else is going up,\" he said. \"Because of FOMO, and because everyone always wants everything to be working at the exact same time, it actually results in people being way more concentrated relative to their risk profile than they should be.\"  \n>  \n>For Gayed, that's the cash in his portfolio: no returns, no momentum.  \n>  \n>Gayed, having thrived in one crisis, is watching for the next one. He thinks it's possible that inflation is going to rise and bonds are going to sell off. He said inflation expectations have held relatively steady, even as central banks unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus and indicators like lumber prices were also pointing higher.  \n>  \n>But mostly, he's aware that there's always another surprise ahead. And he doesn't have to foresee everything that happens as long as when he's right, he's really right.  \n>  \n>\"The market has proven time and time again that it will pretty much almost always do what the crowd thinks it won't. Consistency is an illusion, always has been, always will be in markets,\" he said, adding that the frequency of being right \"matters a lot less than the magnitude.\"\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "gqesyh", "created_utc": 1590426450.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "His name is Gayed.
