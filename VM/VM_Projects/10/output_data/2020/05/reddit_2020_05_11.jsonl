{"title": "SpringWorks (SWTX): A Rare Cancer Biotech with Potentially >50% Upside. Recommending BUY.", "selftext": "Last week, we initiated a position in Springworks Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SWTX), and as promised, we\u2019re providing our view on the company. \n\n**Summary:** Founded in 2017, Springworks is a $1.4B market cap biotech company developing targeted oncology therapies for rare tumor types with high unmet need. We like Springworks for several key reasons: \n\n* The company has two late-stage (Phase 2/3) programs, nirogacestat and mirdametinib, targeting rare tumor types with high unmet need (either insufficient therapies or no available therapies). Past trial data gives us confidence in their chances of approval, and we expect these candidates to be approved in 2022 and 2023 respectively, upon which they will become first-in-class drugs in their respective indications through their differentiated clinical profiles. \n* Springworks has signed collaborations with major biotech companies to develop several interesting early stage assets in additional oncology indications, providing a degree of validation of Springworks\u2019 assets and creating a future growth runway. \n* We anticipate several value-creating milestones over the next year, namely topline data from nirogacestat\u2019s registrational Phase 3 trial in mid-2021 and an interim update from mirdametinib\u2019s registrational Phase 2b in 1Q21. \n* Our DCF analysis assigns Springworks a price target of $55, assuming an 85% probability of success for nirogacestat and mirdametinib in their main indications, and using an 11% discount rate and 2% terminal growth rate. \n\n**Company Background:** Springworks was established in 2017 as a spinoff from Pfizer, which provided the company with initial funding and the development rights to its 4 clinical assets. Springworks raised \\~$230M from investors including Bain Capital and OrbiMed Advisors before going public in September 2019. \n\n**1. Late-stage Clinical Programs in Areas of High Unmet Need:** Springworks has two late stage programs currently in registrational or potentially registrational trials:\n\nNirogacestat. Nirogacestat is an oral, selective gamma secretase inhibitor developed to treat desmoid tumors. \n\n* *Desmoid tumors.* Desmoid tumors are highly morbid, soft tissue tumors with an estimated 6,000 patients being treated in the US every year. \n* *Unmet need.* Though survival rates for desmoid tumors are relatively high compared to other cancer types, desmoid tumors place a heavy burden on patients\u2019 quality of life; they can interfere with the function of nearby structures (e.g. intestines), are painful to live with, and highly disfiguring. Treatment has traditionally been via surgical resection, but this method has been associated with recurrence rates of up to 70%. Chemotherapy and other targeted cancer therapies have been used off-label as well, but these have shown inconsistent efficacy and unfavorable safety profiles. \n* Nirogacestat has received FDA breakthrough and orphan drug designation.\n\nMirdametinib. Mirdametinib is an oral, selective MEK inhibitor developed to treat NF1-associate plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). \n\n* *NF1-PN.* The NF1 gene produces neurofibromin, a protein that represses a key signaling pathway (RAS/MAPK) responsible for the growth of many cancers. When the NF1 gene is mutated, the loss of neurofibromin production allows this pathway to run unchecked, resulting in tumor growth across the body. There are \\~100k NF1 patients in the US, and 30-50% of these patients can develop plexiform neurofibromas, which are tumors that grow along nerves. \n* *Unmet need.* NF1-PN are associated with extreme pain and disfigurement as well as interference with neurocognitive function. First-line therapy is usually surgical resection, but NF1-PN extensive growth patterns along nerves make them hard to completely remove (while risking nerve damage). \n* There is one approved MEK inhibitor for NF1-PN, AstaZeneca\u2019s selumetinib, which was approved in April 2020. While the drug works, mirdametinib has demonstrated a potentially superior safety profile vs. selumetinib, which should allow patients to remain on therapy longer and experience more clinical benefit. \n* Mirdametinib has received FDA orphan drug designation. \n\n**2. Promising Clinical Data.** \n\nNirogacestat. To date, nirogacestat has shown a promising clinical profile in its Phase 1 and 2 trials. The drug is currently enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial, with progression free survival (PFS, a measure of how long patients live without their tumors growing >20% in size) as the primary endpoint. \n\n* *Phase 1.* Nirogacestat achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 71.4% in its 7-patient Phase 1 trial (5/7), and a 100% disease control rate (DCR). Patients were able to stay on the drug for a median of 49.5 months (at the time of publication, so possibly longer), and none went off treatment due to safety issues. \n* *Phase 2.* In a heavily pre-treated population (median 4 lines of prior therapy vs. 3 in Phase 1 i.e. sicker patients), nirogacestat again achieved a 100% DCR and a 29.4% ORR. More importantly, 59% of patients remained on drug for more than 2 years. The drug was well tolerated with only 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to side effects. \n* *Phase 3.* A 115-patient Phase 3 trial is currently enrolling patients. The trial is powered to show a 12-month difference in PFS vs. placebo, and past trials from a similar drug showed that 50% of placebo patients experience disease progression by 8 months, which compares favorably to what nirogacestat has demonstrated in its Phase 1/2 trials. \n* The Phase 3 trial is expected to readout in 2Q/3Q21 and we expect approval of nirogacestat in 2022. \n\nMirdametinib.  \n\n* *Phase 2.* In its Phase 2 trial, Mirdametinib demonstrated a 42% ORR in 8/19 patients. In contrast, selumetinib demonstrated a 74% ORR in its Phase 2 trial. Though selumetinib\u2019s Phase 2 data was numerically superior to mirdametinib\u2019s, we believe several factors artificially limited mirdametinib\u2019s efficacy:\n   * Selumetinib\u2019s trial enrolled only children while mirdametinib\u2019s trial included only patients 16 years or older. Tumors in younger children are considered to be more responsive to therapy than those in adults. \n   * Patients in the mirdametinib trial were removed from the trial if they did not show signs of benefit within 12 months, which may have limited the number responses; 30% of selumetinib\u2019s patients did not respond until after 12 months on drug. \n* *Safety benefits.* In its Phase 2, only 5 out of 19 patients (26%) required dose reductions of mirdametinib. In contrast, in selumetinib\u2019s Phase 1, 10 out of 24 patients (42%) required dose reductions due to toxicity issues. We believe that this is evidence that mirdametinib is a safer drug than selumetinib, which will be an important differentiating factor for doctors deciding between the two drugs. \n* *Phase 2b.* Springworks is currently enrolling patients for a 100-patient Phase 2b trial of mirdametinib (primary endpoint ORR) that could support approval in 2023. The trial will enroll an even split of pediatric and adult patients and will not remove patients before 12 months. We expect that mirdametinib will show a similar ORR to selumetinib and differentiate itself via a superior safety profile. \n\n**3. Intriguing Early Stage Programs.**\n\n* **Nirogacestat for Multiple Myeloma Therapy.** Nirogacestat is also being evaluated as an add-on therapy to BCMA therapies for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells with \\~27k patients in the US every year. These drugs target a protein called BCMA on the surface of cancer cells, and preclinical data has shown that nirogacestat significantly upregulates the expression of BCMA on cancer cells and enhanced the potency of BCMA-targeting drugs. Springworks has already signed collaborations with Glaxo Smith Kline and Allogene Therapeutics to use nirogacestat in combination trials with their BCMA drugs. \n* **BGB-3245.** Springworks has also signed a collaboration agreement with Beigene, a leading China biotech company, to develop a novel cancer drug targeting BRAF-mutant solid tumors. BRAF is a validated oncology target that is clinically relevant in melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. BGB-3245 has been shown in preclinical models to be effective in inhibiting certain mutant forms of BRAF that currently approved BRAF inhibitors cannot target. A Phase 1 trial for BGB-3245 has been initiated in Australia. \n\n**4. Strong Balance Sheet:** As of the end of 2019, Springworks had \\~$330M in cash and no debt. This is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and support its 6 clinical trials through the end of 2022. The company has not indicated that its clinical development timelines have been impacted by Covid, but we will be on the lookout for any future guidance. \n\n**5. Experienced Leadership:** Springworks is led by a world-class management team with deep pharma industry experience. Selected leadership includes:\n\n* Chief Executive Officer Saqib Islam is a founding member of the company and was formerly the Chief Business Officer at Moderna. Prior to Moderna, he held senior leadership roles at Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a $20B rare disease biotech).\n* Chief Medical Officer Jens Renstrup was formerly Head of Medical Affairs at Alexion, where he was instrumental in building out its pipeline. Prior to Alexion, he led medical affairs at Glaxo Smith Kline\u2019s vaccine division. \n* Head of R&D Stephen Squinto is a venture partner at OrbiMed, a highly respected life science investment firm. He is also a co-founder of Alexion, where he led global operations and R&D for over 20 years. \n\n**6. Risks.** Potential investors should be aware that Springworks is exposed to the following key risks as a biotech company:\n\n* *Clinical development risk.* Springworks\u2019 assets could fail their clinical trials due to unfavorable or uncompetitive clinical data and/or unexpected safety issues. \n* *Competitive risk.* Springworks\u2019 drugs could be leapfrogged by more effective drugs, severely limiting their commercial potential. \n* *Financial risk.* Unexpected costs/circumstances could lead to the company running out of cash and having to raise dilutive capital and/or shut down. \n\nDisclosure: We currently own shares of Springworks Therapeutics.

They may be slightly over priced at the moment, so I'd take a \"hold\" position, but if you are looking long term, I think they are going to go up significantly in 5 - 10 years.

Nothing wrong with that if you are young and just staring investing. Over time, I would add some blue-chip stocks that create some decent dividends.  \n\nI'd be cautious about putting too much into Chinese stocks.

VTIQ/NKLA is also a bit risky in the short term, but if they can survive the next 2 - 5 years, they, too, may have a really good long term outlook.

{"title": "Volume clock is way too slow", "selftext": "**Institutionals**\n\nSince the end of February, you should know that most institutionals have taken risk off the table and are sitting on cash waiting for more clarity. There is less money moving the stock markets than there was yesterday. You can see this by daily volume peaking in March and slowly decreasing since then.\n\n**Market makers**\n\nDecreasing volume means decreasing volatility because volume is needed to move prices. Decreasing volatility is a self-reinforcing loop. As uncertainty around future prices decreases, market makers are more confident in their quotes and can put more volume in the limit order books without being caught wrong footed. This in turn means that bigger trades are required to impact prices. With an already low trade volume, a huge shock becomes more necessary for volume and volatility to pick up again. The more time passes and the bigger this shock has to be. It is not likely to happen with seemingly only retail investors and bots playing the market.\n\n**Price discovery is slow**\n\nWhile everyone is betting on a breakout in either directions, the probability of it happening on any single day decreases with time and volume. It is going to become harder for any big trade or news release to move prices in both directions. Your options are losing value by the day because of that.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStop buying OTM calls/puts, you can expect to lose more money as daily volume decreases.

{"title": "Danger Zoooowne!", "selftext": " \n\nFor anyone who missed it, the US unemployment rate as of last week was 14 percent or 20.5 million people. Crikey! This time last year we were at 50-year lows, in three months we managed to wipe out all the job gains of the last decade and then some! \n\n  Over in the UK, economic activity has started to reaccelerate. This reacceleration should not be mistaken for a new boom in economic growth. I think investors/traders should brace themselves for persistently disappointing data points over the next 1-3 months. If we were at 100 pre-virus which we weren\u2019t), The US and UK economies are going to undergo a transition; from total shut down, i.e., 0, to 1, then 2,3,4,5, and so on till we get to 100. It is quite improbable that we go from 0 to 100 in the second quarter. Trust me, homies, we are going to be on some chill s\\*&%.\n\n***Riding into the danger zone:*** **Bankruptcies Rising**\n\n  Investor consensus and policymakers alike keep expecting consumers and businesses bounce back as a function of an  \u201cincrease in pent up demand'' that has been cultivated as a result of being locked away for a month. The data so far fails to confirm this. Below is an extract from a Bloomberg;\n\n*\u201c****Some 42% of American non-financial public companies are discussing slashing investments, 27% are talking about \\[cutting\\] equity payouts and 17% are focused on drawing down on credit lines, conclude economists Andrew Y. Chen and Jie Yang. At the peak of the last recession, the figures were 25%, 11%, and 7%, respectively.\u201d***  \n\n   Businesses are ridding in the danger zone, and bankruptcies are rising.\n\nYou see, rising bankruptcies create a vicious circle. As bankruptcies rise, banks become concerned that their loan books will become worthless. This forces banks to reduce lending, thus reducing credit available to businesses; this creates more bankruptcies, delinquencies, and layoffs. These unfortunate events reinforce banks' decision to reduce available credit even more. Credit/ lending collapses, creating a worsening economic outlook. Highly leverages industries, for example, the restaurants (more on this later) are very exposed here. \n\n**Tightening Lending Standards.**\n\nEarlier last week, the fed released the senior loan officer survey report to highlight a tightening in lending standards. Below is a summary of the report from Darius Dale @ Hedgeye:\n\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Large/Medium C&I Firms**: +4,150bps to 41.5% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JAN \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201990\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Small C&I Firms**: +4,110bps to 39.7% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since APR \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201990\n* **Net % Increasing the Cost of Credit Lines** for Large/Medium C&I Firms: +4,200bps to 32.3% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration ever\n* **Net % Increasing the Cost of Credit Lines for Small C&I Firms**: +2,990bps to 25.4% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since OCT \u201909 and fastest acceleration ever\n* **Net % Increasing Credit Spreads Over Banks\u2019 Cost of Capital for Large/Medium C&I Firms**: +6,170bps to 40.9% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since OCT \u201907 \n* **Net % Increasing Credit Spreads Over Banks\u2019 Cost of Capital for Small C&I Firms**: +4,050bps to 30.2% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since OCT \u201909 and fastest acceleration since OCT \u201907 \n* **Net % Tightening Loan Covenants for Large/Middle** C&I Firms: +4,020bps to 33.3% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201990\n* **Net % Tightening Loan Covenants for Small C&I Firms**: +2,570bps 24.2% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201909\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer Credit Card Loans**: +2,490bps to 38.5% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and most rapid acceleration since JUL \u201908\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer New and Used Auto Loans**: +710bps to 16.0% in APR \u2013 highest reading ever\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer Loans ex-Credit Cards and Autos**: +2,020bps to 21.8% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since JUL \u201908\n\n**The Knock-on effects.**\n\nThe evidence above demonstrates that for businesses;\n\n1 ) The cost of credit is rising at a time where businesses need access to money,2\n\n2) Lending standards are increasing, further reducing access to credit. \n\n1+2= Rising probability of bankruptcy.\n\nFor consumers;\n\n1) High unemployment causes banks to perceive the consumer as a source of lending risk thereby making it difficult to obtain credit\n\n2) Lending standards for auto loans and credit cards are rising, decreasing the availability of credit for the consumption of consumer goods ( cars, phones, etc.). \n\n1+2= Rising probability of widespread solvency events. \n\n**Unique opportunities in Carvana**\n\nIf lending standards are tightening for auto loans, auto businesses like Carvana are likely likely to underperform. Buying put spreads makes sense. Buying November 2020 $80puts and selling the $70 puts should cost about $3 at the time of writing this with a $10 payoff. One could also sell short; however, patience should be exercised as it is on a bullish trend with a lot of short interest. Your balls could get squeezed shorting this bastard.\n\n**PRAA**\n\nDebt collectors love recessions. As delinquencies increase, they make more money as they get more business opportunities. These guys are ramping up the purchase of lousy loan books at a discount, an incredible tailwind for them going into 2022. Buy on any pullbacks.\n\n \n\n**Restaurants**\n\nThese guys are facing a severe decline in capacity. Parts of texas see 25% capacity, reduced foot traffic into full-service restaurants. However, the quick service restaurants seem to fair a lot better. I think star bucks falls into the category of restaurants who get hit with reduced capacity. Sell when lower highs are established. If needed, I will drop an alert when it gets to a level I think is an excellent place to sell. I'm not good with squiggly lines. \n\nUntil next time  ML peace", "id": "ghyrwe", "created_utc": 1589238570.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the bread line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
