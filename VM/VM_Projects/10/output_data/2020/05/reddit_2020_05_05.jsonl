{"title": "Unbiased Investing: 3 Earnings Calls to Listen In On (Keynotes Included) May 4th to May 8th [$DIS, $FLIR, $HEAR]", "selftext": "My [Earnings Call Keynotes](https://imgur.com/VAYvBW4) for the week of May 4th to May 8th 2020.\n\nThis week I will be focusing my attention to 3 of my major holding earnings calls. The earnings calls include:\n\n1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT\n2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT\n3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT\n\nThe summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term.\n\n**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**\n\nThe first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.\n\n1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol & Coastal, Search & Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts.\n\n[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\\_per\\_page=10&page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&page=0)\n\n2. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions.\n\n3. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities.\n\nNow I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon.\n\n**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.\n\nI noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)\n\n[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb)\n\nWe can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time?\n\n[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI)\n\nAfter a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time.\n\nSince 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console.\n\nThe current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team.\n\n**Disney ($DIS):**\n\n\\*Sorry, it's getting late and I do not have time to write my full analysis for Disney however my keynotes are basically what I want to pay attention to on the conference call. Disney has a history of making great investments, and brand loyalty. Of course the parks are a massive liability given the status of the pandemic however I believe people will come back shortly after the pandemic has subsided. Disney+ service is experiencing growth like no other streaming service has seen before, and most of the content is recycled. They currently offer an extremely low price but have plenty of room to adjust this moving forward.\n\n**Disclosure:** Anyways, I am very bullish on FLIR and Disney in the long-term and have recently added to my positions. I have recently purchased Turtle Beach, and am holding for up-to 6 months but will continue to monitor the business environment.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial planner, nor financial analyst. Do your own due diligence before purchasing any equities, the discussion above is purely my opinion.\n\nThanks for reading. I just put this together quickly as I wanted it out well before the Disney Earnings call. I hope this was helpful in some way, please feel free to provide any feedback.

You give up juicy premium for steady, stable returns. Am I wrong on that?\n\nI think you might be conflating stability/risk with volatility. A lot of risky companies (lets take biotech for example) will be very volatile. But a risky company doesn't have to be volatile and a stable company isn't immune from volatility. Now a lot of the time, stable companies do tend to have a lower Beta/volatility. The trick is, though, to find a stable (in the sense of an established company) with relatively high volatility (to rake in options premium).\n\nThe wheel is a decent strategy for recurring returns. Stable is kind of in the eye of the beholder. No one was feeling stable in March.\n\nThe problem with wheeling low vol underlyings is that you simply don't get enough premium to be worth it. The extrinsic value you can charge for your premium is a function of both time and volatility- but moreso volatility. If volatility is too low, you'd make marginally better than a 'risk-free' CD or owning a treasury.\n\nThink about it this way... Let's say you want to lever yourself up on some company you were really bullish about. If that options pricing reflected low volatility, you'd be pretty pumped to buy that call because you'd make money either if vol increases a ton or the underlying moves up sufficiently. So if you are short the call in this scenario, there are more ways for you to be hurt and you are doing it for very little premium in the first place.\n\nJust my $.02. Your money, you do what you want.\n\nEDIT: Strikethrough added. I'm tired and can't read. Regardless of your experience, these are just my thoughts when wheeling. If you have plenty of options experience then it should be stuff you already realize. Like I ended it though. It's your money. You don't have to listen to me. But I definitely wouldn't want to be short puts right now on companies with limited chains. It's outside your initial screening parameters but GE might be a decent underlying to start with if you are bullish the company.

I love that people new to options trading can pick up a relatively easy, relatively low risk strategy but it isn't this magical strategy that is guaranteed to beat the market over years. If anything, I'd bet it under-performs if you are wanting to do it for a long time horizon since you will almost be paying exclusively short term gains.\n\nTo me, wheeling is not this infinite cycle of CSP -> CC -> CSP -> CC. It's just two steps of owning something you are bullish anyways. If average Joe already owns 100 shares of WMT and sells a CC against it. All of a sudden, he can say he's wheelin' too because it's a part of the wheel.\n\nWheeling, to me, is just a fancy way of actively managing your short put and call options.\n\nEDIT: Also, it may be just biased for success over the past 10 years (prior to March). Anyone could come up with a strategy that, short of being completely asinine, would have likely had success in this past bull market.\n\n>Surely the volatility reverts to the mean, right? So how are they making it work?\n\nYes. So if the underlying's mean volatility is still relatively high to the market (B > 1), you can still get decent premium.

They have negative free cash flow. This Q1 report is just a blimp IMO, and their online sales won't be sustained.

Couple that with Amazon + increasing online competition, a shit balance sheet with unrelenting debt and I think this stock should crater from the highs and everyone knows it. There is most likely short covering sustaining the run up. And we are at ATH which for sure must act as psychological resistance. I am compelled to sell calls and take advantage of super high IV.
