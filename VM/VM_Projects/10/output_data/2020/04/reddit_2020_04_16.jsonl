The creatures that make up the lion's share of stock trading. \n\nI think of the initial market sell of in February and wonder to myself : \"Why not December, or January, why February 20?\"\n\nA key factor here is that boomers are old, bold, and waycist to the bone. They could care less about Genocide, Violence, Slavery or Disease in other foreign third world countries. But the moment one of the Mario brothers got sick, the boomers sold off. This is a mark where white people, the most important people according to every depiction of wall street I've ever seen, think shit has hit the fan and can no longer ignore the problem. \n\nFast forward to now, we're back to December 2019. The world is set for a recession, a big one, huge one, bigger than we've ever had, yet people are still investing. What could cause people to feel the effects of the virus or economic downturn and stop living in la la land?\n\nFor me, I think the biggest boomer idea is not related to the virus, or economics, but rather big government or the fear of martial law and chaos. I think this is the one wild card boomers may care about, where they think that the world is going to be taken over by the \"elites\" and that the government is going to make them more subservient. \n\nI think if more states enforce strict lock downs like Michigan, or the lock down lasts longer than people think it should, its likely for protests to occur. This could cause more panic and more fear towards others or the government. \n\nFrom this turmoil I think boomers will be scared to invest and instead hoard as we descend into a police state because they can't go to church anymore. \n\nFor me, I'm trying to make money off of boomer fear by buying into AOBC (Guns and defense), but I'm not sure what else may be profitable. **AOBC $9 Call 09/18** personally.\n\nOne thing is for certain, this market moves more on emotion than logic, and for that reason I'm trying to think like a boomer. \n\nThoughts on this?", "id": "g29al0", "created_utc": 1587016969.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Pee HARD to keep your bladder strong!", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "the real info is always in the comments....", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12813015282154083}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05162084102630615}, {"body": "It's better to buy a gun than an actual gun stock. \n\nI bought a smith and wesson MP15 on a black Friday sale back in 2016 for $350 and it's selling new for $650 now\n\nShoulda bought more tbh", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Smart thinking, really.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13886374235153198}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2583483159542084}, {"body": "Not gonna lie I didn't read any of this", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06570270657539368}, {"body": "Real economy is tanking but JPow is printing money.

Read that shit. For the idiots on this subreddit who can't click a link, the TL;DR is this:\n\n>Three possibilities exist for the potential spread or decline of a disease, depending on its R0 value:\n\n1. If R0 is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.\n\n2. If R0 equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay alive and stable, but there won\u2019t be an outbreak or an epidemic.\n\n3. If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will spread between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.\n\nPhase 1 of Coronavirus was the initial spread, when R0 was in scenario 3. Right now we're living in phase 2 of Coronavirus, where we are taking severe measures and shutting down the economy. We've made it to scenario 2. Opening up is risky, because it might put is right back in scenario 3. However, once states think it will only lead to scenario 2 or 1, we reopen. That's phase 3 and it's coming soon.\n\nIf your trading is based on coronavirus right now (*which it fucking should be*), R0 is your daddy. R0 > 1? Daddy's mad and is going to hit you. **PUT** yourself behind your siblings so they get hit first. R0 < 1? Daddy is in a good mood. **CALL** him and ask him to go to McDonalds for tendies.\n\nThe current bull run make any more sense to you morons? R0 < 1 right now. The market doesn't trade on the present, it trades on the future. And the big bois who control the market have access to the best epidemiologists in the world. I know for a fact that the biggest names in investing have Harvard epidemiologists advising them on coronavirus. They know how R0 works and are basing their decision making off of it. You should too. \n\nThey also know that R0's effect is **exponential**. \n\nImagine a disease starting in India with a cycling time of something around a week from infection to spread. If R0 is 2 and 1 person has it on November 1st, by January 1st 256 people have it. March 1st? 65,000 people have it. May 1st? 16 million. July 1st? Over 4 billion. 9 months and the whole world is infected.\n\nBut let's say the disease starts in a country where people wash their hands. Like the US. That lowers R0 by just a little. Let's say on average each person infects 1.5 people instead of 2. The change is huge. By July 1st only 450,000 are infected instead of 4 billion. \n\nSo small changes in R0 are **MASSIVE**. The difference between an R0 of 0.9 and 1.1 over the next 3 months is literally the difference between you getting rejected at bars and you stuck masturbating at home to pictures of your sister in yoga pants. The market will fundamentally follow R0 data, because that\u2019s what the big boi decision makers are basing their trades on. Right now the market is priced assuming that once we reopen the economy, R0 will be around 1, but a little less. If that were to happen, we would have the V shaped recovery.  If R0 is anything above 1, the economy is screwed. We would go back into lockdown in 3 months. And we\u2019d have to stay in lockdown for at least a month to get R0 back down again. The market would tank. \n\nEvery little action has an effect on R0. People washing hands more? R0 goes down. People coughing into their hands? R0 goes up. Warmer weather? R0 might go down. Warmer weather leads to people going to the beach? R0 goes back up. \n\nSo here's what's going to happen in 2 weeks. Phase 3 is going to start. We're going to start reopening the economy. Look at what the states are mandating. If they are issuing guidelines to not shake hands, not gather in groups of 20 or more, wear masks in public, and avoid travel, and people are actually following the guidelines R0 will probably stay low. We hit a slightly slower V shaped recovery than anticipated. The market might go down a little short term, but we won't see any crashes. No huge gains to be made except shorting volatility.\n\nIf states don't issue guidelines or people don't follow them, prepare for a major crash like the one we saw in February. If you want to be really risk averse, wait until there is good data on weather effects before loading up on puts. \n\n**TL;DR The way the economy reopens in the next 2 weeks will determine the next 6 months of the market.
