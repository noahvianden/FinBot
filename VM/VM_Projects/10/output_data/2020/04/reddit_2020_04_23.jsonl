When you buy a Put, you want the stock price to decrease. [Here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp)'s a simple explanation for Calls. \n3. Yes, as a call buyer you want to buy the contract for the lowest price possible. The contract price is the premium you'll need to pay to own that contract. \n4.

[Here](http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/extrinsic-value-and-intrinsic-value)'s a good explanation for both. \n5. Closing the position is similar to closing the trade in stocks. Ideally, options traders want to close their positions before the expiration date unless they are interested in owning the underlying stock. My guess is that if you're a day trader, you're not interested in owning stocks long term. \n6. Yes. However, the mechanics might be slightly different from stocks.

For example, predicting that Disney will rise to $100 and so we profit $4/share or $400 per contract?\n\nA long call does want the underlying to go above the strike, yes. But it doesn't have to for you to make a profit. If Disney is at $90 when you buy the $96 strike for $3 in premium and Disney upticks a little, your premium could also uptick a little, at the rate specified by delta. Say delta is .40. If Disney goes from $90 to $91, your premium will go from $3 to $3.40 (ignoring all other greeks and IV).\n\n> 5/23\n\nIs that date right? I don't see a 5/23 expiration for DIS. Maybe you meant 5/22?\n\nBy the way, since you are just starting out, I'd strongly recommend you stick with monthly expirations. You'll get better liquidity and tigther bid/ask spreads. 5/22 is a weekly expiration.\n\n> 3) Regarding the contract price at $9 each, do we ALWAYS want to buy it at the lowest possible price, just like stocks?\n\nNot exactly. You have to consider three different factors: 1) moneyness, 2) expiration, 3) greeks/IV.\n\nMoneyness is how far you are from the current market price of the underlying and in which direction. If your strike is on the favorable side, you are in them money (ITM). If your strike is on the unfavorable side, you are out of the money (OTM). Which direction is favorable depends on whether it is a put or a call. Let's stick with calls for now, since puts are just the inverse. In the example above, if Disney is at $90, a $96 strike is OTM and an $86 strike is ITM.\n\nThink of expiration at the deadline by which you need to make a decision about the trade -- before expiration, you must either close it, roll/adjust it, or (if it is long) exercise it. You can also let it expire, but that's a max loss situation that you should only do if every other alternative is worse.\n\nGreeks and IV are best studied in depth on your own, would take pages to explain here. You can start here: https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/\n\nSo now with all that background, you need to consider what strategy you are trading. Are you trading delta? Theta? Volatility? Each of those strategies has a different optimal entry and exit price.\n\nAs an example, in the long call strategy example of $96 calls on Disney that are OTM, you might want to optimize for delta per dollar of premium cost. You basically want as much delta as you can get, with the lowest cost. You also want to consider IV and enter with IV as low as possible and less than 50% in any case.\n\n> 4) What factors would affect the contract price?\n\nAlready described above.\n\n> 5) Options seem to come with 2 choices - closing a position and exercising/lapsing. Would closing a position in this case mean selling off the contracts? In what case do we want to close a position instead of exercising our contracts?\n\nIn the case of a long position, yes, you \"sell to close.\" (Almost) never exercise should be your starting assumption. For now, consider exercise as a Plan B type situation because Plan A failed. Just don't let Plan A fail. A Plan A success is closing the position for a profit before expiration.\n\n> 6) Are there S/L techniques when it comes to options?\n\nEssentially, no. Instead, you can use an option strategy that is defined risk. If things go wrong, your liability is capped. One such strategy is a [vertical spread](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/long-call-spread/).\n\n> 7) Coming from day trading, a trading plan seems pretty straightforward, for example with 5% max risk every trade and 1% max risk on the account. Can I apply the same concept to options? Meaning if I see a 5% loss on that options, would bailing out be too premature?\n\nAbsolutely, but what the 5% and 1% are based on may be different. Personally, no trade I open represents more than 5% total liability against my total account value, but other people use a percentage of buying power instead.\n\nAs for an exit strategy for loss, it depends on the option strategy. For example, for a long call I might exit at 25% of max loss, but for a short call spread, I might exit at 100% of premium collected.\n\n------------------------------\n\nI suggest reading everything on this site and memorizing the Options Basics section: https://www.optionsplaybook.com/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["dis"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I should add that my long reply is with respect to \"normal\" options trading.

{"title": "DD for Y'all", "selftext": "Alrighty retards, growing complaints over a lack of DD in this sub has made me determined to make WSB good enough again. Buncha half senders over at r/Investing don't want it cuz they can't get their PP hard so you guys will benefit from my work instead of them. Y'all said you want investing ideas so I will list tickers and reasons to pursue.\n\nHere's the deal, while Covid-19 has laid absolute pipe to most of the market, there are a few industries that will benefit from it:\n\n**Retail/Wholesale:**\n\nTickers: BJ, WMT, KR, COST, HD, AMZN\n\nShopping has now become a weighing of risk for consumers. They want to make one stop to get their groceries, razors, and paint so they can pretend to be *White People Renovating Houses*. Foot traffic in these stores has either remained constant or slightly increased, however, their online traffic has significantly increased. For grocery, the margins for online are quite low, but it drives the sale of other items and keeps cash flow that generates value.\n\nKR: Consistently beats EPS estimates. [Here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/kr/earnings). Likely to do it again.\n\nBJs is an aging retailer that will eventually eat shit but for now its going to do well, people will flock to companies that are beating on earnings so it is a safe(r) bet.\n\nWMT has seen a pretty significant price increase as of late, so if you are looking for those huge returns you are not going to find them there, but they are a safe growth bet in the long term and really showed their ability to handle crisis with the way they handled everything.\n\nHD is definitely one of the best stocks to buy right now IMO. They are down quite a bit from the beginning of the virus, but are likely to beat on earnings and have seen an increase in traffic. This is likely due to the DIY Karens of the world who have decided to put on their safety glasses and tool belts and redo their bathrooms, paint every room that has a color on its walls and tell their husbands to go out and make their lawn the best it can be this year because they can't stand to see their family sit around and not do something to benefit them in return for all their dish washing. We salute you Karen and that new $500 Kenmore from Home Depot will definitely not take just as much time for you to load and unload you gullible sloot.\n\nAMZN: Kinda a tricky one to be honest, while they are obviously doing well from the fact that when it comes to buying just about anything online and having your wife's boyfriend put it on your front doorstep, it was likely he drives a navy van with a weird smile on the side. But there are other aspects to look at too, the death of the USPS appears imminent, with Trump poised to do what appears to be nothing to protect them from ceasing to exist. There's a window of opportunity for them. But, IMO I would back off for now because their price has already mooned, outpacing their growth and making it overbought and overvalued. Set an alert at $1,900-2,000 and buy then. Just keep in the back of your mind that they are likely to face their biggest challenge of their existence in the next few years, which could either be that  a) they become too big and have a tough time getting any bigger. Or b) the government does what its supposed to and steps in, saying they've let the monopoly go on long enough and that AMZN needs to be broken up.\n\nOverall, consumers are still shopping for what they need, and these stores have it. Trade earnings swings, or find a good price and lock it for a few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Food Service:**\n\nYou've probably seen this yourself if you've pulled up to Starbucks to get anally pounded by the skinny white hippy dude of choice, or if you went to McDonald's just to know what it feels like to not eat at home. Well, you're just one of many who have visited a fast food place and waited an insanely long time just to get a cup that you can pour out and put your booze in so no one knows you're getting hammered 30 minutes after waking up at 11:30. While business at some of these places hasn't necessarily increased, just moved to the drive through, some places that don't normally see a lot of window traffic have picked up. These companies are likely to do well over the next year or so.\n\nSBUX, MCD, CMG, WEN, DPZ, YUM, GRUB, UBER,\n\nSBUX: will run up and beat on earnings, then is likely to sell off a bit. Trade it how you want but they have a bright future ahead either way.\n\nMCD/WEN: have shown the ability to innovate and grow despite size, GrubHub delivery and packed drive thrus they are another that will be benefiting from all the unlucky husbands who have useless wives that can't cook for shit.\n\nDPZ: rallied hard the past few weeks, solid future potential, wait for the right price.\n\nYUM: For the families who have bumshit wives that can't cook or are of a certain race in which their dad might\n\nGRUB/UBER: both of these have seen tremendous popularity while everyone is stuck indoors, now that the anxiety has worn off and people are comfortable again, but still not able to go and eat out these have been the choice. Buy all you can at a comfortable price, these are here to stay.\n\nTo wrap up, I'll waste my time and try to tell you this: don't be an idiot. Take the 10% and move on. Don't YOLO AAL calls, don't try to buy a friggin oil tanker, don't buy AMZN puts. Just relax, stick to what you know will happen, and aim to get out of this with a profit of any size.
