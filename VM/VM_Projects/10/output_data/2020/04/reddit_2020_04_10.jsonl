{"title": "Stocks have never been more overvalued. -ZH", "selftext": "Two weeks after the Fed stunned markets by doing something not even  Ben  Bernanke dared to do, start buying investment grade corporate bonds,   today the Fed's nationalization of the entire bond market was complete   when the Fed - with the blessing of the Treasury - threw the kitchen   sink at the most vulnerable verticals of the bond market - junk bonds,   munis and CLOs and... waved it in. And with that the only thing missing   from the Fed's total takeover of capital markets is equities, which the   Fed will start buying after the next crash.\n\nUntil  we wait here is a complete summary of everything the Fed  announced  this morning, when it released the details of the $2.3  trillion in  loans and purchases to \"support the ~~billionaires~~ economy\", which will consist of:\n\n1. Main Street Lending Program,\n2. Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility,\n3. New Municipal Liquidity Facility,\n4. Expansion of existing primary and secondary corporate bond buying facilities.\n\nThese  Fed's loans and facilities are based on the additional  capital the  Treasury has made available under the CARES Act (see below).  **Of  the total $454bn that Congress appropriated to backstop Fed   facilities, this morning\u2019s announcements commits $195bn, leaving the   majority of funds available for other purposes - like stocks - or to   expand these programs if necessary.** That said, the programs the   Fed announced this morning cover essentially all of the areas in which   we have expected the Fed to act, so we do not expect the Fed to  announce  any further facilities for the time being.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, two  days ago, when a platoon of clueless CNBC hacks said that stocks were  extremely undervalued, and must be bought (on their fundamentals, not  because the Fed was about to nationalize the entire bond market and is  set to start buying equity ETFs in the next crash), we showed just how  \"undervalued\" the market was.\n\nThat's  when Credit Suisse chief equity strategist Jonathan Golub - usually one  of the most bullish Wall Streeters - published a chart showing that any  \"temporary\" cheapness in stocks hit in late March was long gone for the  simple reason that forward earnings have plunged. As a result, as of  noon on March 7, when the S&P 500 had risen as much as 22% from  March 23 lows, forward stock multiples had surged right back 19.0x.\n\nWhy is this notable? Because as Golub wrote, \"this is the same level the S&P500 held on Feb 19, the all-time high.\"\n\nIn other words, at the start of the week stocks were valued the same as they were at the February all time high\u2026\n\nFast  forward to today when the Fed's latest \"shock and awe\" nuclear bomb  announcement which included purchases of junk bond ETFs and muni debt -  and by implication terminally disonnects risk prices from any  fundamental values and instead only the size of the Fed's balance sheet  matters - sent the S&P as high as 2,818. And, in doing so, the  forward PE multiple on the S&P has risen from the record 19.0x  reached in February to a new all time high of 19.4x.\n\nIn other words, the market has never been more overvalued than it is right now.\n\nThat's not all.\n\nAs  Golub writes today, \"we\u2019ve expanded this analysis to cover sectors and  sub-groups. Multiples for cyclical groups (Energy, Materials,  Industrials, Discretionary, Financials) have surpassed prior P/Es.  Valuations for defensive sectors (Staples, Utilities, Health Care,  REITs) as well as Tech and Communications remain below Feb 19 levels.\"\n\nSo  congratulations Jerome Powell: you have succeeded in the impossible -  with the US economy entering a depression, with US GDP set to plunge as  much as 50%, with US unemployment already 15% and set to hit 20% or  more, the Fed chair has single-handedly disconnected stocks from all  fundamental anchors and made the S&P the most overvalued in history  as its forward P/E hits the highest number ever recorded.\n\nFinally as Mercutio McG (@JAMcGinley), noted so poignantly,  ***\"if  the market gets back to ATHs while we are shutdown, it only proves  the  bears right. That the whole thing was a giant Fed fueled ponzi.\"***", "id": "fy4azs", "created_utc": 1586479008.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "SPY 69p", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "4/17", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16330218315124512}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11028169840574265}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09516696631908417}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1184956505894661}, {"body": "one of these times you bears will be right.  what happened to that guy with 15 lines on his chart saying the drop was starting on tuesday?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2463003695011139}, {"body": "Ok", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.052076827734708786}, {"body": "Quit posting articles without crediting the source.

{"title": "Template of public perception during a market bubble/crash", "selftext": "A couple days ago I  posted explaining how I'd used a crash bubble template to forecast the price moves of March. [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fx6pxg/prep\\_the\\_puts\\_largest\\_ever\\_point\\_stocks\\_drop\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fx6pxg/prep_the_puts_largest_ever_point_stocks_drop_is/)\n\nIn this post we're going to look at how I  used the same sort of thing to also  forecast the public sentiment and (to some extent) news events. I will be quoting from a piece I wrote in January. Before people jump on me for it, I know I never had a Reddit account in Jan. Other places let you post there too. \n\nIronically most of my posts got deleted and I got banned from most groups around the 17th of Feb.  Suggesting the market could break the 2019 low then was not allowed.  Now if you say it, you're just part of a bandwagon.  Hard to win with people. I prefer markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notu5s3o00s41.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c28ccd92809083dbd04b3d8ce9278f9e7228727\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I first posted this, I thought we were at the \"Naive value\" stage. I was seeing far too many people who obviously were risk  averse being duped  into buying index funds at the high and thinking they had low volatility risk. The amount of education they were getting was, \"I got in last year and made 30%! Get in right now\". \n\nAll through Dec, Jan and Feb we seen this hit crazy levels. The kids creating content on TSLA going to $7,000 in January ... remember that?  \n\nQuote; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmkrb2de10s41.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb88687c1a928dc2076d4f58675541f175afdd5\n\nIn a very large context since the rally from 2008 a over inflated bubble has been on the cards if we presume the 2000 and 2008 crashes to be the formation of the early bear trap part of the cycle.  This means the enthusiasm, public, greed  and delusion stages are around 2013,  2016, 2018 and 2020.  Near the end of the bubble top there  should be some new reason  price can sustain the unsustainable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuote; \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3y3omuw10s41.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2beafeeeec5b2fd15b3d00bc76627a2aef60280\n\nWe seen this  in early 2020. People legit thought when the Fed injected some cash into the market in January we were going to bull all 2020 (and beyond).  Not many would like to admit just how bullish they actually were only two short months ago. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuote; \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2uhkkzt420s41.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=90a783f8ac4fc4c948045d2f822052495ebdb6ef\n\nIn the cycle, the \"New paradigm\" gives  way to the \"Shock  sell\" part of the cycle. So things should look a bit sketchy and then all of sudden (unexpectedly, apparently) there will be a crash relative to recent price action. \n\nQuote; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3ah5lef20s41.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=b47120a896a513f9ca3385b0370c7e847be07b38\n\nThe \"Shock sell\" stage is also known  as the \"Denial\"  stage.  In March, 2020, literally about a quarter of the world just stopped and people seriously still thought the market was still a buy. Can you think of a better more  apt example of denial?  As I said in the forecast, I think this was the big players cashing in on the noobs. The smarts exit. What did we see in the news at the time? Yeah! All the congress stock selling.  Other market players they do not report on made egregious sums of money at this point. \n\nThe shock sell becomes the bull trap. After price starts to rally everyone starts to talk about the bigger dip. Dollar cost averaging. Blah blah. Same same. That all happened.  Now, as my previous forecasts here have said,  I think  we're at the top of the bull trap  and the next stages are  coming into play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuote; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex36pixc30s41.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad1042136bfad40ab0d01c564af9be865a4f50c0\n\nDuring the next rounds of falling the market  (as per template) would sell off phenomenally strong.  The move would be at least double what the March drop is.  It will be ruthless. Just seem to go on and on and on.  The last part of the move will come in a brutal rush into new lows - negative headlines will be screaming in the news. We'll have seen one of the worst single days ever, and when  people finally puke it - the smarts will buy their positions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter close study of markets over most of my life, I've come to think the markets are nothing more than a huge poker game where the amount of extra information you have over the other players determines if you can take all their chips or not.  I think this game has rules and structure, and they are not the ones CNN tell you. \n\nI've been in the markets a while and  I've watched the type of investors we have coming in evolve. The used to  be a feeling markets could make you money but you  had to be shroud and diligent. There was respect for risk control and many people understood this was worth paying for. Now, you're a fool if your not risking everything just so you get that sweet low ETF fee, baby.  Only cost you  30% in March. Bargain. \n\nI cast my eye over the table now and I see  far too many people who are \"all in\" the markets and have been convinced that their best chance of success to make their all in bet without looking at their cards.  They've become complacent and cocky, but I think in  the not too distant future the stronger hands are going to make a play against them. Then they'll learn the game they play. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuote; \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1hlmpjy40s41.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c96659d7ef8defc74e0dbd9af99c5131a5b859\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know some people will be reading this and their head screaming, \"But the virus.... the lock downs .... THE FED, GODDAMMIT!\"  - and  I do agree with you  this should not work.  I just do not ignore something actually working. In Dec/Jan the template would make this type of  forecast, and in March and April we seen this type of action.  So from here the template would predict huge crash probably sometime in June/July. \n\nWhen it happens, it will be really easy.  Since nothing is easy in the markets before this happens it's going to do multiple things to make put options lose. The key weapon in this (after the bull trap) is going to be ranging weeks (I guess). The market will look like it's going to sell but it will go sideways for long enough to screw everything up for puts. \n\nSince this can happen, there is a lot of benefit in having a forward looking plan.  If we take this template and extrapolate it to the current 2020 markets it suggests once we make a break of the lows once the drop starts it is going to enormous. This means we do not have to take risk too early. Shelve that FOMO. It serves you not.\n\nWhen the real drop starts the market will be dropping easily 5 - 10% a day (maybe gapping off circuit breakers).  During these times we can go for jackpot short term expiry options.  In the next couple weeks I do not think they''ll be too good an idea. They will look tempting if we fall next week - but I'd be cautious until we see some range time traps.  \n\nRemember the bear is a hibernating creature.", "id": "fyh6vc", "created_utc": 1586530220.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "/u/2020sbear Your account is 17 days old.

{"title": "For Consideration : April/June $SPY Calendar Put Spread", "selftext": "  \n\nCan I run this Calendar Put Spread by you?  \n \n\nBackground :\n\nCOVID-19 is widely recognized as the initiator of some of the wildest trading sessions in history. Three to four percent intraday moves of the $SPY have become common place by historical standards. The $SPY hit its all-time high of 339 in February, 2020, has plunged to 218, and is now around 278. The $VIX has gone from \\~13 to \\~85 and still sits in the lower to mid 40s. Still insanely high, this show is in the early plot formation stage.  \n \n\nThe consensus is that the Markets, and our lives, will not realistically begin a return to some semblance of normalcy until a vaccine and therapeutic treatments are developed and accessible to the general population. It appears that this state is a good 12 Months away. In the meantime, volatility is expected to be elevated.  \n \n\nTo the Charts:\n\nI didn\u2019t pull the $SPY time-series to get the exact numbers, but the ten year time series of $SPY in relationship with the $VIX and $SPY Volume, shows the following periods of elevated Volatility in:\n\n* May 2010,\n* September 2011,\n* September 2015,\n* December 2018, and\n* our current situation which began in February of 2020.  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0oafhfe5w0s41.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=958e5a298a8a50c02c1ad6709ce904036abaeeca\n\nNote the spikes in volume and their relationships with the $SPY$ and $VIX. In 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2018, the Volume increased, not exactly, but with a noticeable proportional relationship to the increases in the $VIX and inversely proportional to the value of the $SPY. But, a close look at the most recent values for Volume seem to indicate that the Current spikes in volume are markedly less than those incurred in the above noted previous pull-backs, especially when you consider the size of the Market moves. I believe that\u2019s the effect of JPow and His BRRRRRRT! Machine.   \n \n\nMany an account has been depleted going against the Fed, but I find it impossible to believe that we have hit bottom with respect to the $SPY. It\u2019s not just the volume, we are still figuring out the mortality rates for COVID, nevermind the economic impacts, the supply chains, political unrest, and . . . EARNINGS, which are just coming up.   \n \n\nMy thesis is that the recent pull-back was the first response to COVID and though the Fed has promised infinite money, even the promise of infinite money in the US Markets is not enough to paper over an already wildly over-valued Market laden with hidden debt bombs that are being uncovered. That, coupled with existential fear of dying from taking a breath in a grocery store will drive the economy well below 2008/09 levels.  \n \n\nThe Position :\n\nI am a skittish trader as it is. Just started selling Premium last Fall and YOLOing money is not part of my character. However, this appears to be an opportunity.  \n \n\nThinking of an Apr 24/June 19 Calendar Put Spread @$300.   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwlb4be9w0s41.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf9d603acd4cc940ca4e7c4bb1d8b561b0177308\n\n  \nThe best case being the Apr 24 Put sold will expire with $SPY < \\~276, leaving me with relatively cheap $SPY Puts at a $300 strike, already ITM with nearly two months to go. Bonus being that even if $SPY goes up, I\u2019m still in the green to $SPY 320 and the further $SPY drops, the better.\n\nBest Case:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hvgs6edw0s41.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=536d93acc898cec949da9cd136982cae5cbde05c\n\nMy strategy is to hold until the front-month expires and then extract as much value from the June 19th Puts as I am comfortable with, which would have me bailing at about SPY 210, depending on the body-count and Market sentiment \u2013 YUGE gains by my standards.\n\nSo yes, you can see by now that I am a Noob. Serious Noob tho, selling premium from December 2019 until the recent March plunge. I like selling Premium, it fits my comfort zone. Got out out in time though, only lost $5k of $35k account, but still a damn Noob. Lulz, whad-a-ya think?\n\n\n\nEDIT:  Thanks everyone, I learned a lot.

Read what I said about selling premium in the VIX futures market and check out the images I uploaded in the other thread you found me in, ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fykbwu/non\\_directional\\_strategies\\_in\\_a\\_volatile\\_market/fn0lx1q?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fykbwu/non_directional_strategies_in_a_volatile_market/fn0lx1q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)) specifically the images regarding contango/backwardation, as that form of selling premium can work in SPY options as well... VIX is simply the level of IV in the SPX options chain after all. The idea that you can own time in one part of a futures curve, and sell it another part of that curve where it is relatively more expensive, is important to understand in this form of trading.\n\nAnd back to your thesis, which sounds inherently bearish to me... there is no reason you can't make this a directional bet by selling the near dated option at a different strike than where you own the longer dated position.\n\nBut either way, whether or not you keep the spread purely horizontal, you want to make your risk profile here as close to a win/breakeven proposition as possible, instead of a win/lose one, so see if you can follow what I'm saying below. Understanding this will help you time a potential exit in this high IV environment.\n\nSo if we're doing this closer to my playbook, I'm fine with the dates you chose, but I'd actually switch you over to the call side of the table. The bid on the April 24th SPY 278c was 8.59 at close yesterday and I see a healthy volume of 1.91k contracts for that day. You could have sold that and bought the June 19th 278c for 14.21, for a net debit of 5.62.\n\nThen if your thesis is right, and we see all out panic in the markets, VIX will shoot up, and the IV in your contracts will go through the roof on both sides of your trade. This will be to your benefit, as both legs of this horizontal trade will have the same delta, but there is more time that can increase in value on the long side of your calendar spread. Edit: \\*An important thing to understand here is why many experts recommend closing this type of trade at fixed level of profitability, say 10-50% depending on your risk tolerance. It's not because these trades cannot be more profitable than that range, but rather because of how fleeting moments of panic such as this are by nature. \n\nIf you end up being wrong, you take your cue as to when to exit the position from the markets- keep an eye on the VIX futures curve and when it starts to leave backwardation and move towards contango, you'll know your ship is about to sink. You'll see some red numbers undoubtedly but exiting then will save you from the real pain of exiting once contango has fully taken hold of the VIX futures market and the IV in the SPY chain has evaporated. I might also take this cue as a sign to reverse course, and to do that you could easily just buy back the short leg and stay long riding the wave up with your June call... timing all this is way harder than I might be making it sound...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I like it.\n\nJust got back from a drive and was thinking about what you mentioned regarding the VIX in the other thread, and it got me thinking about the fixed expiry date because VIX follows the European model.

Fed bought us time until we have a vaccine now if the vaccine comes in the next 3-4 months we will be fine otherwise we will go through all the motion of recession if the vaccine take 18 months as predicted by many (Bill Gates, Former FDA). \n\nThis also align well with the November election cycle, Trump can keep the market propped up until ducks come home to roost. \n\nSo why is the market going up?\n\nWithout Fed intervention, we were assuming all of these companies are going to file bankruptcies next month, now that overhang is removed there is sense of relief and sugar high (fed printing high). \n\nLook at the biggest rallies all of these companies were assumed to be going bankrupt next month now they have liquidity problems solved for the next 6-9 months. \n\nAll the quality stocks like AAPL were laggards in this rally compare to this overleveraged garbage. \n\nHere is a relevant video \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qoaTItTsfM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qoaTItTsfM)\n\nI fully believe what the Fed did was the right thing to do (maybe not for bears, including me) \n\nHere is a great comment explaining what the Fed did and its effects \n\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22827276](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22827276)\n\nI am not the one for market prediction since it's nearly impossible but mostly likely it trade sideways with good amount of volatility and overshoot to both upside and downside (SPY 240 - 300) until we see really economic fallout or vaccine which overcome first.", "id": "fy60yt", "created_utc": 1586484706.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Yea I've been on board with everything you stated.

{"title": "Why you should be a Bear and a Bull in this Market", "selftext": "Real talk. I was one of those guys buying into the whole \"diamond hands\" when it comes to puts. Yes, at the time it may have seemed like a great idea and all, but we know that all of our investments turned to absolute shit. The game-plan now is to not bet against the fed; I don't need any advanced charts to predict what I'm saying or have any evidence backing up what comes to pass. But, I will tell you this. In the short term, calls are going to be the way to go. Forget anything you ever thought about markets or how they move on mathematical lines and shit, this case is absolutely different. The FED is propping up the economy for the time being. Buying into short term puts now is suicide, literally. We have never seen the FED print so much damn money that even the idea that the economy can suddenly re-implode is nothing but a pipe dream now, at least for the time being. A huge downturn is just not going to happen. All earnings reports, unemployment figures, mean nothing. \n\nWhy? Because ***companies can blame it on the beer virus.*** As long as this virus remains a huge public concern, which it will at least in the month of April, possibly May, stonks will go up. Forget your bullshit TAs saying this shit will go down anytime soon, because they're only partially right. Yes, the stonk market will go down, but only when Q3 happens. Q3 is going to be the defining moment where we see companies live or die (If the world economy, specifically the US economy, reopens). \n\nWhy? When the US economy opens back up in May or June, earnings reports are going to either go up or go down, if they are near or above projections, stonks go up. If earnings are lower or near lower than expected, stonks go down. I don't expect you retards to know this, but I am telling you now. ***The market will return back to normal once the dust has cleared.*** Powell clearly stated in his Q&A yesterday that the FED will relax policies once they see the US economy recovering. If we open the economy, that is where the real figures start to pour in. We are currently in a fake pumped up economy and the lower the earnings reports are in Q3, the more stonks will go down. The more the FED does not have to intervene, the lower stonks will go up and will eventually go down; that's only if companies are earning more than expected. If they are doing poorly than expected, stonks will go down. You will expect a huge crash in some companies when their earnings reports don't match projections.  ***The FED is responsible for crushing your puts. Watch their actions and watch them closely. Put yourself in the FED's position and ask yourself \"Wow yeah this seems like a great idea to continue what we have never done before, or should we turn back the dial?\"***\n\nTake this day by day. Only keep your calls/puts if you were to buy into them again today. Don't hold at -95% because you think the next big drop is going to happen. Play it smart, win, lose, and learn. That's the name of the game; people get burned; and so will you; just learn from your mistakes and don't get burned as hard as all of those other guys bag holding their puts. \n\nTLDR: Stonks will go up as long as the FED pumps money into the economy like we have never seen. When they start to relax, that means it is time to buy some puts, some calls. If you want to buy puts, remember some of the companies who benefited from this quarantine. If you want to buy calls, remember the companies that were severely (and negatively) affected by it. \n\nPositions: \n\nShort term: SPY 289 C 4/17\n\nLong term: DAL 30 C 1/15 add any severely down travel and hotel stonk you can find and you're solid.

In other words, 0% lockdown, necessitates maximum economic output, but 100 % second wave infections, which causes lockdown to be 100%.  This is the fundamental principle that are trading thesis is structured around.\n\nWe know that everyone wants the lockdown to be lifted.  But what is the new normal in this environment.

But if we lift lockdowns, there's a high chance of reinfection like in HK/Singapore/China.  Therefore if these lockdowns are lifted, stagger in puts as reinfection probability increases dramatically.\n\nHowever, if S1-S2 aren't lifted, the US will need unlimited QE, to fund cashflow in the economy, or risk a string of financial crisis.

{"title": "How WSB is bailing out billionaires and hedge funds.", "selftext": "Let's keep it simple - the FED is providing assets to avoid a liquidity crisis.  Their most recent announcement that they'll be facilitating purchase of below investment grade corporate bonds (also called junk bonds) was expected...although it came much faster than it should have.\n\nWho holds below investment grade corporate bonds? Many 'companies' and now pension funds (as mass downgrades are coming).\n\nStarting with giant Pension Funds - these have ridiculous required returns (usually 7% or above) which makes them take in high risk assets like crappy corporate bonds.  Why do they have these required returns? They need to stay well funded to keep paying out, it's just math (based on the crappy initial funding which was decided on by  some 'intelligent' CEO/leader).  These 'leaders' decided to structure them this way to entice people to work for their organization.  Dandy, except for the whole high risk part.\n\nTaking a look at the 'companies' - simply put if you roll them back to the final holding company it usually as a few shareholders (billionaires) or is a hedge fund.\n\nSo why is the FED intervening on behalf of hedge funds and billionaires? That should be obvious.\n\nNow lets take a break and look at what happens if the FED wouldn't intervene.  Pension Funds have to dump junk bonds or are left holding the bag. AND crappy companies go bankrupt.  This can be called austerity.  Very scary media stuff.  But what actually happens if we allow crappy companies to go bankrupt...the poor employees who are invested in the company actually own more of it.  That's not a bad thing, go bankrupt, employees own more, actually rebuild the company after firing the crappy leadership that put them in this situation in the first place.  \n\nNow to you WSB.  Yes, you're right that your puts should have printed...the economy is heading to the toilet...your sweet $ went directly to the counter party you agreed to pay if you were wrong...guess what that counter party is likely a hedge fund/ultra wealthy person who knew the FED would step in.  We can choose to ignore the fact that BlackRock had a conversation with the government and then were allocated $500B to spend on investment grade corporate bonds including buying their own ETF.  How would like to be given $ to 'save the economy' and instead you just buy a Tesla? Well the media would say that you did your job, some factory worker is getting paid to make you the Tesla but nevermind that it only cost the American Economy $500B to buy a Tesla (aka billionaire spending, trickle down bs).\n\nTl;dr\n\nYour puts are going to hedge funds and billionairs that know the government is bailing them out specifically and sticking the tab to the American people and economy.\n\nPS. When the FED buys junk bonds to keep crappy companies afloat to keep the ultra wealthy (who own a lot of these crappy bonds) happy you create Zombie companies.  Zombie companies are essentially really shitty companies that suck at what they do and provide really little value to the economy but are subsidized by the people.
