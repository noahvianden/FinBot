{"title": "For Trading April 3rd", "selftext": "For Trading April 3rd\n \nOil Recovery\n \nTrading the Range\n \nJobless Claims Double\n \n \nToday was pretty constructive in that we opened lower with the futures and of course the blockbuster news of Mr. Trumps tweet (which I find not believable) about and Oil deal between Russia and the Saudi\u2019s, that sent us up to the high of the day +534, before we has some sideways action until around 1:15 when we started to sell-off and headed back to down on the day to -90 before we rallied and finished +469.93 (2.24%), NASDAQ +126.73 (1.72%), S&P 500 +56.40 (2.28%), the Russell +13.81 (1.29%) and the DJ Transports +93.13 (1.27%).  There was plenty of news to start the day with Initial Jobless claims that were double the prior number at an astounding 6.6million.  Unfortunately, the number next month will be higher.  Tomorrow, we have the monthly employment number for March as well as the ISM non-manufacturing pre-open.  I regarded today\u2019s market action as very constructive.  The lower open and then rally and a second round-trip to a close near the highs was impressive.  While there is still plenty of work to be done, plenty of bad news on the economy and COVID-19 to come, we seem to be building some underlying support.  Market internals were positive but unimpressive with gains outnumbering losers by 1.4:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ.  Volume was also lower that I would have liked to have seen.  On the DJIA there were 25 gainers to 5 losers with BA -50, UTX -36, and WBA-18DPs, while the gainers were led by CVX +50, PG and CAT +36 and MMM+32 DPs.  \n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 800 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: Walgreen reported earnings today and although they had better than expected numbers, they gave less than stellar guidance and the stock fell to a lower low than the March bottom and made a new low close since 2013.  WBA fell to $39.41 and closed $40.32 -2.71 (6.3%).  We used the decline to buy some CVS calls, which has been consolidating and has outperformed its competitor.  Shopify suspended its guidance and the stock, another darling that was priced for perfection got slammed.  The stock, up from $20 in 2016 topped out over $593 in February had fallen to 303 last month but climbed back to $470 last week fell to $334.55 before closing 346.30 -38.37 (9.97%).\n \nAnd last, the Disaster Du Jour was Luckin Coffee (LK), the Chinese Starbucks, sort of.  The stock spent 7 months between $15 and $25 before taking off on a run from $18 to over $50 late last year.  It fell back to $28 but had traded up to $43 last month before starting down and closing just above $26 yesterday.  Unfortunately, the COO was found to have basically fabricated all of the results since Q2.  Muddy Waters wrote up the company on 1/31 saying it had \u201cevolved into a fraud.\u201d\nThe stock gapped down to open $4.92, rallied back to $10.58 buy gave up the gains and finished $6.40 -19.80 (75.57%).  Clearly a disaster on any day.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +11.20, ABBV +1.08, REGN +1.35, ISRG +8.74, MYL -.23, TEVA -.35, VRTX +16.68 (7.4%), BHC M+.10, INCY +4.32 (5.82%), ICPT +.89, LABU +1.98(10.42%) and IBB $108.69 +4.90 (4.72%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY +.25, CGC +.29, CRON +.14, GWPH -.50, ACB +.04, PYX -.37 (13.26%), NBEV -.04, CURLF +.08, KERN +.04 and MJ $10.77 +.21 (1.99%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +14.98 (4.43%), RTN -3.93, GD +.35, TXT +.07, UTX -5.37 (5.88%), NPOC +7.30, BWXT +2.24, TDY +14.50 (5.23%) and ITA $136.94 +.47 (.34%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.01, JWN -.13, KSS -1.12 (8.66%), DDS -2.29 (8.20%), JCP -.02, WMT +4.36 (3.82%), TGT -.97, TJX -.77, RL +.28, UAA -.42 (5.08%), LULU +2.08, TPR +.04, CPRI -.69, and XRT $27.64 -.39 (1.39%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +14.90, AMZN +8.80, AAPL +2.99, FB -1.80, NFLX +3.92, NVDA +11.06, IBM +4.31, TSLA +53.44, BABA +.89, BIDU +1.12, BA -6.32, CAT +5.06, DIS +1.18 and XLK $78.33 +1.79 (2.34%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +5.21, JPM +3.02, BAC +.68, MS +2.14, C +.50, PNC +3.38, AIG -.20, TRV +3.79, AXP -1.14, and XLF $20.04 +.49 (2.51%).\n \n \nOIL, $25.32 +5.01. The explosive move in Oil today was spurred on by an early morning tweet from Mr. Trump claiming that Russia and the Saudi\u2019s were close to an agreement.  My first thought was BS, but the market held and finished strong.  My only warning is that we have had several of these spikes that have failed with news that we knew was real.  The stocks were stronger across the board with CVX the big winner +7.56 (11.03%) and added 50 DPs.  XOM +3.12 (8.13%), OXY +2.05 (19%), OAS +.06, NBL +.47 (8%), MRO +.33, MPC +.58, RIG +.02, APA +.68 (16.92%), BP +1.80 (7.38%) and XLE $30.15 +2.53 (9.16%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,637.70 +46.30. After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 and have fallen back.  Today\u2019s rebound is of little technical value.  I will reassess and look for a new entry point.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $6,865 +655. After we traded in another short-range day yesterday we had a range of over $1000 today, closing about midrange. While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.72 +1.22 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM", "id": "ftyoaf", "created_utc": 1585876145.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "I gotta wonder if day trading algorithms are automatically reading trump\u2019s tweets at light speed and taking them as absolute fact.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "If by absolute fact you mean taking the information and executing certain plays accordingly, then probably, yes", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3437874913215637}, {"body": "They are", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21387873589992523}, {"body": "Who cares...

{"title": "When close to expiry with an OTM debit spread (to expire worthless), is it smart to sell long leg and keep short leg open?", "selftext": "Of course, this is essentially maximizing risk but given the theta decay of an OTM as time converges to expiration, theoretically would it be smart to take a profit on the long leg where the probably of the short leg going ITM is <10%?\n\nFor example, I have a $BA 4/17 $200/$210 debit call spread, where my max loss is $18 (the debit).

Bad scenario, the stock stays above 35$ you keep holding hoping to collect as much premium as possible and something happens down the road and the company tanks ( maybe you didn't buy a short put over ER date and they have a terrible report) the stock drops and you are in a position to pay alot to buy out the contract or you get assigned the shares.

You can play the wheel strategy and probably take some more time to get back to break even. \n\nYou would most likely would be better off waiting until the market stabilized and just buying 3500$ worth of shares in an ETF that tracks a major index. And I mean better off than your best case scenario. \n\nIf you like AMD and want to write puts then I suggest short puts. Just keep writing short puts and if you get assigned then write covered calls (wheel strategy like you said).

All of these numbers were bigger than expected, with broad layoffs in all industries and sectors.\nGlobal stock markets are relatively calm compared to other Friday\u2019s during this crises. In Asia, Japan and South Korea finished almost neutral, while China was slightly down, -0.5%.\nEurope started in the red over 1%, but as trading has continued at this time 8 30AM ET, they have recovered some of their losses. British FTSE is down 0.5%, French CAC down 0.2%, while the German DAX has turned positive +0.4%.\nThe US futures have followed the global markets, going down around 1% in the early hours of the morning and regaining some of these losses after European trading started. At this time they are down around 0.5%, after being positive for a couple of minutes around 8AM.\nThe coronavirus outbreak is still spreading and the US is contributing the most to the new case count.

It also wasn't truly global - there were parties that were relatively whole and who were able to inject liquidity into suffering markets.  That's not true now, especially with oil prices where they are.\n\nThe other element to consider, and which makes this crisis rather unique, is that there is no monetary policy room to deal with it if it lasts much longer.  Yeah, yeah, infinite quantitative easing could certainly happen, but even the fact that this is in play contributes to the uniqueness of this situation.  How easily we forget that QE was originally meant as a last-ditch measure from the great recession.

{"title": "Long Calls PTON - Peloton Earnings Play", "selftext": "Peloton earnings is 5/5. I\u2019m going long and here\u2019s why:\n\n**Part 1: Anecdotal Demand Evidence:** Let\u2019s start with some anecdotal evidence on demand for home gym equipment. Take peek at stock levels for Rogue, Titan, random amazon sellers, etc. Everything is sold out or back ordered 1+ months. For what they do have in stock, shipping is delayed because they have hit their shipping operations capacity. Peloton likely won\u2019t have issues with stock out as they likely build a huge stockpile of inventory for their massive holiday sales season  (228 revenue period ending sept 2019 vs 428 revenue period ended Dec. 2019 \u2013 huge amount of sales at end of year)\n\nDont @ me about people not dropping big cash on gym equipment during a recession. Rogue is sold out of their $7500 monster banshee rack and every other piece of overpriced equipment they sell including the $1000 concept 2 bike they distribute.\n\n[https://www.roguefitness.com/concept-2-erg-package](https://www.roguefitness.com/concept-2-erg-package)\n\n[https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-rm-8-banshee](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-rm-8-banshee)\n\n**TLDR Part 1:** People are loading up on home gym equipment like never before - Uppies\n\n**Part 2: Revenue Conjecture:** Q2 report gave the following guidance for Q3 sales: Peloton said Third-quarter revenue of $470 million to $480. Q3 captures Jan \u2013 March. Sales probably started sky rocketing end of February into March so let\u2019s say they meet their low end target Jan \u2013 Feb and blow past in March by 50%. That puts revenue at $548 million or an increase over expected by 13%. This calculation is pure conjecture but it is supported in a few ways:\n\n* App download 5x normal: [https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555563-peloton-gains-on-report-of-download-spike](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555563-peloton-gains-on-report-of-download-spike)\n* Social media following (Instagram) has a huge spike in march: [https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/onepeloton](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/onepeloton)\n* Deliveries delayed:\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fke06p/long\\_calls\\_on\\_pton/fks95ll/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fke06p/long_calls_on_pton/fks95ll/?context=3)\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnku24/insider\\_sold\\_41m\\_of\\_pton\\_at\\_26\\_instead\\_of\\_buying/fla1o9s/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnku24/insider_sold_41m_of_pton_at_26_instead_of_buying/fla1o9s/?context=3)\n\nDelayed deliveries is key here. If the comments are true on deliveries getting pushed from standard 2 weeks to 6 weeks, they are at 3x capacity, or selling three times as many bikes per day than they expected and hired delivery drivers for.  I doubt they are 3x in every market so I'm not gonna read into that 3x number too much but it is certainly directional on demand increase and points to the fact that my 50% increase for demand in March is probably on the conservative end.\n\n**TLDR Part 2:** Social media following up, app subscribers up, deliveries backed up- points to sales up = stock uppies\n\n**Part 3: Bad News is Good News:** They recently cut tread deliveries which WSB seems to view negatively, but I believe that to be a net positive for *this* earnings report. From my readings of their quarterly reports tread is the lower margin product so all existing delivery resources are now devoted to fulfilling the huge demand on bike deliveries, the higher margin product.\n\n\"Our Connected Fitness Product gross margin decreased slightly for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the increasing mix of deliveries of Tread which currently carry a lower gross margin than our Bike\"- Q2 report\n\nSo same headcount resource cost for delivering, but devoted to delivering huge spike in demand on higher margin product = higher net income.  Its not specifically broken out in the earnings reports, but I don't think tread was ever a huge portion of their revenue to begin with- maybe 15-20%.  Bike is their core product and will completely offset any losses incurred from cancelling tread.\n\nAdditionally, tread deliveries went until about March 18th, so they are really only going to be missing 2 weeks of sales on this report, which could still in theory exceed the tread revenue of the previous report due to higher than expected growth of demand as tread is a fairly new product.\n\n\"As of December\u00a031, 2019, approximately 3% of our Connected Fitness Subscribers owned both a Bike and a Tread\"- Q2 report.\n\nEdit 4/4: The more I think about this tread thing, the more I suspect dropping tread deliveries was not a tough decision for PTON.  Think about the product. Their tread is massive and bulky.  Can probably only fit like 4 of those in the vans they deliver with wheras the bike you can probably fit 10-15 of the bike.  If you have earnings coming up and see a way to blow past your numbers do you want to use 2 headcount resources to deliver 4 low margin products a day or 2 headcount resources to deliver 10-15 high margin products a day.  Its a no brainer, I'm confident in my suspicion that this was a move guided by COVID safety but affirmed by driving revenue.\n\n**TLDR Part 3:** All focus has inadvertently been shifted to higher margin product and will more than offset the 2 week loss in tread sales, uppies\n\n**Part 4: Bonus Uppies:**\n\n* \u201cManufacturing Partner Acquisition - In October 2019, we completed the acquisition of one of our long-time, Taiwan-based bike manufacturing partners, Tonic Fitness Technology, Inc., or Tonic.\u201d \u2013 Q2 report\n\nCost benefits from this acquisition should start hitting the balance sheet this quarter. I\u2019m no expert but I would think that owning your supplier = paying the profit margin on manufacturing to yourself = higher margins on your existing highest margin item (bike) = higher net income. (Not to mention greater control over inventory, quality, scheduling, shipping, etc).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ***\"Launch in Germany -*** In November 2019, we took another important step in our international expansion with the launch of Peloton in Germany. With our entry into Germany, we are in the three largest fitness markets in the world (United States, United Kingdom, and Germany). Germany also marks our first time offering non-English language content to users on our platform courtesy of our new German cycling instructor who has already begun producing classes from our temporary studio in London. To support our sales efforts in Germany, we have opened several retail showrooms across the major metropolitan areas of Germany and began a full-scale national television and digital media campaign in January 2020 to build brand and product awareness. \" -Q2 Report\n\nYeah guess what countries are also largely stuck at home?  Whatever sales PTON projected for UK and Germany when they made the Q2 report are likely blown out of the water.  For reference, the German Peloton instructor is Erik Jager. His IG followers (hauptstadttrainer on IG) are up 13% over the last 14 days and huge spike in March overall.\n\n[https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hauptstadttrainer](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hauptstadttrainer)\n\nWhats a huge driver of Pton instructors following?  People buying PTON bikes and using those workouts.\n\n**TLDR part 4:** Cheaper manufacturing costs on their biggest seller \u2013 stock uppies.  Germany and UK stuck at home - huge incremental unforseen demand opportunity on top of what they projected for international.\n\n**TLDR in summary:** To me all signs point to beating revenue expectations by a double digit %.
