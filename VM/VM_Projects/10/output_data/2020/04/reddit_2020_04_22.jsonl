Most Americans at the moment are working from home or not working and at home. \n\n3. Facebook owns Instagram, WhatsApp and other companies. All companies based on apps or websites. \n\n4.

Finally, Covid is pushing all the late adopters to the digital space (even micro breweries, dispensaries, liquor stores, mom and pop knitting stores). From 2016-2019, big companies like Walmart, etc were finally spending some modicum of time trying to catch up to (albeit way too late) competitors like Amazon, etc, but now you have the late, late finally making the move. Mostly since they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll have to stay socially distant for the next 16 months with their brick and mortar stores.\n\nThat\u2019s basically why Shopify has shot up like a rocket. I know I\u2019m stating the obvious there. But Shopify specializes in targeting non-digital marketers and non-tech savvy people (like dentists, chiropractors, or Instagram influencer types trying to dropship clothes) so that they can almost have a turn-key web solution. (1) domain name (2) web hosting (3) web design, all without a web designer or any technical person. Although of course it comes at a big premium.\n\nNow you\u2019ve got those late, late mom & pop shop adopters (or bigger companies) finally, and reluctantly, switching or doubling down on digital stuff, starting their first Shopify stores, etc.\n\nThe thing is, this is the way it\u2019ll be for the next 5-10+ years at minimum. I hate to speak in absolutes because I might turn out to look like an idiot, especially amidst one of the most uncertain times ever, but the digital commerce space is the long, long term future.\n\nNext, consider that, for online advertising, you only have 2 players. Google and Facebook. I wanna say google has about 60-70% market share (including YouTube), and Facebook has about 20-30%, with the rest going to Snapchat, Yahoo, Bing, etc (although just peanuts in comparison).\n\nAll these businesses have those 2 choices essentially to advertise through, at least for their digital revenues. Aka, Facebook and Google have gotten a shit ton of new customers in the past 40 days. All those people signing up for Shopify, for instance, shooting up their stock, are gonna advertise (probably, and if they advertise) on either or both of those platforms.\n\nOn another note, people are worried about Facebook\u2019s privacy, etc. This is a bit more of an unsteadier aspect, but IMO Facebook is gonna be okay. If governments broke up Facebook, they\u2019d literally be dismantling American & global small business since dentists, etc are more and more relying on it. Plus you can see how paranoid Zuckerberg is after Cambridge Analytica, with the way he\u2019s doing a new 100m small business grant right now, etc, trying to get onto governments\u2019 good sides.\n\nAlso, if you think Facebook is a dying animal (getting less popular, etc) it still has 1.x billion users, not including Instagram, which crushes other so-called up and comers. If it dies, it dies a slow death, probably at least 7-10 years (less good case scenario), which still leaves room for win-win-wins for all at the table (consumers, advertisers, Facebook itself.\n\nI haven\u2019t proof read this lol so sorry for any spelling oddities, etc.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "My bet isn\u2019t that there will be more advertising.
