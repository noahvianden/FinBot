{"title": "GILD Remdesivir Results may provide a rally (OTM low delta calls with low theta)", "selftext": "Hey folks, I know a lot of people are bearish (and for good reasons, no denial that the economy is in the tank), but something that struck me today was El-Erian's discussion on CNBC today. I'm sure many of you know this guy, but tbh, many of his calls (in the past) as well as the current present have proven to be accurate, and whenever this guy talks, WS listens. \n\nTo paraphrase him, he said that the markets are waiting for a medical solution to this pandemic, which is ultimately a health problem. Once there is a solid approved treatment, we may begin to truly rally (at least in the short term until other economic things begin to pop out in a few months time). \n\nTo be honest, I think a solid approved treatment could give way to a meaningful rally. The markets rallied from 220 to 260 on basically a short term technical rebalancing of portfolios and shorts covering. Main stream media said it was because of stimulus news but it was definitely not one of the main reasons why the rally to 260 occurred. \n\nWith this context in mind,  I think that the gilead results may provide a rally sometime in April given that Remdesivir is clearly a solid treatment. Now, I'm NOT SAYING THAT REMDESIVIR WILL SOLVE THE ECONOMY. Before you go all \"/investing\" on me, I'm a trader and not an economist. Gild results will provide the context for the next rally, even if it means that we'll stay in a bear market after that rally. \n\nGILD just launched new trials in the UK to increase access to the drug and is producing the compound at a blistering amount. Shows that they expect approval soon and expect wide adoption. Vaccines are way in the future and this is our best bet in the short term. Expect the markets to like this news when this pops out. Hell we rally a couple percentage points on an oil tweet from Trump that later turned out to be not super accurate. \n\nHere's how I'm playing this: low DTE OTM calls for Jan 2021 SQ (100 strike), BAC (35), MGM (32), JBLU (25), and MS (57.5). Why did I buy these ones? These are some of the most depressed stocks on the market right now. Cyclicals are especially depressed and will be snatched up fast if there is a whiff of hope at the end of this tunnel (airlines, casinos). Big banks and financials such as MS and BAC are strong and will most likely go up at least a few points given that their dividends are safe and dont have any solvency issues. I bought super OTM calls because with a huge rally they go up quite a bit as they move into a higher delta range. Also, they were super cheap but had good liquidity in all of these options. \n\nIn regards to why I chose the jan 2021 calls: I didnt really know (or feel like) timing the Gilead results. At the same time, in the short term, I have spy debit spreads (250-242 spy) that will most likely go up in value as market drops. This week will most likely be slightly red but I dont expect massive drops. The long OTM calls wont decrease much in value given their incredibly low delta as well as low theta. At the same time, once the results are out, we will have a rally that will be bolstered by end of the month 40-60 rebalancing. That's when I'll most likely exit these positions. In the short term, if we keep going lower, I will most likely average down on these options with profits from the spy debits that I have on the line. If for some reason we have a rally this week, my guess is that the options that I have chosen will give me a handsome return, but I'm not really seeing anything on the horizon this week that would lead to such an outcome.", "id": "funzrl", "created_utc": 1585977643.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Why not get some calls on GILD considering if their medicine is the first to market treatment they should see a sizeable boost?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would guess because pharma is very pump / dump and OP wants to go long", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5052846670150757}, {"body": "The options chains for gilead are already pricing in a huge increase.

This regulation is now being used to stop American technology being sold to Huawei. \n\nThe current ban states that any product with more than 25% US origin content CANNOT be sold to Huawei. \n\nHowever, American companies wouldn\u2019t embody capitalism if they didn\u2019t circumvent this ban. \n\nThese dirty rotten commie unpatriotic companies circumvent this ban by having their chips made in Taiwan by TSMC, and then shipped to China. \n\nThe chips are made internationally and specifically to fall under the 25% content origin rule. \n\nBasically for the mouth breathers... these supply chains fall out of US jurisdiction reach. \n\nThe US government understands they\u2019re being bamboozled tho. \n\n[They are now deciding whether to lower the de Minimis rule to 10% or even 0.](https://lawreview.syr.edu/no-way-huawei-proposed-rule-change-to-further-restrict-exports-to-china/)\n\nNow, even though these chips are made offshore and away from US reach, TSMC uses American manufacturing equipment supplied by companies such as LAM research and AMAT. \n\nBecause \u201cAmerican equipment\u201d offshore is being used to manufacture these chips, the US would make it illegal to for TSMC to use American equipment to make chips to sell to Huawei\u2014without a license. \n\nWithout a license is just a formality\u2014god knows that\u2019s not happening. \n\nThis is called a \u201cdirect to product rule.\u201d\n\nIf the US imposed a a direct to product rule, it would make it illegal for TSMC to sell ANY chips made using US equipment to Huawei. \n\nThe US government literally wants to choke Huawei in a BDSM style torture rack. \n\nBecause even if Huawei could design their own chips and stop buying US, they would need TSMC to not use the American equipment. That is extremely difficult and unlikely on TSMC\u2019s part. Damn near impossible. \n\nThe US is basically destroying Huawei\u2019s capability to not just access US chips, but chips altogether\u2014from the largest and most robust manufacturer on the planet\u2014TSMC. \n\nThey are going for the jugular. \n\n*The Play:*\n\nQCOM, SWKS, QRVO, AMAT, LAMX, TSM\u2014these are all good plays, but these are fundamentally strong and sound companies\u2014with exception of QRVO\u2014they do not belong in the category with these titans. \n\nHowever, there is a better one from all these. \n\nA true gem \ud83d\udc8e\u2014 a gem that when you wipe the dust off, realize you\u2019re holding a turd in your hand... \n\nEnter NeoPhotonics\u2014NPTN. \n\nThis thing moves bigly on Huawei related news. \n\nWhy?\n\n[NPNT gets ~45% of its revenue from Huawei](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-CHINA-HUAWEI/0H001GSE93H2/index.html)\n\nIt moved up 16% a while back simply because Trump blurted out US companies need to be open to business with China\u2014and some things like microchips aren\u2019t even a national security concern. \n\nMy guess is he got smacked and schooled by his advisors after saying this dumb shit as the newer chips are 100% useful for military grade equipment. \n\nThat, or he had calls on semis\u2019s that day\u2014more likely he had calls. \n\nBack to NPTN... \n\nNPTN Earnings Transcript from March 2nd, 2020:\n\n[If the existing de minimis threshold were to be lowered to 10%, without other changes, we would not expect a significant direct impact to our revenue outlook.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4328019-neophotonics-nptn-ceo-tim-jenks-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript)\n\nThis means their products must contain less than 10% US origin content. That is why they are still selling to Huawei. \n\nThese rotten commies have plants in China and Japan and are able to reduce their origin content to under 10% and thus able to sell to Huawei being under the allowed 25% total. \n\n*Here is the conclusion:*\n\nIF the US goes all out and lowers the de Minimis threshold to under 10%, NPTN will have nearly half its revenue stream wiped out overnight. \n\nHuge. Fucking. Fall. \n\nHalf it\u2019s revenue stream. \n\n*Timeline*\n\nAny minute. \n\n[It seems Trump officials have already agreed on the new measures for the de Minimis and to alter the direct to product rule.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/27/us-prepares-crackdown-on-huaweis-global-chip-supply-sources-say.html)\n\nI don\u2019t know when the new measures will be made public, but the White House is also holding a 5G summit at some point in early April with the top tech Companies to discuss slowing down Huawei in its 5G expansion.\n\n*Trade with a wind at your back*\n\nThe US China phase one trade deal states:\n\n [In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other.](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf)\n\nCan you put two and two together? \n\nCongratulations. \n\nCovid-19. \n\nTrump calls it the Chinese virus. China states it was released by the US. \n\nChina at the moment looks to be the pandemic expert. US looks likes Italy\u2019s retarded cousin. \n\nHowever, I think the recent intelligence report saying China is fudging their numbers will become a serious thing in the near future. \n\nThere will be a row between Trump and Xi Pooh Pin Ping. With disruptions from beer flu, China might not be able to fulfill its side of the deal to buy designated American goods, let alone can the US manufacture them unless they\u2019re considered essential (such as John Deere\u2014they\u2019re essential to food supplies). China will still have to buy John Deere from the great farmers lol. \n\nBut at some point, because of Covid-19\u2019s supply chain and global shut down disruptions, the US and China will ABSOLUTELY have to come back to the Trade deal and amend certain aspects of it. Things might not go smoothly after all this Coronavirus blow out next time they come to the table. \n\nMillions of Americans unemployed? Priced in. \n\nNot enough ventilators? Priced in. \n\nMillions Americans dying? Priced in. \n\nCorporate bonds bursting? Priced in. \n\nCompanies going bankrupt? Priced in.\n\nUS-China phase one falling apart? Absolutely NOT fucking priced in. \n\nThis could be the driving force for the next leg down. \n\nThis play has the wind at your back. As a general and specific put play if you\u2019re bearish. \n\ntl;dr NPTN pootz", "id": "fujxoz", "created_utc": 1585960150.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "This guy is a spy", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18661734461784363}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s where you come in. \ud83d\ude0f", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2068929672241211}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0973283052444458}, {"body": "very interesting DD. i like your usage of the contractual frustration clause. that would be fucking hilarious if it actually played out that way.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10142354667186737}, {"body": "LAM Research is $LRCX not $LAMX. \n\nGood DD otherwise.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02992536872625351}, {"body": "Seems like good DD.\n\nNo Strike = BAN.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12301833927631378}, {"body": "Fuck, I read a few lines, scrolled through like 3 walls worth of text and then there no positions. \n\n**BAN**", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12850846350193024}, {"body": "You should tweet this to trump.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1070670336484909}, {"body": "What is the DD about?
