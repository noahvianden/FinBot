{"title": "Square is positioned to be a winner by helping small businesses digitize post-pandemic: Oppenheimer", "selftext": "Square shares are up 146% in 2020 so far, and analysts at Oppenheimer think the stock can still go higher.\n\nOn Thursday, Oppenheimer upgraded Square ([SQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ&.tsrc=fin-srch)) to outperform, with a price target of $185. (The all-time high was $166 on Sept. 1; shares were trading at around $152 on Thursday afternoon.) The upgrade is based on the growth of Square\u2019s Cash App, and on the company\u2019s opportunity to help merchants transition to e-commerce.\n\nBut really, the note is a post-pandemic vote of confidence.\n\nAs Oppenheimer writes, the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated a \u201cmassive shift in digital commerce, requiring merchants to rapidly adopt omni-channel solutions.\u201d Of course, it was already obvious before the pandemic that the retail landscape was barreling toward e-commerce, but the pandemic has sent the trend into hyperdrive. [Walmart, Target, and Best Buy reported enormous surges](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html) (100%+) in digital sales in Q2; online-only retailers [Etsy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etsy-ceo-on-huge-q-2-etsy-is-becoming-much-more-mainstream-181632322.html) and [Wayfair](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wayfair-stock-is-up-250-this-year-193131685.html) blew out their Q2 earnings; [Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods is thriving](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) thanks to a combination of online sales and curbside pickup.\n\nAll of those are big retail names. Square\u2019s bread and butter are SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses), which also need to immediately prioritize their e-commerce presence, if they didn\u2019t already. Hundreds of thousands of small business have shut down due to the pandemic, but those that have survived will need to beef up their digital presence.\n\nOppenheimer believes Square is well-suited to serve those small businesses coming out of the pandemic, positioning Square \u201cfor outsized share gains as economic activity normalizes.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer pegs Square\u2019s TAM (total addressable market, [the \u201cit\u201d tech stat of the moment](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-cannabis-and-fake-meat-have-in-common-right-now-180741286.html)) at $160 billion, and within that, puts Cash App\u2019s TAM at $63 billion, noting that \u201cby reinvesting profits from prior Cash App cohorts, combined with its seller ecosystem, Square can develop significant network effects and products that will be challenging for other neo-banks to replicate in the digital wallet space.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Square has an advantage over banks in the mobile payments race.\n\nOppenheimer also notes the \u201cimpressive volume and gross profit growth\u201d of Cash App\u2019s bitcoin trading feature. Square [enabled bitcoin trading within Cash App in 2018](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-square-embrace-bitcoin-brilliant-182530364.html). It reaped $875 million in bitcoin revenue in the second quarter, up 600% year over year, and $17 million in bitcoin gross profit, up 711% year over year. ($17 million is small for a company with $4.17 billion in revenue in 2019, but the growth is the point.) Oppenheimer cites the growth in bitcoin revenue as proof of \u201cthe scalability in the Cash App business model.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has been a noted (and [some believe problematic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorseys-love-of-bitcoin-could-be-a-problem-for-square-122742500.html)) obsession of CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nSquare has always touted that it serves both sides of the small business equation: sellers (i.e., businesses, through its point of sale hardware, payroll software, and Square Capital loan business) and shoppers (consumers paying with Square devices and/or using Cash App). Oppenheimer writes that this \u201ctwo-sided network\u201d will make Square \u201ca structural winner during the recovery.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s an obvious downside case against Square: \u201cEconomic pressures persist longer than anticipated\u201d if the pandemic drags on or even worsens, hitting small businesses harder; \u201ccompetitive responses dampen growth,\u201d and Square certainly has big competitors, including FIS (which acquired Worldpay last year), PayPal, ShopKeep, and Shopify; and if \u201cnew product launches and adoption slow,\u201d which will be up to Dorsey and Square\u2019s own pace of innovation.\n\nOppenheimer sees Square profit growing at a 37% annual rate from the end of 2020 through the end of 2022.

{"title": "Stock Competition Update: 3 months in", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\n3 months ago, 47 of us picked 5 stocks to go long for a competition, each weighted equally in the portfolio. I decided to do this not really for the competitive side, but to see how we as Redditors do with stock picking.\n\nYou can see the results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jgur-RZuJcwWujWLAGKSeJ3eqCCuskcf4z1y0XprDUU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\"new & improved format\" tab shows each participants' picks\n\n\"leaderboard\" tab ranks best performing portfolios*\n\n\"stock leaderboard\" tab ranks best performing tickers*\n\n(*the positioning on these lists doesn't update automatically, so don't be alarmed if the order is off)\n\n**FIRST A NOTE ON DIVIDENDS:** I wanted to go through all stocks with dividends and assume reinvestment of dividends to be included in performance. What happened? Well, I didn't do that. It was taking far too long and work/school has been crushing me... no excuses. I should've done it and I didn't. So for stocks with a dividend that has come out in the last 3 months, the results won't be accurate. For that I apologize.\n\n\n**TIME FRAME: 6/22 - 9/22**\n\n* VTI: +6.7%\n\n* QQQ: +10.4%\n\n* SPY: +6.3%\n\n* DIA: +4.8%\n\n\n**SOME TAKE AWAYS FROM THE DATA**\n\n* First and foremost, 6/22 - 9/22 is only a 3 month period during a very strange year in the stock market, so any conclusions should be taken with a heavy dose of salt.\n\n* Average participant performance was 13.65%, outperforming the indices by a solid margin. That's fantastic! \n\n* If you have a couple of solid winners, it doesn't matter if you have some bad losers. Many participants did very well because one of their picks outperformed significantly.\n\n* In this crazy bull market, valuation seems meaningless (unless you're AYX, a company with incredible growth that slowed considerably during the pandemic, and subsequently took a BIG haircut)\n\n* Holding through turbulence is paramount for long term investors. TSLA had some crazy swings from 6/22 - 9/22, but is still up 113% over that time period.\n\n* Of the 47 participants, only 7 had negative performance, indicating that we are still in a strong bull market. \n\n* Of the 47 participants, 31 outperformed SPY. This validates my belief that stock picking CAN WORK, if one is willing to do the work to have high conviction, and can hold long term through volatility.\n\n* Over this time period, FAANG was up an average of 10.4%, EXACTLY mirroring the performance of QQQ.\n\n**1st place by a long shot: u/Ataraxuh, up 68.82% from 6/22 - 9/22**\n\n* Best performer: NIO, up 158.82%\n\n* Worst performer: TGT, up 25.85%\n\n**2nd place: u/kex06, up 50.58% from 6/22 - 9/22**\n\n* Best performer: NIO, up 158.82%\n\n* Worst performer: NKLA, -59.27%\n\n*Even though NKLA performed terribly, u/kex06 is still in 2nd place due to picking a couple of big winners*\n\n**3rd place: u/thejmils, up 48.85% from 6/22 - 9/22**\n\n* Best performer: NAIL, up 87.43% (leveraged home builders ETF)\n\n* Worst performer: SOXL, up 25.54% (leveraged semiconductor ETF)\n\n*u/thejmils certainly took a different approach and still performed very well. while most of us chose growth/momentum stocks, he/she chose a few leveraged ETFs and the Bank of Montreal*\n\n**TOP 20 PERFORMING STOCKS**\n\n*(I forgot to pull individual prices from 9/22, so percentages are actually for 6/22 - 9/24)*\n\nNIO +140.24%\n\nPENN +103.56% *I really had my money on DKNG over PENN. literally*\n\nTSLA +95.01% *unbelievable that TSLA has performed this well*\n\nLVGO +75.17%\n\nNAIL\t+69.53%\n\nPTON +67.00% *as a bike owner and investor, I'm very pleased*\n\nFNGU +62.52%\n\nZ +61.24% *better than RDFN?? seriously?*\n\nTAN +57.72% *somehow the solar ETF did better than ENPH... shocking to me*\n\nENPH +52.35%\n\nSQ +49.29% *\"the bank of the future\"*\n\nVWDRY +46.76%\n\nMPNGF +39.75%\n\nAMD\t+38.46%\n\nROKU +37.36% *it FINALLY jumped. this is a core holding in my portfolio*\n\nSE +32.34%\n\nDKNG +32.17%\n\nJMIA\t+30.32% *maybe the most volatile stock during this time period*\n\nNVDA +29.61%\n\nTWTR +28.89% *turns out TWTR isn't such a poor performer? that's certainly the way I've looked at it*\n\n**10 WORST PERFORMING STOCKS**\n\n*(I forgot to pull individual prices from 9/22, so this list is actually for 6/22 - 9/24)*\n\nWDI\t-94.53% *turns out fraud is a bad thing?*\n\nI D E X -73.56% *not at all sure what this company does... post got auto removed for including a penny stock thus the spaces between letters. silly rule if you ask me*\n\nNKLA -72.71% *see WDI.

I want them to go (or stay) itm as soon as possible if I was right, and start building intrinsic value and increasing delta. That\u2019s when the biggest $ gains come with options, when you\u2019re actually getting very close the $ return of 100 shares of the underlying per contract for a much less cost. You can often achieve 100% return on an itm LEAP relatively quickly if you were even somewhat right in your thesis on the direction, and then you can consider leaving it open or take your now-doubled funds and run. Obviously, if things go the other way, then you have lot more capital at risk than you would\u2019ve with a cheaper otm option, so that\u2019s always the trade off. \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say a few months ago when SPY was at 300, you bought SPY 350 LEAPS thinking it\u2019s only a matter of time before SPY gets there, and then low and behold SPY gets there rather quickly, but then it also falls back down rather quickly. So now your 350 LEAPS lost a considerable amount of extrinsic value and your profits have either been greatly reduced or maybe even in loss. Now let\u2019s say that when SPY was 300, you paid more to buy 300, or even 280-290 LEAPS, then by the time SPY got to 350 perhaps you would\u2019ve achieved a reasonable profit target already and exited. And even if you still had them when SPY has now fallen to 320\u2019s, they still hold a considerable amount of value and as soon as the tide turns, they\u2019re gonna go back to where they were prior to the pullback relatively quickly.\n\nFor example, atm 2023 LEAPS for both SPY and QQQ are roughly $5k as of now. That requires both QQQ and SPY to be just a bit above ath by the 2023 expiration to be breakeven. So to me that\u2019s a reasonable deal. And if we can somehow get SPY to below 310 and QQQ below 250 (fingers crossed ;)), then paying $50 for at the money 2023 LEAPS will essentially have you at breakeven when ath are reached again, and beyond that is all profit. Obviously this is not a fool proof strategy as any random event in the market can quickly knock out the value of even very deep itm LEAPS, so the safest bet remains to be holding shares/index funds which don\u2019t expire.\n\nAnd also, just because it\u2019s a 2023 LEAP doesn\u2019t mean it has to be held until then. It is still more of a \u2018trade\u2019 and less of a longer term \u2018investment\u2019 in my mind, and thus can be exited at any time for any reason. I prefer to pick a profit target, be it 50% or 100% or whatever, and run when it\u2019s reached. Then one can reassess and take a position somewhere again when the time is right. It\u2019s definitely a relatively safer way to make $2500-5000 on $5000 in the example of the SPY/QQQ LEAPS that I gave above, compared to the myriad of other strategies which are out there. That\u2019s my opinion anyway, of course holding until expiration is completely viable also for those who may prefer to take that higher risk for the potential higher reward.\n\nAs far as whether I\u2019d get them before or after the election, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have a good answer for that :). While election is definitely a factor, I\u2019m mostly just looking at the charts and the ongoing macro and micro trends and trying to time my entry/exit in that manner. My target has been SPY 310\u2019ish and QQQ 250\u2019ish, but it seems to be a grind down rather than the straight line I would\u2019ve liked (lol). If at any point I feel the trend has reversed, then I\u2019ll consider getting in at a higher level.
