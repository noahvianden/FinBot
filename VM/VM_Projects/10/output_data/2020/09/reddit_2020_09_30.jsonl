{"title": "Timing the market", "selftext": "This is purely an opinion post. I feel like there are misconceptions about what \u201ctiming the market\u201d is on this sub. People will tell you that holding any cash or buying at the right price is considered timing the market and that you should just buy in now if you plan on holding long term. \n\n* Basing your buy and sell strategies because you think the market is going to go up or down in the near term and you want to get the same company at a few % lower price. This is obviously timing the market as you are, well, trying to time the market. Nobody can predict short term volatility moves and for all anyone knows we could have S&P 3,000 or S&P 4,000 in a month. \n\n* Sitting on 100% cash because you are waiting to buy when it crashes. Buffett himself has said that sitting on the sidelines of a great game because you think you can find a better time to enter is a terrible mistake. For all you know, the markets can keep going up for years and years and you\u2019re missing out on great returns. This strategy is how you end up FOMOing in near the top because the markets just keep going up and up and everyone\u2019s on /r/stocks talking about their amazing returns, and you finally get fed up with your -2% cash returns and buy in. If you stick to your gut and don\u2019t fall in, however, it\u2019s not a horrible idea, markets will go down, it\u2019s not completely invalid. For example, someone who saw the euphoria in early 2020, 2007 or the late 90\u2019s and said to himself that he\u2019s not going to fall for the tulip mania, probably ended up making great returns as he quickly deployed his cash after the crash. On the other hand, someone who had been sitting in cash since 1995, 2005 or 2016 probably ended up in the first category. This leads me to my next point. \n\n* Building a cash position. This is absolutely not timing the market and is a completely valid and probably very smart position no matter what market cycle we are in. The bad thing about cash is the very low returns. I (again my completely personal opinion) is that you should always keep a decent cash position in your portfolio to buy with. Not 100%  or even 50 or 25%, but having some easily accessible purchasing power on hand at all times is a very good idea, and is NOT \u201ctiming the market\u201d to wait for a good price. Again, building a cash position is a perfectly valid strategy, as long as you aren\u2019t completely out of the market.\n\n* \u201cIt\u2019s for the long term\u201d. A very important rule of investing that is held by almost every successful investor, is: The price you pay for it is the difference between a great company and a great stock. Sure a lot of these hot tickers on reddit will continue to grow in revenues and expand their businesses, I have no doubt in it, but if a company already has 10 years of growth priced into the stock, are you really getting what you pay for? Stocks don\u2019t and won\u2019t keep going up forever. \n\n* \u201cBuy the dip\u201d. People on here will call this timing the market, however I completely disagree. Anyone who says dip-buying is market timing is encouraging FOMO. The best time to buy in is when the streets are full of blood. There is nothing invalid about seeing a company you would love to be invested in, and seeing that it\u2019s expensive right now and not buying it right now. There will be an opportunity in the future, and in the mean time, instead of just sitting on cash, there are always opportunities on the market. Some sectors are expensive right now and others are cheap. Add the expensive on to your watch list, closely monitor it and start looking for companies trading at a fairer price. A common sentiment I see a lot is that \u201cwell if you wait, it\u2019ll just keep going up and up and up\u201d. That sentiment is pure FOMO fueling. \n\nI\u2019m drunk right now so I typed this whole post up, hopefully someone reads it and gains some value, even more hopefully someone just shits all over me because I\u2019m making no sense, either way have a good night and thank you.", "id": "j2h1fi", "created_utc": 1601447857.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Well said brotha", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13229593634605408}, {"body": "What I think a lot of younger investors are missing with this is that with a major market crash, typically the stocks that drag down the averages are the ones affected the most by whatever event sparked the selling to begin with.\n\nBuying amazon wasn\u2019t an obvious play after the .com bubble popped.

{"title": "How to invest in a bear market (helpful article)", "selftext": "Found this [article](https://bankeronwheels.com/covid-19-investing-in-bear-market-crash-bottom/) and found it really helpful. Not saying that we're in a bear market, but these are principles we (new investors) should keep in mind all the time. Also it is not my article, all credit to [bankeronwheels.com](https://bankeronwheels.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Invest in Stocks gradually on the way down**\n\nWhen and how to invest in stocks? If you have directly or indirectly prepared for a period of financial stress and have available cash you may consider starting investing when there is a market crash. A good strategy is to build rules and stick to them \u2014 either based on\u00a0**certain index levels, for example** S&P 500 at 2700 invest 20% of savings, 2500 another 20% etc. or\u00a0**based on timing**\u00a0(slicing every few weeks since we have no clarity which way the market may go and when it will bottom out)\n\n2. Do not chase an upward trend in a bear market\n\nOne of the\u00a0**common mistakes**\u00a0we see is\u00a0**people chasing upward trends**\u00a0because of\u00a0**FOMO \u2014 Fear of Missing Out**\u00a0(when stock market recovers after a big crash for a few days giving hope of long term gains). It takes more courage to buy according to predefined rules which often means buying when everything is gloomy and stocks lose massively. Buy on days when stocks are massively sold not bought. In the long term it pays off. Do not be tempted by rebounds that may prove short-lived.\n\n3. Do not try to time the market\n\nEven the best investors struggle with market timing. In fact most hedge funds (even the most prestigious ones) made substantial losses in March\n\nThe market can turn rapidly both ways and while you may avoid some bad days\u00a0**avoiding just a few good days can be extremely detrimental to your long term performance**\u00a0as illustrated by a study done by Fidelity.\n\nAlso, it is extremely\u00a0**risky to use leverage since additional debt implies you must be correct on timing**\n\n4. Invest, do not speculate\n\nYou may not get spectacular 300\u2013400% returns overnight but your money will be relatively safe if you base your decisions on sound financial statements and diversify.\u00a0**ETFs**\u00a0(including\u00a0[**Bond ETFs**](https://bankeronwheels.com/best-etfs-in-2020/))\u00a0**are a great way to invest in indices without taking idiosyncratic risk**\u00a0(e.g. L\\*\\*\\*\\* Coffee dropped 80% in one day in March on uncovered fraud \u2014 as Warren Buffett says \u201cOnly when the tide goes out to do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked\u201d).\n\n**Ask yourself the question \u2014 am I more qualified than a professional investor**\u00a0to predict which industry player may outperform the rest of the market? Do I know how the landscape post-crisis will look like? Even if you suspect knowing first-order effects are you sure of the second and higher-order effect (to Nicholas Taleb\u2019s point).\n\n5. Avoid binary outcomes\n\nHow to invest in stocks to avoid drawdowns? Each crisis has its own most\u00a0**vulnerable industries where outcomes can be binary**\u00a0\u2014 in 2008 some Banks went out of business and as an investor, you may have lost everything. The Coronavirus crisis has other prime candidates for such outcomes,\u00a0**airlines**\u00a0can be nationalized and\u00a0**hotel**/**tourism**\u00a0industry players can go bankrupt should the distress last longer. You want to avoid these investments until there is more clarity on consumer confidence.\n\nSince these recover now you may think it was wise to invest at some point but the key is that you can\u2019t base the\u00a0**rightness of a decision bed on an outcome but on a probability it would occur**. And in March chances were high there would be lots of Airline Lehman Brothers (in fact, a lot materialized \u2014 LatAm, Virgin Australia, etc)\n\nSolution for how to invest in stocks avoiding binary outcomes: Choose Index Funds!\n\n6. Look for financially resilient firms\n\nIf you do invest in single names, do not believe blindly in potentially meaningless dividend yields based on past data unless it has been confirmed by the management after incorporating all the outlook related to Covid-19. Instead, look at\u00a0**balance sheets with low debt and build-in resilience (cash)**. These firms may outperform and even acquire weaker competitors in the current environment. Be cautious though, you can\u2019t predict the impact of post-Corona market on Business Models.\n\n7. Keep Some Cash\n\nRay Dalio now infamously said a few months ago that \u2018Cash is Trash\u2019. While he is one of the best thinkers in Finance the remark was badly timed. Even in the most conservative scenarios keep some reserves. This is primarily a health crisis and while an economic crisis unfolds having a safety net is paramount.\u00a0**Additional unforeseen** **tail risks always exist (think Oil Price crash or Trade War on top of Coronavirus etc.)**\n\n8. Diversify in other assets including currencies, commodities and high quality debt products\n\nIt is difficult to predict which countries may relatively outperform.\u00a0**Keep your portfolio diversified**\u00a0geographically (e.g. Asia, Europe, US) and product-wise potentially including commodities like Gold that may outperform in low real rates / high inflation environments. Consider very high-quality debt products ([**Treasuries or Investment Grade Debt Bond** ](https://bankeronwheels.com/best-etfs-in-2020/)[**ETFs**](https://bankeronwheels.com/best-etfs-in-2020/)).\u00a0[**Here** ](https://bankeronwheels.com/bond-etf-gold-etf-comparison/)is a good guide on how to protect your Stocks Portfolio.\n\n9. Stay informed but remain cautious\n\nKnowing how to invest in stocks is also about adjusting your strategies as there is more clarity about the outlook. But be very careful with financial experts and consensus \u2014\u00a0**when you see opinions converging usually something else will happen**\n\n10. Duration of the coronavirus pandemic is key\n\nThe risks are still skewed to the downside (it can take\u00a0[**significant time**](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/basics/past-pandemics.html)). While there is a discount to peak market values and positive catalysts may materialize (most pharmas are working on Coronavirus vaccines and mitigating drugs) the time it takes and the change of behavior will alter the markets significantly.\n\n**The impact on people\u2019s health even when cured and society at large is at this stage still uncertain.
