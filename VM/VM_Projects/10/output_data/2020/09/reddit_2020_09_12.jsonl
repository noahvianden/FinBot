{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n> The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n> \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n> \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n> \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n> \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n> The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n> \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n> Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n> \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n> \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n> First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\n\n> One of the top requests we\u2019ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\n\n> Here\u2019s how the S&P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups.

Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\n\n> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n> \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n> * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n> With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n> As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKS55-50q60))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 9.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$FDX** \n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$LEN** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$BRC** \n> * **$CMD** \n> * **$ISR** \n> * **$APOG** \n> * **$ICMB** \n> * **$HMY** \n> * **$VNCE** \n> * **$CSBR** \n> * **$EARS** \n> * **$AFIB** \n> * **$OSH**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # FedEx Corp. $232.79\n**FedEx Corp.

{"title": "Some information on Unity from someone in the game dev space", "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of posts recently asking about Unity, and since it's supposed to become available next week, I'll try to give a good breakdown on it. I've been using Unity myself since 2012 so I've seen it grow quite a bit, as well as how the company itself behaves.\n\n---\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Unity (the engine) steadily improves. Performance is better, the in-engine tools are better, features are better. Strong retention. \n* Massive community. The Unity community is enormous, and passionate. New devs with questions can almost always find the answer on forums, subreddits, or the official discord server. The community is one of the strongest I've seen in tech. **This is very important**; the Unity community, in my experience, is much stronger, passionate, and active, than the general game dev community. \n* Massively used more than competitors in indie spaces. On their website, they boast 1.5 million monthly active users. [This article from 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/unity-ceo-says-half-of-all-games-are-built-on-unity/) has some pretty impressive numbers: 50% of all games, but 60-70% of mobile games specifically. Probably safe to say that these numbers have increased. Also, Epic's fight with Apple COULD potentially give Unity an even larger share. \n* More generalized. Compared to its competitors, Unity has a much wider range of options in terms of what you can make. 3D, 2D, VR, AR, you can pretty much do anything, and do it well (except 2D, sort of). \n* Extremely easy to learn. Unity offers many courses and example projects, both paid and free. It's extremely easy for a beginner to hop in and start learning. Additionally, compared to it's competitors (specifically Unreal), Unity's interface is extremely simple. The engine is also bundled with Visual Studio Community, Microsoft's extremely powerful ide (which has an official Unity extension). I've noticed a trend of smaller engines/frameworks switching their interface to match Unity's, which may reinforce this idea. \n* Asset store. The asset store has gotten significantly better over the last couple years, and is used quite often by developers. Devs buy or sell assets on the store; sellers set their own price, and pretty much anything can go on it. Every sale, Unity gets 30%.\n\n---\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Currently extremely hard to increase revenue from core users. The current model Unity uses, is that if your game/app/business makes less than 100k a year, or you're a student, you pay them nothing. Literally $0. And personally, I believe that they are struggling to motivate indies to pay or subscribe. Their lowest price tier is $400 a year, which isnt that bad, but barely offers any differences as an individual. At one point they even had dark mode locked behind a paywall, but very recently made it free. The only feature I think is truly worth the money is their Teams, specifically collab, which is basically a real time integrated git. It's $9 a month at the low end, which is fair imo, but not a lot in the grand scheme of things. \n* Half baked ideas. Unity tends to dump a lot of dev time on large scale additions to the engine, or overhauling a feature. Sometimes these go well, most of the time they end up being something pretty obscure that only a handful of people are going to use, but sometimes they end up completely outclassed by an existing asset on the store or forgotten about. Three big examples of this are UNET, the 2D engine (too much to type out, but this was and still is absolute garbo compared to alternatives), and the text system. UNET was intended to be an overhaul of the existing (and very bad) networking solution, but was, in a lot of ways, confusing and also bad. Assets already existed that were far better, such as Photon.\nLuckily, Unity sort of learned their lesson with their 3D text, by adding a popular asset to the engine instead of redoing it themselves, but the initial implementation was very sloppy. In general, they seem to spin their wheels quite often on big changes.\n* Inferior to specialization. Unity is very general. AAA games, where the big money is, cannot generally afford to be general. Unreal beats Unity's ass in 3D games, specifically first person and third person games. Do not get me wrong, Unity has made incredible progress in the 3D rendering department. But as seen in Unreal's latest presentation, their rendering is phenomenal. Imo unless Unreal slips up or Unity makes a breakthrough, Unreal will always be about a year ahead. Additionally, and this is not at the fault of Unity, Unreal started as a FPS engine. So as AAA studios made FPS games, the obvious choice was Unreal. Typically, a large studio has access to the source code, which allows them to hyper specialize the engine to their projects needs, but this leads into a big problem for Unity: when the team needs a new engine, they're going to move to the next iteration, because it's more than likely that their optimizations will be able to carry over, and it would be stupid to start from scratch. It's very common for AAA studios to create all their project in a \"modified\" unreal engine, primarily because it's just what they started with. This sort of makes Unity just an option for completely unrelated new projects, like how Blizzard used Unity for Hearthstone.\n\n---\n\nRelevant Comments:\n\n* [More stuff outside of games](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ir2ga7/some_information_on_unity_from_someone_in_the/g4wd3t0/)\n* [Advertisement plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ir2ga7/some_information_on_unity_from_someone_in_the/g4watiw/)\n\n---\n\nConclusion: \n\nI think Unity is a strong long term option, but they'll probably come out overvalued due to hype. I plan on picking up a couple shares and see how things trend, but this is definitely not a company with explosive short term growth like you see with cloud computing. They're basically sitting on a gold mine with their supermassive untapped user base, but not efficiently using it, so imo buy and plan on holding, or wait for a change in their subscription model.", "id": "ir2ga7", "created_utc": 1599869603.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Great insight from a game dev, thanks a lot for this!\n\nI think though you leave out that Unity is also expanding into industrial uses\n\nDoosan will use Unity to render construction projects in order to increase safety\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php%3fud=20200813000633\n\nVolkswagen and Toyota use it for automotive design\n\nhttps://unity.com/our-company/newsroom/unity-technologies-increases-commitment-automotive-dedicated-team-industry\n\nSHoP Architects are using it for architectural rendering in VR \n\nhttps://www.archpaper.com/2019/10/unity-reflect-open-source-tool/\n\nI\u2019m excited for the Unity IPO, and I\u2019m definitely going to pick up some shares", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "interesting, Unity used in architectural engineering.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6890000700950623}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8130919337272644}, {"body": "This is a great article about their business. \n\nTheir ad play it outstanding. \n\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/how-unity-built-a-gaming-engine-for-the-future/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7113442420959473}, {"body": "Commenting to see more replies", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.022974152117967606}, {"body": "Interesting.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n> The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n> \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n> \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n> \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n> \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n> The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n> \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n> Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n> \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n> \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n> First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today.

Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\n\n> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n> \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n> * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n> With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n> As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # FedEx Corp. $232.79\n**FedEx Corp.

I'm assuming you're trading stocks with decent volume and lots of possible options (in single dollar increments ideally)\n\nIn this case you'd buy a debit put spread, buy one put either ITM or just below and sell another at a lower strike.

{"title": "Halloween Play - HSY", "selftext": "What's up retards? OK, I'll admit idk wtf I'm doing. I've lost 35% of my portfolio in the last 2 weeks and I'm thinking of buying some $ROPE, but wait! HALLOWEEN DD!\n\n1st, historically all the great economic crashes happen in/around October. I've been pretty bullish throughout COVID but I'm starting to feel the winds of change. Not a \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, but on this particular play I am. I'm wondering if the markets will take a shit before the elections? Thoughts?\n\n2nd, who the fuck is going to let their kids do Halloween this year?! I know I ain't handing candy out, that's for sure... ALTHOUGH I will probably still buy SOME (less) candy for my fat ass and my wife's boyfriend.\n\nSo HSY, the largest publicly traded candy company. These guy HAVE to be making most of their profits around this time of year, yeah? Halloween canceled + market dump in October(?) = Puts on HSY...\n\nSo now that I've offered some basic reasoning based on some assumptions and really no solid DD, can one of you autists tell me why: A) This is priced in. B) Halloween isn't canceled. C) Oct will be a bull market/no dump. D) HSY doesn't care about this seasonal revenue.\n\nEDIT: Probably buying puts but selling at the 1st dip. Idk if overall candy consumption is up due to covid, which could negate this, and I feel like it's priced in, though I can't read technicals. I'm betting there's a dip when the news starts talking about Halloween being canceled and I'll sell then...\n\nThe real bet here is will Halloween be canceled?\n\nEDIT2: FUCK this play. Apparently you order candy in March so it was probably over ordered.
