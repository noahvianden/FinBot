{"title": "ITM LEAPS Call Debit Spreads?", "selftext": "I've searched, but I can't seem to find answers on exactly this \"strategy,\" so I figured I'd ask here. Does anyone have opinions on buying ITM LEAPS Call debit spreads? For example, right now;\n\nQQQ is currently trading at $273.38 - 01/21/2022 $265c/$266c debit spread is selling for $0.51. \n\nLong $265c $41.33, Short $266c $40.82, Net debit of $0.51, Max Profit of $0.49\n\nAside from tying up capital until January of 2022 and the possibility of the contract expiring worthless, what would be the major drawbacks to buying an In the money LEAPS call debit spread? Since it's a call debit spread, this strategy greatly reduces exposure to theta decay, right? \n\nI opened a similar position on AAPL, when it was trading around $117 earlier this week (01/21/2022 $113.75c/$115c @ $0.53, Max Profit - $0.72, Breakeven  - $114.28) and I don't know if this is a viable strategy since I am relatively new to this.

The market goes up 3 out of 4 years, so a 50/50 bet like this should payout more times than not.  I mean, if you had a coin that came up heads 3 times for every 4 flips, then you'd probably bet on heads as many times as possible, right?\n\nThe one drawback would be the losers, of course.  So you need to hedge like a casino or insurance company.  \n\nCasinos set table limits to spread out their bets over many occuances.  That way nobody can take the house.  \n\nSimilarly, insurance companies use the law of large numbers (yes, it's actually called that) to spread the risk out over many insured people.\n\nBoth have the odds in their favor, so they only need to hedge large single bets/policies.\n\nIn your case, to make this a viable long-term strategy, you would need to spread your \"bets\" over many different periods of time and/or non-correlated (but equally bullish) underlyings.\n\nOne example would be on SPY options.  You could trade that style of debit spread on each of the following:  MAR, JUN, SEP, DEC of 2021 and MAR, JUN, SEP, DEC of 2022.  And then add another trade when MAR of 2023 is available, then another 3 months later when JUN of 2023 is available, so on and so forth.\n\nYou could have one of these \"maturing\" every three months.  Also, you would be perfectly hedged in the event of an assignment since you'd have a long call deeper ITM than your assigned options strike.\n\nAll in all, it sounds like an interesting idea.

This fund is a capitalization weighted, non-leveraged passively managed real estate ETF with a benchmark of MSCI US IMI Real Estate 25/50 Index. It's not one that gets mentioned on here a lot. Like all Real Estate investments, it took a hit in March and is slow to recover.\n\nThe fund scores a perfect 10.0 out of 10 analyst rating from XTF. If you are going to hold Real Estate in an ETF, this is the one to have. It may take several months or even a few years for Real Estate to recover, so as long as you aren't expecting immediate returns, this fund is (hopefully) a solid long term hold. The fund has a distribution yield of a very respectable 3.8% and should sustain that distribution for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou have almost 12% of your portfolio in this fund, and that seems about right to me.\n\n**VTI** \\- Vanguard IDX Fund. **VTI** is a Capitalization-weighted, non-leveraged, passively managed equity ETF with the benchmark index of CRSP US Total Market Index.  Over the long term, the fund performs somewhat similarly to the S&P 500 index. It has the same companies as the top 6 holdings but in different percentages.\n\nWhile I personally think a fund that is more top-heavy with the FAANG stocks would perform better over the long haul, this is a solid choice and provides great diversification, with perhaps slightly less volatility than a more tech-heavy fund would have. **VTI** is a favorite of many people on this subreddit and it's hard to argue against it for a broad market fund.  It has a solid 9.7/10 analyst rating.\n\nFor a 22 year old, my suggestion would be to put some money into **QQQ** which should provide more long-term growth than **VTI**. However, you wouldn't have to stop investing in **VTI**. You could just take what you are putting here and split it between the two. There would be a lot of duplication by doing that, but I think your portfolio would grow more quickly if you do that.  (I'm not a financial expert and this isn't financial advice; just something to consider).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund.  I'm not very fond of Total Stock funds, especially International ones. They tend to underperform the S&P 500 Index and if you're going to pick a very broad market fund, why not just pick **VOO** or **SPY**?\n\nHowever, this fund may be the exception to my dislike of international funds.  The top holdings include **BABA**, Tencent Holdings, Nestle SA, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Roche Holding, Novartis, SAP, Toyota, and ASML. If I were going to invest in a handful of non-US companies, these would all be solid choices. I would not be surprised if this fund performs at least as well as, if not better than the S&P 500 index over the next few/several years.  It has a 9.8/10 Analyst rating from XTF.\n\n**JPM** \\- JPMorgan Chase is one of the few bank stocks that I own. Like all bank stocks, it took a beating in March and is still trying to recover. It's a little early to tell how the unemployment rate and bankruptcies are going to affect the banking industry over the next several months, but if any bank can weather the storm, JPM should be able to. It's a bit of a risky stock for that reason, but I think a solid choice for a long-term hold. The Equity Summary Score is slightly bearish on JPM with a rating of  4.5/10. The stock does pay dividends with a respectable 3.57% yield. That should continue.  If I were you, I would continue to put 12% or so of your investment dollars here. Other stocks in this sector include WFC (Wells Fargo), BAC (Bank of America) and TD (Toronto Dominion).\n\n**MSFT** \\- Microsoft is probably one of the best companies to have money in right now. They haven't had the same growth in value as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google over the past ten years or so, but I think they are poised to do great things in the future.  I'm bullish on MSFT and I own shares, myself. Microsoft does pay a small dividend, but nothing to write home about.  Recognia Technical Analysts have given Microsoft a strong Long-term Sentiment and S&P Global Intelligence suggests that it is slightly undervalued.\n\n**BA** \\- Boeing Co.  Here's where you and I are going to disagree. Boeing has obviously had issues with their 737 Max. Cancellations are outpacing orders on this \"flagship\" airliner. And now the FAA is looking into issues with the 787.  The Equity Summary Score for Boeing stock is a very bearish 0.3/10, and Recognia Technical Analysts give it a \"weak\" rating for the short term, mid-term and long-term. In fact, looking through the various analyst reports, I don't see a single analyst that likes this stock.\n\nBoeing could come back but it could take years or even decades to return to pre-737 Max levels.  This company has fundamental problems beyond decreased air traffic and I wouldn't touch this one with a ten foot pole. There are so many better choices out there.  If you want to diversify outside of Tech, consider something like Disney, Coca Cola, Kroger, Pepsi or Best Buy.  Amazon, Google and Apple would also be better choices for 11% of your portfolio.\n\n**MAR** \\- Marriott. Here is another one that the analysts don't like; however, I'm with you on this one. Of all the Hotel stocks out there, this one is my favorite.  Their properties are mostly in the mid-price to upper-mid range. They are taking a hit due to the pandemic situation and the Analysts are knocking them for that. However, once the COVID situation is over, I think Marriott will bounce back and continue to be a strong, solid-performing company.\n\nThat said, the analysts give this an Equity Summary Score of 0.6/10 (very bearish) and a weak Long-term Sentiment.  (Long term in this context is 9 months to 2 years). However, S&P Global Market Intelligence regards the stock as slightly under-valued with a score of 62/100 where 100 is most undervalued and 1 is least undervalued. They also give the stock a very high \"quality\" score (91/100) but rank it only 33/100 for Financial Health.  This last low score is largely due to COVID.  I think Marriott bounces back within a few years and I expect you to see good long-term growth.  (But what do I know?)  Other options in this sector include:  **HLT** (Hilton) and **H** (Hyatt).\n\nThe only advice I would give you is that you may want to diversify into a couple of other sectors.  ETFs might be the best way to do that.\n\nI'm bullish on renewable/clean energy stocks.  The best ETFs in this sector include:  **ICLN**, **TAN**, **PBW** and **QCLN.** (I have shares in **ICLN**, **TAN** and **PBW**).\n\nI'm also bullish on some health care ETFs including some that specifically invest in companies on the cusp of Genomic technology.  Look for:  **ARKG**, **IDNA**, **XLV** and **FHLC** in this area. (I have shares in **ARKG** and **XLV**.)\n\nAnother ETF that I've put some money in is **THNQ**. This one invests in companies involved in artificial intelligence and robotics.  Other ETFs in this area include **ROBT**, **ROBO** and **ARKQ**.\n\nI hope this helps. best of luck to you.\n\n*(I'll give your portfolio an overall score of A-, which you could raise to an A+ by getting rid of Boeing and adding ICLN and ARKG.)*", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I like the way you are doing analysis.

Though the nation\u2019s top banks and money managers are traditionally in New York, such a tax would have huge implications for the industry, with northern New Jersey effectively serving as modern Wall Street\u2019s digital trading floor.\n\nApparently, the legislation would be to charge 0.25 cents per trade, potentially raising billions of dollars for the state.\n\nSure enough, today, some major markets announced they would be \"conducting tests\" to operate from secondary datacenter locations \"in response to member demand, should adverse tax policies be enacted by the state\". For exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ, those secondary sites are currently located in Illinois in the Chicago area.\n\nWith todays technology, the exchanges can easily relocate to any one of the 49 states that would welcome the large data centers along with the jobs and the tax revenue that they'd bring.\n\nMurphy himself is no stranger to trading as he is a retired long-time Goldman Sachs executive with a net worth of over $50 million.\n\nWhat would be the impact of such transaction taxes to the retail investor? At least in theory, the electronic market makers improve liquidity and maintain tighter spreads that do benefit retail investors. A 0.25 cent transaction tax would almost certainly take them out of business so relocating out of NJ would be the only option to them.", "id": "iqvpov", "created_utc": 1599847202.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Will never happen and if it does it i'll do nothing since exchanges will just relocate.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35246872901916504}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Welcome to the democrat platform.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Daddy Murphy will keep us locked down and over taxed until the only ones left are the ones who can't afford to leave", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2888335883617401}, {"body": "God I can't wait to get out of Illinoi$.

{"title": "Buying OTM LEAPs: what are the most high upside plays in your opinion?", "selftext": "  \n\nJust to provide an example, Apple shares are currently about $110. Let\u2019s say you are very bullish on it and buy a single long term call, 195C expry Jan 2022. That would set you back about $400 ($4.03), or about 4 share\u2019s worth. Let\u2019s say your hunch was right and the share values doubles by Jan 2022. Your gamble earned you ($220-195)\\*100, or roughly $2500. Not bad.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at CISCO. Shares currently at $40. Again, let\u2019s say you are very bullish and think it will double and buy a similarly OTM leap call, 75C expry Jan 2022. Interestingly, the cost for that is $20 ($0.20). Let\u2019s think about that for a second. For the price of one share, you can literally buy two of those options. So if you invested the same $400 to buy twenty(!) CSCO 75C expry Jan 2022 options, and CSCO doubles by Jan 2022, you\u2019ve earned roughly (80-75) \\*2000, or roughly $10,000. Four times the upside of the apple leap call.\n\nYes, Apple is apple, and Cisco is Cisco, but at least from a math perspective the Cisco play has MUCH more upside. I would even argue that the Cisco play (it being also a well established tech company, big potential upsides such as IoT and cyber security) is not necessarily that much riskier than the apple play.

{"title": "The story of TikTok and how to extract tendies out of it", "selftext": "My Fellow Retards,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas a graduate of \"WSB School of Autism\" I have a moral duty to give something back to this great community so here it goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarlier today, while watching Matrix 1 and constantly thinking about tiktok I finally got it the way things will play here.\n\nFirst, big shout to MAGA fans & Uncle Donnie as it was him who created this opportunity for us, you guys rock!!1 All the best in elections!\n\nNow.. as TikTok's creators are not listed in US exchanges the play here is our little, but extremely fast growing company called Fastly ($FSLY) as tiktok is their biggest customer, contributing between 12% and 20% to their revenues according to the various sources. I didn't check official sec papers for that as I've seen enough articles over the Internet, plus additionally it was clear that fastly become very volatile and now today, at this stage where pretty much all news are saying that deal is fucked and uncle Donnie just said to Reuters today that either tiktok is sold to US or it will stop ticking after 15th of September which is going to be Tuesday next week.\n\nI will start with downside then will describe upside:\n\nWhat can go wrong: it is what you read in the news, no deal (tiktok not sold to US companies) means some % drop in fastly more and obviously any bull position will be dismembered.\n\nUpside: TikTok will be sold to US company next week and Fastly will come back very quickly as currently (Friday) it is priced in for the worse to happen. The reasons why this is going to happen is the follows:\n\nBiggest reason for chaina's commies saying that they can't allow sale to happen and in fact they introduced some legislations back in August which theoretically prohibits sale of TikTok due to AI and some recommendation algorithms being used in software which was developed in Beijing by local developers. This is official statement and \"biggest obstacle\", however, in reality communist chaina cannot lose face in front of the world if they would just quietly node to the deal, so instead, they will do these PR tricks in order to look good at least at home, as in US and the rest of the world everybody already know who they really are. This is the biggest thing and the only thing which matters here. Anything else, doesn't, but let me discuss them:\n\n\"AI, recommendation algorithms and even software itself.\"\n\nThis is bullshit. As a guy who spent his life in front the screens, I know that these things can be replaced and given the fact that companies which trying to buy this software are biggest tech companies in the world - replacing ANYTHING in that software is not going to be a problem at all. So simply put - you can replace software, algorithm, anything you like very quickly when you have armies of developers under your command, but what you cannot do is to release software to the world and have 100m Americans to use it from the day 1 and make sure they all love it. This is what matters when people evaluate tech companies. Not the revenue they generate, but how quickly they grow their user base. For apple this is yet another way to sell their stuff to even younger generations to come.. etc etc.. but this is not about it, the fact is that tiktok will be sold next week and you can jump to the train which is going to tendie town while it is still at the station.\n\nLosing tiktok in US is massive hit to fastly, it is still growing company, but it wont grow as fast as it was, however, if things will go well for tiktok - fastly will rebound immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy FD is $FSLY 18/9/2020 100c\n\nGL & HF", "id": "ir0rgc", "created_utc": 1599863386.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Hell of post but I think I\u2019ll just head down to my corner store, remove $1k from the atm, purchase 1 blue Bic lighter, and then proceed to set that $1k on fire in the parking lot.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Send both to me I will make sure to burn it for you.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35096248984336853}, {"body": "Good answer", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1649351418018341}, {"body": "i pr\u00e9f\u00e8re thots too", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.018390752375125885}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23511545360088348}, {"body": "So TSLA calls next week.
