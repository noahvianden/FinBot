They all say the same thing:\n\n**People have been paying off their loans; and buying up the inventory.**\n\nThis is leading to a huge cash windfall for pawn shops -- which hasn't yet been reflected in their stock price.\n\nAnd as the economy begins to contract, you can be sure that the loan side of the business will start to boom.\n\nAnother thing to note: pawn shops do a lot of business in \"scrap gold\" and gold prices are at a historic high.\n\n## The big chains: Cash America and EZ Pawn\n\nThe two largest chains in the US are Cash America ($FCFS, FirstCash) and EZ Pawn ($EZPW, EZCorp), along with their associated subsidiaries.\n\nBoth are in direct competition with each other in many areas of North America, as well as having holdings in Latin America.\n\n$FCFS currently trades at just north of $65.\n\nBut, over the past week, $EZPW had been getting pushed down-- possibly manipulated-- to a low of 5.33.

Especially in Europe where the governments are supporting it, I think hydrogen could win this fight. Same for energy storage. I'm on team Tesla on everything, but I have some doubts about these two\n\nIn the long term, after mining all the lithium we need and having a closed battery recycling ecosystem and having built all the electric trucks and infrastructure we need, ok, pure electric is the most efficient way. But the goal of Tesla is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, not to eventually reach max energetic efficiency at whatever cost. In terms of time and used resources, is electrifying everything really the way to go?\n\nProducing green hydrogen is all about reusing the existing infra structure as much as possible: Produce it from excess energy to stabilise the grid. Use it in place of natural gas in heavy industry, where it's needed anyway, using existing pipeline. Produce synthetic fuel for aviation and shipping instead of throwing away existing airplanes and airports, ships and seaports. And then trucks, if the hydrogen is there already, why not?\n\nSure there can be room for both. I'm just not sure if the cases where electric semi is a clear advantage over hydrogen and even ICE are enough to justify the footprint of producing them and if it can make a difference on a global scale, soon enough. (considering it's diverting the supply of lithium from passenger cars, where it can make a bigger difference)\n\nIn the US, trucking represents 20% of the emissions in the transportation sector, that in turn is 30% of the global emissions. That's 6% overall. Meanwhile heavy industry is responsible for 22% and electricity  generation for 27%. And Tesla itself is a contributer as long as it uses steel and plastics to build cars. Shouldn't we tackle that first? First get cheap electric cars to everyone. Done(?). Now work on electrolysers, carbon capture, fuel synthesis. Solve the other 50% on global scale before diverting resources to the 6%. \n\nAnd then there's SpaceX that needs to figure out how to synthesise methane anyway.\n\nIf the goal is to accelerate sustainability, a green hydrogen based supply of sustainable fuels within the current infra structure seems \"faster\" and actually scalable at global level, when compared to run everything on lithium batteries. The reason it's not happening naturally is because oil and NG is still too cheap in comparison, but governments could change that balance.\n\nIn short, I think the Tesla semi is more about \"making another great product\", maybe unnecessary, and less about the mission.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The so-called hydrogen economy is a gigantic waste of energy and requires to build up a totally new infrastructure to handle this product for fuel cells. \nYou certainly don't use the nat gas pipelines to transport hydrogen, since you need very specific material to prevent leaks and explosions. Same thing for storage tanks. Even stations need to be brand new with compressors etc.\nOn the energy side, the amount of renewable energy production capacity you need to build up to run cars and trucks is much more than the expected over-production of renewables in a grid designed to address other needs... If we were to generalize green H2 for trucks and cars it would divert those valuable renewable resources away from industrial processes that need to be electrified.\nWith regard to Big Oil and Gas, actually they are the ones lobbying for the H2 economy. Most of the H2 currently comes from methane and it will be the case for years to come. Then it would allow those companies to save their downstream business selling fuel to customers, which an EV future would certainly decimate.\nThe hype about it is just because they are first on the market (Hyundai etc.) but once Tesla Semi et al. are out, it's game over, just like the Toyota Mirai. The total costs of ownership will make it very clear. No doubt about it.\nI don't think H2 doesn't have a place in the energy transition, especially for industrial processes requiring particularly high temperatures like for glass production/recycling.

I mean no offense but they are short sighted. This is all true if you focus on the land transportation, particularly passenger cars. It's called hydrogen \"economy\" because it goes much beyond that. Forget about the Mirai and Nikola hydrogen stations. That's bullshit, no one is questioning that.\nHydrogen sounds cool, then you dig deeper and it's dumb, then you dig deeper and it makes sense again.\n\nLook at the pie of carbon emissions https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\nDirect emissions from industry is 22% of the pie. This excludes electricity generation that you could eventually replace with solar panels. This is for running heaters, boilers and direct use of pure industrial gases, hydrogen being one of them (other gases come from air distilation or can be sinthesysed from hydrogen and carbon). The most obvious use is steel production, but pick your product. Stuff can't be made off electricity alone.\n\nFirst we have to stop steam reforming to produce the hydrogen that we already use. Then we must replace the natural gas with synthetic methane, also made from green hydrogen. And then you can solve the aviation and rocket problem too. That's basically inverting the hydrogen production flow, using sunlight instead of the fossil energy stored in NG. That's the only way of reducing industry emissions based on \"first principles\". Electric trucks, grid batteries and solar panels is great, but won't make a dent in this particular problem, that is bigger than the transportation one. \n\nAssuming the hydrogen infrastructure is there, because we need the clean hydrogen anyway, wether to run trucks on hydrogen or electricity, in the end, is irrelevant. The consumed resources to produce those trucks may not be. The same applies to grid batteries Vs electrolysers.\n\nThe argument of the hydrogen economy being supported by \"big oil\" is also a shallow one. First what is \"big oil\"? Literally every industrialized country in the world is in the business of refining, storing and distributing gas and oil products, with various local and international  companies involved in that process. Otherwise your economy simply does not function. However only a few countries are actually in the business of extracting and exporting that oil and gas. Does big oil include your local energy company? For most countries in the world (excludes USA) a green hydrogen economy simply means cutting ties with the supplier and vertically integrate. That's why it makes sense to just re-purpose the NG pipeline. I'm very happy to see the oil industry of my country doing this instead of rooting for them to collapse and take the economy down with them. We have plenty of sunlight and sea water, we have a largely renewable grid that needs to be stabilized, and we have neither lithium mines nor gas or oil. That's the case for a very big chunk of the world. Btw, the main producers hydrogen and other industrial gases are companies like Linde, AirLiquide and Air Products (APD). They don't extract any oil, or gas, they just buy it from \"big oil\". Both airliquide and APD are making big commitments to sustainability.\n\nThis is a much harder argument to make in the US because they have their own supply of gas and oil. But the principle is the same. There's no sustainability without inverting the hidrogen flow and cleaning the Industry sector as well. Instead the US government is selling the idea of clean gas, which is the true dumb one. I think Elon/Tesla are the ones that could do something about it. It's a problem of taking something that is necessary and better, but economically unfavorable, and making it work with a profit. Just like electric cars.

Look up your local auction house and spend an evening or day at the Auction. It is fun and will help you understand why previous CEO\u2019s tanked this awesome company with their stupidity. Hammering a Diamond into a square hole.\n\nWorked for an auction house 4 years. If you go to a well run local auction you will see diverse people,  successful auction houses have a customer makeup like this:\n\n30% Hustlers and People involved with the auctions (Consignees etc)\n\n20% Rich people (Rich people love auctions and I\u2019m not talking about Sotherbys I\u2019m talking about a normal sized city weekly auction there will be lots of rich people there)\n\n40% Normal people that either like the thrill or value seekers.\n\n10% Poor People.\n\nThis is important when we talk about bad CEO decisions.  You have to know your audience.\n\nEbay started out with this dude selling a broken laser printer, Pierre Omidayer. It grew quickly and he brought in professional help. This can be a good thing as founders can get in the way of growth. In 1998 Meg Whitman was hired to be CEO.  Her tenure was unimpressive and she was responsible for the first of two massive blunders that decapitated eBay growth.\n\nEbay was growing and the internet was starting to get widespread use. By the early 2000s people started to talk about WEB 2.0 and for some reason certain people thought that WEB 2.0 meant being fancy.  Ebay did a massive redesign that was hated by most people.  Broadband internet was in it\u2019s infancy and the focus on form over function was frustrating for low bandwidth users as the fanciness was more complicated and took longer to load.  Additionally it stunted the pathway that would eventually appear for mobile growth.  The remnants of this design linger today.\n\n[Screen Cap of the AOLfication of eBay](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/ebay-2003) late 2003 I believe one of the big problems was rendering the menus in AJAX or something similar, very slow to load in that era\n\nHere we can see the failure in line graph form, (These things lag) eBay share price got hammered. One the reasons for the hammering was lackluster earnings, many ebay users attribute this to the redesign failure as it turned off existing and new customers.\n\n[Post redesign slow period earnings dip. ](https://preview.redd.it/n43u8jylxua51.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=960b6c4dc46579798d90f8e176027bea8db4df7c)\n\nProject Ugly-ify and Slow-ify eBay looks to have lopped off growth and momentum for the share price.  Meg Whitmans tenure at ebay neutered growth.\n\nOne could blame Whitman for doing a lot of damage to eBay growth but she will largely be forgotten after you learn about the FLAMING DUMPSTER FIRE OF A CEO that is John Donahoe.  In 2008 eBay hired Donahoe to be CEO.  This could possibly be the worst hire in the history of all hires.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it.  In 2014 Carl Icahn said eBay was the worst run company he had ever seen.\n\n[Carl Icahn says eBay is the worst run company he has ever seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/05/ebay-is-worst-run-company-i-have-ever-seen-carl-icahn.html)\n\nDonahoe had series after series of bad decision. He basically went to war with small and medium sellers (eBay\u2019s actual bread and butter customers) and went to great lengths to attract large corporate clients. (The worst type of business for eBay) and run away his most profitable customers. \n\neBay is a market place.\n\nDonahoe gave steep discounts in fees in order to attract corporate customers.\n\nCompanies like Target started to sell on eBays platform. (Most are now gone because within a few short years the internet was mature enough that they could start their own platforms)\n\n[Link to no longer existing eBay Target Store](http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewStoreV4&name=targetstore&_rdc=1)\n\nFee discounts to corporate customers angered existing sellers.\n\nIn early 2013 he implemented eBay\u2019s search algorithm (Cassini I believe it was called)  Previous to this Algo eBay was just a dumb search engine.  With the Algo, eBay could control visibility of items on the site via built in preferences like Best Match.  With this Donahoe is about to fire maybe 20% of his most profitable customers and give the Amazon marketplace a flood of new users.  This idiot was trying to turn an auction house into the next Amazon.  Instead he just put Amazon growth on steroids and shoots himself in the foot.\n\nCassini was used to ban eBay's customers. DROVES OF THEM\n\nDonahoe decided that any problems on eBay were caused by sellers and he declared war on the people that were his customers.\n\nEnter DSR.  Detailed seller ratings was eBay implementation of strict guidelines for their sellers. DSR = 4 categories, each category was rated 1-5 with 5 being good.  The system treated 1&2s as a failure.\n\nFor Example Customer was unhappy with an item they received for whatever reason.  If someone rated a part of the transaction a 2 they would get a ding against their DSR.  Problem is they treated all categories the same and the thresholds were very stringent.\n\nFor every 1000 transactions a seller had to have LESS than 10 dings in order to participate with Cassini without a search penalty.  If the 10 threshold was crossed (Which is 98.9% or less good rating) they would be penalized in the search standing and go under probation.  If they crossed 20/1000 or 97.9% or less positive approval rating they would BAN YOU FROM THE PLATFORM.\n\nYOU READ THAT CORRECTLY John DONAHOE in is infinite wisdom decided that sellers with as high as a 97.9% positive transaction rating were disposable. I've NEVER SEEN SOMETHING SO STUPID IN MY LIFE.\n\nI kid you not. Donahoe implemented a system where a 98.9% POSITIVE rating has a penalty and 97.9% positive is a ban. (Check the feedback on tons of Amazon marketplace sellers and you will see how ridiculous a threshold this was) What was even more ridiculous was in the beginning all categories were treated the same. For example Books were treated the same way as used women's clothing. Certain categories like womens clothing were DECIMATED by sellers being banned.  People who had been on the platform for a decade and had say a 97% positive feedback selling USED WOMENS CLOTHING were banned left and right.  It gets worse, remember how at 98.9% they would put you on probation? Some people called this the DEATH SPIRAL as if you were on probation the new \u201cBest Match\u201d system would lower your search standing.  So if you were some poor schmuck who had sold 397 used pieces of womens clothing that year and just 4 of them were unhappy with the experience. You\u2019d go on probation with little to no hope of anything other than the ban hammer.  I\u2019ve read many period era messageboard posts of long time sellers in probation trying to do EVERYTHING they could to raise their DSR to get out of probation but had zero visibility with the new algo, they were just left to wither on the vine hoping fruitlessly to turn things around. Most of them didn\u2019t know it YET but eventually as people started putting the pieces together there was no chance of them escaping the Death Spiral. Gaggles of people spent MONTHS trying to save their accounts and eventually most of them realized they were screwed, there was nothing they could do about it because of the Algos.  These sellers turned on ebay and took others with them.\n\nIf you notice during this time period AMAZON marketplace took off. Daddy Bezo\u2019s had a flood of experienced online traders who simply shifted their operations to the less popular (at the time) and more expensive platform (at the time).  It was either that or close shop. MANY CHOSE TO CLOSE SHOP.\n\nThe stupidity of all this was the Small and Medium sellers were the real money makers. eBay charges around a 9% fee with a cap of $250 per transaction.\n\nWhich is more profitable?\n\nTarget selling 50,000 items or 5,000 small to medium size sellers selling 100 items?\n\nThe answer is in the nature of marketplaces.  Target sells to 5,000 customers and that is the end of the story. Small to medium sized sellers tend to keep the money in the marketplace.  User A sells to user B for $100 User B can turn around and take that $100 and buy something he needs for himself or his business from user C, user C can then do the same. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.  Target selling $100 is a one way street while Small to Medium users can be a continuous money carousel.\n\nDonahoe in his infinite ignorance ran off many of his prime sellers. Ultimately sellers are your customers as they are the one\u2019s who pay the fees. He jump started his competition whom he was stupidly trying to emulate.  The important thing to understand about eBay is their product (An Auction) is easily scaleable and cheap to run\n\n[For example this Rolex](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1978-Rolex-MK4-Pepsi-1675-GMT-Maxi-Dial-/254628856737?epid=17038919251&hash=item3b491003a1%3Ag%3AEQYAAOSwMyBe66VL&LH_Auction=1&nma=true&si=TeM7ntP3DMfMhub%252FkeyT83ViFxA%253D&orig_cvip=true&nordt=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557)\n\ncosts about the same to service this listing for a rug\n\n[The Target deal, illustrated with a bathroom rug](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Mod-Target-Accent-Rug/143641586716?hash=item2171b4ac1c%3Ag%3AKdUAAOSwAtZe2bvY&LH_Auction=1)\n\nChasing these corporate dollars was infinitely stupid.\n\n1. They gave these corporations steep discounts to use the platform\n2. The internet was maturing and we were just a few years from all these corporations having their own web presence\n3. Robbed dollars and eyeballs from your bread and butter. Auction and Store listings of small to medium sellers.\n4. Robs future revenue from carousel customers who return money to the marketplace and gives it to corporate customers who do not return dollars and are using the dollars they make off you to build the infrastructure to replace you. DING DING DING\n\nThis Moron declared war on some of his best customers and tried to make eBay an ugly corporate shill and would eventually lead to the invasion of cheap Chinese stuff (eBay is now combating that)\n\nWe can see the results of his war on customers with this graph. eBay\u2019s growth and revenue was decimated by this idiot and you can see the results once the earnings were reported  (Which lagged the implementation of his stupidity)\n\n[War on paying customers displayed via line graph](https://preview.redd.it/vk9trlqqxua51.png?width=2358&format=png&auto=webp&s=814fdb86ea2f429d1fad882b505346951de97df0)\n\nDonohoe decapitated ebay right during what would have been it\u2019s prime growth years and funneled those customers to his biggest competitor.\n\neBay can make far more with less because of the nature of it\u2019s bread and butter customers. Many auction enthusiasts are high income types.  eBay has better demographics financially than it\u2019s competitors. There is even a fairly large industry of arbitrage where people sell items they source elsewhere (Like amazon) and basically drop ship them off as eBay sells because some stuff sells at a premium on eBay. \n\neBay CAN make more money per transaction compared to similar industries and can capture a significant amount of money to return within the marketplace. Similar to sales tax, that dollar can bounce around within the marketplace and eBay can take it\u2019s 9% cut every time it switches hands.\n\nInteresting side rabbit hole that arises during the Donahoe years.  Donahoe was obsessed with attacking his own customers.  This was commonly followed in an industry blog called AuctionWeb and then eventually named ecommercebytes.  Run by the Steiner Couple\n\n[Here is an article their website published about them getting rid of sellers](https://www.ecommercebytes.com/2013/11/06/suspended-ebay-sellers-suggest-widespread-purge/)\n\nThey reported on all of eBay\u2019s policy changes and basically called them out for being the giant window lickers they were.  It ruffled a few feathers within the organization and now 6+ employees of eBay are being charged with crimes like harassment and stalking.  Really a crazy story. DONAHOE is to blame for the policies and culture that allowed this to happen.  He should go to jail over just what he did to the share price.\n\n[Crazy eBay Criminal Stalking](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/06/18/brian-gilbert-santa-clara-police-ebay.html)\n\n[More Crazy eBay Harassment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ebay-harassment-campaign-pig-cockroach-blog-11593009038)\n\nDuring all of this foot shooting was when Carl Icahn said that eBay was THE WORST RUN COMPANY HE HAD EVER SEEN\n\nOne of the problems was the incestuous nature of eBay\u2019s relationship with Paypal and the board members who presided over both.  They basically spent a decade doing what was best for the board and not what was best for the Shareholders, employees and customers of eBay.\n\nThis is now not so much a problem because many of those relationships no longer exist. In the aftermath the other pieces have found increased market value and eBay has been suppressed due to it being stuck with all the burdens of the Donahoe administration and bad perception.\n\neBay should have been worth more as an individual piece and it\u2019s was the one who took the financial hits.\n\nPayPal Split in 2015\n\nPayPal has a 113 P/E (I\u2019m not saying this is the best metric to judge a company I\u2019m just using it for illustration)\n\n[If eBay traded at Paypal P/E it would be worth $660](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/pypl)\n\nSo what\u2019s the catalyst to the eBay Rocket Ship that is about to take off?\n\nCORONA.  Corona is shaking up the whole economy and this shake up will jolt eBay to it\u2019s full potential.\n\nOver the past 4 months as far as I can tell eBay has increased traffic by as much as 18%+ which is pretty AMAZING for a very mature internet company.  Even more amazing when you take into account that this is normally eBays slow period. Traffic is normally on the downturn. YOY I am curious how much busier they have been I'm guessing 45% YOY increase in traffic for the Month of May & June\n\n[Rising against the tide of eBay's traditional slow period ebb.  At this location on traffic rankings even a 3&#37; increase WITH the tide is impressive.](https://preview.redd.it/jriimv47yua51.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e226c0e726df301803c37591b66cd54d8350477)\n\nApril May June July are eBay\u2019s 4 slowest months and the July 28th earnings will encompass 3 of those 4 months. During the slowest time of year eBay went from the mid 50\u2019s to the lower 40\u2019s for it\u2019s spot in total Internet Traffic. A HUGE shift against the normal tide of business cycles.\n\n[Traffic for last 90 days. Up much more over entire Corona Period](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ebay.com) the increase looks more bigly when you view 150 days out\n\nI've spent a few hours trawling eBay seller message boards. Within this quarter I have heard of increases in per transactions and a decrease in \"Best Offers\" which means better margins for sellers and more fees for eBay. I attribute this to Corona disrupting normal supply chains. eBay has been established for many years so boomers when they can\u2019t find something are like \"Oh Yeah EBAY.\" Many sellers report increased sells in business related categories and more aged inventory being sold as parts of the market shift towards online from some of the traditionally Bricks and Mortar industries.  eBay has a very successful and well made app.  Sellers are seeing increased usage amongst younger buyers/sellers whom are either bored with the lockdowns or looking for side income after losing their jobs.  Remember when we mentioned 500 small sellers being worth more than one big corporate client?  This will be obtained with an army of people using the app on their cell phones.  Corona is going to get the attention of customers they lost over the years as they come back to the platform they remember, millennials and new users when they discover the well made app will come online. I've added the eBay App to my phone it is very good and has very customizable search features. \n\nThe Bear case for eBay is even more, if Corona turns out to be worse (It\u2019s not) everything online just becomes more valuable.\n\nSo what is eBay worth?\n\nWell it\u2019s a better investment IMO than Paypal\n\n[eBay valued like Paypal is worth $660](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/pypl)\n\nMercardo Libre is worth more than eBay (This is a Crime) as it is not even a top 1000 worldwide website while eBay is top 50. Plus it doesn\u2019t even turn a profit.  If you have any MELI stock sell half of it and buy eBay in addition to whatever you would buy if you didn't own MELI do the same for PayPal as well IMO.\n\n[If eBay was valued like MELI it would be worth Tesla numbers](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/meli?mod=DNH_S)\n\nMercardo Libre has a 25% bigger market cap than eBay and doesn\u2019t turn a profit. Ebay would be $76 a share just to be on par with MELI and it shouldn\u2019t even be in the same ballpark.\n\nEtsy is just outside of the Top 100 for web traffic and has a 181 P/E if eBay was trading like ETSY it would be trading at $1090 a share\n\n[If eBay was valued like ETSY it would trade for $1090](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/etsy)\n\nChannel Advisor is a company that grew out of offering services for eBay and while it works on multiple platforms it\u2019s use was born from eBay and it has a 60 P/E\n\n[If trading like Channel Advisor it would be worth $363](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnys/ecom?mod=DNH_S)\n\nCorona shifted a lot of users to the eBay marketplace because of busted supply chains.  They now have an Okay website and an EXCELLENT APP.  This increased use comes during the traditional low tide of eBay traffic and if eBay leans into the coming quarters their revenue is going to skyrocket. Corona was the catalysts to wake everybody up to what eBay could do and what it should be worth. EBAY should be one of the most profitable companies in the US economy with lots of room to improve the bottom line. It has all the pieces.\n\nLike\n\nSelling off some of the MANY side projects under the eBay umbrella\n\nStreamlining Employment\n\nJust this month they are integrating their own payment platform which should add 1-2% more to every sell which is a big deal considering that the average fee is around 9%. We are talking about maybe 20% added to revenue with not much changing. BIG MONEY\n\nWinning back Small to Medium sellers and improving the per item transaction is eBay's ticket to tendie town. All the new growth they are experiencing is exactly what they need and want. They have a good App that can capitalize on the reboot.\n\neBay has ample room for growth and I suspect the income levels of buyers in the marketplace is higher than competitors like Amazon, Etsy, Overstock, Stitch Fix.  eBaY has more people with money paying attention.\n\nNew CEO seems to be a bright guy.  All he has to do is not SHOOT HIMSELF IN THE FOOT like the Donahoe CEO.   If successful eBay will be on the moon mission of all moon missions\n\nMOST UNDERVALUED TECH COMPANY IN AMERICA. As always my DMs are open and I do mercenary stuff. I have my position and I am currently buying shares with a goal of 303 shares before earnings.\n\nI suspect this thing will have VERY little resistance upon takeoff\n\n[Little Resistance](https://preview.redd.it/mb0c74vvxua51.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=641636d009ea1b880045bdec44690605d4567e24)\n\nBUY 11 \u2013 101 \u2013 1001 Shares Depending on Bankroll (I like shares on this one, I like the company and I'm expecting dividends) Once this rocket settles it is covered call selling time.
