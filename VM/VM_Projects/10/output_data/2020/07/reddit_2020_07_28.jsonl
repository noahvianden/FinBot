(also experimenting with CDS/PDS)\n\nNowadays did couple of good trades where I\u2019ve collected full premium at expirations, but also I made couple of mistakes.\n\nMain goal is choosing \u201elow cost\u201c ETFs and Stocks (UAL, BAC, JNJ,..) to be able to buy at least 2 contracts with 5 days expiration and let it expire below or above my sell option to collect full premium.\n\nI have also figured that the premium is better when buying the spread on Friday than on Monday and also it is better for making price action than on Monday eveninng. Togethar with that I am looking at:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Price action\n* PUT CALL Ratio and IV graph for      specific expiration\n* KOYFIN Estimates and NEWs (not making      any trade based on news, only to be aware what to expect in upcoming week)\n* Earnings (if there are any which      could impact the ETF \u2013 f.e.: trading IWM in the week where BlackRock has to      report earnings and so on)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think that this setup is a good aproach ?\n\nShould I add something in to this process which could also help me ?

The dump in gold also helped the dollar rebound from two-year lows.\n\nAfter rising almost $40 higher at one point to reach $1,980 an ounce, gold was hit by a wave of selling which it pushed back to $1,915 in volatile trade. Gold is still up over $125 in little more than a week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will reaffirm its accommodating policies at its meeting this week, and perhaps signal a tolerance for higher inflation in the long run.\n\n\"Fed officials have made clear that they will be making their forward guidance more dovish and outcome-based soon,\" wrote analysts at TD Securities. \u201cThe chairman is likely to continue the process of prepping markets for changes when he speaks at his press conference.\u201d One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014 **Top Overnight News** \u2014\n\n* Senate Republicans presented their $1 trillion plan to bolster the pandemic-ravaged U.S. economy with a package that that didn\u2019t completely settle differences within the GOP\n* Gold\u2019s record-breaking rally showed signs of losing steam after futures touched $2,000 an ounce for the first time\n* The European Central Bank urges banks to hold off on returning capital to shareholders and show moderation in setting bonuses amid the coronavirus outbreak in a blow to some lender\n* China\u2019s \u201cbat woman\u201d says the U.S. president owes her country an apology as she again denied assertions that the novel coronavirus is linked to the Wuhan lab where she works\n* Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez lashes out in response to the U.K. ratcheting up its travel ban to Spain to include popular holiday islands\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014 **Trade Of The Day** \u2014\n\nThe game of musical chairs continues with large-cap tech stocks; eventually the music will stop playing and no seats will be found before prices drop, but until that event occurs, most of the market gains are coming from this sector.\n\nToday's Trade of the Day comes via NVDA who does not report earnings until August 13th. [It's set up in a flag formation with a lot of potential energy, ready to break](https://i.imgur.com/QCgwuCk.png). And as we've seen lately, stocks are breaking BEFORE their earnings date.\n\nHere are two potential plays:\n\n1. What makes trading NVDA a challenge, like every other big-cap tech stock, is the price of $415/share. If you don't define a stop loss, then buying just ONE share at $415 represents the maximum 2% account risk for a $21k account! This is where fractional shares can come to the rescue for small accounts. I can define a fixed dollar amount in Robinhood (or other brokers supporting fractional shares) and they will create a fractional share position equivalent to my investment. For example, if I wanted to create a [$40 NVDA position, then Robinhood would grant me .096 shares of NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/hKtKSEA.png).\n2. Alternatively, I could still leverage the gains/losses of a [100-share NVDA position](https://i.imgur.com/QjJHWkf.png) by trading a **vertical options spread using the 28AUG option series**, going **long the $415 call** and simultaneously **selling the $417.5 call** as \"insurance.\" This trade *allows me to cap my risk at $125/contract*, which would represent a max 2% risk to a $6250 account.\n\nDisclaimer \u2014 This is a trade idea meant to help anyone learning options or looking for outside opinion, not an instruction manual for what to do with your money.

To my surprise even Bitcoin saw similar break downs.\n\nIt's nice to see that the precious metals, BTC, and bonds are currently moving up while the market is trading somewhat sideways, but it seems that in a true black swan event that nothing is truly safe other than a bet to the downside (or cash, but the assumption is we have trades open).\n\nI'm waiting for the VIX to be somewhere around 15 or lower to start up with a VIX far OTM call hedge.  Essentially targeting around a 0.5%-1% drag on any of my open position risk.  \n\nSo here's kind of the things I'm seeing for considering:\n\n1. Trade smaller - Cap your position risk for each trade to have a max loss no more than 1%-5% of your portfolio.  At 5% it means you'd have a really hard time of experiencing sequence risk of 20 full losers back to back, rather than the risk of having 3-4 losers back to back if you're risking 20% or more in each trade.   As a guideline I look to never exceed 5% ever, but currently I've been more stringent these past few weeks at around 2%-3% max risk in each trade, and will look to scale back to 5% per position as needed after higher volatility events (market drops).\n2. A bearish Collar trade - Think of putting on a Call Credit Spread with very tight defined risk on an underlying much higher than it's current price say 1-2 standard deviations higher.  Then you're using that credit you take in to buy a put 1-2 standard deviations lower than the current price.  Basically the time decay of your credit spread should fund the purchased put's time decay.  This also has it's risks and could be a drag on the portfolio overall, but you can also experiment with making them all puts (put credit spread, and an insurance put purchase super far below, risk is Max loss on your spread, but it basically an insurance trade).\n3. VIX call hedge.\n\nLately I've been keeping my orders on the higher side (to collect more credit) and am okay if they're not filled as people need to start seeing that cash is actually a position also.
