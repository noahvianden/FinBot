{"title": "When to roll a covered call?", "selftext": "I've new to selling options and I've been wheeling AMD for a few weeks now and Friday was assigned on my CSP at 56, this morning I wrote a covered call with a strike of 56 for 1.06 premium expiring this Friday. It was ATM so the premium was good for a weekly and AMD typically hits resistance in this range. However today AMD closed at 57.46, which is a greater gain than the 106 dollar premium I collected on the covered call. \n\nI've never rolled a call before, I'm assuming what this means is I'd be closing my current short 7/24 56c and realizing the loss while opening a new covered call with a higher strike and further expiration. For example I could sell the 57.5 call expiring Aug 21st for 4.00, and the difference between the realized loss and the new premium would be roughly 300 dollars. But this would only be a good idea if I assumed that AMD would stay in this range in a month from now right? However it would reduce my cost basis by 3 dollars which sounds nice, and if the price dipped back down to the 56 level I could close both the share position and the call for a profit.\n\nThe only caveat here is that AMD has earnings on July 28th, but the price seems to consistently go down post earnings (but during covid times anything can happen lol), so maybe I should wait til we're closing to the date and possibly collect more premium when I roll due to increased IV?\n\nThoughts and advice? Am I overlooking anything here? If I chose to do nothing and had my shares called away I'd still be hitting my goal of $100 per week on my 10k account, but if I can make more in this situation I'd like to of course, thanks for the help!", "id": "huulb4", "created_utc": 1595281801.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "The stock went above your covered call - that's the win scenario.

All it was supposed to do was change the feel of the aircraft under normal flight conditions.  If it failed, oh well the aircraft feels different but there would have been enough authority from the elevators to overcome a malfunctioning MCAS.  The issue is Boeing decided to fix a stall issue by increasing the amount of authority available to MCAS.  It went from being about as serious as an \u201ceco mode\u201d malfunction in a car, to a flight critical feature.  I\u2019d put dollars to donuts that someone thought, \u201chey, maybe we should do a risk assessment on any time we change a system\u2019s application\u201d, but either was told there\u2019s not enough time / have to look out for shareholders / don\u2019t make a scene or that it\u2019s not part of the process to do a risk assessment twice.\n\nAll that to say, if there\u2019s an MCAS system on other aircraft with only one AoA, it might not actually need fixing.  But I wouldn\u2019t bet on there not being other issues not even related to MCAS on other aircraft.  NTSB / FAA are great about not just asking \u201cwhat other planes have this system and what risk is there?\u201d But also \u201ctell us every instance where a system has had scope changes.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been on the equivalent of Boeing\u2019s side of the table before, thankfully with no deaths, and the things auditors can find when they know something\u2019s up is scary.
