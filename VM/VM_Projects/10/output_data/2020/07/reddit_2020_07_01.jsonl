As long as your short call has a theta of more than that, you will cover the theta decay of your long ITM call.

You will take a loss on the short call, but the profit from the long call should cover it (see below). I would close this out prior to expiration to avoid assignment risk. \n\nOne aspect that makes this strategy different from a covered call is that greeks play an important role, given that you have two options. This strategy is technically a diagonal spread, and will not exactly mimic a covered call. Gamma plays a big role. Your max profit occurs at the strike of the short call. Above that strike, gamma is higher for your short call, and thus that call's delta will increase faster than your deep ITM long call--your short call's delta approaches 1 more quickly than your deep ITM long call. This will mean that your profit will slowly decrease. \n\nThere are some scenarios where if the underlying rises too high, you could face a loss. For instance for very long dated LEAP that is not deep ITM. In this case, the starting delta of the long dated option will be too small and it's gamma too low. For instance, if your long option delta is only 60 and your short option is like 90, you can have a scenario where you lose money as the stock rises.\n\nOne of the positive ways the greeks help with this strategy is also related to the gamma of the long deep ITM option.

Consoles are now, more than ever, capable of storing multiple full games. Even then, if someone wanted a physical copy they'd just go on Amazon.

You morons cured my depression(at least some symptoms) and increased my networth by 30%. \n\nI hailed the call of the mother ship early march after reading the bloomberg article. My RH account was approved on 3rd april(SPY @ 248) and I bought 240p 5/1. That was also the day SPY started skyrocketing and I kept catching the falling knife. I became even more depressed as I was down about 2.5k which for me was money with which I could have paid 200$ extra pm and not lived in a basement(not kidding, I actually live in a basement). I eventually let go of it and closed it at 2k loss and learnt a bunch of things to not do. \n\nAfter a day SHOP tanked and I rode the 510p while going down and 800c while going up next morning. This almost recouped my lossed and I decided to never again put more than 10% of my portfolio(7k) into options. Since then I have mostly traded spreads. \n\nOne strategy that works for me although it must be used by lot of other people is I look at the 1 months, 1 week, 1 year performance of companies in the same sector and it shows a divergence for one stock in a weekly/monthly chart and there are no fundamental reasons for it I buy a 1-2 month OTM call. I did this for twtr and FB last week and broke my rules on catching the knife, but  I had conviction. Over the week I had accumulated 250 contacts 35c 7/17 at avg price of 0.16$ and just one FB 230c 9/5 9.60$. Sold this morning @.21 per contract at market open and fb at 17.  \n\nI know this is peanuts for a lot of you but even after taxes this is a lot of money for me. Slowly transitioning into thetagang but I am stil too poor for that. \n\nThank you all for the laughs each night. I am gonna go to chick-fil-a now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jviiolwxia851.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=352b874588e6475891f7d1e3b623efc684bc1480\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gq80kwcxia851.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f150768459e8779f08f95c87a1e7d1a0708a2d4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgq4kerwia851.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=001c5d85d50818ebefee2f74154c8c4468d216bd", "id": "hjgmjk", "created_utc": 1593630029.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "A W is a W my dude", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "you just gave me FOMO on W today :\\~", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4645887017250061}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19529476761817932}, {"body": "too low but ill give you an upvote", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "thanks!  \nyeah ik.

Motivating for me. When I got into options I was up $3000 (30% of my portfolio) on a put and didn\u2019t sell it cause I had no idea wtf I was doing. Then I kept buying puts expecting market to crash. Long story short I lost everything but $200.\n\nI since then realized the key was management. I was buying shit and not documenting how much I had. At one point bought six options with no foresight and saw me losing $1000 a day. No stop losses, and no idea of what percentage I would cash out at.\n\nThen I realized that, if I was to cash out at 20% gains 35 times with 200 dollars, I would reach $25k. So I built a chart in excel where I document my investment to cash portfolio (Max is at 50%), target return (20% base) and expectations for the month.\n\nIf I make more than 20% on a return, I leave it in my cash portfolio. This helps me feel safer about my next bet (so I don\u2019t make emotional trades) and if I\u2019m feeling froggy I\u2019ll split the difference between cash portfolio and my next trade\n\nBeautiful part is, as the portfolio grows, so does the savings (assuming positive), which gives a bigger and bigger cushion.\n\nAnd you want a big cushion. It\u2019ll keep you from making emotional moves, makes you feel more secure in case your portfolio gets eradicated from multiple bad trades, and can give you freedom to buy at better positions when they arrive (average down).\n\n100% of your portfolio being invested at a time is a big no-no.
