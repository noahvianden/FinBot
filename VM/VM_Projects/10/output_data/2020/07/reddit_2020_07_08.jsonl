{"title": "WMT vs AMZN?", "selftext": "\nFor Trading JULY 8th\n \n \nJOLTs 5.4 vs. 5 Million\n \nNVAX gets $1.6B from BARDA\n \n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP\u2019s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP\u2019s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight\u2019s video about the S&P is very telling, I think, with the S&P only 2% off its high, the median S&P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.\n \nWe sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today\u2019s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM", "id": "hn7na3", "created_utc": 1594171585.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "I didn't read any of this.\n\nGo buy shares of both.

{"title": "Weekly CSPs for income", "selftext": "I've been trading a strategy that I'd love to get feedback on. It has been very successful over the last 4 months but I'm afraid I may be missing something because it seems too easy so far which means it's very likely I'm doing something that is overly risky or misunderstood. I get that this is a great market but I'm trying to get honest feedback as to whether this is a dangerous or simplistic strategy in \"normal\" markets. What I'm doing:  \nSelling puts typically at only 1 or 2 week DTE at a delta of between 8 and 15 with an IV between 40 and 100. I only sell at a probability of profit +80% and a minimum of 20% annualized return- with the short duration it can be much higher. I also try to find good support levels to set my strike under and select stocks in a strong uptrend. My win rate has been over 95% as far as having to roll.  \nFor example today I sold a NVDA $380 put for this Friday for $1.00 at a -12 delta and a POP of 89%. So it seems like a solid likelihood I can make it three days without it dropping ITM.  \nWhat's wrong with this deep OOTM and very short DTE strategy? I understand many people go 20-45 days at a higher delta which just seems to a noob like me that it's a long time for something to go wrong but I might be thinking of that the wrong way. Experienced traders I respect seem to focus on 30-45 days DTE at a higher delta like 30- has that strategy been shown to have a higher expectancy?

Sure. In an IRA is one popular example. Does it make sense for your particular situation?

The only accounts I have that are not margin accounts are those that are not allowed to be a margin account, like my IRA.  And yet, the number of margin loans and margin calls I've had are both zero.\n\n> I am considering only trading highly liquid stocks like AMD and working with different strategies until i learn the ropes. How did you guys start out and what became your best strategy?\n\nThere is a chicken/egg problem to solve. Ideally, you know all the strategies and then can pick the best one to fit an opportunity for an underlying. That would allow you to say, \"I want to trade AMD,\" and then pick the best strategy for that decision. But when you are starting out, you don't know all the strategies yet, so you have to kind of do the reverse: start with the strategy you are learning, pick an underlying that is the best fit.\n\nSo set aside the idea of \"I'm trading AMD.\" First, decide what strategy you want to learn, then you can ask which underlying best fits that strategy. For example, a covered call is where many people who are stock trades/buy&holders start. For that, you want an underlying that goes mostly sideways. AMD actually fits that description since April, in a $50-$60 range, but in prior years it does not.\n\nFor many strategies, including long put/call and vertical spreads, starting out with ETFs or indexes is usually a less risky way to get your feet wet. A call debit spread on SPY or SPX, for example.

Options are actually very stupid because they are time-limited and decay.\n\nIf you buy a 2 week option and the stock does go up and then down after 1 week, you'll probably lose that opportunity window to sell it at a profit. (unless news comes out the last few days before your option expires and the stock flies up the last few days a lot..) That is how fast options decay and change in price.\n\n\nSo you need to be almost baby sitting them due to the computers very quickly buying and selling options as well as you need to have bought options when they are cheap.\n\nSo try only buying options that are $0.75 or less to start and try to find those that have 2-weeks to 1 month expiration out.\n\n\nYou will want to choose strikes that are realistic.\n\nFor example, SPY is at 314 right now.. Don't buy $355 strike calls.. Buy the $323 calls instead... the chances of SPY going to $320 are much better and will actually make you profit should you catch it at the right time.\n\n\nBuy the $310 puts for 2 weeks as Spy has a good chance of going to or below $310.. \n\nsee what I mean? \n\nI would look at the options that are 1 month out from now.  and Buy 1 of each, a put and a call, but look for the prices Like I explained earlier, Look for these:\n\nYou may ask yourself how can I find options for $0.75!?  well you buy in spreads.\n\nSo you buy the 322 call and then sell a $323 call! That is called a call debit spread.  So you buy an option at one strike, then sell the option at the next strike..\n\nMake sense?\n\nLook at these and notice the expiration, cost, max loss, max profit, they are small, but you can buy many of them, like for example 10 etc.. \n\n\nhttps://ibb.co/6gxv3Fg\n\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Nm4dJ7J", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.12165258079767227}, {"body": "HTZ $2c 7/17", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$5c 7/17", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7343511581420898}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06545976549386978}, {"body": "https://www.prtradingresearch.com/simple-options-guide-52.php \n\nAll you have to do is give an email to them and the. unsubscribe when you get the pdf.
