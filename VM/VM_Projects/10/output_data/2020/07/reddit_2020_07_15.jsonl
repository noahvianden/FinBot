They are a slow-moving vehicle and not necessarily completely understood in detail even by those who do use them.\n\n>If I do it again next week I cut my premium down from $17.71 by $2 week one and another $7.63 thus cutting my premium down by almost half and still with a max profit of $14.99.\n\nI don't know how you can calculate your max profit. One of the defining features of calendars is that you can't establish a max profit when you put the trade on, since you are working with 2 different volatilities (front and back expiration). The best you can do is get an approximation and even then if conditions change drastically your numbers will be off. If you look at a vertical spread for example, no matter what the market does, your max profit and max losses don't change and are easily obtained prior to putting the trade on.\n\n>I\u2019m just wondering as a beginner why I didn\u2019t do this earlier. Am I missing something?\n\nAhh, the feeling of finding something that seems too good to be true.... What you are missing is that the same mechanism that is giving you profits if the underlying pins or is around your strike price (bigger theta in the front expiration) is the same mechanism that will kill your trade if the underlying price moves violently (bigger gamma in the front expiration). Mind you, your max loss IS INDEED defined and is the initial debit you pay when you establish the trade.\n\nAnother feature that you didn't mention is that traders look at a trade that is both POSITIVE theta and also POSITIVE Vega and they seem to have found the holy grail. The truth is more complicated than that. I actually looked at this very topic in this video:\n\n[https://youtu.be/S7CBoNHqo9U](https://youtu.be/S7CBoNHqo9U)\n\nThis is not to say that calendars don't have their place in someone's portfolio. When you want a trade that is aiming for a narrow range of the underlying with some theta working in your favor, and with defined risk (max loss) you can go for calendar spreads.
