{"title": "Toronto-Dominion ($TD) is Undervalued, Long-Term Buy (and Banks in general)", "selftext": "I was going to write something super long and windy, but I'll keep things short and sweet.\n\n**Overall Investing Thoughts:**\n\n**I personally feel like people are way too crazy and overhyped about Tech & Healthcare stocks rn when both of these sectors are extremely overvalued.** I probably scroll past 20 posts **per day** about whether Microsoft at X price on X date is a good buy before I call it quits haha.\n\nNonetheless, I feel like **one of the sectors being overlooked is Banks/Financials**, due to the nature of Federal policies/interventions and other detrimental affects of the Big Rona on business and loan repayments.\n\nObviously **in the SHORT-TERM**, these companies are going to face hardships and rocky-seas, however if you are **long-term investor**, these companies are at a pretty solid sale. \n\nAs good ole, Warren Buffet says: \n\n>\"It's better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price\"\n\nI believe that some top financial banks are at a good sale to be held onto for the long-term. Heck, even Buffet increased his stakes in Bank of America just recently. (Although I will say I think BAC is a little overvalued rn)\n\n**JPM** is a strong company I'll mention that is at a decent sale at a **23% Margin of Safety (MOS)** at it's current price point, as well as **Royal Bank of Canada ($RY)**. I will note that $RY is **only at a 15% MOS** and I don't have any positions in $RY, but I would have if: 1) I didn't already have too many bank stocks, 2) I didn't like TD more, and 3) if I had more capital since I'm a small time, young \"investor\". \n\n\\*I got my MOS from Gurufocus's DCF calculator\\*\n\nBut I digress...\n\n**TD Snapshot:**\n\n26MM global customers, 2300+ locations, retail-banking focused company, and 3 Business Segments: Canadian Retail (60% of revenue), U.S. Retail (28% of revenue) and Wholesale Banking (12% of revenue). \n\nRelevant news is the Charles-Schwab + TD Ameritrade Merger. Don't think this really has an affect on TD since TD Ameritrade is a separate *BUT RELATED* entity to TD, but I thought this should be mentioned. \n\n*From Yahoo Finance:*\n\n**PE (TTM): 9.97**\n\n**PB (MRQ): 1.26**\n\n**EPS (TTM): 4.52**\n\n*From Seeking Alpha:*\n\n**Dividend Yield: 5.04%** \n\n**Quarterly payouts of $0.5815** (equals $2.27 annually per share)\n\n**10% Annualized Dividend Growth** [(here)](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2020/2020-Q2_QuickFacts_F_EN.pdf)\n\nThe dividend yield and its historical growth is really solid for this company at this price point. Probably the best bang for your buck when compared to its counterpart, $RY.\n\nAnother reason I chose $TD over $RY is mainly due to the international exposure. TD is in the process of expanding their network in the United States, which will give it a diverse stream of revenue and growth for the future of retail banking. \n\nTo the best of my noobie investing abilities, their balance sheet looks strong, and they've had consistent and steady growth in their revenue and cash flow. Management is also very strong and I'm confident in how they've been handling TD in recent years.\n\nDespite the stock being flat since 2017 at $60, I think the dividends will pay for itself if that happens again and just means that if you get in now at $45 you can hope to gain at least $15 in the long-term when it returns to $60 (this is my subjective opinion)\n\nBeing one of the Top 2 Banks in Canada, I don't really think the Canadian government would let this company go under (if it ever does) and the same can be said about their other top bank $RY. I equate these 2 companies to Bank of America and JPM in the U.S., respectively. \n\nLike with other banks, their Q2 and future Quarterly earnings look bleak. And I think we won't see much stock appreciation for another 2-5 years. However, given how strong TD's financials, management and positioning have been, they are really undervalued in this current market.\n\nBased on Gurufocus, they have a **fair value of $71, giving them a MOS of 37%.** \n\nI'm not smart enough to do my own DCF calculations, but I do trust Gurufocu's calculations enough which I back up with my own DD.\n\nReally happy to discuss this stock or how to analyze bank stocks in general since I'm still learning. Enjoy!\n\n**TL;DR: $TD is a Long-Term BUY that has solid growth, management, dividends, and financials. Its current price at $45 makes it extremely undervalued and I think it has more upside in the long-term.**", "id": "hyk071", "created_utc": 1595817345.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I don't disagree with you cause the same situation can be said about the U.S. and our banks. \n\nHence at least for me, this is a pretty long play.

Big bloated companies like Intel do get complacent and evil and have setbacks but how realistic is it to dismiss that kind of advantage. How does AMD scale up production when they don\u2019t control it, especially when Intel is going to partially outsource to TSM along with AMD and NVIDIA and they all will have to share equally (assuming TSM doesn\u2019t prioritize Intel since Intel has more money and market share). It seems like there\u2019s a ceiling there especially in data center which is Intel\u2019s top focus.

{"title": "Day Trading Strategy.", "selftext": "When I first started trading I looked for the perfect strategy, 3 years have passed and I haven't found the \"holy grail\" strategy.\n\nBut I did find a pretty good one. One of the major problems beginners have is when should they buy or sell a stock? What do you EXACTLY do?\n\n\nThe Strategy:  Heikin Ashi + Stochastic RSI.\n\n\nHeikin Ashi is a wonderful chart type that cuts major noise. It's a lot different than your regular candlestick charts. You get a series of green/red candles and the calculation is quite different.\n\nStep 1. I look at the trend of the Major index.\n\nI live in India, so I track Nifty50, you may track your country's index (Dow or something). I look for the trend and confirm the trend on multiple setups.\n\nIf the stock has positive correlation with the market, and the market is up, I look for buying opportunities.\n\nIf the market (index) is down, I look for shorting opportunities. The correlation with the market matters.\n\nSome stocks have negative correlation i.e. The market goes up and the stock goes down. If the stock has positive correlation and the market is up, I usually avoid shorting.\n\n\nStep 2. The Trend of the Stock.\n\nYou can use something as simple as the 50 or the 200 simple moving average to find the trend of the stock.\n\nAfter that I draw a few support and Resistance zones on the chart. Not a lot, usually around 3,maybe 4 occasionally.\n\n\nStep 3. Confirm the trend.\n\nI use a 4x time frame chart to confirm the trend. For day trading I use 15 minute chart and I confirm the trend on a 1 hour chart.\n\nFor swing trading you can use 30 minute chart and confirm the trend on the 4 hour chart.\n\nIf the 15 min chart is bullish and the 4 hour chart is bearish, I avoid trading.\n\n\nStep 4. Use Heikin Ashi.\n\nThe rules of heikin ashi are simple, two continuous closed red candles = bearish trend and two closed continuous green candles = bullish.\n\nThere are other rules regarding the size of the candle and the trend.\n\n\nStep 5. Stochastic RSI.\n\nI use the default setting usually, and if the RSI is below 30 and rising up, when the heikin ashi has closed two green candles, I buy. \n\nWhen the stochastic RSI is above 70, coming down, and there are two red candles on Heikin Ashi, I sell. \n\n\nStep 6. Entry. \n\nThe 4th and the 5th point will give you the entry signal. I use a stop-loss above the high of the candle (previous) or some other way. \n\nThe risk is always less than 2%, if my capital is 10,000 the risk per trade is less than 200 bucks. \n\nTo find out the number of shares to buy you can watch my video on position sizing, or any other video on YouTube. \n\n\nStep 7. Exit. \n\nWhen the trend continues and I see an area of resistance (long trade) I exit my position.\n\nOr when two continuous red candles are closed on Heikin Ashi. If the candles are red but the size is very small, I don't exit.\n\nExit= Major Support /Resistance or two continuous closed candles in the opposite direction with decent size.\n\n\nSome Thoughts.\n\n\nThe Win Rate of this strategy is theoretically 80%, but in real trading it falls to 65-70% considering that your stop loss is hit.\n\nThat's still a good success rate. The risk reward is usually uncertain but it's above 1.5:1 (usually).\n\nThe more rules you add, the lesser opportunities you get.\n\nIf 2 rules out of the 7 rules are violated, or if a major rule is violated, I DON'T TRADE.\n\nThis definitely decreases the opportunities I get, but my win rate is higher and I am more confident with my trade.\n\nYou can modify the strategy according to what works for you. I learnt it from my mentor and made a couple of changes.\n\nThis may not work on every stock (no strategy does) and it is good in TRENDING MARKET. In a sideways market it either doesn't give signals or doesn't work.\n\n-Vikrant C.\n\n\nEdit: I'm thinking of making a video on this strategy along with examples, comment below if that is something you'll be interested in.", "id": "hywp4a", "created_utc": 1595870977.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "You should make this into a program that you can run automatically.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, this would be interesting to run.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3766207695007324}, {"body": "Yeah, but I lack programming skills.

Incredibly cheap for a WFH stock and obviously while it doesn\u2019t deserve a skyrocket premium like ZM or SHOP, it deserves a higher valuation than a 5x sales multiple vs a 30x plus average for most WFH tech software stocks\n\n- Consistently beat earnings EVERY quarter. On a probability basis, we are probably looking at another beat for Q2.\n\n- There really isn\u2019t a lot being priced in for Q2 earnings. Dropbox CFO was maintaining guidance during Q1 earnings minus an adjustment for FX fluctuations and interest rate reductions. That means Q2 earnings expectations aren\u2019t pricing in a revenue boost from COVID, despite a 60% increase in daily trial signups across all their subscription tiers.\n\n- Obviously being a WFH stock, there\u2019s a good narrative surrounding Dropbox on top of the solid fundamentals. Many stocks that outperformed peers during Q1 had a great narrative (think TSLA, SQ, SHOP, NKLA, etc) but they don\u2019t have the fundamentals to back it up, thus commanding very expensive premiums. DBX is a great narrative on solid fundamentals play.\n\n- After the most recent Dropbox update (family plan, password manager etc), their IOS app has spiked in rankings from #15 to #10 in the Productivity category (the rankings I saw are based on the HK IOS app store, not sure if this is the same across the board for other regions)\n\nThoughts?", "id": "hys49p", "created_utc": 1595855983.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I actually really like this play.
