{"title": "Covered strangles- best strategy for the long run?", "selftext": "\nSo I\u2019ve been trading for about three years now. Started the day I turned 18, and I\u2019ve experimented with every options strategy under the sun. I am testing out a strategy that I think will satisfy my need for monthly income, while still providing me long exposure to stocks I want in my investing portfolio. I\u2019m sure this has been done before, but if you haven\u2019t tried it, I\u2019d suggest trying it with one quality company and see how you fare.\n\nProcess\n\nBuy 100 shares of stock\n\nSell 30-45DTE 30-40 delta call\n\nSell 30-45DTE 30-40 delta CSP\n\nI will also usually use the premium received to buy more shares because I am just looking to build a solid foundation for DCA\n\nPrice increases\n\nShares increase in value\n\nCovered call increases in value\n\nCSP decreases in value \n\nCongrats, you just collected premium from the shares appreciating plus the premium from the CC and CSP, which will most likely mitigate the difference between the share price and the CC strike price, unless the stock has a crazy month. But hey, profit is profit.\n\nPrice decreases\n\nShares decrease in value\n\nCovered call decreases in value\n\nCSP increases in value(assignment?)\n\nThis is probably worst case scenario, but if you\u2019re in a solid company, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. When this happens, I just take assignment to reduce my cost basis depending how far the stock has fallen. Like I said, this is more suited for a theta investor. So now you have 200 shares of the company at a reduced cost basis, allowing you to sell covered calls at a lower strike, getting more premium while still(possibly) being able to sell above cost basis to capture an upward move.\n\nPrice stagnates \n\nShares stay the same(obviously)\n\nCovered call decreases in value\n\nCSP decreases in value\n\nWhile investors are sitting there with their dick in their hands, you get to collect the premium from both the CC and CSP\n\nPros\n\n- Monthly income\n- Reduce cost basis\n- Still capture some sort of move if the stock price goes up\n- Mitigate downside risk\n\nCons\n\n- High capital requirement \n- Can\u2019t capture a large move up\n- Could be stuck bagholding for a long time\n\nThis is my main strategy as of right now. Gained about 4% the last month on my live account running it on RAD. Been killing it in my demo account. Made about 13% the last two months running it on SPCE,MU,and AMD. I\u2019m not committing my entire portfolio to covered strangles because obviously over leveraging is bad regardless of the strategy, but I\u2019d suggest this strategy to anyone looking for reliable income, but also wants to create a good portfolio at a \u201cdiscount\u201d.

It's obvious that Square is the future and NCR is the past. So a \"futurist\" investor will buy SQ regardless of the price. An investor who thinks that the stock market is overvalued and/or that we're already in or at least headed to a major retail recession will buy neither.\n\nIMHO, a better approach would be to study NCR as a company (customer base, products, earnings, assets, debt etc.) and to assess their management's ability to compete with Square.\n\nYou may not be a Buffet-fan like I am. You may think that Buffet was past his prime 10-20 years ago and that the stoolpresidente is the guy to follow now. I have no issue with that.

Prepare for volatility, and feel righteous when you time things right.         \n\nThe government started selling 10yr and 5yr bonds starting from yesterday and supposed to last into Thursday. Expect 100% of the money raised in bonds selling to be put back into the market as it is legally required to do.           \n\nHave you been tracking the ebb and flow of the market? Rarely do travel/leisure and tech rise at the same time. Even if they both rise, you can call out which will go up more rapidly the next day by which made gains faster the day before. If travel/leisure gained 5%, you can bet the next day it will be closer to 1% while tech might gain 5%. Be careful of the losses as I think both are on a bubble and earnings season is here(sell in May and go away no applies to August since tax season was delayed from April to July and billionaires need to sell stock to pay taxes or lose credit which makes them more money).          \n\nThe dollar is becoming weaker, but if you look at the market with a cynical mind, you will see that the market is driven to help the billionaires while scaring away the day traders who have trouble with pattern recognition. The Billionaires would become richest if they waited until after this earnings season or next to sell out prior to watching the dollar get stronger and deflation to occur. They would\u2019ve made billions while the dollar shrinks and they can hold the money without losing any, only to reinvest when the true bottom comes or to jump back in for daily support/resistance.         \n\nKey dates in my mind:         \n\n7/28 marks the end of the federal quiet period. The government is about to allow our bow PowPow to speak again, and I suspect he will talk about the recent bond sales and the state of the economy(not good especially with lockdowns. Pow is a bear stuck with a printing press with a jammed PRNT button).              \n\nToday(?): Trump speaks. Whenever he hits the stage the manufacturing industry tends to drop 1-2% followed by a sharp rebound after the steep drop. You can make some money if you time it right, and it has happened almost 100% of the time.             \n\n8/1: senate recess.
