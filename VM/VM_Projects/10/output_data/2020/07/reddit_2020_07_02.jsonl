Roadster will be even more powerful. I dunno, to me acceleration in EVs just looks like it's \"How much do you want?\"\n\nThe Model X/S both have 100 kWh batteries,\n\nModel X gets 325 mi with 2509 kg\n\nModel S gets 335 mi (+3.1%) for 2,200 kg (-12.3%)\n\nSame deal with 3LR /Y which both have 75kWh,\n\nModel Y gets 316 mi with 2,003 kg\n\nModel 3 gets 322 mi (+1.9%) with 1,730 kg (-13.6%)\n\nI do think you're right about LFP increasing mass and reducing acceleration (with lower power density), but power and mass really doesn't seem to matter much for EVs. The main reason that mass doesn't really have a big impact on range is because air resistance only cares about size and shape of the object, at 60 mph speeds your energy losses are like +50% air resistance.\n\nThe Model 3 Perf battery pack is 480 kg, say you just double the mass of that but it still fits into the same area.

You could still just add whatever magic the Model S has and get back to 191.\n\nLFP would be mostly for \"commuter, work car\", but it's just the upper barrier for performance where you need cobalt is Very high. Just swapping in LFP in the Model 3 perf gets you on par with LR performance, that should be enough juice for anyone. Swapping to the Model S would probably be more expensive, but COST is the biggest benefit LFP.\n\nThe barrier for where you want to swap to NCA/NCM I'm thinking like ultra performance, Model S perf and Roadster cars.

{"title": "Story Time You Degenerate Fucks--Top 5 Novels of the 21st Century", "selftext": "A while back, one of the faithful, u/fuzzyblankeet, tried to start a book club, in which you fucks were somehow supposed to generate literary suggestions. The project was akin to asking a gaggle of sociopaths to share their feelings. There were some decent suggestions, but most of you held the understanding that literature started with Harry Potter and ended with Ready Player One. It was fucking embarrassing. \n\nTime to get a little lesson in modern literature so you fucks can begin to understand why you make the poor decisions you do, and maybe get in touch with one or two of the synapses that try to muster some action potential whenever you try to suppress the time Daddy touched your no-no-zone. It might just help you understand why you're buying high and selling low like the rabble of idiots that you are.  \n\nWe're just over twenty basis points into this god-forsaken century. Now is as good and arbitrary a time as ever to list my top five books of the 1/5 mark.\n\nA lot of people make the distinction between favorite and best. I'm ambivalent on the matter, as you should be too, because finding objectivity within any rendering of our essentially conscious experience is the child of folly--though I'd expect nothing more from you bumbling lot of bairns. It's not that I much care anyway; my bias is what makes my taste, and my tastes inherently signal to my brain that I think more people should think like me. This is the kind of thinking that churns the democratic engine. God bless America. \n\nSo on with it then:\n\n1. ***A Naked Singularity*****, by Sergio De La Pava:** The best self-published book of all time, period. As the story goes, De La Pava had tried over 100 agents before shelving the masterpiece, as it was too 'difficult' for us Americans, who need more time and brain-space to money-grub. It's particularly telling when a child of Colombian immigrants gives up. But his wife, Susanna, didn't. She published and promoted the thing herself. After selling tens of thousands of copies, it was picked up by the University of Chicago Press, which is obviously an odd placement for a mammoth Joycean effort.  \nAnyhow, the novel follows a young Manhattan defense attorney, Casi--as Sergio was himself at the time of writing. In preparing a defense for an appointed client, our protagonist overhears the specifics of a drop for a drug deal. In an unlikely twist, Casi teams up with a pseudo-rival--a colleague with reproachable morals--to steal the money from the drug deal.  \nTo say the book is about this heist is like saying *Ulysses* is about Leopold's horniness or something. *ANS* is simply indescribable. The prose is purely revolutionary, hilarious, poetic, and infinitely cutting, all in the same breath. A paradoxically oblique yet accurate picture of the novel and its author can be gleaned from a piece by Garth Risk Hallberg (author of *City on Fire*, which was the bloated and underwhelming sophomore effort of a genius), about how he came to love this book as well: [https://themillions.com/2012/06/outside-the-ring-a-profile-of-sergio-de-la-pava.html](https://themillions.com/2012/06/outside-the-ring-a-profile-of-sergio-de-la-pava.html)\n2. ***In the Distance*****, by Hernan Diaz:** We're now 40% of the way through the list of my five favorite novels for 20% through the 21st century, and we haven't run into a single straight white male yet. I am become the radical left.   \nHow about this for an endorsement: *In the Distance* was a finalist for the Pulitzer. Enough said. But you should still keep reading, for the sake of seeding your barren cognitive landscape. Seriously, you people are fucking idiots.   \nBut for those of you who still peruse snail mail catalogs and participate in book clubs in which major points of discussion include whether a book boasts an 'exciting plot'--i.e. those of you who should seriously consider alternative methods of living your lives--don't worry: Carys Davies of *The Guardian*\\--an editorial ranging between worthless and adding negative value to society--as a \"thrilling narrative, full of twists and turns.\"  \nThanks, Carys.  \nSet in the time of Manifest Destiny (for you illiterate pieces of shit, that's when the pioneers went west, my sons), *In the Distance* follows Haukan, an incredibly large and hulking Swedish immigrant. Haukan loses--as in literarlly, he can no longer locate--his brother on the way to America. In spending the rest of his life in search of his lost brother, his legend waxes and wanes, he loves and loses, he fights and he makes peace--the whole gamut of contretemps and vicissitudes that go with any good epic. Only, with this one, the language is perfectly colloquial to the time period, while sacrificing none of its potential given the modern technology of English literature.   \nMeanwhile, you ragged curs can't even find the bone hidden in your own yard. Seriously, you disgust me. \n3. ***The Flamethrowers*****, by Rachel Kushner:** We're 60% of the way through listing my five favorite novels through 20% of the 21st century, and we haven't encountered a single straight white male. Look at the strides we've made. It's probably just me.   \nThis one you might have heard of, if you've ever red a bok 1nce. Represented by Jonathan Franzen's agent, Susan Golomb, it's no wonder Rachel slipped this one into the list of fat contracts handed out by Scribner that year. It certainly was deserving.  \nA good friend of Sergio De La Pava's, Kushner is no stranger to baroque prose. Whether pulling us into the Italy of yore or the New York of 1976, Kusher's obsession with actualizing time and culture is impeccable. Speaking of Garth Hallberg (remember, the writer I mentioned twenty minutes ago--adjusting for the reading pace of you homunculi?), *City on Fire* was lionized for, if anything other than its bloated narrative, its verisimilitude of 1970s New York. However, I think Kushner did a far better job, and didn't limit herself as Garth did for the sake of a commercially viable project. Meanwhile, you all would sell your filthy prostates to the first horny codger handing out a fiver.   \nFrom certain writers, I've heard of Rachel Kushner's faith to story and craft, likened to the old masters' obsession with art, which you don't find today among the tripe that's plastered with a generic vertical title and assortment of colors that passes for cover art (you can bet your bottom bitch that I do in fact judge by its cover). Prior to an earlier novel of hers that's set in Cuba, Kushner disappeared for for years, allegedly there, for research. This dedication shows in her work, contrary to what you see around this sub. \n4. **Emerald City, by Brian Birnbaum:** This is probably the most flawed book of the bunch, even more so than *ANS.* Still, *Emerald City* is an incredibly dynamic novel about a college basketball player whose father is defrauding the government through subsidies for deaf teleconferencing technology--with the catch being that his parents are deaf as well. The story pulls in two other 'protagonists'--a Romeo and Juliet sort of deal in that there are warring crime families behind the fraud scheme.  \nThe novel exhibits the best blend of plot and prose. There are more than 150 named characters and a ton of action, and yet every line is pyrotechnic, lyrical, hilarious, or all three. It also offers as much a blend of genre, from crime novel to campus drama to family saga. You got your Raymond Chandler, Chad Harbach, and Jonathan Franzen all in one novel. Not that any of you would know the first thing about any of them...  \nAlso a good friend of De La Pava (who blurbed *Emerald City*), Birnbaum's path to publication was somewhat similar. He actually did get signed at a big agency before his agent left the business. *EC* is the first novel of a small press that's putting out their second this September, so it's got a similar feel to *A Naked Singularity* in its upstartishness. It's also challenging, if not quite as much as *ANS*. This one might help you dimwits forge a few electrical connections before graduating to the big leagues. \n5. ***Stephen Florida*****, by Gabe Habash:** Speaking of writers that blurbed *Emerald City*, Gabe Habash rounds out the list, safely keeping straight white males in the minority. Good job, me.   \nTo call this book unique is like saying it was unlikely that the Golden State Warriors would lose two of their top three stars to injury in the playoffs last year. The obvious stated, but you're still out of the loop. Allow me to fill you in.  \nWhereas *Emerald City* boasted one antihero-cum-protagonist (it's latin, you fucking pigs), *Stephen Florida*'s first person perspective comes from the antihero of all antiheroes--the eponymous Stephen Florida. Weirdly, that's actually not how his name is spelled, but Florida allowed a clerical error made by the school he wrestles at and attends to ride uncorrected.  \nFlorida's goal is simple: win the NCAA D-III wrestling title. As a senior, he's got a shot. The only problem is himself: he's batshit fucking crazy, the type who pisses into water fountains and gets into fights with people because it's a day that ends in 'y'. He makes for a novel that's as hilarious as it is intense. This one is perfect for you fucks.   \nMaybe it's because he grew up with his grandmother after losing his parents as a child. Maybe it's because he's his own worst enemy. Maybe it's simply the fact that he cares as much as he does. Somehow, you find yourself rooting for the kid.
