This is oversimplified, speculative bullshit.\n\n\nFirst, assuming no other technological innovations in the smartphone space whatsoever, **all** existing smartphones on the planet have a limited lifespan from regular use (or even accidental use).  They will need to be replaced in their current form.  So, even when growth in new iPhone purchases ultimately slows, that hardly means \"the end is near\" or even close.\n\n\nSecond, does anyone with any sense of technological history really think \"that's it\" for smartphone innovation?  Does Apple think that way?  Hell no.  [Source:  Watch the 60 Minutes report from last week.]  While there are some obvious smartphone improvements on the horizon--such as speed and computing power, battery life and charging, or waterproofing--there will undoubtedly be new innovations for \"phones\" that are not on anyone's radar.  Something **new**.\n\n\nThese will become the next generation of \"must have\" devices.  And, whether or not Apple even invents this new technology, ask yourself who is in the best position to take advantage of it.  Who has the brand, reputation, skill, cash, industry know-how, etc? Do you really think Apple will be \"left in the dust\" in this space?\n\n\nThird, iPhone is easily the most sought after phone on the planet at the moment.  There's no contest.  Yes, there are other good alternatives, but if we are simply talking about what most people on the planet really want -- it's an Apple iPhone.  The end.\n\n\n[Source:  I travel a lot, pay attention to these things, and generally \"know stuff.\"]\n\n\nFourth, there's no sure thing, that's for sure (extra Yogi Berra), and yes currently Apple derives most of it's profits from iPhone, but so what?  They're hardly alone.  Ford derives most of it's profits from car sales.  Facebook derives most of it's profits from advertising.  Exxon derives most of it's profits from oil.\n\n\nCould iPhone sales crumble like traditional car sales, advertising on Facebook, or oil?  Absolutely, and one day that will likely happen.  And also, one day, Ford will be replaced by jetpacks or other forms of transportation, Facebook will become AOL, and oil use will be looked at like coal or kerosine.  Also, some of us will be dead.  The better question for a longterm investor is whether **you** will outlive Apple.\n\n\nFifth, Apple has \"several\" other products besides iPhone that generate considerable profit.  It's amazing how this is so easily ignored or dismissed.  iWatch, for example, is an incredibly profitable product by any measure in it's **first** generation.  And yes, I know people think iWatch sales are going to be limited, but they said the [same thing](http://www.refinery29.com/2013/10/55995/ipod-anniversary-reviews-2001) about iPod when it came out.  But regardless, who cares?  It makes money.  \n\n\nCan Google say the same thing about Google Glass?  And what's Facebook's next big \"innovation\"?  And does anyone besides Bezos really think Amazon is going to be delivering products via drone?  Really?!?  Seriously?!  If so, you're adorable.\n\n\n[On that note, I actually do not own an iWatch yet, but that's because I am a 2.0 buyer of technology and I'm waiting until March, when the second one comes out.  That said, I bought my girlfriend an iWatch for Christmas and she loves it.  It did not arrive via a drone, however.]\n\n\nAnd this brings us to the nub of the innovation debate.  Predicting innovation or even the direction of particular technology is like predicting whether a cup of coffee on the other side of the room is cold.  Or, whether it's even coffee at all.\n\n\nMost pivotal technological innovations are not really just improvements of existing items--like watches, cars, or can openers.  The most pivotal innovations take us by surprise.  They do something **new**.\n\n\nRemember when you saw the internet for the first time?  Or saw a \"video\" on the internet for the first time?  How about when you first touched the screen of an iPhone?\n\n\nGoogle did something new in the way they delivered search and information.  Facebook did something new in the way they connected us to one another.  Apple did something new in the way we connected with our devices.  That's what they do.\n\n\nFor now, Apple is a market leader making one of the most desirable and profitable products on the face of the planet.  It's a product with a limited lifespan and some planned obsolescence.  The company has one of the best balance sheets, if not the best, in the entire world and is demonstrably **not** resting upon it's laurels.

This Christmas if a retailer wanted to get people in their store they advertise a deal on an Apple product.\n\nUltimately I am extremely bullish on technology but much more \"new\" tech.   Personally, I am more bullish on Google than Apple.   Google continues to increase their reach at an incredible pace.

Google now has 6 different brands where each has over 1 billion unique monthly users.\n\nI also really like Facebook and Amazon.
