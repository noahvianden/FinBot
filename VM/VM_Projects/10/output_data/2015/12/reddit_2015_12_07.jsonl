In general I like the valuation for this stock though.  However, the key thing for at least a little while is what Whitesaja said about espn.  ESPN is huge for DIS, and will continue to be a major factor on their stock price for a while and will likely be a dark cloud for a long time.  Despite that, I like where I think DIS will be years from now.  Right now ESPN is the controlling factor of this stock price, which just isn't good for the price but could be considered good for a buying opportunity, so I'm biding my time but I would like to increase DIS to be one of my larger positions.
