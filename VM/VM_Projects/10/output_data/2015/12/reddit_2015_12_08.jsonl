I remember it like yesterday:\n\nLivermore first became famous after the Panic of 1907 when he sold the market short as it crashed. He noticed conditions where a lack of capital existed to buy stock. Accordingly, he predicted that there would be a sharp drop in prices when many speculators were simultaneously forced to sell by margin calls and a lack of credit. With the lack of capital, there would be no buyers in sight to absorb the sold stock, further driving down prices.

{"title": "FFHL - Next Chinese Pump & Dump??? YOLO!", "selftext": "Just before the great sub-prime crash many years ago, when China was red hot, there were lots of \"reverse buyouts\" of small companies with very low floats.  A reverse buyout was the easiest way for the Chinese to gain hold of a U.S. listed public company without going through the scrutiny and costs of an IPO.  These stocks shot to the moon for a very short period as they were part of an organized pump & dump scheme.  I've kept an eye out on some of these.\n\nEFUT was such a stock.  It has recently (within past few days) come back from it's great sleep.  Would have been great to get in on the ground floor, but it's very difficult to call which stock will be pumped next.\n\nFFHL has been dormant for years.  6.1M float.  And look at the volume today, without the price moving much.  Earlier this year, the company was bought from the Chinese government.  The Chinese government had taken it over a few years ago from the previous guys who had done the pump and dumps in the pre-sub prime era.  The stock recently got the Nasadq warning letter for a desisting as it's price was under $1.  Within the warning period, they raised the price to above $1, saving their listing on the exchange.  It has since gone under $1, but they haven't received a warning letter (yet).  Just the fact that they lifted the price above $1, it means there is still interest.  And they are waiting on a good time for another pump & dump.\n\nSo based on the fact that it's a low float Chinese company, that it's sister (EFUT) has recently rocketed, and the heavy volume today, I think we're getting very close to this taking off.  \n\nThis is YOLO.  This is not an investment.  We couldn't care less about what they do (they're into plastics).  I predict this will go between $10-$20, but for a very short period.  Buy now, and get out on the spike.\n\nWhen will it happen?  I'm estimating in the next 3 months.  $2,000 in these poker chips can turn into $20,000.  \n\nI own 5,000 shares at 78 cents/share.
