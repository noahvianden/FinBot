{"title": "I have some old stock certificates..", "selftext": "Google Drive Link with all the pictures - https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3EC5yMirI8cVGVIWHRaajhvUk0&usp=sharing\n\nOkay so, I have over 100 old stock certificates from two different companies. One is Farmer's Union Oil & Supply Co... and the other is Cooperative Supply Inc. Farmer's Union Oil was renamed to Co-Op Supply Inc on February 26th, 1946, and I have the original certificate of amendment to prove it. I also have a lot of stock related paperwork that was issued with the stocks. \n\nHere is where it gets interesting. There is an urban legend in my town that all of these stocks were dug up out of a safe that the Mormon Church buried. The stocks were dug up a few years ago, and I came in contact with some people who were involved in the recovery of them. I was given a large portion of these stocks. They all have different names on them, and so far my research has turned nothing up. All I know is that the company still does exist, and they either merged or partnered with Cenex, to do their distributing. I have no clue where to go from here and I have spent many hours researching to no avail. Maybe you guys can provide some insight. Thanks for reading, and ask any questions that you might have.\n\nEdit: The large majority of them do not have owner signatures on the backsides.

The last few quarters before that they were paying way more debt down than they just took, and it looks like Q2 of last year they also took on debt, not as much though.\n\nWhat did they take debt on so heavily this passed Q2?\n\nhttp://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=61870&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2072057\n\n\u201cFor the quarter ended June 30, 2015, cash flow utilization from operations was $148.5 million, which reflected the earlier than expected receipt of certain customer payments during the fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 as well as the timing of spending on key development programs. \u201c\n\n\u2026 What are these key development programs? From what I see clicking around, they picked up Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs in Jan 2015. In case you don't know, Gulfstream makes sick ass private planes, here's a G650, don't we need these to fly to our helipad which takes us to our remotely located yacht??? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Gulfstream_G650_departs_Bristol_23rdAug2014_arp.jpg/1280px-Gulfstream_G650_departs_Bristol_23rdAug2014_arp.jpg\n They also got an air bus contract this month to work on A320 and A330/340 planes.\n\nI'm pretty certain I want to buy shares of this company as I think it's well valued, but I fear the shemitah.

Until 2008 you could even get 25 year financing on personal airplanes because they were considered appreciating assets (like your house).  Lots of people who bought airplanes decades ago made huge profits selling that ~4000 dollar airplane they bought in 1957 for 80k in the 80s/90s.  So the takeaway from that is Delta isn't buying all new airplanes every four or five years.\n\nThose good ole days are over and the business is hurting.  Mainly because of their own dumb-fuckery but that's another topic.  The upswing in recent years has been due to the airlines swapping out the bigger stuff for 737s to accommodate the shift in traffic from international/coast to coast to regional, and GA being more turbo props and corporate jets than light piston stuff (aka higher margin sales).  Most of that demand is already filled, though.\n\nShort answer is as long as new orders are down, suppliers are also going to be down for the most part.  Most of the manufacturers publish their new deliveries and order backlog in investor reports.  Wait until you see orders start going up.\n\nOf course military demand is never ending and ever growing.  How much of their profit is from the Pentagon?  DD might make all of the above irrelevant.

In 2007 it was 750k for a new one.\n\nThe savior, as with everything else, is Europe and China.  Dassault, Airbus, Daher-Socata, and Piltaus have done pretty well in recent years, because they're pushing new more efficient designs.
