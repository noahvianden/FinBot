I would not try to calculate the value of Epix to NFLX.  As long as NFLX is the premier choice for streaming viewing, NFLX will keep its value.\n\nThe problem with NFLX (a distributor first, but very wisely became a creator of content too) is that content creators (TV shows, movies) do not want to let NFLX become a monopoly.  Why not?  Well if it's not obvious, if NFLX were a monopoly then the content creators would not be able to negotiate a better price on their content (where would they go?).\n\nThe content creators are now trying to prop up competition, like Hulu (earlier this year Seinfeld went to Hulu...NFLX did just fine earlier this year.  Hence I suggest not bothering with trying to calculate the value of Epix to NFLX).  Even though Hulu sucks compared to NFLX (Hulu runs ads, even if you have premium service).  The content creators will want to keep competition alive amongst the distributors (Hulu, Amazon Prime, NFLX).\n\nIn addition, Nielsen recently announced that they can report on how many people are watching individual shows on NFLX.  You may remember, if you're old enough, that Nielsen is a service of TV shows.  Trying to also remain relevant, as TV viewership falls.  This is good news for TV shows (creators) because they can ask for more money from NFLX.\n\nNFLX has refused to raise prices, because that would just bring more competition.

That's a smart play by content creators to chose different distributors to leave better prices for themselves. But Hulu is clearly an inferior product. A monthly payment plus ads that you can't get rid of with AdBlock is a huge problem with Hulu that discourages consumers to use their product. This would essentially shift the traffic back to Netflix as I think they have grasped what the consumer wants while others are ignoring it for short term monetary gain. I don't see the distribution side of Netflix a problem in the long run. Content creators will have to resort to using Netflix as the growing customer base proves it is the best platform for distribution, enough to counter them being afraid of Netflix turning into a monopoly. Also, I imagine Netflix wants to expand them becoming content creators as I'm seeing a greater influx of Netflix created content which is good, as this cuts out the third party content creators that might want more than Netflix is willing to give. But I think the biggest point is that Netflix original content is actually *good*.

The structure of the trial has been finalized and the FDA and EMA have both signed off on the design. The trial will enroll 148 patients with progressive metastatic CRPC with detectable AR-V7 expression. Patients will be randomized to treatment with either Galeterone or Xtandi. The primary endpoint is radiographic PFS (rPFS) with secondary endpoints of PSA response, OS, time to chemotherapy, and safety.\n\n> **It\u2019s hard to find a Phase 3 clinical trial as de-risked as the one set-up by Tokai management. In my opinion, the chance of success here is nearly 100%.** Galeterone has been shown to be just as effective in patients with AR-V7 than without due to its numerous mechanisms of action while Xtandi is known to be ineffective in patients with AR-V7. The Johns Hopkins study showed that patients with AR-V7 expression had no PSA50 response, only 1.4 months of PSA progression free survival and 2.1 months of rPFS. In the Phase 2 Galeterone clinical trial 86% of patients with AR-V7 achieved PSA50 response translating to a 7.3 month PSA PFS.\n\n---\n\nSome more articles:\n\nhttp://www.smarteranalyst.com/2014/12/23/william-blairs-top-biopharmaceutical-stock-picks-q1-2015/\n\n>Xu gave Takai an Outperform rating and a $44 price target.
