{"title": "ANFI Still has upside left", "selftext": "So full disclosure, I'm new and still have much to learn from you brilliant bastards but I wanted to contribute something at least. \n\nEssentially, Amira Nature Foods is a 100 year old rice company that came under attack by Prescience Point with allegations of fraud. If you look at their chart, that's what dropped it from the $15-20 range to the $5 range. These allegations seemed bullshit, and turns out they were. \n\n\nRecently they were cleared of these charges, which caused the spike back up to $8. It's been on a steady rise since. As of now, it's above $10, so it's too late to get some of those gains, but I do believe there is some upside left. \n\n\nThey've made deals with Whole Foods, and another with Price Chopper stores so they're continuing to grow. They are releasing financials any day now (before the end of the year) which I believe will help shoot this up even further. I think conservatively $15 would be easy to hit, but wouldn't be surprised if there was a spike to $20. That would be ~50-100% increase if you got in now. \n\n\nI know this isn't the usual type of stock you see on here, but it's treated me well so far and I wanted to return the favor to you sons of bitches. I've been in since $5 with only 350 shares, and only regret not buying more when I had the chance. \n\n\nAgain, I'm an idiot so do your own research and please let me know if I'm completely bat shit crazy here. Like I said, I'm new and learning, so I would appreciate any other opinions or ideas about this. Hopefully this will help fund some yacht accounts, though. \n\nEDIT: Spelling, formatting\n  \n----------\n\nEDIT: Retailers Post-Allegations\n\n/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR asked a good question about retailers before and after. Here's a list of agreements with retailers AFTER the allegations. Some are limited to regions, so I included the states as necessary.\n\nAnnounced agreement with KeHE distributors to distribute in the U.S.\n\nCrossmark and United Natural Foods\n\nPublix\n\nAmazon.com\n\nCostco:\nArizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada,  and Utah.\n\nJewel-Osco:\nIllinois, Indiana, and Iowa\n\nNorther and Southern California, Utah: 5 Distributers\nGelson\u2019s Markets, G&G Supermarket, Harmons Grocery, Murphy\u2019s Market, and SPD Markets.\n\nWhole Food\u2019s:\nAgreement with stores in Florida. This seems like the beginning of their relationship and hopefully they\u2019ll expand to all of Whole Foods.\n\nShaw\u2019s Supermarkets:\nSubsidiary of Albertson\u2019s. Stores in 5 New England states.\n\n\n\nEssentially, they're working with some big names and forming partnerships that will likely continue to grow their reach in the U.S. They're all over the world, so there are many others internationally as well. \n\n----------\nEDIT: Unfortunately today has become a bit hectic so I haven't been able to do as much further digging as I would like. I haven't found any evidence of them LOSING and clients due to the false allegations, but I can't say for sure that means that they didn't. I'll continue digging once I have some more free time. It's the holidays so I don't feel like there will be too much action in the meantime. I'll post more once I find information worth sharing.
