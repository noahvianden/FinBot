Your returns are adversely affected. You'd be better off finding low beta/volatility stocks with excellent business operations (business model should be unaffected by future technology innovations). I'm currently working on a paper that argues that the highest quality stocks, which generally trade at multiples slightly higher than the market (say 20x vs 16x for the market), are actually cheaper than they should be because of shock value. They have lower risk profiles and higher expected returns in the long run. Best options currently are CLB, AXP, TDG, and a bunch of other stuff if your interested in considering a better investing strategy.\n\nFor smaller caps with slightly higher risk profile (but still lower than TSLA, TWTR, or even Kellogs (K)) there's some amazing business models like WD-40 Co. (WDFC - kind of expensive), SELF, MSON (better Intuitive Surgical), ect.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "The trick on stocks is to buy them when they are low and sell them when they are high.\n\nMost people don't abstract that far enough.
