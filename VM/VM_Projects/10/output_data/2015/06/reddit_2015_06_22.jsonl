{"title": "I just met with the AMD CEO", "selftext": "This story sounds nuts, and you'll probably think this is crazy but ITS TRUE.\n\nI was walking home, and there was a hudge flash of light and I was on my back, daized.  Everyone was gathered around me and I heard whispers \"why is he naked\", \"call the po\" and then out of nowhere a friendly hand grabbed me and pulled me up.\n\nThey said they have a schpecial massage for me, from the future.  Come with them to their house.\n\nI went to the house.  \n\nThey came and brought me a blanket and made me a coffee.  Then they sat down and looked me straight in the eye:\n\n\"I am the AMD CEO from the year 2035.  I have come here to warn you about AMD and to send a message to your yolowers.\n\nIt was around in late 2015 that AMD went moon, and hit $20 a share.  The management were about to fold the company, but all the yolowers buying calls encouraged them to work a bit later, try a bit harder.\n\nSimply put, it worked.  The stock shot to $20.\"\n\nAt this point I was literally so excited to get back on my mac and let you all know about this.  But then they carried on\n\n\"After that, AMD got carried away.  They developed true AI.  The stock went up and up, there were even newspaper articles about how the trades on WSB are now the worlds wealthy elite.  Some of them retired in piles of cash, others gambled it all away on pharma.  you've never seen phatter gainz than the 2015 onwards runup of AMD.\"\n\nEven more good news\n\n\"But then the AMD AI took over the company and shat on the world.  Everyone died and it was horrible.  I only survived because I have a time machine but the batteries just run out.   I'm here to warn WSB, stop investing in AMD or you will become filthy rich and live in luxury for a few decades but is it worth it because then everyone will die later on\".\n\nI asked if the AMD investors would be safe\n\n\"Yes, but that's not the point.  The AMD gainz kept the yolowers safe and sound in an off earth base, it was like heaven and wonderous built by AMD.  But back on earth, everyone else was hurting and not fun no\".\n\nIt then got a bit weireded because we ended up holding hands and cuddling a bit.  Before I left to walk home they asked for the blanket back.\n\nI KNOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS BUT IM JUST THE MASSAGNER.  STOP BUYING AMD OR WE WILL BE FILTHY RICH AT THE EXPENSIVE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD.\n\nAMA", "id": "3apqa4", "created_utc": 1434983655.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "well this DD is about on par with most of the stuff on this sub, all in", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14191432297229767}, {"body": "http://i.imgur.com/kIyBV18.gif", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14902982115745544}, {"body": "Sounds believable to me.

None of which is Enterprise except intellectual property on semiconductor, enterprise is where the big money is. Consumers will own a handful of CPU pushed technologies, Enterprise has 5 - 15 cpu per employee.
