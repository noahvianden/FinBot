{"title": "I have over 70% accuracy on paper trading (daytrading futures). Now what?", "selftext": "Hi. I've been studying technical analysis and the stock market in general for the last 4 months. During the last month I've been watching the market and making my \"trades\" on paper for at least 3 hours everyday (mostly around 9am~12). I place all my exact price entries and exits/stops before \"making the trade\". I'm using 3 charts, 1 min (main), 5 min and 15 min, eventually giving the 60 min a look and starting every day with a look at the daily chart. I also keep a screen showing the main stocks (the 5 most traded stocks) because these are responsible for most of the index movement.\n\nI aim for relatively big movements (15 min tops) only when there's a ~2.5/1 or higher reward/risk ratio. When I'm scalping, there's no such thing since the accuracy rate is extremely high for anyone. While scalping I'm aiming for ~50 points (commission will be 5 points) and risking up to 80. But scalping is an extremely tiring activity.\n\nWhat should I expect when I trade with real money? \n\nDoes anyone here can share a similar experience? How did it went when you started trading real money? \n\n\nEDIT: some users PM'd me asking about my strategy. It's no secret and it's probably not effective in other countries/markets (I trade BVMF futures).[ Try it at you own risk.](http://pastebin.com/Arfphjfc)\n", "id": "3a1yjv", "created_utc": 1434472157.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Your biggest hurdle will be risk management.  Your accuracy and pay-off ratios sound about right for by-hand trading.  That's with paper money though - where you're not really thinking about how a position actually can negatively affect your bank account.\n\nWhen you make the transition to live, you need to be very careful to preserve the correct size.  Do not take on an overly large position that either: 1) leads you to gambler's ruin or 2) makes you psychologically nervous (as in OMG what if I lose, how will I make it back???)\n\nYou might try looking at different bankroll/betting schemes; the Kelly criterion comes to mind (most people don't go more than 1/3 or 1/2 Kelly - full Kelly is incredibly risky.)\n\nOr you might just go with a flat 2% of your account in \"actual\" risk per position.  Note that this is risk, not exposure.  A $6000 position in a stock that moves $2 a day and costs $100 a share has a risk of $120, not $6000.\n\nAlso, watch out for correlation among your positions.  Most stocks are around 80% correlated with one another; where this becomes a problem is if you're watching tech stocks, and both YHOO and GOOG 'hit'.  If you take a position in both, you effectively have one large position in GOOG or YHOO, which is possibly outside of your risk tolerance.  One of the counter-measures is to avoid trading more than 1 symbol per sector, or, if you're very data-science about it, running a correlation test against both symbols before entering - but that's mainly for algo-trading.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "1/3 Kelly sounds alright.\n\nI studied lots of risk management strategies, though.
