{"title": "Calls and Puts", "selftext": "Hey guys, I have been trading for a while, but I have never touched Options trading.  I am not sure if it is something i should be doing, but I definitely would like to become educated in options trading.\n\nSo far, this is what I understand (these are made up numbers):\n\n~~Say there is a stock currently trading at $100.  I think this stock will hit $110 in 7 days.  So I buy a call which means I pay a premium of say $50 with a strike price of $105 that expires in 7 days.  So if the stock hits $110 on or before the 7th day, it would be smart to exercise the option because that means I would get the 100 shares at $105 a piece right?  If this is correct, would I not lose possible profit before of the premium I paid?\n\nIf I held this option to buy the stock when the stock hits 110, would I be able to sell the option to buy the stock?  Does that even make sense?  Thanks ahead~~\n\nEDIT:  Erm, I think I figured it out, but I still have a few questions.  \n\nI'm going to use Apple as an example.  Say I buy 1 contract at $125.00 share price that expires on the 17th of April which costs $2.76.  That means I am going to pay $276 to reserve the right to buy this stock at a price of $125.00 anytime from now until the 17th of April.  Say April 14th this stock hits $130.00.  How do I make profit at this point?  Would I need to exercise the option to buy it and then sell everything I just bought at $130.00 to make money?  Or would I just sell the option that I acquired?", "id": "30xida", "created_utc": 1427813201.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Comments below have filled in some blanks for you, but I think I'd like to at least add:\n\nStarting brand new to options, you should probably only buy calls that expire at least 30-60 days out. You can buy shorter calls/puts when you have things figured out... But for now, you want time on your side.\n\n> I'm going to use Apple as an example. Say I buy 1 contract at $125.00 share price that expires on the 17th of April which costs $2.76.

How do I make profit at this point? Would I need to exercise the option to buy it and then sell everything I just bought at $130.00 to make money? Or would I just sell the option that I acquired?\n\nYou'd Buy To Open to open your call position, then Sell To Close to close out of your contracts before expiration. Simple as that, with American Options you can sell your contracts any day leading up to expiration. Buy To Open you buy on the ask price, Sell to Close you sell at the bid price. Don't take those prices as the final word though... Set Limit orders and you'll usually find them still executed if you're within the ballpark, it just wont be an instant buy since it isn't market price.\n\nIf there isn't much volume you can still exit your positions, the only problem that low volume presents is that the bid/ask spread will be pretty steep. So while on paper you might be at a 50% gain, you might only be able to sell for a 40% gain, etc.\n\nAnd while most don't exercise their calls, they do have their benefits. For instance, I'll buy LEAP contracts (1 year+ expiration) for positions I'm already holding long-term and know the outlook of. Maybe there's a dividend increase on the horizon, etc. Buy leverage at today's prices then watch the gains materialize as the event takes place. Then I'll usually sell off some contracts and exercise the rest as shares. That way the options were essentially a layaway plan, and I get a big discounted buy-in due to the profits from the contracts sold off. Aka buy 20 contracts, then later sell back 10 and exercise 10, etc.\n\nAnd another tip that others haven't mentioned... Try to stay away from deep Out of The Money calls, they are lotto tickets that never hit. They are so cheap because it's pretty much 99% odds they wont reach anywhere near that strike and just expire worthless. If buying calls, you should try to buy barely OTM or ITM calls.  Me personally, I usually buy deeper in the money (Delta +.75) so that it means the options move more in line with the actual stock. This way if I ever want to cash out, the hopeful profits are at least in line with the stock... I didn't have to see some gigantic event to walk away with any sort of money. Now this requires more upfront money, but it's worth it to me at least.\n\nAnd finally, I'll just say that options are a whole new challenge, and you shouldn't be jumping in them crazy without knowing what the hell you're doing...

A slightly ITM call might have a Delta of .80, which means for every dollar the stock gains, the option gains roughly 80 cents...

BUT it's the safer route. Some brokers will charge a high fee if they have to decide things for you, and often you wont like what they decide. You might be a penny short for covering the exercise of 10 contracts, and they'll just decide to sell all contracts instead of exercising 9 out of 10.\n\nAnd if just closing the position then you can wait longer...

Cheap gas-powered autos eliminated the viability of electric cars for a hundred years. It happened in the 1970's when gas became expensive and drove purchase decisions to virtually eliminate large gas hungry engines and it happened in the 1990's when gas became exceptionally cheap again and people suddenly rediscovered giant 8 cylinder cars that average 15 MPG. (SUV)\n\nIf gas is going up in cost for most people, then electric car companies like Tesla will have more customers and will sell more cars. If instead, gas is basically going to be free as it appears to be right now, then companies like Tesla will sell fewer cars. It isn't a direct correlation, but I think it's more than a coincidence.

Oil being cheap doesn't hurt Tesla or it's products, but because oil is cheap, Tesla stock doesn't get the artificial price boost it might if oil was continuing to be more expensive in an ongoing basis.\n\nWhen oil is expensive, and getting more expensive by the year, less sophisticated investors assume that more people will purchase electric cars since \"electricity\" is cheaper than \"gas\" so they think that if more people are buying electric cars, then TSLA must clearly sell more cars the next quarter. \n\nIn reality, the people who buy cars at the price of a Tesla don't make decisions based on cost, it's a more emotional, brand driven purchase. But the stock is still going to be affected by oil because of this perception, even though it's not a real correlation.\n\nWhen Tesla releases a low end consumer priced car (sub-30k), then we'll see a more accurate effect, since when that happens, the number of tesla cars sold will probably be really be affected by consumers making choices based on oil cost.
