{"title": "Oil storage running out was quite predictable. So why wasn't the drop to below $43 already priced in?", "selftext": "I've been hearing internet chatter about this since February. Information from the EIA is easy to find and oil stocks have been increasing more or less uniformly since January.\n\nhttps://archive.moe/biz/thread/654419/\n\nhttp://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_stoc_wstk_dcu_nus_w.htm\n\nhttp://www.eia.gov/petroleum/storagecapacity/storagecapacity.pdf\n\nnote: shell crude oil capacity, tank farms + SPR, 438,982+727,000=1165982\n\nhttp://www.livecharts.co.uk/MarketCharts/crude.php\n\nCan oil be \"priced in\" so easily? People who actually physically buy oil are less than 3% of buyers according to investopedia so it is not like the price of oil is grounded in much. It could zip up and down like TSLA if it wanted. Also there are stocks that seem to quite closely track the price of oil.\n\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=STO+Interactive#symbol=STO;range=6m\n\nWTI dropped to $45 then went back up to around $50 and hovered there between $47 and $55 through February until about March 12. My general theory is the momentum of the drop since November carried it to $45 then it recovered, but now fears of storage capacity running out have triggered another plunge. However watching storage capacity steadily decrease you think people would have predicted this.\n\nEither it has already been priced in to a reasonable degree and the price has dropped below $43 due to speculators whose actions couldn't be predicted with any accuracy or big investors were unwilling to take the risk and prices of $40 to $55 are in the \"grey area\".\n\nOr the big hedgies could be pricing it in at a gradual pace. When WTI first dropped below $47 in January it might have been considered too low but now storage is closer to full capacity they might have decided to short at prices this low.\n\nIt could be that Saudi Arabia may at any moment cut production lending unpredictability to the situation so the big banks aren't willing to commit. Or they could fear \"unknown unknowns\" or some black swan event and are only taking low risk actions.\n\nAm I trying to read the tea leaves here?", "id": "2zgiww", "created_utc": 1426680011.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "I think your overthinking it. It all boils down to supply and demand. The supply has been overtaking demand for some time now. Opec usually cuts production to balance out prices. However, with shale gas producers in the market now, Opec doesnt want to cut production because they are afraid to lose market share. Someone else will just cut into their action if they cut production.\n\nProblem is, no one is willing to cut production. They just keep pumping it out. Everybody is playing a big ass game of chicken basically. Thats the way I understand the situation. Prices cant go up if demand doesnt increase or supply doesnt decrease.\n\nAs far as the drops not being priced in, oil contracts have specific delivery dates. That makes it a lot trickier.

Fundamentally not much has changed regarding oil though. im still expecting it to drop below 40 myself, im defintely not going long anywhere in the 40's.
