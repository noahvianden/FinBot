But the odds of Apple falling in 2015 are minimal at best and even if it fails, it will fail by max 10-15%. This doesn't justidy the cost of a leap.\n\nIf you buy an option, even if apple rise, you could lose money. Given that apple is already so high, this isn't such a hot idea. I'm not even discussing dividends yet. There is a way to play options on Apple, but this isn't it. If you really want to do an options play, sell OTM puts and collect a nice payment every day from the theta.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "exactly, Apple is not going to fall.

If you actually checked the price of the 60 strike option he is talking about, the bid pretty much matches the price of AAPL (64.80 at the close), if he took the offer he would have to pay .50 for the right to own this option but if he put a bid in it is likely someone would fill him in between.  \n\nSo what does he get for owning the option?  He gets leverage, he only has to put up $60 and he has full exposure to AAPL.  He basically gets to own the stock for half price.  It is riskier than owning the stock since he faces 2x move in percentage terms if it goes against him.  Then again, you seem to believe that it is impossible AAPL will go down lol.  \n\nAlso, PLEASE stop giving advice about options play.  Your play is fucking retarded, sell OTM puts?? Put up infinite risk just to collect a small premium.
