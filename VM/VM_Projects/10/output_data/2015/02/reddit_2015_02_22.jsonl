Don't just give up once there is a challenge. Research and papertrade daily will make good practice. After a few months you will most likely be ready options trade (you need to understand how to handle your emotions). If it goes well then continue it, if it doesn't then stop immediately. Trading options is extremely difficult if you have never seen it before. This is how I was at first, I thought trading was too hard. But I stuck with it everyday and **papertraded for fun**. Some of the best traders are the ones that put in hours of effort. Plus regular stock trading is hard too, it is just a different style of trading than options.\n\n\n\nGood luck ~badbaseball\n\nEdit: just a quick thing, don't fall for \"get rich quick schemes\" found on youtube (Tim s).

Stay away from them for now until you've learned more.\n\nThat being said, if you must trade options, AAPL probably isn't the worst choice.  Another strategy you could use is to buy 100 shares of a company under ~$12-13 (based on the size of your bankroll) and sell covered calls.  Every month you sell a covered call and it's not exercised you get to keep the premium, which is basically like holding a stock and having it pay you every month.  If the call you sold is exercised you lose the stock but get the profit from the premium and the price increase of the stock itself up till the strike price.\n\nIt's a conservative way to use options and good for beginners.\n\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/covered-call.asp", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0}, {"body": "old man redditor strikes again. how about instead of lecturing you offer your own experience.

I sold a few of my SBUX shares to play around with. I got in on Apple at 99.6 a share. I figured the stock would go up with the new iphone and possibly iwatch. \nIf you want to branch out a bit, my advice would be to do some research. Find a company you like and believe in. There will be many ups and downs but if you truly believe in what the company is doing and will do you have nothing to stress over. This was advice my best friend gave to me. He is in the financial industry and knows significantly more than I do. So, i took his advice and researched a medical Marijuana company that manufactures medicine for epilepsy for young children. It is the leading medical marijuana company. Called the proxy company. Kinda like it is the measuring stick for all the other medical marijuana stocks. I figured that is an industry that is about to explode so it would be nice to get in on it early. the stock is GW Pharmaceuticals. GWPH. Check it out. \nMy other piece of advice would be extreme patience. You're only 17 so you should give yourself at least a 5 year window before you can rate your experience a success or a failure. \nAlso, Ali Baba, BABA. They are the amazon of Asia. They are an enormous company that is trying to expand business to the west. \n\nGood Luck!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "sbux", "aapl", "ups"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "The best advice for your age is to not ask what to invest in but to ask why you should invest.
