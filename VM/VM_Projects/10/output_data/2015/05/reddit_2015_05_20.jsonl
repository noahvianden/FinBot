{"title": "Went all in on May 29th SPY Puts @ 213 strike for $1.55.", "selftext": "\nAlright, here's some background. I am 20 years old and in my 2nd year of college majoring in finance. I did my first trade 6 months ago when I was 19 on December 5th where I bought 5  INTC calls where I lost big time. I have only had 1 successful trade in the last 20 option trades I have done. The only successful trade was on CBOE VIX where I bought 10 Puts @ 16 strike price for $.35 and sold at $.65, My account is down about 70% after being down 90%. So this trade will make or break it. If I make a profit off this trade, I'll add more RIG or maybe at PFE for dividends/growth over the next 5-6 years until I graduate. Probably RIG since they offer and amazing dividend, and I don't mind exposing myself to more risk long term. \n\nDuring this period of time, I also bought shares on a separate account where I have had amazing success.\nBought 30 shares of RIG @ $15.9\nBought 50 shares of SDRL @ 9\nBought 10 shares of HAL @ $42\nBought 5 shares of GILD @98\nBought 20 shares of INTC @ 37,2 \nThank you oil. Not going to sell, as I'm leaving these for 5+ years. \n\nWhat I have learned in this period of time.\n* It is better to overall miss a trade, then to rush into one.\n* When you enter into a trade, ALWAYS have an exit price. 50% on options. \n* Never beat yourself up over a big loss, or any loss. PERIOD\n* Take a few week break from the market, after a losing spree.\n*Never buy when there's been 3 or more bullish candle sticks in a row, Just wait it out, and wait for a 1% sell off. \n\n*Listen to Icahn and buy AAPL 2 year Leaps\n*YOLO AMD ONLY WAY TO MAKE MILLIONS\n*\nP.S I own 80 shares of AMD when they crashed in 2008. I bought in at $3.85. Still holding on to them because AMD = LIFE. Seriously, AMD was my favorite company when I was growing up because I was an AMD fanboy. \n\nDuring this period of time, I've been working on a program with python that automatically analyzes the lowest monthly and daily lows of VIX, and calculates the probability that a volatile event occurs compared to every month in the last 25 years. I have gathered some really cool information like, signals before crashes, volatility when presidents change, and so on. Nothing new, but still fun on working on it. \n\nReasons to buy puts on SPY\n1. Bearish candle stick today\n2. Reversal on 5 day RSI\n3. Touched bollinger bands\n4. Currently no economic data to support this pushing\n5. Gold was rising\n6. Dollar had gains\n\n\nWorries\n1. Bond's keep dropping\n2. Economic events this week\nI am an expert at buying high, and selling low. So I'm going all in on SPY Puts 3 @ 213. Before, I would be buying at this time. So this time I'm doing the opposite of what I really want to do. Wish me luck, hope SPX drops by 20 - 25 points at some point in the next week and a half. \n\n", "id": "36ll7e", "created_utc": 1432108221.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "You're 20\nYou bought AMD in 2008\n\nWat", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, my dad had made an account for me when I was 9.
