A lot of big tech companies, for example, have taken a big hit. I believe AAPL is very undervaluated right now and I expect them to climb back up towards 120-130$ somewhere within a few months. They are at like 109$ premarket now but I think they are gonna drop again due to all this chaos, and then eventually stabilize and rise up. Apple stays strong imo. Their numbers are very strong, and iPhone as a brand is not dead - if it was to die it wouldn't happen instantly for sure. They also have an upcoming release which may or may not boost the stock based on what they reveal on September 9th (iirc). A lot of similar companies have taken big hits.

Relative to the S&P 500, AAPL\u2019s NTM P/E has averaged 0.91x and troughed at 0.62x. For FCF, AAPL\u2019s LTM EV/FCF has averaged 11.5x and troughed at 7.1x. If we assume that 1) our current estimates for AAPL are reasonable, and 2) AAPL reaches trough multiples for NTM P/E, relative P/E, and FCF, then the average of our noted trough multiples would suggest a value\nof about $99. Hence, we believe that investors are already assuming that AAPL estimates move lower over the next few quarters.  \n\n**Valuation & Recommendation**  \nWe retain our Outperform rating on AAPL and believe the stock is inexpensive at current levels. We forecast by product line, not by geography. With that said, we wanted to attempt to put some context around China risk in FY2016. China was 23% of Apple\u2019s revenues in the LTM through June 2015 and growing as a\npercentage of revenues. For FY2016, we project total revenue growth of 3.2% y/y. If we assume that China revenues grow by 10% y/y in FY2016 (likely conservative, but very tough compares), then the implied growth rate for all other geographies would be about 1% y/y in FY2016.
