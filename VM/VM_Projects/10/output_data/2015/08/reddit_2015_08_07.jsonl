{"title": "Stocks I'm watching tomorrow, 8/7/2015", "selftext": "Hey hey!\n\nAnother week winding down and we're still in crazy volatility mode on SPY. It is imperative in this environment that you trade stocks that have catalysts and LOTS of volume, I can't stress it enough. Patterns and technical analysis aren't as important as long as the stock has VOLUME but obviously if you have a good pattern PLUS volume PLUS a catalyst, that is ideal. I've had a good few days with NFLX, FSLR, PLNT, AIMT and others. I also have a couple swings which I started today. I stopped out on my first CAP swing from $14.20 at $13.59 but I'm back in now at $13.05 and think I found the bottom this time (famous last words, lol) so we'll see how that goes...I will add more once it starts to confirm a bounce and aim for a $14-14.50 target, maybe more. Also I mentioned this one a week or so ago, AQXP, but never bought it because I found out they had earnings today. I don't hold through earnings so I wanted to wait. Luckily I noticed someone mention the earnings on Twitter and caught their conference call so I grabbed a little bit at $1.97-1.98 after hours and am aiming for it to break $2.11 tomorrow and push to $2.50-2.75. This is a beaten stock and really the news wasn't that terrible: Their main drug missed its phase 2 primary endpoint but just BARELY, and all of the secondary endpoints were met. As they explained in the conference call, the data from the secondary endpoints shows that the drug is in fact working, they just needed a longer testing time to get statistically significant results. So I guess their goal now is to take the expanded data to the FDA and they are confident that the drug is still effective. Of course they are going to spin it and I am NOT investing in this or trading it for fundamental reasons, but I think the call was pretty optimistic and that will probably bring in a lot of buyers tomorrow whom I plan to sell to at $2.50+ ... tee hee! Aside from that I'm watching NYMX for a break of $2.55, PLNT for a break over $16, and have some stuff on the back burner like X and SONS which are flagging, SRPT pushing $35 and NVDA which beat earnings after hours.\n\nSorry I haven't been updating every night...I'm teaching a lot now and playing catch up since I fell behind when I moved, having no internet access for a freakin week and a half. Anyway updates really aren't required every night since mostly I'm just trading stuff that is in play and the watchlists often just end up getting trumped by something better in the morning.\n\nHope everyone had a nice week!\n\nChris", "id": "3g38nn", "created_utc": 1438919023.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "I took an entry into AQXP at 1.74 a couple days ago, with the sole intention of holding through earnings, I didn't really see a reason for it to be bad, and for them to provide further information on their phase 2 failure to me meant that there was more to it than everyone originally thought.

I've become a quick fan of yours. I'm trying to learn the market as best as I can before doing anything with serious money. I've been playing with about $150 on robinhood just to get an idea of how all this works. Thankfully haven't lost anything yet, but I'm new.  Please forgive my total ignorance... But I'd really appreciate some advice. Would you mind answering some questions?\n\nHow are you predicting which of these stocks are going to pop? Is it about the news? Good news + big volume + upward trend= money? I'm sure there's no set formula but you seem to have a knack for forecasting some serious winners. Mostly curious how you filter your news... It's all just noise to me... I've learned a lot from finviz, but can you tell me... What's your secret? Because at this point it's so beyond me I'm convinced you have spidey senses. \n\nI promise I'm not trying to get rich quick.

is this finally catching up with itself?\n\n* **chart ->** http://i.imgur.com/9vAKK7y.png\n\nfact is: the $djia is trading in one of its narrowest trading ranges for a year in history this year from its high/low closes ... that is neither bearish or bullish, but interesting nonetheless\n\n* **chart ->** http://i.imgur.com/aK9C4co.png\n\nas far as the s&p cash index goes here, we're still trading within this longer term bull channel that we have been in since those 2011 correction lows ... but notice how this year we stopped trending up and stopped hitting that upper trend line and are now range bound for the most part all year and the inability to break to new highs ... this is certainly a change from what we've been accustomed to seeing for much of this bull market run... we are now attempting to test the lower part of the year's range... but, as we have seen the prior 2 times, we managed to bounce off that 2040ish level each and every time... will this 3rd time be the charm yet again? or is this thing finally setting itself up for a break down lower?\n\n* **chart ->** http://i.imgur.com/lco2Y1N.png\n\nnext chart i have here is of the vix 10yr weekly ... i'm not sure if anyone on here was even aware of this, but just this week the vix managed to print into a sub 11 reading, which is very rare... how rare you ask? well, we only printed below 11 on the vix once last year, which means this print we saw the other day was one of the lowest prints we have seen on vix since going back to early 2007! that is pretty amazing imo\n\n* **chart ->** http://i.imgur.com/hN7IzDU.png\n\nand last but not least was the chart of the nasadq comp-\n\ni think this chart really goes to show you just how powerful this bull market since 2009 has been ... the nasdaq even managed to break through to new highs taking out highs that went back during the 2000 dot com tech bubble ... yes, i know, different times and different index this time around ... but i think it is still very impressive to see just how far we have come on this bull run overall!\n\n* **chart ->** http://i.imgur.com/Nibm4dT.png\n\nso it all begs the question- what's next for these markets?\n\nis this yet another classic \"btfd\" case here or something more serious as far as a correction goes?\n\nkeep in mind folks that we have not seen an official -10% correction in the s&p cash since that 2011 correction! it has been about 4 years now! that is incredibly long! one of the longest stretches we've seen in history in fact...\n\ni'm not saying the bull market absolutely ends right here, because as we have seen time and time and time again over the course of the past years here, those calling for the end of the bull run have been proven wrong each and every time!\n\nbut, anyway this was just a couple of interesting things i'm seeing out there and thought to share w/ you all nonetheless...\n\nhope you all have a great weekend! :-)", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Very informative and lots of great chart analysis, thanks for sharing!", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3080959618091583}, {"body": "A little food for thought - the DJIA is a terrible barometer for pretty much anything economy related.
