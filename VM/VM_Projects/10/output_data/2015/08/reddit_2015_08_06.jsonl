{"title": "A Detailed Look At $GOOG", "selftext": "Google (NASDAQ:[GOOG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG)) ([GOOGL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOGL)) continued its strong performance in the [second quarter](investor.google.com/earnings/2015/Q2_google_earnings.html) of 2015. Highlights in the period included double-digit growth in revenues, cash flows, and earnings. The firm has tremendous flexibility, as it boasts over $70 billion in cash and has only ~$5 billion in debt. We think the company is gearing up for potential buybacks, which we would view as value-creating (in light of its price-fair-value-ratio), or even a dividend, arguably following in Apple's ([AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL)) footsteps. Perhaps more exciting is that the company is focusing its efforts on cost management, which means economic returns are looking to rise..\n\nThough revenue has been growing consistently, that growth has come under pressure, but more due to the law of large numbers than anything else. In 2014, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, down from 21% in 2013, and down from 22% in 2012, but as the company's revenue base grows, an accelerating pace of revenue expansion becomes more difficult. Constant-currency revenue growth was 18% in the second quarter, and many firms would give anything for that pace of expansion.\n\nThe best may still be ahead for Google. According to the second-quarter [earnings call transcript](seekingalpha.com/article/3332585-googles-goog-management-discusses-on-q2-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=2), YouTube watch time rose more than 60% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, its fastest growth rate in two years! What's more impressive is the jump in mobile activity. Mobile watch time on YouTube more than doubled from the prior year's period, a positive sign as the Internet becomes increasingly mobile focused. Also, the number of advertisers on YouTube rose over 40% year-over-year and the average spend per advertiser is up 60% year-over-year, supplementing the 11% growth in Google's advertising revenue.\n\nIt's probably not surprising Google's stock price has reached 52-week highs following the release of the firm's second quarter earnings. We've been pounding the table on shares (see [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2520865-why-google-has-upside-to-800-plus-per-share), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2326125-google-one-of-the-best-values-in-this-overheated-market), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2165243-why-google-has-upside-to-nearly-650), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/1923781-why-google-continues-to-have-significant-upside)). What was our differentiated insight? A rigorous focus on the free cash flow and the balance sheet. Though many investors like to dismiss valuation, and we respect that, if performed correctly, it can uncover some of the best insights out there. Let's take a look at Google's other investment considerations and derive our fair value estimate for shares.\n\n**Investment Highlights**\n\n\u2022 Once known exclusively for its search dominance, which it maintains, Google has become a tech company focused on a number of things: social, Android, ads, YouTube, Chrome, and research. We think the company will have some megahits in the years ahead, and shares are worth well over $600 each.\n\n\u2022 Google is a holding in the portfolio of the Best Ideas Newsletter. We like its valuation, growth potential, cash-flow generation and competitive profile. Very few firms are more attractive on a fundamental basis.\n\n\u2022 Google continues to grow revenue at a healthy pace. The firm is pleased with the momentum it is seeing from its mobile division, particularly within mobile advertising. The mobile Internet space will be key for the company moving forward, but Facebook and Twitter are not backing down.\n\n\u2022 Google has a strong future in search-both on the desktop and via mobile devices. The company recently sold Motorola Mobility, a value-creating move as it can now allocate more capital to high-return opportunities or new concepts such as self-driving cars, Glass, Fiber, or other innovative ideas.\n\n\u2022 Google has three different stock classes with two different tickers. GOOG represents Class A stock, and GOOGL represents the non-voting Class C stock that was created by a stock split in 2014 in order for Google founders to maintain majority control.\n\n**Economic Profit Analysis**\n\nFrom our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Google's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 61.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation\u2122 rating of EXCELLENT.\n\n**Cash Flow Analysis**\n\nFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Google's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.\n\nThe free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Google, cash flow from operations increased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 235% over the same time period.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2015, Google reported cash from operations of ~$7 billion and capital expenditures of ~$2.5 billion, resulting in free cash flow of ~$4.5 billion in the quarter.\n\n**Valuation Analysis**\n\nThis is the section you've been searching for, the culmination of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Google's shares are worth between $543-$815 each. Our next modeling update will likely result in a fair value revision closer to $800 per share in light of the firm's quarterly results. A fair value range is paramount to an assessment in valuation, and why we were able to make the call on Google's undervalued shares.\n\nAt present, our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 16% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 28.8%, which is above Google's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Google, we use a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Follow us for our next update.\n\nWrapping Things Up\n\nWe think Google is a fantastic company.\n\nWe've been big fans for some time now, and we love the company's renewed focus on expense management. Its growth potential is not going away anytime soon, and the firm will continue to be a Internet powerhouse as consumers shift to a increasingly more mobile-based Internet.\n\nAs the power of the Internet expands, Google with have its hand in the growth. Ongoing innovation should create a suite of products in the future that are even more advanced that those on the present horizon. What those products might be offers a unique case of upside potential, a dynamic that few companies truly have. Google is on the right track.\n\nThe company has been one of the best performers in the Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio.
