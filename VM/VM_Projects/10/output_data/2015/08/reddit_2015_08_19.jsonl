Personally, I think a PE of 22 is fair given the market's at 21 PE. It's a strong company with some great competitive advantages. The price run up this year to PEs of 25-26 were due to people's ignorance. They got caught up in the Marvel / Star Wars fever. Or momentum trading. \n\nI think the correction is well founded. The paradigm shift that the TV industry will go through is a point of concern for Disney. And at 25-26 PE, I dont believe it was priced in correctly. \n\n>I'm leaning more towards buy with all of their heavily hyped upcoming products (Star Wars).\n\nPerhaps you should think about the company a little more.

I think 22 PE is fair, but given the challenges they face, I'd like to see a lower valuation before I'd buy more. If I had zero position in the company, I would likely be tempted to buy at its current levels. \n\nThe reason I remain bullish on Disney is because of the extreme pricing power that ESPN enjoys. Remember, in the world of DVR and Netflix, sports is the one thing you have to watch live. You just have to. So ESPN has an inherent advantage over every other station given that fact alone.\n\nAs for the rest of their channels, I think theyre on solid ground. Theyve shown an ability to adapt. Which is really what you want. In 2003 Blockbuster came out and said it wasnt afraid of competition from the internet. Uhuh. And these guys were getting paid millions of dollars to be this stupid. But Disney isn't making that mistake. Theyre cutting deals with Netflix. They signed one in 2012. Giving Netflix exclusivity rights starting in 2016. You have the Netflix original Marvel content. Starting with Daredevil, but they have a lot more planned. My point is that theyre at least trying to predict where the puck will go.\n\nAre they going to be right? Yea I think they'll be fine. Theyre a wonderfully managed company. They have the most impressive IP library in the world, hands down. I think they'll weather the storm just fine and come out smelling like a rose.\n\nBut there is risk there. Theyre not a company like UNP where the industry looks the same today as it did 50 years ago and will likely look very similar 50 years from today. Those are the companies you really want, but theyre hard to find. \n\nBack to Disney, I think they'll be fine. They see the problem. Theyre addressing it.
