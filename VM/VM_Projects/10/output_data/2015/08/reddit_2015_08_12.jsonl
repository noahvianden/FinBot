If all hell breaks loose and there is a crash in the stock (The strike you picked is really OTM too it won't be hit) but then to roll the option to an even deeper OTM put to free up your margin. Then eventually closing your position to buy back the put for next to nothing.\n\nI just wanted a second opinion on this strategy if you have heard of it before. It was reiterated that this is a super boring way to do things but had a good ROI which was safe. Can anyone poke holes with this strategy or any other issues anyone can think of ?", "id": "3gqi7w", "created_utc": 1439395297.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "I sell naked puts.

The company could report something bad and next thing you know you're ITM and could be sold the stock you didn't want in the first place.   As an example:  HD.  Stock is 117 now.  Two strikes OTM puts you at basically 110 (or even at 105).  100 put for September is ~.92.   Delta is .18  (roughly 80% chance being OTM).
