Big dogs would gobble up little dogs and it would turn real fast.  I don't think anything is provable as far as objectively saying if any position on any stock or option is good/bad.  The bad ones are easy if a company is like going bankrupt or something and you still buy it but still...\n\nThat being said.  I'll try to give you the broad opinion of what i've seen from others.\n\n* some people don't like long positions like yours.  Greeks work against you a little and eat some of your value daily.  \n* some people like long positions a lot because it's limited risk with the potential unlimited reward \n* some people don't like long positions because the success is riskier and harder to achieve? (without control i think).  Like, you may get lucky a few times and think you just the most expertiest expert at guessing what things will do, then put all of your winnings in and be wrong and lose it all.  People say that long position people eventually lose and that it's not the smartest way.  Although, there are a good bit of people who do nothing but long and seem to do well.\n* some people don't like long because the percentage of success is lower than other options.  \n* some people like long because it's simple to grasp and because they want to play around and feel like they are doing something smarter than just putting it on red at the casino.\n* some people like long because they are good at it, but I think to be good at exclusively long trading you have to make  lots of adjustments, be very good at micromanagement, have good timing, manage your risk on your own with exit strategies and such (some strategies basically manage risk for you..ish), etc.  (some of these points apply to options trading in general.  To be successful I think you have to be good at most of these.)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great points, thank you for taking the time.

Theta isn't too bad when it's not close to expiration yet but the close it gets the more ridiculous it gets. \n\nI'm not saying theta is going to get you for sure.
