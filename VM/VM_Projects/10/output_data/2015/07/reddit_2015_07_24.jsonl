{"title": "My AMZN disaster", "selftext": "Gather round, it's story time. It may not be what you think. After the AMZN earnings were out, I legged into selling strangles (both puts and calls). It was a roller-coaster ride that ended with me covering the put leg for about a 750% loss basis the premium collected. (Obviously the margin requirement is rather large for selling options on AMZN, so percentage on capital isn't so dramatic).\n\nAbout 10 minutes after the open with AMZN around 567, I sold JulW4 540 puts. About 15 minutes later with AMZN at 559 I hedged that by selling JulW4 590 calls.\n\nAround noon Eastern time it is looking good with AMZN holding in the middle range. Then came the down draft. When it breaks the 540 strike to the downside, I hit eject with AMZN at 539. Had I held until the close the loss would have been more like 2200%. \n\nSome might say I was over confident, too big for my britches. \n\nYes, it was a bad day, but I'll live to trade again. I usually report all my trades for the week with a Saturday update to my blog:\n\nhttp://tradesbytiger.blogspot.com/\n\nThis week includes trades on AMBA GLD GPRO JPM SWKS TSO UA and maybe a few more. My blog is ad free, I don't make a dime from it.

I'll address them all in one batch. For those that feel compelled to give me advice, I sell naked all the time, and leg in all the time. Most of the time it works, but sometimes high probability trades blow up.\n\nYes, risky. I think I was emboldened after my selling of GPRO strangles before earnings worked so well. Sometimes the market has to teach people a lesson. It was my turn today. I'm sure many other premium sellers got blown out of the water on AMZN, either before or after the news, but haven't reported it publicly. \n\nWhen markets move fast, it makes it that much harder to get in or out of positions, and spread orders can be twice as hard. If a person is unwilling to take the max loss on a spread and is forced out on a spread, taking market fills on both ends of a fast moving market can make my bad trade look like a spring picnic.\n\nAs for details, I sold the 540 puts for 50 cents when AMZN was at 567 and the 590 calls for 32 cents @559. The calls expired for a win, but the losing leg was covered at $3.65 @539. So no, it was not close to break even, with 82 cents of credit against $3.65 to cover. I wasn't too concerned about buying power, because it was a one day trade. It was going to work, and I'd get my buying power back, or I was going to get out. AMZN closed at $529.42, so had I held on until the last minute of trading, covering might have cost $10+, perhaps a full $11 with a market order to avoid assignment.\n\nSpreads have their own problems. I believe that in this case, most of the common spreads would have made the out come worse not better. It would have added another level of bid/ask spreads and commissions and not offered any real protection against what happened. The loss on my trade was less than $3 per unit. A three dollar wide spread on AMZN in a fast moving market is unlikely to be worth doing for retail traders. Someone did one $2.50 wide before earnings, but that was during a calm market time. Ten dollar wide, sometimes more, is common on a $500+ underlying, so max loss $10, plus another level of commissions and bid/ask friction.\n\nUnless a person is willing to take a max loss on the spread getting out in a fast market on expiration day is like walking through a mine field. Using spreads vs. selling naked, can help in case of a big gap, but the news was out and today was expiration day. I rightly thought the gaps were over. Unfortunately it was a trending move down during the last couple of hours.

The point of my posting the story is so that others might learn something, and perhaps I might learn something too.\n\nThe other part of the math is that it is a one day trade. If the trade was available every trading day, which it isn't because every day isn't expiration day, back of the envelope has it compounding to something like 250% per year on max regular margin and maybe 600% on max portfolio margin. \n\nThose potential returns are on a 90% to 95% probability trade. 90% on IV, more like 95% on historically realized vol. So even after the loss, I kind of like the math, even if it blew up in my face this time. To get those big annual returns, the trades would all have to be winners at max margin (which no one would do, but it gives an idea of the potential).\n\nThose wanting to buy those cheapo long shot options probably aren't understanding what they are saying or understanding how low the probabilities are for the options I sold. \n\nIt took an almost perfect storm to sink my ship. Even so, it was basically a $3 loss on a $500+ underlying.
