{"title": "Another \"First Time Investor\" Thread", "selftext": "I hate clogging up a subreddit with the most common type of post, so I want to open with an apology there. I suppose this subreddit sees it a lot because everyone's situation is pretty similar.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I are in our mid twenties and have most of our money in a simple savings account right now. We both know that our money could be doing more for us, but we dont know how. We went to check rates on CDs at our bank, and they arent much better than the savings account right now.\n\n**TL;DR Start Here**  \nWe have about $6000-8000 to invest and we aren't sure the best way to do this. I'm not sure what platform to use (TD Ameritrade, Robinhoob, Merril/BofA, etc...) or what I should be investing in. Since it isn't a huge amount of money, should I be buying shares in a mutual fund? Or, because I really feel like they'll do well this year, should I invest in a single stock (DIS in this case, we both work at Disney World).\n\nAny help would be great, and again I am sorry for flooding the sub with another post like this.", "id": "2r19uj", "created_utc": 1420146084.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Is this an IRA account.

I'd at very least wait till the DOW gets bellow 16,500 or lower if you can stand to wait. \n\nWhen that point comes just buy & hold SPY through robbinhood... it's probably a better deal for you in terms of fee structure than say getting into mutual funds (where everybody buys high and sells low except for the smart people who get punished). \n\nAlso mutual funds will rape you on fees. If your broker is aggressive you'll get pushed into funds that rape you extra hard on fees. Personally I'm against mutual funds, but you'll get people who say \"buy gee I didn't get raped; I have more money than I started with\".... well yeah it's been a good run recently, but that doesn't mean you didn't get chiseled on fees.\n\nAlso if you do the mutual fund thing you're going to get penalized if you end up taking that money out for some unexpected reason (like you got fired or you had a medical expense or you had a baby)... so in my mind you'd be setting yourself up for failure. \n\nBuying DIS to me looks like a little bit like insider trading... especially depending on when you sell. If you buy just before it takes off and then sell just before it drops you'll get flagged on the graph where they compare investors in a specific stock. Basically they're looking for outliers, if you did a little bit too well it's possible you could get a phone call to explain yourself... at which point being employed at DIS would be about the worst thing possible to have to explain.\n\nI seriously doubt this would happen because the insider trading they're supposed to look for is supposed to be large scale... but man I'd just stay away. I mean you're not going to make millions if it goes perfectly & you have a good amount of bullshit to deal with if it goes wrong. \n\nThe risk vs reward is just not there for it.... although I guess now I have to look at DIS this year... lol.\n\nPS - Dave Ramsey (much hated on reddit for his religious beliefs) has a pretty great approach to investing for beginners... he suggest having $1,000 in an \"emergency fund\", then paying off all your debt (other than your mortgage), then putting aside cash to cover 3-6 months worth of expenses.... and THEN investing. I don't have much of an opinion of the guy other than that I think that's a brilliant plan that I wish brokers would share with people... they don't because they only get paid when you buy & sell... but really that'd be a great idea if you're not already in that spot. ", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Not really insider stuff, on DIS. My logic is solely this: 2 Marvel Movies, 2 Pixar Movies, a Star Wars Movie, and a few other movies.  \n\nCEO Said last year that we should expect a larger Star Wars presence in the parks. Probably should expect some announcement on that this year. The new expansion at Downtown Disney should start taking shape this year, too. Might help DIS.  \nAlso on the parks-side, the next Avatar movie is released next year and the hype train should start going this year for that. With Disney building a Avatar themed area in Florida, this could reflect well upon us.\n\nTo be completely honest, it's the only single-stock that I feel I have done enough DD on. Mainly because I work here.\n\nRegarding the rest of your post:  \nFirst, thank you. Theres a lot of great info here. I have heard of Dave Ramsey, and thats about where we are right now. The 6-8 grand represents that extra money.\n\nI didn't know mutual funds were that aggressive with fees and such. I really didnt know abot locking money up like that, I had no idea. I will look into ETF's to see whats there, I have never looked before.\n\nIf I do go with a single stock, for some reason, and end up buying 60 or so shares of DIS, I am not too worried about insider trading.
