{"title": "DWTI - strong for the rest of the week? (weekly forecasting for commodities)", "selftext": "Expectations for this week? Should I hold from open to close for the rest of the week? My stance is that oil has not bottomed yet so DWTI will be strong throughout this week and maybe even further. My fear is that leveraged ETFs will eventually crash and burn regardless due to some theory called \"decay\" that people have been telling me to stay away from these ETFs. I'm only looking to trade for the short term so I don't think this applied to me unless I hold it for the long run anyways.\n\nAnyways, what are your guys' forecasts for oil and other commodities ETFs?
