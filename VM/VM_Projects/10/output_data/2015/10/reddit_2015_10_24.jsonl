Even if two candidates have the same target, different compounds can have extremely wide ranges of specificity and affinity, which affect everything from off-target effects and toxicity, all the way to the efficacy of the drug itself, as not everything will activate sigma-1R equally. In fact, forget about totally different compounds; even tiny modifications to the chemical groups of closely related compounds can result in drastically different downstream effects. We're theoretically talking potentially entire *orders of magnitude* differences in binding affinity and activation rates. \n\nBy your logic, we should never approve any new drugs or variations of existing drugs anymore for things that already exist. It is utterly idiotic to suggest that existing sigma-1R agonists must all function the exact same way, and A2-73 couldn't provide superior clinical results (or even safety) to extant drugs of the same class. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>What actually is horribly misguided is to suggest to anyone that a range of other neurological conditions that have completely different mechanisms of action could be improved by this drug which hasn't even passed phase two.

Again, see my previous comment about protein-protein interaction networks. Frankly, we know very little about the entire interactome of many physiologically relevant molecules, including sigma-1R, so for you to definitively say it has no effect on the progression of other diseases is unfounded. \n\nYour analogy is deceptive as there is a already ton of work done that shows sigma-1R can provide benefit in slowing the progression and symptoms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS models. How? We don't know for sure, but just because we haven't elucidated the entire mechanism doesn't mean the relationship does not exist. There is also plenty of evidence to suggest that sigma-1R has roles far beyond being just a chaperone, and it could be acting through any one of these additional pathways.\n\nBut don't take my word for it.
