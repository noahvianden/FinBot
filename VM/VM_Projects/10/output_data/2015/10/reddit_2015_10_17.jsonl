{"title": "New to trading. Question regarding a stock", "selftext": "So I am new to trading,  so forgive my ignorance.  \n\nI work at Starbucks and we get stock granted to us every year.  I have 9 shares that will vest in a month and I am thinking of investing them in AMD.  \n\nAMD manufactures computer components (gpu and cpus) and has been doing poorly in recent years,  especially on its CPU line.  Their competitor,  Intel,  has dominated them as far as CPUs go.  AMD sits anywhere from 1.60-2.00 and has been going down  for years.  \n\nI'm thinking of taking my 9 shares in SBUX and using those to purchase AMD on the grounds that either their new line of GPUs coming out will raise the price,  or,  similar to Apple and Microsoft in the 90s, Intel will buy non voting shares of AMD to reinvigorate the competition.  \n\nAny advice or help would be appreciated.  Thanks!", "id": "3p5vlj", "created_utc": 1445121051.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 7, "comments": [{"body": "Been doing this for 3 years now and I can't tell you how many times I've heard the same AMD story and yours is similar and its done nothing but gone down. Thing is that their isn't enough of a GPU market to save AMD, the industry is going to server cloud computing which relies on the fast CPUs more than anything which Intel has been dominating. Intel's business, like AMD, is a high spend business and very susceptible to chip demand which is not predictable at all. I don't recommend investing in either to them to quite frank. I do like the new 3DX point chip out of Intel though, it has super potential, but I recommend buying micron(MU) to take advantage of that one if you like it. \n\nBut I also like Starbucks, its been a darling of wall street for a while and its probably here to stay. You may want to consider just keeping your shares for the long haul. But starbucks is at the top of its trading range though so can't argue if you want to sell your shares for something else, but I wouldn't put it on AMD.

AMD has an incredibly outdated manufacturing process (in comparison to Nvidia) and a very low market share in both the CPU + GPU markets; they have sustained net losses over several years, with the situation only going from bad to worse. Personally, I don't believe that their recent transaction with Fujitsu will yield any major success.\n\nIt's a risky one at best, look for something else!

", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well I do wish you the best of luck, but keep in mind there are thousands of traders out there with sophisticated algorithms and Bloomberg terminals and you have a very very high chance of losing money; hopefully not all of it. Trading fees will eat away at profits. Many brokers (including Scott Trade) have capital requirements for traders, usually $25,000 and usually a margin account. Maybe you have 25 grand lying around, so we'll continue. Your 9 shares of SBUX are worth about $540. Scott Trade will cost you $7 to sell SBUX and $7 to buy XYZ. You're already down 2.6%. That is huge. \n\nI know this was a specific question about AMD, but you ask for any advice, so here it is: trading is almost never a way to make money. Most lucky traders lose a few grand and get out. Others lose everything and then some (margin calls). And there is a tiny fraction (of professionals) who see any significant, consistent profits. \n\nYou're an adult, do what you want, but my advice would be to not trade. Hold those SBUX shares, **keep buying more through SIP**. Hold them for retirement. As you know SBUX is rolling out serving alcohol and improving their food menus. They are a solid company and can be a great core holding in a portfolio (esp since you can buy them at a discount). Head over to r/investing for investing advice and more knowledge on the stock market and why trading is a horrible idea. \n\nIf you are fully convinced you want to trade then definitely use a virtual platform, Scott trade is good.
