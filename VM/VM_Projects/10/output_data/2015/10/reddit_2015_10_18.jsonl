You sell a put and sell a call, on the presumption that the stock won't move outside of the range of the two strikes you are using. If a stock is currently trading at ~100 (e.g. NFLX), you could write a strangle for the 90 and 110 strikes (10% in either direction).   So you'd sell a put at the 90 strike, and sell a call at the 110 strike.\n\nFor example: For Nov 20th expiration for a NFLX 90/110 strangle, you'd get a premium of $195 for the 90 put and $255 for the 110 call (as of 12:30pm today), so you put $450 in your pocket today for each contract you sell. As long as NFLX stays within those bounds through nov 20th, you keep your $450.  However, if NFLX goes way up or way down, you're going to be out some pretty serious cash, especially to the upside/naked call side.  On the downside/put side you just take possession of 100 shares of NFLX at $90 strike, which is probably fine (as long as you have $9k laying around).   If it looks like the stock is getting close to either of your strikes prior to expiration, you can \"roll\" out that leg, meaning that you buy back your short option (hopefully for less than you sold it for), and then re-sell a similar option at a later date and a different strike.  \n\nSo, let's say you do the Nov 20th 90/110 strangle today.  A few weeks pass, and NFLX is trading at $92 on Nov 15th, 5 days before expiration.  You can buy back the 90 PUT (which will be pretty cheap, thanks to time decay) and then turn around and sell, say, an $85 put for either the same expiration (\"roll down\") or sell an $85 put for the next expiration period (\"roll down and out\").   This allows you to manage the trade a bit. \n\nThe worst thing that can happen when you sell a strangle is the stock shoots straight up right after you write it - this leaves you in a naked call position (potential for unlimited cash losses) and time decay hasn't yet worked in your favor, so buying back your option is expensive as fuck.  The ONLY thing you have in your favor in that situation is there is that long calls don't typically get assigned right away, so you could theoretically wait for it to come back down a bit, or buy a further OTM call to at least stop the bleeding.  Ugh, naked calls.  They're YOLO as shit though. ", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1298317015171051}], "tickers": []}
