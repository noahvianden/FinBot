So I do believe it will run on AMD and there is a couple percent upside we will see on Tuesday.\nAs for the future of AMD beyond consoles, I see it doing rather well with their APUs, and continuing good GPU sales. However I dont believe they will become as large as intel anytime soon, but their APU offerings have always been ahead of intel  and will continue to do so. (im weighing GPU performance heavily, as that is what is needed these days- not CPU improvements), This will allow them to start to secure the PC market (laptops being the big seller, then desktops), and they are working on downscaling their APUs for mobile platforms such as tablets. The Temash APU should find its way into tablets in a couple months.\n\nI strongly believe x86 hybrid tablet/laptops will be the future of the PC market and tablet market, and that AMD has well positioned itself to create a versatile APU that gives the consumer what they want, at a much lower price then intel can offer manufacturers.\n\nThe only question is whether or not AMD can break intels hold on manufacturers, as intel has been proven several times in court that they threaten and bribe manufacturers to use their chips over AMD.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "amd", "intc"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I bot AMD last month, up 52 percent since I got in.
