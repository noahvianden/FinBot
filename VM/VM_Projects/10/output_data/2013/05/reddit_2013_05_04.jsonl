AH Friday had nothing to do with this since the earnings report came out Thursday May 2 and thus the market reacted to it Friday during regular hours.   If you wrote this article late Thursday you can say it was down Thursday AH, but since you wrote it Friday it's just better to say down at close Friday. \n\nWhen you say something is down AH you are implying something changed since the market closed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Only .22% to $175.20.  I wouldn't say it dropped that much further.   \n\nThere's a lot more wrong with that write up than just that.  For example you are implying the there is a bubble and that it burst, but your only evidence of that is that the price per share dropped about 13% on poor guidance.  \n\nYou give no analysis of the fundamentals as to why it is a bubble and why it is bursting.\n\nFTR I do think LNKD is incredibly overvalued and my reason is to simply look at at that PE ratio of about 900 to 1.  This company is valued at $19B with just 19 cents in earnings on the year(I haven't looked at the latest filings).    The poor guidance on revenues going forward surely means that traders are dreaming to think that the company will make enough in earnings over the next year or so to bring that PE down to a more reasonable ratio, say 50-1 which is still high to me but at least it's on planet Earth.
