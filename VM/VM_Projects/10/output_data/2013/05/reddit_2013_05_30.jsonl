A few months ago, they were at 2.80 or so and now they're at about four.\n\nIf Microsoft and Sony are going to cause AMD's stock to rise back up to around 8 or 10, will it happen soon, or would it have already happened?\n\nWould this be a wise investment?\n\nIf not, what about STX (Seagate)? They are a leading producer of storage modules such as hard drives, disk drives, and solid state drives in the technology industry, which is rapidly developing. \n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks!", "id": "1fb4aq", "created_utc": 1369877695.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "Plenty of AMD discussion on here and /r/investing.

Doing a very small amount of research you will quickly realize that the amount of gaming consoles sold by no means replaces the diminishing market for computers.
