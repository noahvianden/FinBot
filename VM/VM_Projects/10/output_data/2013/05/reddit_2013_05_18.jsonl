The daily MACD shows a new shorter term uptrend but volume isn't impressive.  Without news this could turn down.\n\n\nGGAL - Nice wedge forming, weekly and daily MACD look similar with a slight uptrend.  My guess is it will continue to trade sideways a bit more and depending on any news, etc. it's a 50/50 shot.\n\n\nAVEO - With recent news I'm not sure this will turn positive.  The weekly MACD looks like it might be in the early stages of bottoming out, the daily MACD looks like it's beginning to turn up.  In any event it's too soon and warrants watching a bit to see how the news will shake out.\n\n\nGMO - Weekly RSI show this to be over sold, the weekly MACD looks as thought it's beginning to turn positive.  The daily MACD looks to be close to confirming the shorter term uptrend.  The volume looks OK but not quite reassuring.  This could set up nicely into a longer term uptrend but still a little early to tell.\n\n\nJRCC - This one is trending already and the daily RSI is showing over bought.  The daily MACD confirmed the short term uptrend in early May.  The weekly RSI is still below over bought territory and the weekly MACD has yet to confirm the longer term uptrend but looks like it will.  I think if the weekly MACD lines move positive that will be a decent buy signal and this could set up for a nice uptrend.\n ", "id": "1elcg1", "created_utc": 1368907412.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Here's another few I like\n\n[SGYP](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sgyp&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\n[CHTP](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=chtp&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\nBoth of these are going to see some heavy action in the next 6-7 months, but my bet is that you'll double your money within the next 4-5 months.

I have a ShareBuilder account that I use for my long term holds with companies that I am interested in.  I like ShareBuilder's automatic investment plan to purchase shares on a monthly basis with a fixed amount which allows you to purchase partial shares.  It's basically a [Dollar Cost Averaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) method of investing.\n\nI am about to open an account with another online brokerage that has a lower transaction fee so that I can experiment with swing trading and technical analysis.  I've been doing some personal research and educating myself on the subject lately.  So for these types of trades I'm not that concerned with the long term outlook of the company.  So that was the intent behind my posts with these companies.\n\nThis was my comment on ECTY a little over a week ago for what it's worth.\n\n\n\n*I looked into them as well about the time they started the latest run up. Vista Partners initiated coverage on them and set a price target of $3.70. That caught the interest of a lot of investors and hence the run up.\nLook into them a bit and you'll see that they received a large sum from the DOE to build out a charging network and that market isn't quite there yet. Of course the government's position is that in order to sell more EVs you need the infrastructure, hence their investment in ECTY, among others.*\n\n*One of their competitors and a larger company is AeroVironment (AVAV) and they do a lot more than just EV charging stations/infrastructure. There are a lot of other companies also getting into this area. So the competition will be tough for a while.*\n\n*My opinion is that they just had a run up and right now may not be a good time to buy in unless you are looking to hold them for the long term and don't mind seeing the pps dip a bit in the short term. I think the stock may be a bit over priced and could pull back a bit more. They are about at their 20 DMA now at $1.55. I think they could continue to trend with the 20 DMA with further partnership/business news but until they release earnings that show they can be profitable then this is a pretty speculative play.\nIn my opinion if you are OK with some significant risk and willing to wait this one out for the long term you might get lucky.*\n\n*Cheers and good luck.*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "/r/patterntrading exists but no one uses it", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I wonder why", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "oh god, you again", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13775219023227692}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12293336540460587}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.016425566747784615}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7508083581924438}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5260554552078247}], "tickers": ["amzn"]}
