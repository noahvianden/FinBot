If you consider a five year horizon for investment, will the current price or a $65 entry make that much difference?  Probably not.\n\nI've been invested in SBUX for so long and have spent so much time following it that when it dropped into the high $40s not too long ago, I was telling everyone and their brother is was a total no-brainer.  It's returned about 60% since that point late last fall.\n\nAre their other investments that could have done better?  Absolutely.  \n\nBut, not very many that have someone like Schulz at the helm, an absolutely unbeatable ability to execute, a solid growth plan internationally, the brilliance to get people hooked into both their stored-cash card and their loyalty programs, and continually evolves into new growth markets which puts their substantial FCF to work.
