Even if their revenue, profit margin and earnings stay flat, the stock is insanely cheap right now.  If they start to see all three of these technicals decline (which hasn't happened, it simply slowed), then what is happening right now is rational. Same thing happened to Dell, HP, and Microsoft. In my opinion, the new markets they are emerging in will not allow these to decline or even flatten out anytime soon. I think everyone is shitting their pants because they see the company loosing steam in the near future with what products they do offer. I bought in at 520, which I thought was a steal. Apparently the market disagrees after today. However, I think that they need one new product release to be the catalyst that shoots them back up into the mid 600's and I am confident a company like Apples track record can provide that. Not sure when or even if that will happen, but I plan on continuing to invest the dips because I am confident it will be back.
