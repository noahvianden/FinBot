That kind of cash per share ratio is normally reserved for distressed companies (i.e. RIMM when trading near $10). Let's not even discuss PE, since market clearly doesn't care what AAPL's PE ratio is, why bother.\n- Supply constrained on iPhone 5, iPhone 4 (surprise), iPad mini, and iMacs for the entire quarter.\n- YoY double digit % increase in all products except for Macs and iPod.\n- New method for giving guidance: no more EPS figure. Just a \"likely\" range for gross margin % and top line. The days of huge beats vs their guidance may be over. (NOTE: I think this is what caused the big drop in AH). Plugging their guidance for next Q into my spreadsheet gives me a number in high 9s.\n- Both top line and bottom line increased from Q1 last year. EPS shows a YoY decrease because the shares float increased.\n\nMy conclusion, company looks very healthy, but we're in the midst of a painful transition from AAPL being owned by growth investors to being owned by value investors. Ironically, AAPL is still growing EPS faster than GOOG, which is not a value stock.\n\nI'm certainly going to take it on the chin tomorrow.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I agree with you that it is at a ridiculously low level right now.
