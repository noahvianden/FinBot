Schwager. I've been trading for 4 years, options for about a year and a half, and I wish I read this book 5 years ago. No matter what kind of trading you want to do, you will benefit from reading this book.\n\nAn option is a contract which gives the holder the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price (the \"strike\" price.) A holder of a \"call option\" gives the owner the right to buy at the strike price, and a \"put option\" gives the owner the right to sell a stock at the strike price. One contract is for 100 shares. However, these contracts expire on the expiration date, at which point you can either exercise them (buy/sell the shares at the strike price) or sell it and get the intrinsic value for it.\n\n\nAs I'm typing this, I'm realizing that it's hard to give a quick overview of options. As there is plenty of information already written about them which is available on the internet, I'll leave you to it. But basically, I trade options because it gives me leverage (increased gains/losses) over trading the stock itself. A 1% move in the stock will cause some options to increase 100% or more.  So if you can time the market, you can make a substantial amount of money trading options.\n", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7546796798706055}, {"body": "There is no \"quick overview\" that is sufficient to allow you to trade.\n\nSimply put, options are purchasing the right to buy or sell stocks at a specified price at a specified time.  What you make or lose on those options is not only dependent on the stock price but the timing of the stock price.\n\nDon't start trading options until you have been trading equities actively for at least two years.  Then paper trade options for about six months and make sure you understand the greeks.\n\nUnderstanding the risk/reward in options is a lot more complex than regular stocks, and you can chew through your gains like crazy because of transaction costs.\n\nPick a good book and then sit down and work through the examples until you get them.
