{"title": "I want to talk about the psychology of people who go all the way on exponential gambles like bitcoin, Tesla, and tulips and make +xx,xxx% returns.", "selftext": "It takes a while to really appreciate the worthlessness of hindsight in both investing and trading.  \n  \nThe lessons of trading can be taught in an afternoon (similar to poker), but you won't understand them until you have been there and had those same lessons emotionally impact you while dealing in real money (similar to poker).  Deep down, many of us wish we will one day make the 'brilliant idiot' play of someone who buys something about to hit a tipping point and then hold it until the mania is in full swing, when we finally sell to absolutely ludicrous returns on our investment (+xx,xxx%).  \n  \nThis will probably never happen, and those who are disciplined investors know that such fantasies are actually just traps in the way of actually acquiring real wealth slowly and steadily.  **Very few people get rich this way, but a lot of people get broke quickly by trying.**  \n  \nHowever, assuming that you have your responsible investments covered, and you are using purely play money, I want to talk about the psychology involved in such an ordeal.  For ease of example, let's assume we have tulips that a few years ago were available for pennies, and now are trading for over a thousand dollars apiece (but by all means, feel free to cite specific examples you have seen/experienced).  \n  \nFor example, you would have to buy your tulip when either:  \n----------------------\n  \n**a.)** It was worthless and everyone was mocking you for your poor investment decisions (*'really?  enjoy losing your money'*).  Using the latest tulips as an example, this would correspond to buying into any price from 1 cent to 10 dollars.  \n  \n**b.)** it had just begun it's meteoric ascent.  You wouldn't make absurd returns, just ridiculous ones.  This would correspond to recognizing an early pattern of potential explosive growth and jumping on the bandwagon early.  This would correspond to buying tulips at prices from $10 to $100.  \n  \n**But buying is just the beginning**.  Then you have to **hold**.  You have to hold through new high after new high.  You have to sit and listen to every voice of reason telling you that your 'investment' is overvalued and about to crash at any given moment.  \n  \nAnd *worse*, you probably actually have to endure at least one or two actual value crashes during the ascent.  The psychological pressure becomes even worse at this point because now all the naysayers are *right* and you were (temporarily) an idiot for holding on for so long.  \n  \nYou would have to hold through all of this insane pressure to sell, and the terrible guilt as you watched value plummet during crashes... all the way to the exponential high of $1,000+ a tulip.  \n  \nAnd then, after all of that stone-wall holding... you have to recognize when the actual high is near and sell.  \n  \nI would love to hear your best tulip stories, and to hear your emotions throughout.\n-------------------------  \n  \nAnd to be clear, an exponential rise can happen in a period of a few months or an entire decade; the concept is the same, just stretched over a longer time period.

Attempting to analyze it beyond just chance is useless - it's like asking a lottery winner at the 7-11 why he picked the 6 numbers he did.\n\nIn your tulip example - once you're up 1000%, what makes you hold out for 10000%?
