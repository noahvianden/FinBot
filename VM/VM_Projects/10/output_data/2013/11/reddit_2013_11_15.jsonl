But it's a gamble because them good 'ole boys who buy trucks like their Chevy's and Fords.  Although if your looking for pulling power, an electric truck will out torque a diesel Dodge Ram all day long.  I think this idea has merit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "As a Honda salesman (Ridgeline), you cannot overestimate the loyalty of Ford and Chevy truck buyers. I know the RL is a different type of truck, but it does what 90% of truck owners use their trucks for better than the domestic brands, and I have yet to see one person convert. Its the construction worker's boss's boss that drives a Ridgeline. \n\nI love Tesla, and they probably know all of this and have a plan, but an incredibly different market than the luxury status symbol green vehicle thing they've been so successful at.

", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ridgeline is 100% made in the USA. Rides worlds nicer. Has better features. Is far safer, has a locking and waterproof trunk in the bed, fully lit bed, intelligent AWD in addition to 4WD mode, and maintains resale value better than almost every gasoline truck out there. However, your father did not drive one, your father-in-law will make fun of you, your grandfather will make you park it down the street, all your Co workers will tease you relentlessly. \n\nUnless Tesla can overcome those issues (they can't), then they had better be aiming at a different niche.  Ridgelines sell to safety inspectors, land surveyors,  that actually go to a work site regularly, network guys who install spools of fiber optics...\n\nActually, this may not be such a bad idea. Especially on the west coast. I'm in the Midwest, so the import hate is much worse.

They are being roadtested in Japan and that big australian mining company whose name i forgot is automating it.s huge dumptrucks. \nTesla chose the pick-up market because it is big. UPS/FEDEX trucks is too small a market for them. They went from luxury sedan, to an SUV and now a pick-up. These large markets will generate cash that will allow them to invest in the nessecary electric and maintenanceinfrastructure it will need before before moving down the line to stationwagons and compact cars.
