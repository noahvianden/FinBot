I chose Disney.\n\nApple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) was a toss up for me. I was not entirely sure, but was leaning towards Google.\n\nLastly, UPS (UPS) and Union Pacific (UNP). This was the other one I was not completely sure about, but I was thinking UPS.\n\nIf you guys could give your input, that'd be great.
