{"title": "AAPL macd-H double bottom divergence", "selftext": "I wanted a piece of AAPL for a long time and waited for the right time. Today I saw it come up on one of the scans I run daily and took a look at the chart.\nThe weekly chart looks almost like a double bottom from April's low to today and the MACD-H which was slightly negative at April is now slightly positive.\n\nhttp://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=AAPL&p=W&b=5&g=0&id=p98481893927 \n\nI bought the deep in the money far out in the future mini call with strike of 330 and expiration on Jan 2015 for 92.40 each.\n\nI plan on waiting for it to rise and sell covered calls out of the money for income in the coming months.\n\nAlso AAPL is on the MagicFormulaInvesting.com list and passes the Rule#1 criteria so it is a high probability good stock for the coming years.\n\nI like to combine strong justifications from an investor's point of view with the trader's point of view. I hope I didn't massage the data too much to fit what I wanted to see.\n\nWhat do you think?

I posted something similar on HSM about a reverse symmetry movement ([here](http://www.hotstockmarket.com/t/40090/aapl-apple-inc/16500#post_2966534)). \n\nSo if the pattern is similar, the first move over resistance was approx. 5.3% (485-460/460). So if we keep it consistent we look at the breach of support from it's range. Support is approx. 418-460. A move approx. 5.3% of 418 is 395 (a target we hit today). Long story short, there is an expected approx. 10% move based on my theory from 395. Which should bring us to 434 (math on the thread is a bit off). \n\nThen you look at the indicators on the bottom and how to interpret that is:\n>The %K (showing the ratio of differences between current close and lowest price and between highest and lowest prices) is the main line. The second is the %D line being a moving average of %K over a chosen period.\n\nK is red and D is purple. Stocks where both K and D are hovering under 20, I consider that highly oversold and for volatile stocks that move can be explosive. So in my opinion, if we see that 10% we should see it relatively quickly like between 5-10 trading days.
