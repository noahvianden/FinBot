Although the sample size is small, there has been better success with the straddles (using all ATM strikes). However, we did have a view on AMD earnings a few weeks ago where we employed a wide strangle. [Details on open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77hpuHw5eo0) and [details on close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u2g-lgietU).\n\nThat same week we did something similar with TSLA and lost out after they barely moved the day after earnings.\n\nWhat it really comes down to is how much time value your long options will retain relative to your short options. The IV crush will reduce both significantly, but you will profit when the shorts get crushed harder than the longs. It might sound obvious, but it\u2019s deceptively hard to get right.\n\nIn the case of a wide strangle like this (relative to IV), your biggest risk is the stock not moving at all, in which case all options will crush down to near 0. Both sides will be 5% OTM, which is a huge gap for 25% and 7 DTE.\n\nOtherwise, if you get a big move, you can assume that the far OTM side will crush to 0 and hope that the net remaining time value on the other side exceeds your entry debit so you can turn a profit. If you\u2019re dealing with poor option liquidity, then this could be a very difficult fill to get. In my experience, you have to leg in and leg out to realize profit, but it can be done.
