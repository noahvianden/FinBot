I ended up deciding against but I could see them doing well if they can figure a few things out. Their biggest concerns are:\n\n1) Making and maintaining a net profit. The company has seen revenue grow quite a bit but they\u2019re still struggling to be a profitable company. It\u2019s not too alarming as they are still relatively new and in their early days, where many companies struggle with staying out of the red. I haven\u2019t read their last couple earnings but IIRC they were going deeper in the red despite growth in their overall revenue. Growth for the sake of growth can be dangerous, they want to make sure they\u2019re both growing and getting closer to profitability.\n\n2) Competition. Like any business/sector, there is fairly strong competition within Teledoc\u2019s sector. We\u2019ve seen a few companies emerge over the last decade trying to do the same thing Teledoc is. Right now Teledoc is the leader in the field but it should be a competitive race.\n\n3) Laws/Insurance. The US healthcare and insurance system is a total mess and extremely complex. Each state has different laws, regulations, licenses, and requirements that it can serve as a roadblock for a company like Teledoc. This is partially why Teledoc has found some success overseas as these laws and regulations in other countries are either less complicated or more universal across the country. I\u2019m not sure how the company can get around barriers like this.\n\n4) International exposure and growth is great but the money is in the US market. You can see this by looking at their financials. They have to figure out a way to penetrate the US market and get around or work with our current system for healthcare and insurance. Again, this is going to be tough but the money is in the US. \n\n5) Privacy/Convincing People. Some people are cautious and weary of using a platform like this. They don\u2019t trust it or are weary over doing business over the internet when it comes to something like their health. They\u2019ll have to convince consumers that they can be trusted with this information so ensuring their platform is safe and secure is critical. They can\u2019t afford to have any major security breaches, hacking, or data scandals. Facebook took a beating for similar concerns, a similar event could spell the end to a company like Teledoc. So far so good but they have to make sure user security remains a priority.\n\nI think the idea is great and really hope they succeed but they have some significant concerns and obstacles they\u2019ll have to overcome. If you\u2019re going to invest in them, I\u2019d make sure this is a company you\u2019re willing to hold long term and that you can stomach some volatility. If you look at the stock\u2019s performance you\u2019ll see it\u2019s all over the place over the past year.

Maybe i'll wait a few more quarters to get some clarity on the situation. I like the industry and im very positive about the future of healthcare. I think teledoc will stand to gain from this growth IF they maintain their position in telehealth. Competition is inevitable but what is concerning to me is if the big guys such as amazon decide to enter the market, its not gonna turn out pretty for sure. Teledoc still doesnt have much cash so if the big guys come into their space, Teledoc imo will have to raise capital via debt or equity to maintain their position.
