{"title": "Surreal Expectations Is This One?", "selftext": "So I'm working with a firm that does options.

Jan I did $750 in profit using 3 contracts max per trade, but the issue with it was I think I had about the max 2k worth of risk (entire portfolio not single trade) on at any given time and I don't want to max out my buying power and dip in to leverage. I've always been told \"past performance does not reflect future gains\". The truth in tow was that I may or may not have gotten lucky twice that I omitted because there was an AAPL and NVDA trade that I took super out of the money that ended up deep in the money the following day. I just never accepted them as official trades, it's paper c'mon, but I felt I got lucky on the magnitude of the moves rather than the direction. Despite that the employer seems a bit pushy in telling me time is of the essence which is also strangely said in the contract as a push tactic to get me to sign.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI dunno, I'm a bit leery about a few other points but what do you guys think?
