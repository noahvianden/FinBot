{"title": "selling options on an S&P500 based portfolio?", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm not sure if there's a proper term for this, but anyway I'll try to explain best as I can.\n\nI have a portfolio that consists of members of the S&P500, selected based on some recent performance and generally companies I like fundamentally. Not all the members of the S&P make it in, obviously, because that would make it hell and I'd be better off buying SPY or something instead.\n\nI'm interested in selling calls against this portfolio since it should have a good deal of correlation to the S&P500 itself. How would one go about calculating the desired delta should be when selecting the strike and the quantity of contracts?\n\nRight now I'm thinking of doing the following (just as an example, I'm pulling these numbers out randomly):\n\n250 shares of JPM, beta at 0.8 will \"contribute\" long 200 delta in SPY\n\n10 shares of AMZN, beta at 0.6 will \"contribute\" long 6 delta in SPY\n\nAssuming my portfolio only consists of these two positions, my total portfolio delta in SPY terms will be 206 and assuming I wanted to be delta neutral, I should short a total 206 delta in options (something like 10 contracts of 20 delta calls).\n\n\nIt makes sense to me but the idea of selling 10 contracts is kinda scary. Am I missing something? Is there another way to do this?\n\n(I wouldn't be shooting for delta neutral, maybe to cut it from 206 to 100 or something, the delta neutral was just for illustration purposes)", "id": "b02xjj", "created_utc": 1552361241.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "preface: i'm not endorsing this strategy, it's just an example w/ your numbers.\n\nBeta is weighted vs the security not by the share price. Ignoring any alpha, 10 shares of AMZN at a beta of 0.6 won't move like 6 shares of SPY it will move like 60% of the value of the shares worth of SPY. With AZMN at 1670, 10 shares is $16,700 total which will move like $10,020 worth of SPY or 36 shares.\n\nJPM at 104.35, 250 shares is $26,087 which factoring in the beta of 0.8 is about 75 shares of SPY. So if those two stocks were your whole portfolio and you wanted to be BETA neutral, then you would short 101 shares of SPY. Or sell like two contracts with deltas of 0.50 or something.\n\nThen your exposure would only be from the alphas of the stocks + things like slippage from the options and you would generate some minor income from the thetas on the calls you sold.\n\nedit: or if you wanted to use your 20 delta calls, you would sell 5 of them, but that's a position you would need to manage because if SPY keeps rising the delta is going to bump quickly and all of a sudden you might be short 5 60 delta calls and then you'll end up net-short spy because the beta on the shares won't change. if this is the route you want to go and you're not experienced then you should either do it with a spread or just sell a couple of them and stay net-long spy until it runs up and you get back to neutral, then maybe roll them over.\n\nedit 2: also AMZN has a beta of 1.63 and JPM has a beta of 1.04, so I don't know where those 0.6 and 0.8 numbers came from but I just used them.

Beta is the factor by which you multiply a return in SPY to get the \"equivalent\" return on a different stock. Think of it as some sort of \"return amplification factor\".\n\nAlso, I'm not sure where you got your betas from, they seem way off. E.g., AMZN tends to move considerably more than SPY each day, so AMZN's beta should be > 1. According to Yahoo Finance, the 3-month beta is ~1.6; according to Nasdaq, it's about ~1.4 (not sure how long it is though).\n\nIn any case, you should look for something called \"beta-weighted delta dollars\". Delta dollars is the dollar equivalent exposure of your deltas. In other words, it's the value of the stock multiplied by how many shares you have.\n\nE.g., 10 shares os AMZN --> ~$16.7k AMZN-delta-dollars\n\nA 1% change in SPY is equivalent to a 1.6% change in AMZN (assuming beta = 1.6). A 1.6% change in the portfolio above is equivalent to ~$267.

{"title": "Ladybaybee recommended stock picks 2019-03-12", "selftext": "[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/GBtXNbV)\n\n**HOW I USE THIS:** \n\n1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as \u201cBUY\u201d opportunities.\n\n2) I focus in the column \u201cSuccess Rate(3m)\u201d which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. \n\n3) Then, I see the number in \u201cTx(3m)\u201d which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. \n\n4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (>5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. \n\n5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.\n\n\n6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. \n\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nI am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The \u201cNot Owned\u201d column means: if you don\u2019t own this stock then you should \u2026 The \u201cOwned\u201d column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column \u201cGrowth(1 Year)\u201d refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column \u201cTx(1Yr)\u201d shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. \u201cFactor\u201d is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally \u201cSuccess Rate\u201d shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.\n\nMany people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of \u201clookalike\u201d stocks as well as major ETF\u2019s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.\n\nYou can follow my picks on twitter @ladybaybee1", "id": "b08l1b", "created_utc": 1552401966.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "So, what you essentially did, was automate algorithm generation, back test all the algos you generated, and have it recommend stocks that showed the most reliable / predicatable patterns.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty interesting, and I can\u2019t say it won\u2019t work.
