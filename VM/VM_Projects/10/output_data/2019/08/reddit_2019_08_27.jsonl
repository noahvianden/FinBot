{"title": "Charter Communications: Cord Cutters Crash Common Cable Company", "selftext": "Charter, which, following its acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House, is now the second largest cable company in the United States, services 27.2 million customers through its various residential and commercial business segments. Of the company\u2019s variety of offerings, which includes video, Internet, voice, enterprise solutions, and other services, the firm\u2019s primary channels of revenue are through its residential video and Internet services, which, combined, contributed over 74% of the firm\u2019s revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. While the company\u2019s commercial services are important, this analysis focuses on the residential part of Charter\u2019s operations due to the disproportionate amount of revenue that is generated therein.\n\nThe traditional competitors to Charter in its cable video offerings include other cable operators such as Comcast and Verizon as well as satellite television providers, including AT&T and Dish Network. Charter, itself, following its acquisitions in 2016, identified its own peer group as containing: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Spring, Time Warner Inc., Viacom, Dish Network Corporation, CenturyLink, and a few other, less notable and/or comparable companies. In both the cable video and Internet industries, Charter competes as a cost-leader, whereas other companies, such as Verizon, compete on quality and differentiation.\n\nThe cable provider industry sells access to video content generally on a subscription basis, frequently bundling video services with other, related services including Internet and voice: 59% of Charter\u2019s customers subscribe to a bundled package of the company\u2019s services. Cable and satellite television services, has witnessed a substantial dip in subscribers in recent years, with a nearly 1.5 million net customer loss in 2017. This trend of \u201ccord-cutters\u201d is being driven by demographic changes, shifting consumer preferences, and by substitute products from new market entrants. Pay-TV penetration has fallen from 88% to 79% since 2010.\n\nYounger consumers are not reliable cable customers: 65% of consumers from 18 to 29 years old subscribe which pales in comparison to the 83.0% of consumers over 50 years old that subscribe. While this may be, in part, due to the relative levels of disposable income between these two customer segments, it very well could be attributable to the other, perhaps more threatening, trend of new market entrants taking away market share. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and other streaming services threaten to capture market share from incumbents in the subscription TV industry. These streaming alternatives not only offer packages that are more finely tailored to the desires of the individual customer, but they are substantially cheaper than cable TV packages. At $35 per month, YouTubeTV significantly undercuts Charter, which tries to act as a cost leader. This trend of lower-cost alternatives entering the market is more problematic for Charter, as a cost leader, than for firms that offer a differentiated product. If Charter\u2019s only selling-point is its lower cost relative to the industry, they have no competitive advantage if they are undercut.\n\n\nAnother trend within the industry is the increasing cost of content. Which content a cable provider offers is extremely important to how well they are able to attract new customers and reduce the churn of their existing client base. 21% of consumers report having signed up for a streaming service for access to a specific show. This number is even higher for younger consumers, who will become an increasingly important source of revenue for the coming years. Again, as a low cost provider, the company is only able to pass on the increasing price of content so much before consumers will move elsewhere with their money.\n\nCharter is a highly leveraged company, with a debt ratio of 46.5% and net debt to EBITDA of 4.53 at the end of FY17. Charter recognizes that it \u201c[has] a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect [the company\u2019s] financial health and [its] ability to react to changes in [its] business\u201d. Among the most important implications of the company\u2019s debt are the fact that the interest and principal payments detract, in a significant way, from the firm\u2019s funds available for capital expenditures and changes in the business. This is especially critical for Charter given the industry trends of technological innovation, increasing content costs, and the high capital intensity of the broadband industry. The dire nature of the firm\u2019s current position can be seen by its EBIT-to-interest coverage ratio, which is 1.33 for 2017. This means that the firm only generated enough earnings through operations to pay off its interest obligations 1.33 times. This ratio is dangerously close to 1.0, below which the firm would be unable to pay off its interest payments purely through income from operations.\n\n\nWhile other, potentially more lucrative, short opportunities might be out there, Charter could be a good company to bet against in the mid-to-long term based on your macro outlook. If you\u2019re bearish on the market as a whole, Charter is significant and dependent enough to be dragged down with the market, while offering very limited idiosyncratic upside potential. The company has already revealed a propensity for rapid, significant shifts in its stock price from ~$390 at the beginning of 2/18 to $260 at the end of 3/18.", "id": "cvwyli", "created_utc": 1566866988.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Can I get a TLDR", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Charter sucks grandpa's gray balls, buy puts 6 months out, way out the money.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I wish THIS succinct sentence was the original post.
