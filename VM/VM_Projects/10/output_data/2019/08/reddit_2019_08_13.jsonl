One pays for charging but members get a discount on home charging equipment and one can also add on discounted charging rates for the country\u2019s largest network of public EV charging stations. That\u2019s just one of several useful monthly add-ons one may choose to add to their subscription, such as car and bike share memberships, discounted parking at rural and suburban train stations, etc. \n\nThe Green Class starts at about $700USD a month for the half-price fare card and an i3 (I think).
