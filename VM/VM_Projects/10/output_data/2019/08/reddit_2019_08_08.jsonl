Just looking for some guidelines to follow. \n\nFor example: contracts 1 month out, hold maximum 2 weeks. Contracts 6 months out, hold max of 3 months.

Generally, avoid buying options, unless you expect serious price movement or an increase in volatility. If I were selling the option, I would\u2019ve already established my max loss, etc., so I\u2019d probably let it ride. In your situation, you could do all sorts of things to maneuver or adjust. For instance, you could convert it to a debit or credit spread, by selling at a strike below or above your current position. If you expect no movement in the short term, but expect a big change down the road, you could try a calendar spread, e.g. If you own a call at strike X for December 2019, try selling a call at strike X for October 2019. It\u2019ll help defray your costs. Best case scenario, the option you sell expires worthless, and the one you bought eventually comes around and spikes.
