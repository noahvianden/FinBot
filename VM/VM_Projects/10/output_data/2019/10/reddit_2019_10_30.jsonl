They were just bad in comparison to the hyper-unrealistic expectations of the  ivory tower analysts. A lot of people's portfolios got unfairly punished. Buyer beware, for sure, but a -40% drop for not-a-scandal type news is simply gross incompetence on the part of the likes of GS.

I hope they recover and thrive, but taking that kind of undeserved hit to its shares can devastate a company. Moral of the story: don't trust analysts.

Turbo positive would be if they shatter expectations and kick ass during the conference call. That's more of a subjective value, but any results that make you go \"dam, good job\" would be considered turbo positive. I read something along the lines of pumpkin increasing foot traffic by >15% yoy in stores during the same time period, but that was some finance article and not sited from management or a official report. \n\nMy only concern is them cutting guidance 2 months back. Where the fuck did that come from? The week before their CEO was on the news claiming SBUX is pumping on all cylinders... 7 days later, guidance cut. I thought that was bullshit, but well see how it plays out. \n\nAll in all, if its a beat (which I think it will be) you will clear your 88C or get really close to it imo.
