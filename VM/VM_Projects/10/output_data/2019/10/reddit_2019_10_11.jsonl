{"title": "The 5 stocks I would pick if I was a Hedge Fund Manager (Purely fun discussion, no stock positions in these companies)", "selftext": "My 5 stocks choices with competitive advantages are:\n\n1. Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE: UNP) -Their railroad networks dominate California to Chicago, all the way up to Canada then as far south as Mexico. Even with self driving technology, your self driving truck can't compete with a 200 long cargo train charging 100s of dollars a container. Rail is cheaper, fast, and eco friendly way of transport that reaches areas that may be inaccessible for trucks or not cost effective (Think transporting recycled steel).\n2. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) -Manufacturing military gear such as aircraft is very lucrative especially when you have an unaccounted for USA military industrial complex spending. With potential conflicts in so many nations, what could go wrong buying this stock?\n3. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) - Doctors are expensive sometimes costing upwards of 1 million a year to pay, insure, and other costs. All a robot needs is maintenance, a technician (almost always cheaper), electricity, hardware and software then you are good to go. Since healthcare is a fortune to pay for, and robots are typically significantly cheaper, developing automation is the smart thing to do.\n4. Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) - The world isn't any closer to a trash less society, this is a simple business model perfect for mega companies. The moat around US trash collection is how regulations on local, state, and federal levels make it a very hard business to get into which costs usually millions just to have dominion over one area. Republic Services is in 41 states and although is 2nd place to Waste Management, offers more growth potential due to Waste Management already being top dog. In addition Republic Service can profit off of trash collection via recycling.\n5. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) -Being an artisan company usually making $10 off something that is likely less than $1 to make is a lucrative business. Especially when your brand is worth billions and associated with middle class and up clientele. Starbucks is like the Disney of coffee, they sell the romance of coffee shops with a well proven and established formula. Considering coffee is just as addictive as any other normal thing like soda, it's no surprise to recommend Starbucks stock. I doubt most Starbucks drinkers are going to go cold turkey anytime soon with coffee.\n\nEdit: I plan on buying these stocks in the near future (within 1 month from today)\n\nAny thoughts on my 5 stock picks?", "id": "dgbtfw", "created_utc": 1570780149.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "For most of these you are essentially pitching an industry, not a stock. \n\nFor example, why Lockheed instead of Northrop Grumman? Or Boeing? If you are only bullish on military contractors in general, it would make more sense to take a position on the industry as a whole as opposed to blindly selecting a player in the industry to bet on. \n\nAlternatively, if you have a reason to believe that Lockheed Martin has a competitive advantage over it's competitors and will outperform the industry average in the long run, it might make sense to simultaneously take a long position on Lockheed and a short position on the industry as a whole to mitigate risk.

The DoD can say at any time they are going to reduce the number if F-35s or take issue with pricing and Lockheed just has to accept that. Intuitive Surgical has a great competitive advantage but I don't think you hit on it. You said that it is cheap to do the surgeries with the robot and that is not true. In fact it is more expensive than doing a procedure laparoscopically because those same tools can be reused by the hospital as opposed to the consumable tools used by the robot. Plus installing the robot is a tremendous investment for cash strapped hospitals. I'd love to buy it but can't get comfortable with valuation.
