I started buying tesla shares early this year around February and started to check out this thread since then. I started buying at over $280 at a bad time and started to buy more and more as the price went down in Q1 and Q2. At some point I had more than a third of my total capital invested in this stock an became obsessed. I analyzed all the financial statements, watched hours of both bear and bull cases on YouTube and checked out this thread every single day, even during the weekends when the market was not open but there was still discussion going on.\n\nI was there when we were all hoping for a great Q1 just to find all our investments in the red. I was also there in Q2 when we had faith in improvements and saw better deliveries but terrible profits. I held my ground with an average of $230 until today, because I knew there was going to be a moment to celebrate and I'm glad to finally see it, but it feels bad to celebrate on my own without thanking this community for helping me keep sanity and focus on the big picture.\n\nI found out a few weeks ago that my wife is pregnant so I'm pulling out all my gains tomorrow as now I should not take so much risk with my investments, but it has been a really fun ride.

{"title": "Most bullish ER -- Expect ATH", "selftext": "Before today, my expectation was 300 by year-end. But after reading the earning report and listened to the earning call, I predict TSLA is on the way to ATH and may even reach 420 in this year or after Q4 ER, which is way earlier than I expected -- that is the magic of 3% gross margin!\n\nStrong Points in this ER:\n\n1. They re-iterated 360K vehicles for the year, which means >105K in Q4. If they can be >100M profitable this Q with only 30M FSD recognition, they may easily hit 200-300M profit in Q4. Now imagine what the stock may be when analysts start to assume 1B profit and cash per year for Tsla...\n2. The prospect is simply great. With new solar roof unveil tmr (what a surprise!), FSD feature complete by year-end (Elon re-affirmed in the call although we shouldn't believe his timeline), GF4 to be announced by year-end and future GFs already in plan, increasing order backlog in all vehicles, pickup reveal incoming, model Y hit next summer, semi and roadster planned in the next 2 years, battery day and so on, TSLA has an extremely clear and winning road-path for 5 years --- like the strongest prospect of any company on earth. (we can safely assume robo-taxi may never happen or at least > 5 years)\n3. With GF3 running and model Y to come out next summer, TSLA 2020 delivery guidance will likely be about 500-600K. Assuming demands hold up, that is about 50% higher than 2019. One simply cannot find a better growth story.\n4. EV trend is strong, and model 3 demand looks sustainable. People will be familiar with Q1 seasonality and far less volatility is expected for 2020 Q1 -- as long as it is better than 2019 Q1 the story will be fine.\n5. Again, FSD feature complete by year-end! If true, one can expect a huge wave of Tsla cars and infinite demand in the near future -- it does not need to work perfectly, but 99.99% accuracy will make the driving extremely easy and everyone wants a Tsla => this will provide a one-term huge deferred revenue boost, also permanent profit / margin boost per quarter, plus strong demand => may potentially moon the stock 3 fold in a year, just like Cloud to Amazon. But again one often needs to multiple Elon's timeline by 2 or 3 times....\n\nPotential Risks (in order of importance):\n\n1. Whether demand holds up in US, China, and worldwide will be a perpetual point just like iphone...\n2. Whether the margin is sustainable in Q4 and beyond.\n3. Long-term competition, since all other auto-makers will start their EV production in 0-3 years.\n4. Any trade-war hint, recession issue, or global exchange risk can hit the stock.\n5. Any ramp-up issue in GF3 may hold stock back shortly.\n\nOverall, this report puts Tsla in its best position in years. It is a great feat they achieved it with tax credit almost gone.\n\nLet me know if I missed any point; and only time will tell if I am too bullish or not....I am a believer of 420 for now, and hopefully we see some analysts price targets to 420!", "id": "dmaf04", "created_utc": 1571886260.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Bro doesn't matter where the stock is at the end of the year, this is only the beginning", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "agreed!
