{"title": "Taxation for options contracts closed on last trading day of year", "selftext": "I bought and sold section 1256 compliant contracts. Most of the broker records are good, except for the trades on 12/31. I will give examples to illustrate.\n\n1. Bought SPX contract on 12/14, closed on 12/31. Shown as \"realized profit/loss\". I agree with this.\n2. Bought SPX contract on 12/14, closed next year Jan 10th (let us say). Shown as \"unrealized profit/loss current year\". I agree with this.\n3. Sold SPX contract on 12/14, closed on 12/31.\n   1. Not shown as realized loss as trade will settle next year. And they say this is done only for short sales closed on last day, not for scenario 1 above.\n   2. But they will also not report this as unrealized profit/loss current year because ... hey the trade is closed so there is nothing unrealized to report\n4. Sold SPX contract on 12/14, closed next year Jan 10th. Shown as \"unrealized profit/loss current year\". I agree with this too.\n\nSo basically scenario 3 above does not make sense to me. They are unwilling to change their accounting, but at the same time they are unwilling to provide me M2M value at the end of the year so that I can use either the realized or unrealized number.\n\nSome more scenarios:\n\n5. Sold MSFT contract (option expiring in February) on December 14. Closed it on 12/31. The way they have handled the 4 scenarios I described above, it is the same treatment. So the P&L is neither recorded as realized or unrealized. Now MSFT is not section 1256, but again is that correct? If I closed a trade on 12/31, it should be my realized P&L, no?\n\n6. Sold DIA contract on December 14, Closed it on 12/31. Same issue. But DIA is not a company stock and AFAIK it is not a 1256. My belief is that it should be recorded as \"realized P&L\" based on the trade date, not the settlement date. Is that correct?\n\nI have a call scheduled with IRS along with my accountant to discuss this, but that is on Monday and before that I wanted to see if someone here has any advice. I have lots and lots of transactions, and because I trade vertical spreads and I did rolled over a bunch of my positions on 12/31, and since the broker is counting only scenarios 1, 2, and 4 above, and just hiding scenario 3 - it ends up showing my P&L off by a very large amount, and I do not want to end up paying a lot of tax plus penalties when in my reading of 1256 there should not be any such difference whether I opened to buy or opened to sell.\n\nAppreciate any insights you can provide.", "id": "ddokzu", "created_utc": 1570288928.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Im not sure how it works for options but I know that for stocks long positions become realized on the trade date while short positions become realized on the settlement date for tax purposes.

First, equity options are treated the same way as shares of stock.\n\nFor equities options, long options that are sold to close on the final trading day are taxed on the closing date according to the IRS so for equities even your broker is incorrect.  Short options that are bought to close on the final trading day are taxed on the settlement date (usually 1/2 of the next year).  This is how my 1099 had a large negative P&L from TDA.  All of my long options closed on 12/31 were on the 1099, however, the short options closed on 12/31 were not and that's where the profit was.  The 1099 would be correct IF I traded equity options.\n\nThe problem is I trade SPX and RUT which are section 1256 contracts which should be marked to market.  Thankfully, TDA provides Gainskeeper reports which used used mark to market and were correct.  I reported the Gainskeeper P&L for that tax year and the following tax year.  If I ended up being audited, I would have provided the Gainskeeper reports and a spreadsheet I created that showed that the 1099 did not include short options closed on 12/31.\n\nIf your broker does not provide Gainskeeper, I recommend using TradeLog software.  Do not use the 1099 P&L if you are confident the P&L is incorrect.  It's on you to report an accurate P&L.  I tried to get TDA to issue a corrected 1099 and failed.\n\nI learned NOT to close short options on the final trading day of the year.\n\nI am not a CPA nor a tax attorney.

If a trade is close to its profit goal or max loss, I close it.  If a trade is close to an adjustment point, I adjust it.  \n\nIf a trade must be modified during the last trading day, I avoid closing short options.

Just saw it. I don't want to mention broker names because hey google is forever but the odds are quite high we have the same broker :)\n\nI do have gainskeeper records and I am very confident. 100% I actually did walk through these line by line with their tax group so I know it by heart. My only concern here would be whether I tracked all inaccuracies. My trade log (summarized so an extra line per contract) is 1000+ lines. I can't use windows software but I did see the tradelog website last weekend. I do have all records and cross tabs and will put them in some kind of permanent storage.

But your experience is very helpful. Thanks for your response.\n\nQuick follow ups:\n1) will our broker give a letter explaining why they are not classifying these transactions as either unrealized or realized? At least confirm that these trades were executed 12/31 but not reported as either realized or unrealized?\n2) have you tried m2m? I applied for trader status 2 years back but have been using 1099 because 95% of my p&l is 1256, 100% as of now. Wonder if there are any issues switching?\n\nEdit... I realized why it is not easy to do m2m. With 1256, you treat some gains as long term. But you can't do the same to everything else since there would be equity, there would be equity options and there would be dividend. As of now I deal with only 1256 but even for first few months of 2019, I had all the above (equity, equity options and dividend) so for both 2018 and 2019 I will need to calculate p&l separately for each kind.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1.

{"title": "Some interesting stories in the stock market this week", "selftext": "**Value Stocks**\n\nThe Stars Group (TSG) is up 33% this week after announcing a planned combination with Flutter Entertainment PLC, the owner of Paddy Power in the UK and Ireland. Flutter is getting a good deal, evidenced by a 6.6% jump in its own stock price, it is buying flutter for about 7x adjusted EBITDA before synergies.\n\nBut TSG share holders also look set to benefit from this deal as;\n\n* TSG\u2019s stock price has languished since it over paid for Sky Betting and took on too much debt. Flutter has much more reasonable debt levels and will be able to share the burden.\n* TSG\u2019s shareholders will benefit (along with Flutter stock holders) from a rise in Flutter since they are to receive 0.2253 shares in this all stock deal.\n* Both entities will benefit from cost savings and the potential opportunity to dominate online betting in both Europe and the US.\n\nThat market in the US alone has been estimated at between $7 billion to $9 billion. Competition will be fierce but the opportunity should allow strong double digit growth for years to come and make the current valuation (even after this weeks rise) of just 9.2x current year estimates look far too cheap.\n\n**Insider Buying**\n\nOn Monday, Barron\u2019s reported that four directors (later joined by a fifth) purchased stock in GameStop Corp in the first open-market purchases by insiders since September of 2016.\n\nThe purchases were mostly above $5.00 and, even though the stock has since risen to $5.55, investors may still be interested as the stock has fallen around 66% this year. The company has been hit by an unrelenting slump in sales as customers switch to buying games online. However the outlook has some rays of light as the company should receive a boost by the launch of new consoles planned for next year.\n\n**Acquisition**\n\nCedar Fair fell on Friday after the theme park operator turned down a $4 billion offer from Six Flags Entertainment, claiming it was inadequate. The stock closed on Friday with a market cap of $3.23 billion and there was no indication of a raised offer being forthcoming. However with synergies driving the deal, and with SG&A expenses of around 15% revenues (and 120% net income), a compromise might yet be reached.\n\n**Large Caps**\n\nHP Inc dropped almost 10% on Friday (to $16.64) after the company announced a bold new strategy to reduce its workforce by 16% as part of a broad restructuring meant to cut costs and boost sales growth. HP announced that it expects profit, excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020 (slightly above consensus $2.24). HP\u2019s board also boosted the company\u2019s share repurchasing plan by $5 billion on top of the $1.7 billion remaining on its existing plan. That looks significant compared to its current market cap of just under $25 billion.\n\nThe market was not impressed by the announcement but, if management are successful, the stock looks cheap at less than 7.5x forward earnings. Incoming CEO Enrique Lores (who is a long standing company man with about 30 years at the firm) said \u201cWe are really confident about the future of the company.\u201d\n\n**Speculative Opportunity**\n\nMeet Group stock price jumped almost 25% on Thursday after the company raised Q3 guidance with CEO of Meet Group, Geoff Cook saying that \"New features including streamer levels, VIP badges, first time buyer bonuses and one-on-one video chat are contributing to meaningful business results. Further, we believe that the moderation-related headwinds related to our recent safety enhancements are largely behind us.\u201d\n\nPutting the moderation-related headwinds behind them is key as the stock price dropped a few months ago due to concerns that its app was too racy for Apple and Google and might even be banned. The firm has taken steps to address those concerns and now has industry-leading safety practices including a prominent alert button for abuse reporting which sends a screenshot to Meet\u2019s 200 moderation employees for immediate review.\n\nWhile Q2 results were reasonable, the updated Q3 guidance reassures investors that management\u2019s eye is back on the ball trying to grow profits. Especially since Mr Cook also said he expected a strong Q4 \"Given the ongoing stabilization in our advertising business, we anticipate a seasonally strong fourth quarter in advertising,\"\n\n**Growth Stocks/High risk and speculative**\n\nOn Wednesday Zynex Inc, the non-invasive medical device company for pain management, announced 95% year over year order growth for the third quarter. CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the rise to the company's expansion of its sales force which has doubled over the past couple of years.\n\nThat\u2019s key because the company has reported its goal to grow to 400 sales employees over the next few years and expects each to generate $1 million of sales. Margins in this business are healthy and should improve as the business grows. Gross margins were 80% at the last quarter and net margins 28%. Hitting the $400 million revenue target should generate net income well in excess of $100 million. In comparison, the stocks valuation at Friday\u2019s close was just 3.65x that figure at $365 million.\n\nPlease feel free to \u201cFOLLOW\u201d me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

China  is not a 'friendly business environment', there are no anti-competitive  laws or judges and juries that are not bought up by the PRC. I'm  guessing Paypal is betting on the fact that they can distrupt the  absolute gigantic market share of WePay. (lol. its basically installed  on every chinese persons phone). Thing is, Tencent is the PRC's golden  duck, it allows them to conduct massive surveillance, and all the board  of directors will bend over for anything the PRC wants. Why would they  want to help out Paypal?\n2. WePay/WeChat  is not just a payment app. It is everything. It's google, facebook,  craiglist, your 401k, dating app, facetime, chat, .. the list goes on.  Theres a reason that this has gigantic market share, you can do  everything on it, including paying off loans, clearly they the better  service + they are a staple of current chinese culture.\n3.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 7th, 2019.\n\n# **Dow and S&P 500 will try to snap a 3-week slide as US-China trade talks kick off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/04/dow-sp-500-will-try-to-snap-a-3-week-slide-as-trade-talks-kick-off.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks will try to regain their mojo next week as China and the U.S. hold long-awaited trade negotiations in Washington.\n*****\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% this week while the S&P 500 slid about 0.3%. Overall, the two averages posted their first three-week losing streak since August.\n*****\n> Wall Street\u2019s poor performance for the week comes after a disappointing U.S. manufacturing data report sparked fears of a recession. The report itself pointed to trade as a key source of weakness for the manufacturing sector, making next week\u2019s trade talks the key focus for traders.\n*****\n> \u201cTrade talks are crucial, not just for the U.S., but globally,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe conclusion from central bankers, CEOs and CFOs is we\u2019re slowing down.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cThey are waiting for something constructive,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n> The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that U.S. manufacturing activity contracted to its lowest level in more than 10 years. This data sparked a two-day sell-off in which the Dow dropped more than 800 points. ISM Chair Timothy Fiore said trade \u201cremains the most significant issue.\u201d\n*****\n> Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have heightened over the past year, with both countries exchanging tariffs on billions of dollars worth of their products. However, the tone around U.S.-China trade improved recently as China increased last month .\n*****\n> White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also said Friday that \u201cpositive surprises\u201d could come out of next week\u2019s negotiations. Chinese and U.S. negotiators are expected to meet next Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n> But Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, warned signs of progress are crucial for the market moving forward. \u201cMarkets have entered a \u2018show me\u2019 phase,\u201d he said in a note to clients.\n*****\n> Investors will also look ahead to the Federal Reserve releasing the minutes from its September meeting on Wednesday. The Fed cut rates last month by 25 basis points for the second time this year, citing \u201cthe implications of global developments for the economic outlook\u201d among other factors.\n*****\n> \u201cIt seems to me Powell is laying the blame or the explanation for the weakness directly at the feet of the administration,\u201d said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. \u201cIt\u2019s growth outside of the U.S. It\u2019s the parts of the U.S. economy that are exposed to trade that are being affected. Other than that, the economy is doing fine.\u201d\n*****\n> Nonetheless, the probability of a third Fed rate cut increased this week amid weaker-than-forecast services and jobs-growth data. Market expectations for an October rate cut rose to around 80% from about 50% in the previous week, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n*****\n> On Thursday, ISM said the U.S. services sector grew at its slowest pace since August 2016. Meanwhile, data released Friday by the Labor Department showed slower-than-expected jobs growth in the U.S.\n*****\n> Counterintuitively, the stock market got a boost after both data sets were released. The major averages posted solid gains on Thursday and rallied more than 1% on Friday with the Dow jumping more than 350 points.\n*****\n> \u201cWith job growth decent but slowing, a contraction in manufacturing, the ongoing trade war, and low inflation, the Federal Reserve will cut the fed funds rate\u201d later in October, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Eagj9lV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/q3INzBH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/muLk8zh.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/40kqgIz.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rxU3GWe.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/opEoymj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ai0Hs6K.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OvgVTge.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TuJZAMj.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hGrjpRe.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/j8YZ3Wy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QnKvWBS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/4/19\n\n> All-in-all, it was a pretty mixed week for economic data, specifically manufacturing and labor data. While Markit\u2019s gauge on manufacturing was slightly stronger than both expectations and the August print, ISM\u2019s version disappointed with little in the way of bright spots among its components. Hard data, on the other hand, is showing a bit of a different picture as Durable Goods appear healthy with the fastest 3m/3m growth rate since last November as we discussed in Thursday's Closer. The Markit Services PMI and ISM\u2019s Non-Manufacturing Index were also split with Markit\u2019s reading holding steady as ISM disappointed once again. Employment data was the other major focus of the week with similar disappointments, but some silver linings. Ahead of Friday\u2019s Nonfarm Payrolls Report, ISM\u2019s Employment components for both the Manufacturing and Services sectors further weakened in September while this week\u2019s initial jobless claims rose slightly more than expected (although continuing claims fell again). ADP\u2019s reading on employment also fell more than expected. The NFP report followed suit showing fewer jobs added in September, but new lows in the unemployment rate and underemployment rate added to the case of continued labor market strength.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/100419-Eco.png))**\n\n> Economic data takes a bit of a breather next week with only two-thirds as many releases this week. Consumer credit is first up on the docket and is expected to moderate to $15 billion after a very strong print last time around. On Tuesday, we will get confidence numbers out of the small business world. NFIB\u2019s Small Business Optimism is forecasted to fall to 102.5 from 103.1 in August. PPI is also out that morning, although no change is expected for both the headline and core numbers. CPI data is due to be released later in the week on Thursday and likewise, no change is expected. Further in inflation data, on Friday, import and export price indices are also scheduled to be released. In labor data, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) will come out on Wednesday followed by weekly claims numbers the following day. After rising to 219K this week, claims are expected to improve to 217K. Finally, Friday\u2019s preliminary University of Michigan Sentiment for October will round out the week. It is expected to fall to 92.0 after last month\u2019s rebound up to 93.2.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/100419-Eco2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Labor Market Chugs Along\n\n> The U.S. labor market keeps chugging along, despite signs of weakness in other pockets of the U.S. economy.\n\n> Nonfarm payrolls rose 136,000 in September, and July and August payrolls growth were revised up by 45,000. The 12-month average payrolls change climbed to 179,000 including Friday\u2019s data, still slightly higher than the expansion average.\n\n> Overall, the September jobs report showed hiring has been steady, defying recent worries of economic weakness after surprisingly weak manufacturing and services surveys were released earlier this week. Other labor-market measures also look healthy. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September, a new cycle low, and initial jobless claims are still subdued.\n\n> Wage growth slowed notably last month, though, hinting that inflationary pressures could be moderating. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, average hourly earnings growth fell to 2.9% year over year, the slowest pace since July 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wage-growth-slips_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Slowing average hourly earnings growth could point to a cooling job market. However, average hourly earnings growth for production and nonsupervisory workers increased 3.5% year over year, indicating there could be temporary influences weighing down the overall wage measure. At any rate, 2.9% wage growth is still enough to buoy personal incomes and consumer spending while keeping interest rates at bay.\n\n> \u201cEven though hiring has slowed slightly this year, it still looks healthy for the 10th year of this economic expansion,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWages are growing near a 3% clip, and we still see evidence that domestic inflation is subdued enough to support an accommodative Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# October Most Volatile Month of the Year\n\n> Historically speaking, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to reach its seasonal high in the month of October. This may be due to the fact that the two worst performing months of the year, August and September (by average performance) precede it. October also has the honor of slaying twelve, post-WWII bear markets. A bear market\u2019s low is frequently accompanied by high levels of fear and market volatility. VIX\u2019s seasonal pattern can be seen in the following chart. October\u2019s peak and July\u2019s low are indicated by blue arrows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d4228dac4015d5a36ad78a5f1e387ac/82d3c849ec28ac26-fb/s500x750/47de0619630baef67f78abd4e78de224db1526f8.jpg))**\n\n> October\u2019s volatility peak is also visible when actual daily percent changes are analyzed. October has hosted the most daily moves in excess of 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7% and even 10% since 1930. Do not fret over the nine times S&P 500 has moved more than 10% in a single day. Six of the nine occurrences were way back in the 1930\u2019s. Only three have occurred more recently and out of those, two were actually positive days (10/13/2008 +11.58% and 10/28/2008 +10.79%). Actually only two of the nine days with moves in excess of 10% were negative days: 3/18/1935 \u201310.06% and 10/19/1987 \u201320.47%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc66e10380325a9a76bef59132f9ca2d/82d3c849ec28ac26-7e/s500x750/27c964dfdc987ec33b27dc8207f4b367e0928ffb.jpg))**\n\n> Putting the table data into a bar chart adds a quick confirmation of October\u2019s heightened volatility versus all other months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/36d55ab4c2dbb07024442489e8676a54/82d3c849ec28ac26-3b/s500x750/eb549a4cdd8f61b9537c69d43c026619ab7314a9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Some October Weakness Common in Pre-Election Years\n\n> It certainly did not take long for the market to trigger Octoberphobia this year. Tuesday\u2019s soft manufacturing report was at least part of the trigger. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have already declined over 2.6% and its just the second trading day of the month. Tomorrow\u2019s Non-Manufacturing ISM report and Friday\u2019s jobs report could sooth some of the current recession fears and warrant close attention. However, market weakness in October, even in pre-election years is common. Our recent post showed October ranking second worst of all month in pre-election years.\n\n> October\u2019s tepid history in pre-election years can also be seen in the following seasonal pattern charts. The only real notably difference between this year and past pre-election years is weakness has arrived earlier. Looking at the black line in each chart, the average pre-election year October pullback has been around 3% for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. A larger pullback this year would not be out of the question considering trade, growth and political uncertainty. If economic data proves resilient, then the usual end of year rally enjoyed in past pre-election years will likely materialize.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d90968941a305c98fdb4ad542352570d/a135fdba4760b72b-14/s500x750/64f59ca2fcce589ada720cfad33ce5c9f2a14af4.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/47d2f92aabe0de292bd2fe5798af5654/a135fdba4760b72b-10/s500x750/386c045a2dbdd85371215487b53ab89e16f9de27.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a292f0046c9c90fd9f14d2812b8c12c4/a135fdba4760b72b-18/s500x750/2876568265e76ef61b9a5f5b5eb063de792a5572.jpg))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 4th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs6Nc84HgyU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.6.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$DAL** \n> * **$AZZ** \n> * **$LEVI** \n> * **$HELE** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$SAR** \n> * **$EXFO**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TuJZAMj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0LpFbkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/mR8JhFV.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.7.19 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 10.7.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.8.19 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/ENkyJMH.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.8.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/ktPmkSF.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.9.19 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gjEHuaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.10.19 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/X53SbX5.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hUsedGN.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.11.19 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Domino's Pizza, Inc. $242.13\n> **Domino's Pizza, Inc.
