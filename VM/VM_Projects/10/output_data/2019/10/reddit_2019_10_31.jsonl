{"title": "TLT Swing Position", "selftext": "Even though the fed cut rates, the sentiment in the market has become increasingly bearish despite FB and AAPL earnings beats.

This is a max risk of $9 to cash out a max of $300. Today I took 145/145.5 debit spread calls for 11/15 with $15. This is also a $15 max risk to cash out another max gain of $300.

Your trade hopes it will go above 151 by Dec 20, about month and a half from now. That's around a 7% increase. \n\nLet's use the \"30 Year Treasury Bond\" futures (ZB) as a decent proxy. Despite it's name, it corresponds, by definition, to treasury bonds with maturities between 15 and 25 years. TLT is 20+ years, so that's a reasonable approximation.\n\nFrom the CME treasury analytics website (https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/treasury-analytics.html), we can see that ZB is trading at 161'15. If the price goes up by 7%, it would be trading at 172'25. With a 1000x multiplier, that's a dollar gain of about $11k, give or take.\n\nFrom the same website, we can see that the dollar value of a basis point is about $200, and the current yield is about 1.85%.\n\nNow, grossly approximating, those numbers mean that an $11k increase in dollar value (or a 7% increase in price) corresponds to about a 55 basis points decrease in yield on that part of the curve. \n\nSo you're basically betting that by Dec 20, the yield at around the 20yr maturity will be down to 1.3%.\n\nFrom the Treasury website (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2019) you can get a sense for what that means. It has never come even close to that, even during the zero fed funds rates for the recovery of 2008, and even with QE. \n\nSo... \n\n\n\n>Tell me what you think!\n\nWhile this is something within the realm of possibility, it's beyond absurdly unlikely.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed.
