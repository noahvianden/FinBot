{"title": "Boeing investors are pricing in a quick resolution and strong bounce back in earnings even though that is looking increasingly less likely", "selftext": "Its hard to see why Boeing is up 13% this year. The  737 Max was expected to account for 33% of Boeings revenues over the next 5 years but, with a worsening outlook, investors are attaching little weight to potential problems.\n\nOriginal expectations of getting planes back in the air have been pushed back by a second identified failure of a microprocessor that could push the nose of the plane toward the ground. Boeing expects to submit a fix in September but, even if that is sufficient, it will take months for approval and it may be that further adaptations are required.  Even once approved it will take months to clear the backlog and compensation will have to be paid.\n\nElsewhere Boeing faces the prospect of an expanded probe into claims of subpar work at a South Carolina factory that makes Boeing 787 Dreamliners and Boeing, with international sales accounting for over 50%, remains highly exposed to a potential trade war.\n\nAll in all its not been a good year.  Boeing\u2019s strong balance sheet mean it should weather the problem without any major issue but the valuation looks aggressive with a TTM PE of 21. The stock price has increased about 13% this year despite all the bad news.  Over 3 years the stock price is up 170% while revenues and earnings are up 5%-10%. \n\nInvestors are clearly expecting a quick resolution and strong bounce back in earnings even though that is looking less likely.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/29/business/boeing-737-max-outlook/index.html", "id": "c7a086", "created_utc": 1561875846.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "I'm not touching Boeing with a ten foot pole.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "People that live directly below a dam have the most confidence that the dam won't break.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I live directly below a dam and everyone I know keeps an expendable little Dutch boy on retainer.
