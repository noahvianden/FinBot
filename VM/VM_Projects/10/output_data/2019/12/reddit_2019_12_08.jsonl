How are you graded at the end of the term? Guessing total gain? Also, are you only able to buy and sell?

If you can buy some options, especially call options, consider which stocks might do well over the next few months, especially with Christmas in mind; keep an eye out for companies with earnings reports in Jan and Feb.  \n\n\nOn easy trading strategy I've done over the last year is trade SPY options based on Trump tweets and trade deal news.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "SPY calls are literally unstoppable", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "SPY calls are basically cheating.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7414721846580505}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09442225843667984}], "tickers": ["msft", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Wish my school did this at the time.\n\nHonestly, I would put a majority of the portfolio into ETFs, Indexes, Blue Chips, Assets you actually like, etc. Then play with maybe 5-15% depending on how risky you wanna get. It sounds kinda boring but your positions in 'safe' assets will minimize blowing up your account (which at least a few of your peers will do). Then the allocated 5-15% can be used for trading.\n\nThis will hopefully teach you how to manage your portfolio to some degree. Secondly it'll give you some \"play\" money so it's not all boring sitting on assets to appreciate over 20+ years since you only have months. You'll also get to see your assets appreciate or depreciate and learn some emotional control and analysis assuming you follow up and keep up to date on your assets. My advise is to let those safe assets sit. No touch unless you feel the position you are in is undeserved of your attention.\n\nSome directional bets (pure speculation):\nFED has an upcoming announcement I believe Wednesday? (Don't quote me on that, I'm on mobile don't care to double check). Elon Musk just finished his 'pedo' comment case. Maybe make an earnings play in the next few weeks for many companies that have yet to fulfill a report. Most people will tell you that these factors are already 'priced in'. They are correct but you can still make a pretty penny on the right call since this is paper trading.\n\nIf you need more information on what exact asset to play in accordance to the mentioned, just follow up on some online resources. Finance news outlets and the like. Make your best judgement call. Do they have good cash flow? Are they allocating their resources correctly? Is management good? Are products/services being pushed? Is debt handled correctly? If you need an easier starting point than that then just think in generalized terms. For example, Disney just launched their Disney Plus service, they have 2 new movies in the past month with two more on the way. Remakes left and right, the new TV show. They seem like a decent bet right? Doesn't have to get all technical all the time.\n\nThe honest truth is have some fun, jump in, and experiment. You won't understand anything unless you involve yourself. Getting on the ground floor is a completely different experience than learning *about* it, gotta jump in to appreciate the full exposure. \n\nThis might seem unnecessary but Ill say it anyways. Taking trade advice from ANYONE other than a licensed and professional financial advisor is ill advised in real money but since this is a paper trading experience I figure I'd point you in a direction. None of this should be transferred over to real money trading. I am not a licensed professional. This was merely an excercise.
