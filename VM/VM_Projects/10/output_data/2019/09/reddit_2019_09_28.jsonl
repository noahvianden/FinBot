The next trading week will be the trading week of October.  The S&P500 has closed the week at 2966 after opening 2998. This might not sound like a big fall, but the bulls have lost a critical fight in the markets this week. In the coming two weeks, it seem likely the bulls will start to quit. Pullbacks will continue to make lower highs, and then bears will continue to drive the market to new lows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I have explained here is an uptrend failure, and the transition into a downtrend.  The downtrend has a dominoes like effect.  One trend continuation levels fails and price falls. The next bigger level fails, price falls more. Another price level fails, and there is a bigger still drop.  It is this cascade of events that builds up to be these \"S&P500 dropped 20% today\" news headlines we see in crashes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI showed the first major trend failure in part 2, when I showed how I opened trades to position from the drop with China walking out of a meeting.\n\n[https://imgur.com/JkywbF0](https://imgur.com/JkywbF0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Review of Previous Forecasts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week in part 2 I said after we'd seen the first trend failure level we should look for certain warning signs in price. The candles that would form if there were to be failures of other trend levels were drawn onto the S&P500 chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I said these would be the warning signs in the order they would appear.\n\n[https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U](https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the same chart in the previous picture, and here is the first warning candle I've drawn presenting itself.\n\nI've also added in the price formation of what the big warning signal will be.  A drop of around 10%,  close to 2650 low. This will probably happen in a very small period of time, hours or even minutes. Highly likely there will be a news related catalysis.\n\n[https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U](https://imgur.com/Nfmgo4U)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week in part two I said we should look for these warning candles along with an escalation in new news events.
