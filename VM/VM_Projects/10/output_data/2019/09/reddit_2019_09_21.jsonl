{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 23rd, 2019", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 23rd, 2019.\n\n# **Week ahead: As stocks struggle to break to new highs, markets could be swayed by Fed speakers, trade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/as-stocks-reach-for-new-highs-markets-could-be-swayed-by-fed-speakers.html)**\n*****\n> Developments in U.S.-Chinese trade talks and the comments from a host of Fed speakers could be important for markets in the week ahead, as stocks struggle to regain highs.\n*****\n> The Fed in the past week cut interest rates for the second time in two months, but the latest forecasts of Fed officials showed just how divided they are on the need for future rate cuts. Five wanted deeper cuts, five didn\u2019t want any cuts and another seven were happy with the Fed\u2019s action.\n*****\n> \u201cThe market seems like it\u2019s pretty jumpy based on what the say. i think it would flip back and forth depending on how the headlines come out,\u201d said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies. Simons said the focus will also be on the Fed\u2019s operations in the short-term funding market, after turbulence in the overnight market in the past week temporarily sent some overnight rates sharply higher.\n*****\n> There are nearly a dozen Fed speakers on the calendar in the coming week, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is not scheduled to speak.\n*****\n> Trade developments could continue to cause volatility in markets. Reports Friday that Chinese agriculture officials canceled visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska sent stocks lower, for fear it signaled that talks were not making progress.\n*****\n> Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&P off about 0.5% to 2,992. The index had been around 1% away from its all-time high for a few weeks.\n*****\n> \u201cTech that has been out of play and is acting faulty. it\u2019s now turning into a headwind, and that could cause a problem for the bulls,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen so many mixed signals in the market in quite some time.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s hard for the market to make new highs without tech. At best, it\u2019s concerning when you see key names, like Amazon and Netflix, not just failing to lead but faltering,\u201d he said. Netflix was down more than 8% for the week, and Amazon was off 2.6%.\n*****\n> Redler said it was a concern that shares of market leader Microsoft gave up its initial gains and turned negative, soon after it announced a buyback and raised its dividend. \u201cStrength was sold instead of embraced,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was good news. What are they going to do when bad news happens?\u201d\n*****\n> Following the attacks on Saudi Aramco last week, the United Nations General Assembly in New York and meetings around it take on more importance for markets. U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials have said Iran was behind the attack, which knocked a significant amount of Saudi oil production off line. Iran has denied involvement, and Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility.\n*****\n> Iran\u2019 President Hassan Rouhani has been given a visa to travel to New York for the UN. Before the attack on Saudi Arabia last week, President Donald Trump had suggested he would speak to Rouhani but there seems little chance of that now. Oil have been highly volatile, with Brent crude futures up 7% since the attack as Saudi Arabia sought to assure markets that it would be able to bring its operations back on line.\n*****\n> There is some economic data that will also be important to markets. There is manufacturing PMI Monday, important after ISM manufacturing data showed a contraction in August. Durable goods will also be important on Friday, as will personal consumption data, which includes the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation indicator, the core PCE deflator.\n*****\n> \u201cWhat Powell said in his remarks was inflation was below his target,\u201d said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. \u201cBut even the core PCE deflator is expected to be 1.8, a new high for the year.\u201d The Fed\u2019s target inflation rate is 2%, and other inflation measures have been above that, including core CPI.\n*****\n> The Fed will also be in focus after problems in the overnight funding market, used by banks in need of short term cash. Rates spiked for repo, or repurchase agreements, in a chaotic two-day period Monday and Tuesday. The Fed\u2019s target fed funds rate also moved above its target range, in an unusual move.\n*****\n> The market has since calmed after the Fed carried out open market operations to add liquidity to the market. On Friday, it announced three 14-day operations involving $30 billion as well as continued overnight operations of at least $75 billion each.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the Fed has absolute control over short term rates. It was caught sleeping at the wheel,\u201d said Chandler.\n*****\n> Powell said the Fed would monitor the market and take whatever action is needed. The market is considered the basic plumbing for financial markets, where banks who have a short-term need for cash come to fund themselves. The odd spike in rates was viewed as the result of a cash crunch, not a credit crisis.\n*****\n> Bond market pros have been concerned that the Fed would again see strains in the market at month end, when there\u2019s more activity in the overnight funding market.\n*****\n> \u201cIt gets you further past quarter end,\u201d said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO. \u201cA 14-day pushes them further into October. I think nerves will have calmed. The fact you\u2019ll see fed funds print clearly in the range will reassert confidence. These operations will serve as a reminder that the Fed can have absolute control the front end if and when it wants to. This is a good thing.\u201d\n*****\n> The funds rate was at 1.90% Thursday, within the target rate range of 1.75% to 2%.\n*****\n> \u201cThey\u2019re removing any doubt of their ability to take control of fed funds in the modern framework. They just announced $165 billion over quarter-end , and we may go bigger. They haven\u2019t done a repo injection in 10 years,\u201d said Hill.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MUY41wt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/k9ylFAj.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/4MliIIb.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/p1SKaqG.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bNuO4rD.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XWSTZFM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QKBfLJ1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hfgzjRc.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nkX6a4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RA20ULu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9yTEKX2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/mJj1obE.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/4jYIEGb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 down 23 of 29 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%\n\n> The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines especially since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 29 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just three times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.\n\n> Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA \u20131.02%, S&P 500 \u20130.95%, NASDAQ \u20130.90% and a sizable \u20131.38% for Russell 2000.

During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf589120968a5d6057ac1efe410ef3a/cc2da8936980c71c-4d/s400x600/f2a824e6445a02718474d46969d66c27a0fbfc79.jpg))**\n\n> Pre-election year Octobers are ranked second from last for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ while Russell 2000 is dead last with an average loss of 1.9%. Eliminating gruesome 1987 from the calculation provides only a moderate amount of relief. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n# Where\u2019s That September Volatility?\n\n> September is historically known as one of the worst for stocks, yet in 2019 the S&P 500 Index is up 2.7% so far amid a sea of scary headlines. Incredibly, the S&P 500 has wavered less than 0.1% from its previous close 6 of the past 10 trading sessions, as it consolidates just beneath all-time highs.\n\n> \u201cOver the past two weeks we\u2019ve had the European Central Bank meeting, the Federal Reserve meeting, higher inflation, a historic jump in crude oil, Middle East turmoil, trouble in the repo market, and even multiple NFL quarterbacks sustaining major injuries,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet, with all of those scary headlines, stocks are actually in the midst of one of the least volatile two-week stretches we\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d\n\n> We are quite encouraged by the overall change in market tone we\u2019ve heard recently, with more cyclical names taking the baton and leading, but with the S&P 500 up near our fair value target of 3,000, we would be on the lookout for this sea of tranquility to get rougher at any time. In fact, according to historical calendars, we may need to be on high guard for the second half of September.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, The Second Half of September Can Be Tricky For Stocks, later in the month of September is when we\u2019ve seen seasonal weakness. Things have been going well for equities in the face of some worrisome headlines, but don\u2019t get complacent, as the calendar could be one of the biggest near-term risks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Second-Half-Of-September-Can-Be-TRicky-For-Stocks.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fed Hits It Down The Middle\n\n> \u201cHistory does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n> As expected, the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy committee cut its policy rate by 25 basis points (.25%) to a target range of 1.75%\u20132%. This comes on the heels of the first rate cut in more than 10 years at the end of July. This cut is somewhat more controversial, however, because the overall U.S. economic data has been improving, and there\u2019s been a tick higher in inflation.\n\n> One of the most important questions heading into this meeting was how many voting Fed members would support additional rate cuts. There were two dissenting voting members at the July rate cut, and once again there were two votes opposed to today\u2019s cut\u2014but unlike last time, there was also one dissenter who favored a larger 50 basis point (.50%) cut. Materials in the economic projections indicated 10 of 17 participants (which includes non-voting members) did not believe additional cuts would be needed over the remainder of the year, although evolving economic conditions could certainly lead to a shift.\n\n> As the quote from Mark Twain suggests, by looking back at history we can potentially find clues as to what might happen in the future.\n\n> Looking back at the previous two recessions (2001 and 2008), the Fed cut rates 50 basis points (.50%) to kick off the new cycle of rate cuts. We looked back at what the Fed said at the time, and policymakers didn\u2019t foresee a recession; the larger .50% cut might have been their way of showing how worried they really were at the time. In other words, maybe the Fed knew there potentially was trouble under the surface.\n\n> Compare this with three consecutive 25 basis point (.25%) cuts in the 1995/1996 and 1998 rate cut cycles, which led to continued equity gains and avoided recessions. Given we foresee one more cut this year, could it be another three cuts of 25 basis points (.25%) and then an economic acceleration?\n\n> \u201cHere\u2019s the catch. When the first two cuts in a new cycle of rate cuts are only 25 basis points, this could be the Fed\u2019s way of truly viewing the cuts as insurance,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, the past five cycles of cuts that started with two 25 basis point cuts saw the S&P 500 Index move higher 6 and 12 months later every single time.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Stocks Have Historically Done Well If The First Two Fed Rate Cuts Are 25 Basis Points, the S&P 500 was up an average of 9.7% six months after the second of two 25 basis point cuts to kick off a new cycle of rate cuts. Going out a year, the S&P 500 had gained a very impressive average of 16.7%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fed-Rate-Cuts_1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Strong Start for September, but Second Half Could Bring Trouble\n\n> As of Friday\u2019s close the market is well above historical average performance in September. DJIA was up nearly 3.1%, S&P 500 was up 2.8%, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 were up 2.7% while Russell 2000 was up 5.6%. Small-caps outperforming large-caps recently is not unusual and they did so again today. However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 29 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/97337e721a4a4404b14ce6e0751f4a48/29cca1e6f4e066f1-60/s500x750/fb019b5ce842de90676dba26a9413fcb30ec1566.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Broader Transports Still Outperforming YTD\n\n> With shares of FedEx (FDX) on pace for their second worst earnings reaction day since at least 2001, the Dow Transports, an index in which FDX has a weighting of over 8% (after today's decline), is down close to 2%. Historically, the Transports have been considered a leading indicator of the economy, so the weakness in FDX, and by extension, the Dow Transports, is resulting in heightened concerns over the state of the economy. Looking at the chart below, the picture for the Transports doesn't look pretty. The timing of today's decline couldn't have been worse as it came just as the Transports were attempting to break above the highs from July, but now it just looks like the second lower high this year. Following today's declines, the Dow Transports are up 14.7% YTD which is about five percentage points behind the performance of the S&P 500.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091819-DJ-Transports1.png))**\n\n> Given the changes in the US economy over time, we've been skeptical of the continued predictive ability of the Transports, but even putting that aside for a moment, a broader look at Transports shows a less pessimistic picture. The chart below shows the performance of the stocks in the S&P 1500 index on an equal-weighted basis so far in 2019. By this measure, today's decline comes after the index made a higher high, and while it's back below those former highs today, with a gain of 20.5% YTD, this broader look at transports is still outperforming the S&P 500 on a YTD basis. It may not be a great picture for this group of transport stocks, but it doesn't really look bad either.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091819-SP-1500-Equalweight1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending September 20th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw8aeuRijjc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 09.22.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zutxm2sd42M))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$MU** \n> * **$NIO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$KMX** \n> * **$NKE** \n> * **$BB** \n> * **$RAD** \n> * **$CMD** \n> * **$ACN** \n> * **$UXIN** \n> * **$JBL** \n> * **$INFO** \n> * **$CAG** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$MANU** \n> * **$SNX** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$KBH** \n> * **$UEPS** \n> * **$ATU** \n> * **$CTAS** \n> * **$MTN** \n> * **$AGTC** \n> * **$WOR** \n> * **$PIR** \n> * **$ISR** \n> * **$DLNG** \n> * **$CAMP** \n> * **$AIR** \n> * **$FUL** \n> * **$PRGS** \n> * **$CMTL** \n> * **$DYNT** \n> * **$RBZ**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nkX6a4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mUbUzug.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/mH9RWZ5.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.23.19 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7aKH8Og.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 9.23.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.24.19 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/mD9okQj.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.24.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/NzkGtV6.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.25.19 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZGbh5n8.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.25.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/mRnSNwM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.26.19 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/pBwzoA4.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.26.19 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/iR42Elv.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.27.19 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.27.19 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $49.16\n> **Micron Technology, Inc.
