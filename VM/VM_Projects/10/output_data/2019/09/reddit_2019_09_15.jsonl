The market has mostly been in full on bull mode, so long/short strategies can\u2019t keep up. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all dead. \n\nAbsolute return strategies still have a place in big portfolios, as a substitute for the miserly returns offered by short term bonds and such. And yes, those managers charge an arm and a leg, too, but at the end of the day, if you can get 2% from banking and treasuries, or you can step just a little further on the risk spectrum and get 3-5% after fees, what\u2019s it matter what the manager charged?\n\nWealthy individuals, pensions, endowments and foundations aren\u2019t necessarily eager to take on the risk of an all stock strategy. \n\nThat might seem strange to you, but the super wealthy don\u2019t need to take the risks we do. They want steady growth, and don\u2019t want big losses. As long as that happens, they\u2019re all set for the rest of their lives, as are their kids \n\nLikewise for the other; they\u2019re perpetual institutions  some make long term spending sommitments and can\u2019t risk giving disproportionate amounts of assets in downturns. \n\nWe laugh at some of the returns we read about them getting, but we\u2019re playing a different game, desperately trying to accumulate enough assets to retire comfortably.
