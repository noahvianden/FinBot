But that's how I understood it.  I've been trading options for years and it seems there's always something new to learn.\n\nHere's another good one: Don't remember the stock but it was within the past 2 years.  Someone was naked short a stock, it was a rather low priced stock and I don't remember the company.  Overnight the stock sky-rocketed, I mean like from 2 to 50.  He couldn't cover it.  They wiped his account and nearly everything they could get their hands on, including his 401k.  The point: Selling anything naked implies unlimited risk. (I know that's not exactly true for selling puts, since a stock can't go below 0).  If you can't cover a disaster, don't trade it.\n\nAnother: Years ago, probably 2008 a trader was trading calendar spreads in the VIX.  Calendars are forgiving right? Wrong. Not in the VIX, it doesn't work that way.  The front month volatility can shoot up (you're short the front month) while the later month does next to nothing. In a calendar on a stock, the later month options would go up as well.  This trader lost everything because he couldn't cover his losses on the front month short.  The losses were extreme.  Tom Sosnoff did a blurb on this a few years ago.  I think it was when he was still at TOS. \n\nMoral: I'd like to say 'if you don't know what you're doing, don't do it', but like I say, I'm always learning.  It's sometimes difficult to know what you don't know.  But it can hurt.  I find out about things I hadn't been aware of before.  Be careful out there and know the risks.  Don't assume anything. Learn a product or a strategy and get good at it, then expand.  I would never encourage someone new to options to start by selling puts.\n\nOne last thing.  Synthetically, selling puts is exactly the same as writing a covered call.  So if you're inclined to sell puts, just buy 100 shares and sell a call against it.  Or sell 1 call per 100 shares of stock you buy.  If you can't afford to buy that much stock you probably shouldn't be selling that many puts either.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m only going to sell naked puts at strikes that I can cover if I am assigned the stock.
