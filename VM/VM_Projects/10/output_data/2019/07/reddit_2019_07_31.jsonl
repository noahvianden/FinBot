How about the early 90s when the technology that we're currently using that allowed people to connect globally was introduced? No parallels? Over 80% of IPOs in 2018 were unprofitable companies, the most in history. While it's not exactly a fair comparison because today's companies are much different and more mature than their 1999 counterparts, it's still a jarring amount. So why is it that so many are doing it now rather than waiting to become profitable? It's not because they need the investment money to continue operating. It's because they, the venture capital groups and the investment banks that back them, believe that this is the peak of the market and they will make the most money doing it now rather than waiting for stronger fundamentals and IPOing at a later date. If investors throwing money at unprofitable companies isn't a sign of a bubble idk what is.\n\nOf course at the end of the day I'm just another small time retail investor and I could be way off but only time will tell.
