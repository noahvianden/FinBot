{"title": "Picking the right options contract for short term (scalp) naked buys", "selftext": "As we know, options, unlike futures, can vary widely on their value given the greeks. Futures have a Delta of 1 and move directly in line with the price movement of the stock. Options, on the other hand, usually have a Delta of .30 just out of the money, .5 at the money, and .7 just above in the money (give or take given the strike price intervals). Then you have to take into account the other deltas (importantly Gamma for this short term scenario).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven the following hypotheticals:\n\n1. AAPL options contract at 1.30 just out of the money with a Delta of .30 and a Gamma of .06.\n2. AAPL options contract at 2.75 at the money with a Delta of .50 and a Gamma of .08.\n3. AAPL options contract at 4.30 just above in the money with a Delta of .70 and a Gamma of .06.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is - taking into account commissions of roughly .75 per contract flat ($1.50 round trip) would it be more profitable to buy 10 OTM contracts, 5 ATM contracts, or 3 ITM contracts on a scalp (lets say at the open) with a relatively big move?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been trading 10 contracts of 1. (OTM) with good success but commissions are a killer. If I could get the same or better results with 3. (ITM), it would greatly reduce my commissions. Also, another concerns would be filling limit orders with the faster price movements of a 3 than a 1 with the basically double delta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: My results on the market data available right now on TOS is as follows - It seems to say that buying more cheaper contracts is the way to go for a short term scalp. However, this is based on a big move of a hypothetical $1 dollar and investing roughly the same amount. It also is not taking into account Gamma which may make some difference. Also, given an unlimited supply of money, you have to take into account (A.) being able to get rid of a larger number of contracts and (B.) investing higher amounts if the move is a highly probable one to get the most out of the move even though (10contracts of a ITM with higher delta will give you back more but will be more expensive - if filling orders for more contracts is a concern). Most importantly, the below does not take into account losing trades - A 10 contract move is a guaranteed $15 commission if flat or lose vs a $4.50 commission at 3 contracts (at .75c flat each side). With a low win rate, this is particularly important. Overall, the below seems to indicate to buy as many contracts as affordable on a highly probable move.

I choose put or calls purely based on the direction I want to scalp - I need a direction assumption. \n\nThe problem is Theta. If I think I'm not going to br able to make more than what Theta is going to eat away, I might do something to reduce my gamma rent (ie, the ratio of Theta/Gamma), like selling some other options, looking for contracts with higher IV than what I'm going to trade, and then delta-hedging those with underlying. \n\nIf the trade goes in my favor, and it seems like I might have caught a nice intraday trend, I might keep rolling my ATM option to keep it ATM or maybe slightly OTM if I truly believe in the trend and I'm willing to increase my risk. \n\nWhen I roll the contract, I usually use part of the profits I had so far to increase the position size, effectively increasing even further my gamma, to increase even further the acceleration. Note that this will increase your Theta exposure, too, so that might need to be taken care of by selling more of the high IV contract and delta-hedging it. \n\nIt's quite some work if you don't automate at least part of it.

I used this strategy on very short plays. \n\nI also play the trend on MAs using them as basically a stop loss but prefer futures for this as the high Delta pays you back for a slow but steady move. I have found that, with options, I may have a great slow and steady move but due to theta and gamma, if it suddenly breaks out of the trend the opposite way, a 30 minute move may almost break even or just a few bucks due to the gamma against me. \n\nI would be curious to trade options on futures.

I am trying to move as much as possible to futures due to their taxes and lower overall commissions.\n\nRight? Taxes are one of the main factors that drove me to futures in the first place. The liquidity is impressive. And also the ability to create some trades on the term structure of the contracts is pretty cool, too.\n\nIn terms of commissions, I pay $3.70/RT on /ES all inclusive (I use their tiered pricing structure, and this is the 2nd tier, i.e., between 1k and 10k contracts / month) which I consider relatively OK. For options on /ES, it becomes a little bit less, since CME charges a little bit less.\n\nI could reduce commissions with another broker (see list below), but I need many of other IB's features and markets for a variety of reasons. Overall, I think what I'm paying is \"fair\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What options on futures do you trade?\n\nThe main underlyings I trade options on these days are equity futures (/ES, /NQ), gold (/GC),and  crude oil (/CL). I have a few medium-term positions, but I usually stay within the current quarter.\n\nSometimes I might open longer-term (i.e., many weeks to many months, maybe up to 6 months?) option positions on grains (/ZC, /ZS, /ZW) or meat (/HE) \u2014 for these, very often I apply the exact same strategy I described above, but instead of having to roll over and over again intraday, I usually only roll maybe once or twice a week. Since the options are longer dated, the underlying has to go much further away for the gamma I'm getting to require me to roll. Much less time consuming!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What platform do you use?\n\nI use Interactive Brokers as my main (and currently, only) broker.\n\nAs for platform, I use their **TWS** for these types of trades I describe above. I absolutely love their Risk Navigator to help me ensure I'm well hedged on the elements of risk I'm not trading, and their modeling is really good for my purposes.\n\nFor day trading outright futures I use **SierraChart** connected to TWS. I used their Trade DOM (which is basically a clone of Jigsaw Daytradr, my favorite DOM by far) and TPO charts. I actually just switched from Daytradr to SierraChart because of the TPO charts, because everything else I need is supported by Daytradr, and the guy behind it is amazing (as opposed to the team behind SierraChart, which is a bunch of assholes; smart, decent developers, but huge assholes).\n\nI've experimented with a lot of other setups over time, too, until I got to this point I consider almost ideal.\n\n* I've used **TD Ameritrade / TOS** a lot, but it's just crazy expensive, and the platform (and I might be shot one day for saying this here) is pretty bad, slow as hell (yes, slower than TWS when *both* are properly configured! I actually have screen recordings of their Analysis tab taking about \\~45 seconds to become responsive, on a 12-core 3.2GHz i7 computer with 64GB of RAM and a Radeon Vega64, running nothing other than TOS... so, no, it's no my computer's issue), their option pricing model sucks compared IB's (so their risk analysis tools get it all wrong). And they are *much* more expensive, have I said that? lol\n* I've used **TastyWorks**, which just sucks, in every aspect. No decent analysis, their data is terrible for day trading order flow (you don't even get a DOM!), and also terribly expensive (even though they advertise as cheap). Also, it's really frustrating when they keep saying, \"yeah, we're gonna release feature X next month\" every month and never actually release it...\n* I've used **Tradovate**, clearing through Dorman Trading (don't think it matters much, though; could've used Phillip Capital instead), which is pretty decent for day trading futures, but their Future Options offerings are not that good \u2014 they don't calculate margins properly for options. In terms of platforms connected to Tradovate, their Web platform is actually surprisingly decent. But I usually preferred to have a dedicated CQG connecting on **NinjaTrader**, and then later on **Jigsaw Daytradr** \u2014 which, in my opinion, is one of the absolute best DOMs out there. I actually wrote *a ton* of code for their web-based platform to help me with my trading. Pretty good stuff! Also, their commission structure is fantastic. You can pay a monthly subscription to get close to zero costs (you'll only pay clearing fees plus exchange fees).\n* I've also used **NinjaTrader Brokerage**, with the same setup as Tradovate (except for web-based platform, which is exclusive to Tradovate), with pretty much the same impressions. However, NinjaTrader Brokerage's technology (i.e., website, account management, etc) is ... non-existent, so I left rather quickly.

You'll see maybe 2 to 4 ticks bid-ask spread on options on the ES. Keep in mind, though, that we're talking about a product that has a 0.25 tick size and 5 times the notional size (one option contract on ES is 50x the SP500 index, while on SPY it is 100x the ETF which is about 1/10th of the SP500, so 50x the index vs 10x the index, in notional). That means the spread on SPY options at, say, 1 or 2 cents, correspond to 1/10th or 2/10th of one index point, while the spread on ES options at, say, 2 to 4 ticks, corresponds to 0.5 to one index point.
