In the US, it\u2019s marketed by Centene. But I know apremilast has other trade names.

I\u2019m trying to be more deliberate. \n\nGiven the trends that I see with respect to what Otezla treats, and given what I see and hear providers saying about it, I\u2019m inclined to think that it may or may not be Humira-lite in terms of its market. However, I don\u2019t know jack about Centene, apremilast\u2019s other trade names, competing biosimilars, any ongoing clinical trials to potentially expand its market, patents, etc. I know that these are all things that can be individually researched, obviously.
