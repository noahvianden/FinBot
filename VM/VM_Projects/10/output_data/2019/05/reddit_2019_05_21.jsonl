In the 2008 recession, GM declared chapter 11 bankruptcy, and sought to renegotiate its debts. There's a bunch of politics involved (Bush + Obama related), but I'm not going to talk about that.\n\nShareholders in GM were converted into [MTLQQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motors_Liquidation_Company), the \"Q\" on the end is a formality, standing for a company that is entering bankruptcy. (This is why the bears sometimes call themselves TSLAQ investors: they're betting on bankruptcy and are trying to make money should the company go bankrupt). You still own GM stock (MTLQQ), and as such, negotiations will start to take place to buy out the value of your shares.\n\nEarly in the negotiation process, MTLQQ was worth ~17 cents. Eventually, the shares became completely worthless. Some bulls inevitably tried to buy MTLQQ (there's a chance it would come back!!), and yes... there was a chance... but it didn't happen.\n\nBankruptcy is there to protect the #1 investors of the company: the **bondholders**. The owners of **debt** have #1 pick and #1 control in bankruptcy negotiations. After the bondholders come the preferred shares. Finally, the \"common shares\".\n\nA new company, called \"New GM\" bought out the factories and workers of \"MTLQQ\". The owner of \"New GM\" was 60% US Government (aka: President Obama. Politically, this caused a lot of controversy, so I don't expect this sort of buyout to ever happen again), 40% Canada + Auto Unions. Old GM died completely along with its debts (The popular Hummer and Saturn lines of vehicles remained a part of \"old GM\" and died with it). Bond-holders got some money back (the money that President Obama paid to buy out the factories), but there was basically nothing left for common shareholders of MTLQQ.\n\nAs you can see, GM survived in an unusual way... but survived nonetheless. Its technically a new company however, and as such the debts of \"old GM\" were cancelled and the old owners of MTLQQ lost everything. \n\n----------\n\nTesla is in a common situation: there are bondholders (the banks who funded the Gigafactory 1), these guys get #1 pick to any money in the bankruptcy proceedings. #2 pick is preferred shares (ex: the 2019 Convertible that was just issued as a ~$1 billion loan). Finally, the last pick are the common shareholders (aka: owners of TSLA).\n\nCommon shareholders are **always** last in bankruptcy filings. Sometimes, the common shareholders get some dollars as the shares liquidate, but more often than not, they get nothing. The last days of trading the \"Q\" ticker symbol will be based on that debate: how many cents each shareholder gets. I guess Chapter 7 bankruptcy has a higher chance of getting money back: because chapter 7 means the company is selling off all factories / equipment / etc. etc. to try to get as much value possible back to the shareholders.\n\nThere will almost certainly be a buyer of Tesla's assets: the Gigafactory is worth something after all. But the funds from selling the Gigafactory will first go to bondholders, then go to preferred (aka convertible) shareholders. Its very unlikely that TSLAQ holders would get anything. Common shareholders are always last in these situations.\n\n---------\n\nEDIT: there's a \"bull\" theory going around saying that Apple or Google will buy out Tesla. Well... maybe. But they'll want to buy Tesla **after** bankruptcy. Its always cheaper to buy a company after bankruptcy, especially after shedding billions of dollars in debt. There's no reason for Apple or Google to buy Tesla before a bankruptcy event, its simply going to be cheaper to do it during bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFurthermore, during a bankruptcy event, Apple or Google can buy the parts of Tesla it wants. Ex: Apple or Google can bid on just the FSD / Autopilot brand and engineers, without buying any other part of the company. They simply have more flexibility to pick-apart the company at that point in the game. I don't know why anyone would buy all of Tesla, instead of \"just the parts they want\".
