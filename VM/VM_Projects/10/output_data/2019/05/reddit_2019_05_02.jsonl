At the core it lowers the exchange rate, increases Corp Profits, increases Base Money,  increases inflation expectations, decreases real yields, increase equities,  and leads to a fall in interest rate yields (rally in price.) Negatives of lower for longer could exacerbate frothiness & eventually lead to a US Dollar Crises in 2020.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU7T5ErMIUA&t=39s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU7T5ErMIUA&t=39s)\n\nThere are a number of Options Strategies impacted positively by Lower for Longer. These strategies typically involve selling convexity into the market, which is just a fancy way of saying temporarily you will be able to pursue strategies that benefit from lower sustained realized volatility;\n\n\\*Disclaimer these strategies will not outperform for the entirety of 2019 as volatility will eventually reach a tipping point and rise substantially\n\nA - Short Payer Swaptions (Selling Premium & collecting Income)\n\nB - Long Receiver Swaptions (Buying Premium & Hedging Risk to Downside)\n\nC - Trades using Repo Financing (MBS, REITs, Long Duration Zero Coupon Treasuries, & COCO's, Tier 2 Hybrid, Subordinated Unsecured Debt, etc)\n\nD - POs (Principle only investors on long duration strips of MBS & Treasury)\n\nE - Utilizing Balance Sheet in combo with falling Repo Yields to Finance Purchase of Long Treasuries (Leveraged)\n\nF - Financing Via Repo & Loading up Periphery Euro Debt (Italian Bonds) - Very Risky\n\nG -  Vertical Call Spreads (using commodities Gold, Silver, & Oil)\n\nH  - Grab positive carry between Cost of Puts & Income Brought from Selling Protection on CDS\n\nI - Long Volatility via Options Butterflies on Index in 2nd Half of 2019\n\nLow Volatility also allows investors to get away with selling convexity, long duration, & upping short gamma. There is a tipping point where these strategies will no longer work as effectively as they have in the first 3 months of 2019 - When will that happen? Not sure, but I'd start to reduce short convexity exposure near July/August 2019\n\nJust sharing information, so all comments are welcomed :)", "id": "bjweo1", "created_utc": 1556811639.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Lmao.\n\nRetail traders doing repos, CDS, MBS, or swaptions.\n\nCould you imagine the chaos?

Yea, in all seriousness it's not a matter of retail being able to trade these strategies. It is more a matter of how the retail exposure in passive investing influences the overall market. Late cycle spike in volatility will lead to a mad dash rush to the nearest exits. \"You don't sell what you should, you sell what you can\" If you factor in decelerating growth in the domestic and global economy, it is going to put pressure on cash flows and BB, BBB, over-leveraged credits meeting payments. Worst case below trend growth turns into a huge credit migration in BBB's due to credit agency downgrades.

Like almost all of it.\n\nRating agencies are always the last to move (they'd rather be late than wrong), so those spreads will blow out way before they get downgraded. Of course, once they do, then it becomes an institutional governance issue, which exacerbates the problem.\n\nI actually work in Risk at an insurance company. So imagining what happens is kinda my job. A large part of our plan is to hold sufficient capital and reserves to meet short-term solvency and liquidity requirements (Solvency II, RBC, etc.), then bag-hold the rest of the float. Namely because of: \n\n1. The haircut we would have to take would be ridiculous.\n2. Not enough global buyers -- insurance companies are the apex predator in debt markets, if they sell, the only buyers who could provide that liquidity are central banks.\n3. Selling instead of holding through the cycle is actually detrimental to your margins, which especially matters when you make a living pinching bps here and there.\n\nGranted, Dodd-Frank did improve a lot of the collateral posting requirements and procedures so CDS buying presents a legitimate hedging strategy now. But they're expensive as f\\*ck, and once you need those babies, they're already priced to gouge.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great response well detailed and spot on with the analysis. I was smiling the entire time i read it. Global liquidity is tightening and will continue for the remainder of the year. We may see a slight offset by the PBOC in combination with the Federal Reserve pursuing LSAP \"lite\" in October lol. Not sure if I am completely sold on excess liquidity generating higher inflation. We've been hearing this argument since the original start of QE in 2008, but aging demographics, technological advances, stable wage growth, and relatively low potential growth rates have all acted to cap inflation. I would agree with the argument tighter labor markets, wage growth, tariffs, (Saudi/OPEC/Russian Production cuts) higher crude oil prices, & an adjustment in the US Dollar could potential \"engender\" higher inflation in the 2nd half of the year. Although, I think the real turning point is tied to US Households and Corporations continuing to absorb a disproportionate share of global imbalances. At the end of any decade long economic expansion the deficit center country's inability to smoothly adjust is the cause of the recession. This is a global phenomenon, which is really in some sense partly in the control of the US and partly in the control of Global Trading Partners. I do not think this time will be any different. \n\nYou are spot on in terms of the research you did. Some of the companies you mentioned are in the process of deleveraging. I think the larger issue revolves around the size of the debt outstanding with BBB ratings and the possible credit migration. I know i'm preaching to the choir, but if GDP continues to fall near trend, earnings growth decelerates, corporate leverage will rise, which could have a destabilizing effect on debt services and interest payments. I agree with you on the ratings agencies as well, but it is still a considerable risk given the size of the BBB market. \n\nYea, well given the low liquidity in the bond market I agree the fire sales would be ridiculous, but no other financial institutions would be willing to warehouse those assets and hold on their balance sheet because of some of the regulatory issues and higher capital cost they would have to assume.\n\nI actually slightly disagree with the idea there is limited demand for these assets globally. If anything i'd make the opposite argument. There is plenty of demand for these assets. I think 2020's to 2025 will be a period of Global Bond Convergence in yields. I also feel strongly we will see tighter spreads between Advanced Economies and Emerging Economies. This is demand driven, but also incorporates China's Financial Account Liberalization. This will include large Chinese insurers, banks, and financial intermediaries diversifying their holding suppressing yields globally. There is a real search for anyone attempting to match longer duration liabilities with longer duration assets. You are right insurance companies are a large force in the debt markets, but for institutions in high need of duration we are in a period of excess demand and we still do not have enough fixed income assets to meet the potential liabilities of an aging global society. \n\nI also agree you would want to hold all of the assets on your balance sheet until maturity. \n\nCredit Default Swaps paired with Zero Coupon Bonds is a great way to effectively create synthetic bonds, so you're able to extend duration at a reasonable cost. \n\nI would be curious as to how you guys are managing your Mortgage Backed Holdings? A lot of negative convexity. Lower for longer is creating an interesting issue for liability driven investments. Any additional moves down in rates reduces duration, which sort of forces insurance companies to buy longer dated assets further out along the curve. The yield searching is likely going to put more downward pressure on longer term yields in the very near future. Now think about the overall impact this will have on Pensions meeting their mandates going forward. \n\nAre you guys going out and investing in a ton of zero coupon long dated government bonds, principal only strips, going down the corporate stack into subordinated debt, Senior Unsecured, Tier 2 Bonds, Hybrid Tier 1 Contingent Convertibles (CoCo). I'm clearly bullish on adding convexity if we are expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates in September. At this point this late in the cycle most investors would shy away from anything with embedded options, but it is very likely volatility continues to fall, which is an open invitation to sell convexity, by going into the market and purchasing callable bonds and taking the short call risk if you don't expect it to be in the money. There are a lot of ways to really max out on adding convexity and getting a really great return on fixed income assets. \n\nFinal question how was the huge rally in the derivatives portfolio? I'm sure you guys are mostly Rec Fixed on Interest Rate Swaps and did you  make any money on selling payer swaptions or on your receiver swaptions positions? - What is outlook on bond market volatility?

Actuarially it's just over $1m on average.  Someone dies in a car crash, insurance for the liable party usually picks up the tab (this coverage is required in most states).

The mere fact that a product causes deaths isn't usually prosecutable - the act of lying about facts or risks in order to obtain approvals for a product is prosecutable generally as a fraud, not under any sort of manslaughter theory.   See e.g. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-20/boeing-criminal-probe-rare-in-u-s-for-a-planemaker-after-crash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-20/boeing-criminal-probe-rare-in-u-s-for-a-planemaker-after-crash).  Historically speaking, things today cause a shockingly low amount of deaths, but there is actually extremely voluminous case law on people trying to hold companies responsible for deaths.  If autopilot statistically results in half the deaths per mile as human drivers (assume that is the case) how is that negligent?  Negligence is failing to live up to a duty.  If you've created something that results in less deaths how is that abandoning a duty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo use an analogy, if a seat belt failed, the car maker wouldn't necessarily be liable, certainly not criminally for that mere fact of failure resulting in death.  If the car maker knew the seat belts were made with inferior material to save costs, and lied about it in order to get regulatory approval, then there is probably a case.  But just because someone dies it doesn't mean there is civil liability, and certainly doesn't mean there is criminal liability which is the highest standard.  \n\n  \nHumans are very bad at judging risk and this is one of the biggest psychological problems FSD cars (Tesla and others) will face in adoption.
