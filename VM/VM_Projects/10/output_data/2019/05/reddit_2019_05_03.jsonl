I can only speak on this industry but they usually say construction experiences the good and the bad of the economy before anyone else. Not exactly groundbreaking news here but I think it's fair to say we're probably at a peak right now but the end of this strong economy could be months or years away.

However, I think expecting serious growth and seeing like GDP hitting 4%, unemployment remaining this low, and market gains of 15% or more is pretty unrealistic right now.\n\nThe average American does and lives pretty well right despite what people want to believe. The biggest concerns are healthcare/insurance, education costs (daycare, college), lack of affordable housing, and poor money management. It's tough to save and invest with high insurance premiums, expensive childcare costs, student loans, and expensive housing. However, most Americans certainly don't help their causes either with poor spending habits, expensive tastes, and other bad decisions. I oversee people working the trades and pay varies all over. Let me tell you, it doesn't matter if the person is making $15 an hour or $75 an hour, chances are they are probably living paycheck to paycheck. Americans really need to be educated better on financials and savings. That said, we absolutely need to fix up our insurance, education, and housing problems.\n\nI've stated before on here that I thought March 2019 would be the start of our economy's downfall and entrance into bear territory.
