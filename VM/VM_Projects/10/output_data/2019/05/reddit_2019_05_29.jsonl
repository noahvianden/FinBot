Going to provide links to address my hypothesis.\n\n**Tesla Tubers:**\n\nTesla has an insane youtube community, with many different channels that have millions of subscribers who are super active and sold a lot of cars for Tesla, basically a propaganda arm for the company. On early January, Musk on Twitter received a lot of complaints from people about the Youtubers Bragging and abusing the referral program to win roadsters. Musk takes notice and abruptly cancels the referral program.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y95eESEpUx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y95eESEpUx4) Bragging about his roadster winnings\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFknwbuncng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFknwbuncng) Complaining why it was canceled\n\n**Tuber Backlash:**\n\nThese YouTubers were upset, many of them made videos criticizing the decision to cancel the referral programs, as they've lost the potential to win more cars, power walls, reveal event invites in the future. So this happens\n\n**Rich Rebuilds Rants:**\n\nRich Rebuilds, is known to make 10-15 minute videos to salvaged Teslas and occasionally does entertaining rants about the company and its followers. He makes a series of video rants about his Model X delivery experience, video goes viral and YouTubers take this as an opportunity to make more videos to Bash the Company. Not taking into account's Tesla wasn't even given time to build the infostructure to service those cars, or the fact that if there were service issues, the company itself would be the first to know about them. Never the less, in the span of few weeks, the people who once praised the company, sold cars for the company are now actively making videos attacking it and doing unrepairable damage to its Brand and most importantly Demand.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgMTx\\_xFezM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgMTx_xFezM) Rich rebuilds video\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atFw7wALxOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atFw7wALxOY) These two clowns once again complaining about an issue that every car company goes through during a ramp. Apparently, they're Tesla's biggest fans.\n\nSo at this point, you've got the mainstream media attacking Tesla, and alternative media attacking Tesla via Reddit and Youtube. Mind you none of these people were ever complaining when the referral program was active, the hypocrisy is unreal here. **Suprise Suprise DEMAND DROPS BIG TIME** in January and February.\n\n**Q 4 Conference call**\n\nI listened to this call 3 times, I just wanted to know how can we the investors, shareholders be so deceived to not know what was coming. Then I realized Musk spent the first 15 minutes of the call acknowledging service and quality issues and going above and beyond to fix those issues this year. It's clear at this point, that Tesla's reputation took a big hit among potential costumers.\n\n**Electric, S/X refresh anticipation, and Fred Lambert attacks**\n\nThis guy arguably did the most damage to Tesla's bottom line, and it really makes a lot of sense that Musk is calling him atm. It starts in October, Tesla lowers the price of the performance model 3 by 5k. Unfortunately, Tesla didn't realize that king Lambert had bought one a month ago, and he was pissed! he publishes hit pieces criticizing the price drop, calls out Musk on twitter, and Musk offers him and other models 3 performance owners refunds or free supercharging. I bet those refunds were costly.

If you have any car, I don't care what kind, it will have problems when it's -30C for weeks. His door handles start freezing, and his range drops, a known issue for EVS, instead of going to the service center to fix the Car, he starts making articles about how terrible the model 3 is in the winter.

The constant never ending articles about the upcoming \"refresh\" .Even though Elon stated multi-able times on conference calls and on Twitter that Tesla improves its product with tweaks, and doesn't do full out refreshes. Potential S/X buyers read those articles and made a decision to wait instead of pulling the trigger early.

The demand drop and the financials reflect this reality. I hope Tesla starts using traditional media for advertising, as it's way more predictable for both the consumer and the company.

{"title": "FT: Investors raise bets on Fed making two rate cuts", "selftext": "Lol market is in for a shocker.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/5c506164-8185-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849\n\n\nInvestors raise bets on Fed making two rate cuts\n\nInvestors have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates not once but twice this year, to counter concerns about slowing global economic growth that have been inflamed by the worsening US-China trade war.\n\nThe probability that the central bank will cut rates two or more times by the end of 2019 rose above 40 per cent on Tuesday, according to futures prices, exceeding for the first time expectations of a single cut.\nThe markets have been signalling a single rate cut this year for several months, even while the Fed has been keeping official policy on pause and maintained that its next move could be in either direction.\n\nConcerns over the growth outlook have been roiling the bond market, helping push the US government\u2019s\u00a0borrowing costs lower\u00a0as investors sought out the relative safety of Treasuries.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, fell as much as 6 basis points on Tuesday to 2.26 per cent, marking its lowest level since September 2017.\n\n\u201cThe economic data continues to weaken, exacerbated by a prolonged trade war with China,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThat second rate cut is gaining traction because the market believes the economy will weaken.\u201d\n\nThe US slapped additional tariffs on imports from China this month, and Chinese officials retaliated with measures of their own. President Donald Trump warned on Monday that US tariffs on goods from China could still \u201cgo up very, very substantially, very easily\u201d.\n\nThe signal from the widely-watched US yield curve, whose inversion has been a reliable indicator of past recessions, also intensified investor nervousness on Tuesday, because long-dated Treasury yields slid further below yields on shorter-dated government debt.\n\nThe difference between three-month and 10-year Treasury yields dropped as low as minus-9 basis points, nearing the year to date low of minus-11 bps. This measure of the yield curve has turned negative before every US recession of the past 50 years.\n\nCiti\u2019s global economic surprise index, which measures whether data are coming in better or worse relative to expectations, has been in negative territory for more than a year \u2014 its longest stint below zero on record. That has led analysts to pare their forecasts for global growth this year, to a median estimate of 3.3 per cent in 2019. This would be the slowest rate of expansion since 2009.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley warned that, after adjusting for the effects of the unprecedented unwinding of the Fed\u2019s post-financial crisis bond buying program, the yield curve has effectively been inverted since November 2018.\n\n\u201cWe think this means the US economic slowdown and rising recession risk is happening regardless of the trade outcome,\u201d the equity strategists, led by Michael Wilson, wrote.\n\nThe Fed\u00a0has avoided\u00a0any indication that cuts are coming. Minutes of its most recent meeting, held on April 30 and May 1 before the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs were announced, suggested that there was no immediate plan to move interest rates either higher or lower. Speeches from policymakers in recent weeks have reiterated the central bank\u2019s \u201cpatient\u201d approach.\n\nIn spite of the Fed\u2019s stance, investors\u2019 are anticipating that the central bank will have to ease its monetary policy.\n\n\u201cOne cut is likely. I would not be surprised if we see two,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \u201cA lot of it depends on how much of a deterioration we see in the economic data.
