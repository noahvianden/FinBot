Morgan misses profit expectations for the first time in 15 quarters", "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/14/jp-morgan-is-set-to-report-fourth-quarter-earnings--heres-what-the-street-expects.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/14/jp-morgan-is-set-to-report-fourth-quarter-earnings--heres-what-the-street-expects.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[J.P. Morgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=JPM) posted quarterly profit below analysts' expectations for the first time in 15 quarters on weaker-than-expected bond-trading revenue.  \n\n \n\nThe bank generated $1.98 per share in profit for the fourth quarter of 2018, below the $2.20 per share average estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The biggest shortfall appeared to come from the New York-based bank's trading division, where fixed-income trading produced $1.86 billion in revenue, compared to the $2.2 billion estimate.\n\nThe lender's shares dropped 2.7 percent to $98.23 in pre-market trading Tuesday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJ.P. Morgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is closely watched as a bellwether for the financial industry. So analysts may inquire about how the bank sees loan losses developing in 2019: The firm set aside $1.55 billion for credit losses, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier and $250 million more than analysts' $1.3 billion estimate. The bank said it was preparing for rising losses in retail credit cards and commercial and industrial loans.\n\n\"Despite a challenging quarter, we grew markets revenue in the investment bank for the year with record performance in equities and solid performance in fixed income,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in the earnings release.\n\n \n\nIn his remarks, Dimon also addressed the U.S. political dysfunction that is now threatening to slow economic growth: In 2019, \"we urge our country's leaders to strike a collaborative, constructive tone, which would reinforce already-strong consumer and business sentiment. Businesses, government and communities need to work together to solve problems and help strengthen the economy for the benefit of everyone.\"\n\nStill, the bank noted that its $7.1 billion in profit, a nearly 70 percent increase from the year earlier, was a fourth-quarter record. Company-wide revenue rose 4 percent to $26.8 billion, just under analysts' $26.84 billion estimate. Across the firm's core lending operations, businesses were strong: The firm posted a 9 percent increase to $14.5 billion in net interest income on loan growth and rising interest rates.\n\n \n\nThe lender posted net interest margin, a key profitability figure, of 2.54 percent, an improvement of 3 basis points from the previous quarter that matched analysts' expectations.\n\nNon-interest expenses rose 6 percent to $15.7 billion, slightly higher than analysts' $15.6 billion estimate, as the firm invested in technology and high-level hires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBank stocks were pummeled last year, particularly in the fourth quarter, on fears that a worsening U.S.-China trade war and global recession could be on the horizon, meaning rising losses across consumer and corporate loans. It was a comedown after the U.S. tax overhaul meant banks would produce billions of dollars more in profit in 2018, setting expectations for a rally in bank shares.\n\nStill, under Dimon, J.P Morgan has exceeded analysts' profit expectations for 15 straight quarters -- up until the fourth quarter of 2018. The bank has leading market share in retail, corporate and investment banking lines, giving it a diverse set of businesses to lean on when a particular area suffers. \n\n \n\nChoppy markets in December probably crimped trading and investment banking fees at J.P. Morgan, according to Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. Trading and investment banking revenue for the biggest U.S. banks probably fell up to 10 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by weakness in fixed income trading and debt and equity issuance.\n\nOn Monday, rival bank Citigroup [posted](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/11/citigroup-earnings-q4-2018.html) profit that beat analysts' estimates on cost cutting and a revenue shortfall triggered by a 21 percent decline in fixed income trading. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley report later this week. \n\n Shares of J.P. Morgan fell 8.7 percent last year, the smallest decline among the six biggest banks and a better showing than the 20 percent decline of the KBW Bank Index. As a result, J.P. Morgan has the highest price-to-book value among its peers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Here's what Wall Street expected:  \n\n\nEarnings: $2.20 a share, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv.  \n\n\nRevenue: $26.8 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from a year earlier.  \n\n\nNet Interest Margin: 2.54 percent, according to FactSet  \n\n\nTrading Revenue: Equities $1.29 billion, Fixed Income $2.20 billion \n\n&#x200B;", "id": "ag9187", "created_utc": 1547562545.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "still unreal growth for a financial institution their size", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "Never enough for the share holders.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4263635277748108}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43417972326278687}, {"body": "Thinking of opening a  JPM Mar 01 93.5/101 Put Vertical @ $237  using OptionsPlay:\n\n \n\nCost: $237\n\nMax Reward: $513\n\nMax Risk: $237\n\nPOP: 40.11%\n\nBreakeven: $98.63\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://app.optionsplay.com/#share/5c3deea72ea8928260e8980c](https://app.optionsplay.com/#share/5c3deea72ea8928260e8980c)", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019d hold off until tomorrow so you can see general market sentiment towards all this.

They want to own the stocks of companies with proven track records; companies who have survived previous recessions.\n\nRemember the focus is on the quality of the dividend, we are not looking for the highest yielding stocks...this is a HUGE mistake. \n\nHow do you separate a quality dividend stock from another? One easy way for you is to use dividend.com. This is a FREE website. \nYou can type in the ticker symbol for a stock and see it\u2019s dividend growth track record. If you\u2019re looking for a great dividend stock, you want to pick a stock with a long track record of dividend increases.\n\nFurthermore you should look at 3 key ratios using Morningstar.com\n\nOperating margin - a measure of profitability -  how much of each dollar of revenues is left over after both costs of goods sold and operating expenses are considered. The formula is for calculating operating margin is: Operating Margin =Operating Earnings / Revenue.\n\nFree Cash Flow to Sales % Free cash flow to sales is a valuation ratio that measures a company's surplus cash flow against sales revenues. The ratio indicates how much of a company's revenue is transformed into cash. FCF/Sales expressed as a percentage is often used to find 'cash cow' stocks.\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. Return on invested capital gives a sense of how well a company is using its money to generate returns.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) - 46 years - yields 3.36% - 118% of share price appreciation over the past decade.\nImproving revenues and earnings\nStrengthening operating margins over the past decade.\nROIC greater than 10% over the past decade\nFCF/sales hovering around 10%.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) - 8 years - yields 2.27% - 1263% of share price appreciation over the past decade.\nImproving revenues and earnings\nStable operating margin\nStrong ROIC, 44% for 2018!\nA history of strong FCF/sales, 40% for 2018.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) - 46 years - yields 4.64% - 143% of share price appreciation over the past decade.\nImproving revenues and earning\nImproving operating margin\nStrong ROIC, 21% in 2018\nA history of very strong FCF/sales - 37% for 2018", "id": "agadul", "created_utc": 1547570445.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "What makes a long term play SBUX?
