{"title": "XLNX: Upcoming Growth?", "selftext": "Fellow aspies: my spergie senses are tingling again, DD time.\n\nTLDR: XLNX has been stuck in FPGA market since inception. Newly appointed CEO Peng is looking towards data centers for future growth with ACAPs. If adopted, ACAP has the ability to greatly expand XLNX business as data centers and the clouds grow (not to mention 5G).\n\nUgh. Just read the TLDR. Your tism says you're too lazy for DDs. You don't know about semiconductors or computer science, you just want tendies. DISCLOSURE: dont pretend my tism is below yours; I'm not a computer scientist, coder, techie, etc. I want tendies. So if you're using this as your research rather than a gateway/comparison I'd say forgo the tldr & just invest with u/1R0NYMAN... Info here is found in XLNX, NVDA, INTC ERs as well as numerous articles on FPGA & ACAP found on sites such as Forbes (a ton of articles actually), Nextplatform, Tom's Hardware. ACAP info found in XLNX published white paper. \n\nXLNX has made a number of shifts in 2018. Former CEO Moshe Gavrielov retired & appointed Victor Peng. Peng announced that data centers would be their focus for the future (because duh. If you don't know the potential growth in data centers over the next 5-10yrs just buy SPY 2020 240p) with ACAP 7nm chips being key. (ACAP = Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform.) Research says that data accelerator market will go from 3B to 21.3B from '18 to 2023. That's 50% CAGR. ACAP chips are essentially XLNX's solution to the FPGA scale problem while also dealing with ASIC problems, namely that with ASIC the chip is what it is, new technology=new ASIC=millions & years of development (development which, ofc, uses FPGAs to prototype).\n\nMoore's Law is over. (So like... Moore's era?) This means that 7nm is small. Really small. Potentially only surpassed by 5nm (although the total aspies in comp sci have developed 3nm to 1nm so...). For speeds & scaling to improve in cloud that means more accelerators. ACAP. Basically there are a number of seeming pros with one major con. I'll go over the pros below. The major detractor is (and again I do not code so I do not understand the full scale of what this means, although I can perhaps see the difficulties) that ACAP still contains FPGAs & needs to be programmed. Additionally, XLNX has called ACAP \"Versal 7nm\" a MLaaS (Machine learning as a service). In addition to programming for FPGAs one would need to code in numerous other languages depending on ACAP application. The adoption in the industry may be dependant a bit on adaption to this. (If you know more about this/can clarify lmk somehow. Personally curious what programmers would say about this.)\n\nCurrently, data centers use NVDA & INTC GPUs (ASIC). Basically XLNX wants a slice of this via ACAP. XLNX apparently shits on INTC's FPGAs (Altera) in both technology & market share (XLNX ~60% vs ~35%), not to mention that INTC doesn't have anything close to an ACAP 7nm (they're currently floundering around with 10nm, constantly delaying release). If XLNX can pry INTC frozen, dead grip from data centers (along with NVDA's sweaty, leather jacket wearing grip) via ACAP they should get a nice slice of the data center accelerator pie. AMD has bet specifically on this as it has partnered with XLNX on their MLaaS to beat out their INTC & NVDA (NGC) rivals. Fundamentally, the ACAP offers benefits even a sperg like me can -seemingly- understand. Their chips represent a shift from the years and millions of $ that ASIC development takes: ACAP is a platform for \"fast time to market compute acceleration.\" Not to mention that ASICs die when tech improves, whereas ACAP is obviously adaptive. XLNX claims these are more energy efficient (7nm...), as well as being significantly faster.\n\nDetails from XLNX: \"Versal ACAP are built around... Network on Chip (NoC, which I guess is them one-upping SoC). ACAPs comprise: multicore scalar PS, CPM, AI accelerators & complex signal processing, and programmable logic (PL).\" These contain up to 2,000 logic blocks, up to almost 4,000 dsp engines, and up to 400 AI engines. XLNX claims that it is at least 2.5X as fast as GPUs, and in some instances much more. (White Paper) XLNX claims this can be applied to data centers, 5G/SATCOM, defense/aerospace, ADAS, etc. \n\nFor the r/wsb spergs (as opposed to comp sci spergs), XLNX has a seemingly low risk business. XLNX generates 28% revenue from US, 44% Asia (in Korea they are already deploying 5G), 20% Europe, 8% Japan while none of their customers represent greater than 10% of revenues (compared to SWKS & QRVO which might as well be APPL subsidiaries by revenue). They dominate the traditional FPGA market and if ACAP adopts, they will expand to a NoC company, using their MLaaS relying on the field programmability for adaption. The market for this seems wide open & quickly growing.\n\nXLNX trades at ~20B market cap on net income of approx ~850M/yr. At an obviously high value, ACAP may be factored in at this point however, if adoption is positive ACAP may take XLNX to an entirely different place in the matter of a couple years. Finally, in the highly cyclic sector of semis, XLNX looks poised for sustained growth against the standard cycle if ACAP delivers. \n\nSo yea. XLNX finally makes programmable compute accelerators that, according to XLNX, is a one-stop-shop NoC that scales at lower cost, uses less energy, and are faster than any other accelerator. \n\nTldr translation for r/wsb; buy $MU $90 calls March '19, buy $XLNX $60 puts for March '19, u/1R0NYMAN-style box spreads.

While for the moment they have larger market share than Intel (Altera) these ACAPs are a different product in my opinion. Likely to be more expensive and have less programmability than traditional FPGAs, as I think their chip has basically a lot of non-programmmable peripherals built in all connected by a network on chip. I don't really know where they're headed with this product, but it does seem like they might be trying to build specialized machine learning chips with some programmability rather than a FPGA. Could be good for capitalizing on the machine learning craze right now, but I think Wall Street is overvaluing their chances at the moment.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "XLNX isn't discontinuing FPGAs but basically creating something entirely new in ACAP. They will compete directly with NVDAs GPUs in a market they haven't entered before which is growing 50% CAGR over the next 5 years. XLNX grows rev at ~20% y/y before ACAP. After?... The chip shit is too over my head to act like I know enough to ramble about but this thing runs tons of logic blocks and ai engines, you can program one part without others all while it runs. Look at XLNX ACAP white paper.\n\nI may not know shit about tech in a professional sense but I do know that ML/AI/Big data is just beginning. MSFT is just beginning to use Azure to offer Dynamics 365, an all-in-one cloud/API/APM/CRM/Security/DB/analytics which I presume will complete will a ton of mid-level cloud-tech.

I know ML is big and will continue to be big, but the question is whether there's demand for the specific ML product? If big companies choose to make their own ASICs specifically for machine learning that would reflect poorly on Xilinx's decision to pursue this product line.
