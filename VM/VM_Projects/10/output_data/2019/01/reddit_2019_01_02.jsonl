Everything that Tesla releases, he thinks is fantastic.  I'm not sure that as a person with dollars to invest that I should listen to him.

It could could have a number of causes.  A good analyst would try to come up with a large number of reasons, but he only mentions causes that are great for Tesla (lots of demand overseas and tons of people waiting for the $35k version).  Personally, I think the reason that only 15,000 Model3's were sold to reservation holders this quarter is the many, many reservation holders will never buy the car.  Even at $35,000 they aren't going to buy it.

Being right is not cheerleading. \n\nJudge the data as it comes. No legitimate analyst on Earth would ever say people are just holding reservations with no intention of converting them.

He keeps making incremental changes to his Model so that in each quarter he winds up pretty close, but if you look back any period of time he is woefully off.  Case in point, here is his model from a year ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N090eePxlE&index=104&t=0s&list=PLhmaOvttbVxCddeAOyx8wdBI_SJ_vcEzC\n\nKey highlights: \n\nOperating income of $200 million for 2018.  Actual results: operating loss of nearly $1 billion.\n\nRevenue of $25.3 billion for 2018 (and he makes a big deal out of this being conservative!).  Actual results: revenue of a little over $21 billion.\n\nSG&A and R&D in 2018 of $5.4 billion.  Actual results: about $4.4 billion.  This one is interesting because he is off by 18%, but he actually was too conservative.  Which just shows how completely ludicrous his profitability estimates were.\n\nDeliveries of 200k Model 3s in 2018, and 110k S/X.  Actual results: 145,846 Model 3s and 99,394 S/X.\n\nThen, if you look at 2019 his estimates look even more insane.  He thinks the company will deliver over 7,500 Model 3s per week for the entire year, on top of increasing S/X deliveries by 16% over current levels (curious how they will do that given they are production constrained).  Oh yes, and they'll ship 500 semis this year.  \n\nSo in sum, LOL at his analysis being largely accurate.  \n\n", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": ">No it hasn't. He keeps making incremental changes to his Model so that in each quarter he winds up pretty close, but if you look back any period of time he is woefully off.\n\nPoint to a better projection.  \n\nEVERY analysis should change based on available data. A financial model is based on assumptions derived from the information you have.  Galileo has a real financial model of Tesla that is supported by key assumptions.  The key assumptions must be continually evaluated against data that becomes available.  \n\nThe strength of any financial model is in how deeply its key assumptions are validated. For instance cost of goods sold for Tesla can be modeled really well from the exquisite bottom up examination that the Munro group did during their teardown of the model 3.  \n\nGathering data to validate your key assumptions is an ongoing activity.  You must change your assumptions to fit the data.  Making predictions with little or no substance like people are holding 1k$ reservations with no intention of ever ordering is not financial analysis unless it is validated by key assumptions and data. Like \"In the past 5 examples of Tesla style reservation based sales only x% of reservation holders ever converted their reservation.\" \n\nBesides the depth of Galileo's excellent modelling, you have failed to appreciate the accuracy of his predictions for another reason.  Tesla is a growth company in the early adoption stages of its growth.  In this phase, the exponential nature of sales means that predicting revenue within 20% is very rare and demonstrates the validity of the model rather than its failure.  It would be a terrible prediction for a company like Coca Cola but for an exponentially growing new market entrant with a very complex business model it is nothing short of astounding. \n\nI would love to see a better analysis (other than the teslamotorclub forum one) that does a better job of modeling Tesla.  Galileo is extremely transparent about his key assumptions and when the predictions derived from those assumptions are inaccurate he evaluates why he was wrong and improves his model.
