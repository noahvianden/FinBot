AMZN and GOOG had great earnings but alas that was not enough within this bear mkt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[it's all downhill from here \\(or is it?\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xto6dwebi7821.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=eda90727e25717ad6a396cf8e506145dea87b8a4)\n\nthe reality is tim crook and lying huang are either incompetent or dishonest; let me explain. in Q2 Huang said explicitly that there was an inventory overhang that would be quickly unwound during, i quote \"go back to school season\". In Q3 he tells us that actually all those cards that have benefited sales the past year thx to crypto is now in the second hand mkt trading for half price or less given the btc debacle. thus the channels don't even wanna have any kind of card from them.\n\nMr. Crook pulled the same stunt , he once said \"china is not a problem\" now it is + his : i'm gonna hide phone units cuz i think i'm jobs and ppl will believe in me was borderline retarded.\n\nanyway that was my rant.\n\n$AAPL has told us the truth now, i think a 0.7x AAPL to SPX500 multiple is fair. so around 140$ but that's another story.\n\nnow the problem is that $AAPL crashed 9% and since there were no earnings or anything in place, option mkt was absolutely NOT pricing this move. indeed, mkt had priced in a 1stdv lower bar of no more than 154.33 for friday expiration.\n\n[1stdv range priced in option mkts for aapl by expiration. you have to go to FEB 19 to get in this current range.](https://preview.redd.it/h1pijkqhj7821.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=3faffa50a8b323dab2fb2f6f3ea7948d8ea169e4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Option chain for AAPL FRI Exp](https://preview.redd.it/rdpt03zqj7821.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4418b4dc4621eb83f19e14115815384f16100f8)\n\nso now we have a big problem, all these puts that you see above 145 strike where we are currently can generate two outcomes depending on if their holders decide to a)monetize them or b)roll them to later if they think this shit is going lower\n\nOption a is the most likely at least at the start of the session and this is why i think we have been going up because monetizing them means unwinding the delta associated to these puts (so negative delta) hence we have a pool of 1E9$ in AAPL shares or *similar\\*(don't pay attention to this word if u dun get what i mean, just being rigorous)*  that could be covered and i believe this is what will happen at start of session and will take us higher on whole nasdaq complex as the case for this going down a lot more is less likely in my opinion. so i am long nasdaq since 5 am NY and i'm up 30 pts already, but i think u can start and build a small pos around the cash open even though the entry is far from perfect.\n\nb) Rolling these puts at these strikes that now have a MUCH higher delta suggests that the opposite will happen, in order to hedge the sellers will need to sell a lot more shares but i only expect this downside pressure to not only be minimal but also delayed.\n\nso clearly the way for aapl in my mind is up then flat or down.\n\nADP is already out and was good for us, i went long USDJPY on it. \n\nlast important data point today is ISM, if it's inline we should be fine i hope. so overall i am expecting a bullish day or at least a day where bulls will get an opportunity to get out with some gains. \n\ntarget is 2500 then yesterday's high at 2519\n\nif we do start falling then we can rely on QQQ and then SPY  puts for support and the SPY ovn low\n\nSupport one is 2465 then 2402.5. this one will absolutely hold i am certain.\n\nQQQ offers 6126 or 149.22\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k2l98innm7821.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc75fc40d6181793d447e6c7a02026c637b8ef7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5dtbik0n7821.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f7851d89d60f9a711b78a381735b6b9a9b9f2e\n\nOverall i'm neutral to slightly bullish for the day and here's my game plan:\n\nstay long into US OPEN with stop at breakeven. \n\nif that doesn't work then buy the support levels i mentioned for a reversal and tight stops which should hold as long as ISM doesn't go crazy to below 50.
