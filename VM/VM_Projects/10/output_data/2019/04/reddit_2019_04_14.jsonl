{"title": "Hey fellow autists, I wrote a story for all of you.", "selftext": "So, a week ago I responded to a prompt over at the writingprompts sub, and the story blew up. I slipped some wsb memes in there for extra spice, and I thought you would enjoy it.\n\nThe prompt was this one: \n\n**[WP] You're a financial advisor. In 1994, you get a weird phone call from a man asking you if he can get any Bitcoin below $200k, and the call cuts off before you can ask him what Bitcoin was. Years later you get a call again from the same man, claiming he's calling back seconds after disconnection.** \n\n-------------\n\nI must confess, when the bitcoin hit $15k I was tempted to sell. I had bought a ton of them the moment they first appeared, guided by an odd call I had received decades ago. For people like me, who care little about those slow-earning stocks, and love the adrenaline a good bet on a highly volatile company provides, every little hint of information, no matter how ridicule, was enough for me to spend all my savings.\n\nThe green numbers were my drug, and the red ones my motivation to invest more. Diversification they said, and I laughed at them when $MU sky-rocketed, and I bathed in tendies.\n\nBut I'm straying away. You see, if I sold bitcoin when it reached  $15k I would've been set for life, but one does not simply ignore a call from someone telling you that he wanted to get bitcoin below $200k. That's a sort of legal insider information, despite how unreliable it was.\n\nOf course, as you may know, the bitcoin plummeted, and new cryptocurrencies rose. I won't lie, I panicked back then, and almost sold at $5k, but I forbid myself to do such a stupid thing. I knew it was going to rise, and it was going to rise like nothing the market had ever seen before.\n\nAnd then it hit $1k, and the ramen noodles were starting to make me sick. Still I waited, tear after tear, thinking about the amount of money I had lost, and how the people in the online forums called me names, and paid their respects with the letter F.\n\nBut then it happened. It rose slowly but steadily. The moment I saw this, I bought at $2K, and kept it. When it reached $15k again, my mind screamed to sell and stop the stress. But the stress is what made me feel alive, and so I held onto my bitcoins.\n\nTwo years later, it hit $199k, and the phone rang again.\n\n\"Hey man, this phone disconnected or something. Can I buy below $200k?\"\n\nI frowned. This was the man from the call from all those decades ago. The call that started it all. \"What do you mean the phone disconnected? It's been 30 years since we spoke.\"\n\nThe man laughed. \"Yeah sure, that coffee you are *drinking* must be quite strong. Now, can we talk business, please?\"\n\nConfused, but interested, I played his game. Perhaps he would accidentally give me the key to make another fortune. \"You can buy for sure below $200k. It's at $198k right now. But do you think it will keep rising?\"\n\n\"Keep rising? Absolutely not. It will hit $205k and then plummet to cents. I just want to buy, hold, and sell when it reaches $204k.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, I can make the operation for you. I just need your data.\"\n\nThere was no answer. Once again, the phone had disconnected.\n\nWithout a doubt, when it hit $204k I sold, and secured a fortune that would last for centuries. I became the richest man in the world, and became an angel investor, losing fortunes in start-ups that went nowhere.\n\nBut as thing goes, a young man approached me one day and pitched his invention. It was a telephone he claimed could communicate with the past. Everyone rejected him, for he had no proof that it worked, and when you used it you lost connection after a handful of seconds.\n\nI bought every patent and license the man had. He scampered happily away with his money, and I, as a good businessman, reserved the technology just for me.\n\nI grabbed the phone, and dialed a very old number.\n\n\"Hello, can I buy bitcoin below $200k?\"", "id": "bd7mn4", "created_utc": 1555276116.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Well, somebody clearly on drugs....", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19732698798179626}, {"body": "Well written story, reminds me of 12 Monkeys", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.192912757396698}, {"body": "Spoopy", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1506316214799881}, {"body": "Can we tag this DD please?", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20000451803207397}, {"body": "Excellent charts.
