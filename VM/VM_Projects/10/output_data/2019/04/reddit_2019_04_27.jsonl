{"title": "Assessment of Model S & X decline in sales: blip or trend?", "selftext": "Some of my thoughts on the possible causes of the unexpected decline in Model S and X production and deliveries:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduction/deliveries of Model S & X vehicles in Q4 '18 reached 25,161/27,607 , which is roughly in line with a steady run-rate of about 25k/quarter since 2017.  Production/deliveries fell drastically to 14,150/12,100 in Q1 '19, despite Tesla's Q4 '18 shareholder letter guidance that the company expected only modest reductions in production and delivery (Exact text: \"we are expecting our Model S and Model X deliveries in Q1 2019 to be slightly below Q1 2018\"  For reference, Q1 '18 S and X production/deliveries were  24,728/21,800).  I estimate that Tesla's delivery of only about 12k Model S and X, vs. 21k Model S and X, cost the company roughly 900M $US in revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is going on?  Is this a temporary problem or something moret  I looked at the possibility of issues in the Supply Chain and Demand.  I consider the possibility of outside competition to be unlikely, given the absence of widely available competitors to the Model S and X.  I acknowledge that some consumers may be waiting on future vehicles like the Audi E-Tron and Porche Taycan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possibility (1) Supply Chain misteps.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know that a lot of new components are involved in the project \"Raven\" refresh to the Model S and X, announced last week:\n\n(1) New Drivetrain: permanent magnet synchronous reluctance motor, silicon carbide power electronics, and improved lubrication, cooling, bearings, and gear designs.\n\n(2) New Fully Adaptive Suspension.\n\n(3) Several other components of Model S and Model X in keeping with our philosophy of continuous improvement. These updates include new wheel bearings and a few new tire designs for certain variants to improve range, ride, and steering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough the battery packs appear to be the same between pre and post Raven varients:\n\nModel S 100D to Model S Long Range, goes from 335 miles to 370 miles, or +10.4%\n\nModel S 75D to Model S Standard Range, goes from 259 miles to 285 miles, or + +10.0%\n\nThe battery pack is unlikely to be the same between LR and SR, however.  Model S LR is 4883 lbs, SR is 4769 lbs.  Note that in the configuration page, both cars are listed as having the same features.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla announced the discontinuation of the Model S and X 75D on Janury 10, 2019, with a final call for orders of this variant by January 13, 2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla announced the new LR and SR Model S and X on April 23, 2019, stating in its press release: \"These changes will go into production at our factory in Fremont, California this week, and can be ordered today at Tesla.com.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the shareholder letter released on April 24, 2019, Tesla stated: \"In Q1, the Model S and Model X production line was updated to accommodate the next generation of powertrain for these vehicles. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnder the \"supply chain\" theory, Tesla began to wind down manufacturing and purchase of 100D and 75D specific components in late Q4 '18 or early  Q1 '19, while simultaneously attempting to wind up manufacturing and purchase of Raven specific components.  In this scenario, Raven components did not ramp as expected, leaving Tesla with insufficient parts to keep building pre-Raven vehicles.  Tesla therefore decided to focus on building high-margin 100D vehicles with the parts they had on hand and the last of the parts coming through the supplier pipeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possibility (2) Demand fell.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reduction in US federal tax credit would have some impact on sales of Model S and X, although I am skeptical that $3,750 would make that much difference to someone buying a car in the $80,000-$100,000 price range.  I believe that Model 3 did and will continue to draw away many Model S buyers.  From a utility standpoint, the Model 3 is almost as good as the Model S in terms of cabin space.  From a subjective standpoint, it is more fun to drive, though at the cost of Noise Vibration and Harshness (NVH) and overall refinement. Double the cost for the convenience of a hatchback in the Model S is probably not worth it to most buyers.  On the other hand, I do not believe that Model 3 will have much impact on Model X sales.  Model X offers a higher seating position and a much more comfortable 2nd row in terms of legroom and leg support, as well as the option of a 3rd row.  In my observation, there is not much, if any, overlap between the market for 3-row crossovers like the X and executive sedans like Model 3.  Further insight into the demand issue is hindered by lack of data on the breakdown between Model S and X sales for Q1 '19\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possibility (3)** Combination of the above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cannot conclude, based on the information available, that the decline in Model S and X production/deliveries was due to any single factor.  My expectation is that the Model 3 LR Dual Motor will have measurable effect on the take-rates of Model S Standard Range, but little to no effect on Model X of any variant.", "id": "bi2y2n", "created_utc": 1556395181.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "They cut the most affordable versions and most people knew a refresh was coming.
