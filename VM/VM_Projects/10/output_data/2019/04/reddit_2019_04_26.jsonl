Fundamentally sound, and markets itself as a premium product which will always have a niche in the marketplace. On top of that the products are above average, and work extremely well together. Look around, how many Apple devices do you have? Personally I have 3, and I\u2019m willing to bet the domestic average is 2-3. An iPhone, Mac, AirPod/beats, maybe the watch is up there too. Onto pod that their recent acquisitions have been AR and Optical based. This leads me to believe that they\u2019ll release Apple Glasses and take the AR world by storm. Like they revolutionized the smartphone by taking an already existing product and perfecting it. Apple will take the market Google Glass probed is available, and make it a household item. The screen is going to be a technology of the past. AR is the future.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s: there are a few things that will always be essential to human life. Food, water, shelter, and clothing. McDonald\u2019s is an easy choice if you want to enter the food industry, especially fast food. On top of that McDonald\u2019s also owns the land where the restaurants are located. They provide the franchisers with a means to make money and pay rent, McDonald\u2019s gets the rent money on top of the profits from the food. They are a self sufficient real estate company.\n\nNvidia: like I said, screens will be a tech of the past. Nvidia is heavily invested in developing AR/VR products. On top of that I have reason to believe the next market bubble will be ESports. Look at these professional gamers, they are making big amounts of money and being sponsored by huge companies.
