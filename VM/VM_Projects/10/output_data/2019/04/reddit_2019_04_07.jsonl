Because they\u2019re publicly traded they have to release financials, statements, conference calls, and major news. This news can be found by reading their quarterly and yearly financials, listening to their quarterly conference calls, and keeping an eye on things through platforms like news websites, newspapers, stock screeners, calling their investor relations or visiting their investor relations page on their website, talking with others in the industry or who invest/follow the company, and dozens of other ways.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to get into the NVDA stuff because it involves some stuff not directly related to the stock market but let\u2019s use another example. You have a publicly traded manufacturing company that makes equipment and paint/chemicals. In the background noise you hear news stories about how tariffs are coming on imported steel and now making steel more expensive. You can use the news of tariffs and steel becoming more expensive to come to the conclusion that the manufacturing company is gong to have concerns regarding increasing costs with producing their equipment because their products are made of steel and the tariffs will hurt pretty bad. Do they increase prices on their products for the consumer or do they keep prices the same, face lower margins, and hope the tariffs are only temporary. Do they shift production/focus from equipment more towards chemicals/paint for the meanwhile which is now the more profitable department of their business? Did you notice on their financial statements from last quarter that they had luckily purchased and made note of a ton of steel they purchased before the tariffs so maybe they\u2019re potentially in good shape and actually hold an advantage over their competitors who will be struggling with supply and raising costs? Stuff like that you have to look for and research. It\u2019s all separate and different aspects but everything comes together big picture.\n\nIt takes time and effort which people either don\u2019t want to give or can\u2019t give. It\u2019s hard following and keeping track of this stuff and reading through financials if you already work a 9-5 so it\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s also hard if you have no background, experience, or knowledge of how to read or understand this stuff. However the information is usually out there for the most part, you\u2019ll just be going against people who really know their stuff or have incredible resources/technology to make better use of it. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you but you overlook it or don\u2019t understand it. There is a lot to it but rarely is availability of information a concern. \n\nIt\u2019s why many people recommend index funds. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading financials, finding an edge, or fearing you\u2019ve missed something. Your portfolio will more or less flow with the market as a whole with index funds.

If your goal is to build wealth without doing much research, index funds is definitely the way to go. If you are interested in learning about this space, start with a very small amount that you can afford to lose. Gradually, you will understand the elements/philosophy of long-term investing. Note that beating the index is hard for anyone (even full time professionals). Individual stock picks require a lot of research, patience, conviction and a willingness to be proven wrong. If you find that you enjoy the research process despite the above elements, allocate more of your capital in individual stock picks rather than index funds.

Stock ABC has a Beta of 2 then if the market fall/rises 1% then you would estimate that ABC would fall/rise 2%, So high growth sectors like tech can be great in good times and terrible in bad times.
