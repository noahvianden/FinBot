Maybe there is some more upside to the stock because of the - lets say 'optimism', eventually it is gonna revert to the mean which i believe is around $12 or lower. The reason is as follows:\n\n- Intel has fine tuned its CPU architecture to the max. Esp because they own their manufacturing, which i have explained below.
