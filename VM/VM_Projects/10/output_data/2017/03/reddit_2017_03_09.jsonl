Annoying, can be, especially if you didn't know this when making a purchase, but it isn't anything new or surprising. \n\n\nAlso, the high end gaming card has always been close to the titan in terms of performance, but at a much lower cost. IIRC, gaming performance on a titan is similar, but for double precision applications it blows the other cards out of the water. \n\nHaven't kept up on CPU development as much.

It's true that there will always be a better card, but games are so heavily optimized for specific brands and cards that it really could mean that your Titan X will underperform in the same game with the only difference being driver optimizations targeted toward the newer card.\n\nHowever, when you spend $1200 on a card, you aren't just trying to be cutting edge, you are trying to future proof your computer so you dont have to buy another card for a long time. That's becoming less and less possible given the extremely targeted optimizations I mentioned in combination with the seemingly exponential rise in resource usage in games year after year. \n\nThis ties in into Nvidia's and Intel's incrementalism tactic which I wouldn't put it past them to decrease the life cycle of their enthusiast products to increase sales with every iteration under the guise of increasing demand on the CPU or GPU.

I will have to look into this more later. Early benchmarks should always be taken with a grain of salt, and even if it can match the performance of a 1080, it will need to also be priced competitively and match the power management/thermal performance of the 1080. The latter is something AMD has struggled with in the past on GPUs, and the my understanding is that 10 series from nvidia does very well here. \n\n\nAlso, I guess technically the dual precision on the titan may be a moot point, because if the consumer has no need/can't tell the difference, then that will do little to console them.

Nvidia also releases some good road maps and stays with a consistent timing, so everyone knew this was going to happen, no question. That is how it always works.\n\nNvidia responded to AMD's product and potential price points by dropping their own prices and releasing the Ti at a fairly low price.  This is what we want as a consumer, competition drives down prices and increases quality.  \n\nI definitely think the question is still up about how well the Vega will perform and at what price point, and it could be awesome and cheap which will be freaking fantastic.  AMD has taken a lot of risk on the Vega though, which is admirable and I am glad they do what they do, but it will not give them much flexibility in pricing.  Let me explain.\n\nNvidia 1080Ti's are made from chips that Nvidia has been producing for a long time.  They know how they will operate and they probably have piles and piles of them sitting around.  AMD, on the other hand, is releasing something brand new right now, haven't already had products on the market for 8+ months to cover their cost, and are introducing a lot of new tech that can negatively impact yields.  All in all what this means:  AMD absolutely HAS to sell lots of Vegas to pay off their investment.  Nvidia has probably already broken even, so they have the advantage of changing their prices all over the place.\n\nI typically go with green products since I have had some driver issues with AMD in the past, but I want Vega to absolutely destroy Pascal.  That is what everyone should want.  That would drive prices down so fast it would be great for everyone.  But AMD doesn't have as much big of a window to \"slay the dragon\" as you might think.  \n\nI say all this because I want AMD to be successful but I don't want it to be because of hype.

{"title": "$GIMO Chart DD and stuff", "selftext": "**Ticker**: $GIMO\n\n**Exchange:** NYSE\n\n**Industry:** Software\n\n\n\n**Overview:** $GIMO offers solutions that deliver visibility and control of traffic accross networks. It has a presence in the United States; Rest of Americas; Europe; Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. (Source: Reuters)\n\n\nIn January, $GIMO reported prelimiary Q4 results that caused a crash of almost 20%. Of course institutional downgrades soon followed. Now, the company is operating at it's \"new\" value, and looks to be at a fair price. This post will outline when to buy, and when to sell in an effort to make a short-term gain. Personally, I like playing options to get the most bang for my buck. \n\n\nThat being said, I believe $GIMO will continue it's uptrend through to the middle of next week before it either peaks, or rallies, and here's why... \n\n\n\n**Ichimoku Cloud:**\n\n[Figure A](http://imgur.com/a/Uma9e)\n\nIf you'd like to read up on Ichimoku clouds, check out [this](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud) article. Otherwise, the TL;DR is that when the pink, green, and light-blue lines cross in to the purple cloud, there's a good chance there will be a rally of some sort.\n\n\nAside from that, you want to notice the green line and how it is starting to trend upwards. This alone is not enough to say whether or not you should expect it to continue, but it's a good starting indicator... \n\n\n\n**MACD:**\n\n\n[Figure B](http://imgur.com/a/Ui0OU)\n\nYou can learn about the MACD over [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/082701.asp).\n\n\nWhat you want to notice, is that the green line is starting to turn around, and the blue is about to as well. This would be a nice 'sweet spot'. Scroll down in the article to Figure 4 and look at the 2nd circled 'Buy' spot. Looks familiar, eh? TL;DR looks like it's trending up.\n\n\n\n**Stochasitcs:**\n\n\n[Figure C](http://imgur.com/a/xAZBP)\n\nThis is the Stoachastic Momentum Index (SMI).  We are using it as an indicator to tell us whether or not the 'run' is over ($GIMO has been green 2 days in a row now). Since the two lines look like they just turned around and are still near the bottom, it leads us to believe that there is still room to run. I personally think it'll be bullish through next week.\n\n\nMore info on using this indicator can be found [here](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2013/04/11/StochasticMomentumIndex.html)\n\n\n[Figure D](http://imgur.com/a/SUdUv)\n\nThis figure shows the Stochastics-Fast chart. Similar to the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI), this is to help identify whether or not the stock is overbought or oversold. More information can be found [here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/fast-stochastic). \n\n\nThis chart is the LEAST desirable out of all the charts posted so far. Right now it says its approaching the overbought territory, so tread carefully!\n\n\n**Conclusion:** I believe $GIMO will dip or stay relatively flat tomorrow (Friday Mar 10th), this will give a little more leeway on the overbought territory which allows for a little more of a run throughout next week. So my play would be to wait for a dip tomorrow, buy, then hold through to Weds or Thurs next week for a small run. After a few smaller green days Mon-Weds, I think it will dip a bit, until the MACD levels out. Not necessarily to 'oversold' territory, but enough to run back up again and a little higher than the previous peak (seen in first chart around mid Feb).\n\n\n\nWell, I guess that's all. Let me know what you guys think, and if I'm an idiot that's gonna lose every last penny or not. Or if I'm doing everything wrong, etc...
