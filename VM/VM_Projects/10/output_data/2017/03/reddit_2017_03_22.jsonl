SPY is not the index itself. I understand what you're saying, but there is no ETF that tracks the spot value of the VIX. Everything related to the VIX (VIX options, TVIX, UVXY) is based off of VIX futures. That's why sometimes it seems like ETFs and ETNs like TVIX and UVXY don't track the VIX very well. The value of the index is not the most important factor--the most important factor is the value of the VIX futures contracts. The values are related of course, because when a futures contract reaches maturity, its value converges on the actual value of VIX itself (the contracts are ultimately cash-settled).\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the whole purpose of VIX to begin with. VIX naturally goes up and down and often has *huge* spikes on a short timescale. Consider: if there was an ETF that tracked the actual value of the VIX, you could just buy it and hold it until VIX has a huge spike, then sell it for a hefty profit. But that would be absurd. The point of the VIX is that you have to pay a premium to hedge against a huge market crash. VIX futures are almost always in contango, which basically means that people buying VIX futures expect the future spot value of the VIX to be below the current value of the futures contract (they don't *expect* a market crash, but they want to be protected in case there is one). If you look at VIX futures for April, May, June, July, etc. you will see that the further out you go, the more expensive they are.

I basically told him this:\n\n>>History tells you that the average person doesn't [have enough $$$ to afford those losses], hence the sell offs which lead to crashes.\n\n>The sell-offs aren't caused by stock traders not having enough money to get by; they're caused by people panic-selling everything they've invested in because they think literally every company in their portfolio is about to go bankrupt. Now, if you're a professional stock trader, in which 100% of your income comes from stocks, then yes, you may need to sell out in order to keep ANY of your assets. But for most people and companies, stocks are an appreciating asset. If you have a WELL-DIVERSIFIED portfolio, you will always be better off holding those stocks and waiting out the crash.\n\n>Unless you believe literally every company is about to go bankrupt, you shouldn't sell. And if every business DOES go bankrupt, then you have much bigger problems than the current value of your portfolio.
