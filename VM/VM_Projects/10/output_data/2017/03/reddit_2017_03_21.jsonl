However, if you don't have access to the greeks and can't or don't want to compute them, you can easily calculate the probability of exercise given historical stock data (available even for free on Yahoo/Google finance) and the current risk free rate which is only a google search away. \n\nAlso see here: \nhttp://money.stackexchange.com/a/30416", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "/u/SardonicTRex is exactly right, thank you for your detailed explanation. \n\n/u/ssrg1615 you're also right that it does look like a random walk with an upward drift. many of the models that individuals and firms use to price the likelihood of various strikes being ITM/OTM for a given point in the future are based on random walks, normal distributions, lognormal distributions, historical distributions, monte carlo simulations, etc. \n\nthis is reflected especially well in stocks like MSFT, for which there is little expectation of high volatility resulting from news, competitors, or earnings. NFLX and TSLA, for example, exhibit a much greater degree of this form of volatility, and as a result, greater tail risks are taken into account, and the random walk phenomenon is occasionally diminished in the heatmaps for these and similar stocks (this is my opinion).

The solution the context of an American option might or might not apply, it depends. Black-Scholes as a model is right or wrong depending on your assumptions of the underlying asset, not the derivative payout structure, which a question of the specific solution. \n\nAt least for American calls when the ex-dividend date isn't close or the payout is small, then there's no reason you can't use the formula for the European option since early exercise isn't optimal and so there's no additional value over a European option. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "\"You can adjust the black scholes formula for dividends fairly easily\"\n\nI don't believe this is correct. The whole reason entire branches of option pricing theory exist is because BS is not sufficient for American options with discrete dividends (like US equities such as MSFT).\n\nThere are three different things to account for when dealing with a single dividend: price movement prior to the dividend, early exercise at dividend, and then price movement after the dividend. With more than one dividend between now and then there are additional periods. MSFT issuing .39 (~60bps) at a time is a huge factor because it means that the probability of ITM options for the next expiration (or more) to be exercised at ex-div is near 100%. If you instead apply BS, that probability is much lower, which also has a direct impact on IV measurements. Rising rates will also impact this more over time.\n\nI understand where you're coming from when you talk about the payout potentially being so small that it doesn't matter, but that's my whole point. If you don't care about that level of accuracy, then whether someone uses delta or N(d2) based on misapplication of BS is irrelevant as well.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"I don't believe this is correct.\"\n\nI was referring to European options. I then went on to discuss American options.
