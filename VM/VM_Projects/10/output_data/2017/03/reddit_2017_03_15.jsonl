Waiting until summers end to dip into the markets could backfire this year as many MarketWatch analysts are expecting a notable dip in the next few months.  \n\nSimilarly, I believe TSLA will have no choice but to correct downward once the offering price for the shares is announced.  Typically offering prices are at a discount to market value.  This is probably why market makers are pumping this share value up right now- so that fewer shares are required to be sold to reach the dollar amount needed and less dilution to current shareholders. \n\nWhat really matters is the convertible debt.  This has higher priority to shares in the event of bankruptcy (something Jason Wheeler, ex TSLA CFO, hinted at just a month ago).  This debt is secured using stock and the conversion rate has yet to be revealed.  Also, these notes are protected. Per the prospectus if TSLA stock valuation ever drops to an uncomfortable level Musk must sell shares in order to pay the debt.  While this may not be an immediate concern, it does guarantee that any major event that pushes Tesla shares down under $160 will windfall into an uncontrolled down spin. \n\nSome are currently arguing that by only raising a small amount of capital Tesla mgmt was able to avoid diluting shareholders as much as previously thought.  While this is true in the very short term, the fact that the company will need to dip into markets again later this year shows that this was merely a gimmick to avoid a share selloff.  \n\nThis company is uncomfortably divorced from fundamentals and with each delay they lose more and more of their \"first to market\" lead in most of their businesses.  EVs from various suppliers are multiplying with release dates 2018-2020.  VW is investing in a supercharger network (guess what, they can not only afford it but have mapped out a detailed execution plan), and what with the new Intel purchase of MBLY there's yet another competitor in the self-driving space.  Solar shingles are cool, but US solar purchases declines as a whole last year and according to TSLA 10k SCTY isn't really bringing in the bacon.  Lithium battery competition will continue to grow and once a more efficient battery is produced (and they're in the works) then the Gigafactory will need to be retrofitted to be able to produce the new technology.  \n\nI am short common, so I apologize if this information sounds bias, but with the cyclic nature of the auto industry and the new administration attacking the EPA combined with this disconnect from basic financial fundamentals supports a short position (among other reasons).

{"title": "Why you should buy Yirendai LTD calls", "selftext": "Yirendai (YRD) is a Chinese consumer finance marketplace. They are a P2P lending service that is currently KILLING it. Their net income went from $-4.5 m to $43.8 m in 2015. They beat expected earnings by 750% in 2015. Their balance sheet is looking good as well-- a healthy ratio of assets to liabilities.\n\nWith a track record of growth and an above-industry return on equity and assets, I don't know how YRD is only trading at a 13.9 P/E ratio. It's honestly a great value stock for you dirty value investors, and has a large enough market cap (1.67 b) that it's unlikely to just go up in flames. There's also nothing indicating that the Chinese lending market is struggling. \n\nThe reason I recommend calls is because they report FY 2016 earnings after hours tomorrow. Despite that, IV is unusually low, which makes buying options less risky, and I expect them to thoroughly smash earnings. \n\nI don't know why I bothered to type out all that for you tards, so here it is in plain English: YIRENDAI IS CHINESE AMD\n", "id": "5zg60g", "created_utc": 1489538176.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Put your money where your mouth is.
