I see a pullback to $260-$275 if they misses or only meet earnings expectations.\n\nWall street is expecting almost 50% quarter over quarter revenue growth. \nThey already reported record quarterly delivers (~25k deliveries, ~13.5k Model S, ~11.5k Model X). This is a 69% increase over q1 of 2016. \n\nSo given that this is positive news, I still see a pullback on Thursday and Friday. They are sitting at all time highs for the life of the company. That's a 24.6% increase over the past 3 months and 19.3% above the average price target that analysts have given them. They are priced for perfection at the moment and get this; this is  the first quarter where operations from their acquisition of Solar City will be on the balance sheet. Solar City was ridiculously not profitable when Tesla bought it and took it off the market. Unless serious improvements have been made on the Solar City side of the business it will drag down the rest of the numbers, including their profit margin, which currently is at -9.6%.\n\nA massive beat is expected and if they don't grossly exceed expectations, if any kinks come up in their production line or numbers, they will likely see a pullback. Even if they do beat moderately they will likely see a pullback. \n\nOver the past year they have missed earnings expectations 3 out of 4 times with an average pullback of 16.6%.

{"title": "Top 3 stocks to buy that growing really fast", "selftext": "Momentum significant increases are one of the main profit generators for short term traders. Under this circumstances, the primary task is to find the fastest growing stocks and predict the persistence of this trend. \n\nOne of the stocks that is susceptible to sudden fluctuations, especially temporary growth, is Twitter (NYSE: TWTR). The underlying cause is the constantly varying number of monthly active users, especially their effort to attract the passive Twitter users, which can be felt by the increasing rate of daily users which is now 11%.\n\nAnother one that is thought to soar in the immediate future is Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS). The reason why the current situation is favourable for Goldman is Trump's intention to reduce regulations and taxes for this sector. \n\nAs for biotech and pharmaceutical, an outstanding stock in terms of momentary performance is Pfizer (PFE). First of all, many of their medications aren't recent releases or drugs oriented on a narrow target market. What makes Pfizer a stock with good fundamentals is the considerable number of frequently used drugs for all the categories of patients, including Lyrica, Viagra, Lipitor, Celebrex. On top of that, most of the fluctuations are caused by new launches especially against ontological complications. \n\nSome other similar stocks are Verizon Communications, Intel Corp and Cisco. \n\nWhat are your top 3 fastest growing stocks?", "id": "68bjij", "created_utc": 1493497994.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Amazon, Shopify and Mazor robotics ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Amazon - no.
