They produce battery, solar cells etc as well. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "And what are their profit margins on those businesses?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That's actually a question nobody can really answer right now, due to the SolarCity merger being in progress. Previous quarterly results from Tesla don't contain all of their business in those areas. Not to mention that a lot of what they bought from SolarCity comes in a fairly nontraditional package - namely, leased solar installations. Those don't actually show up with a profit return until around 7-8 years after installation. Which, incidentally, is why SolarCity was reporting so low and valued so low in the first place. Tesla made a pretty smart move to snatch it up for cheap in its 10th year of operation, now that an increasingly larger amount of leases will become profitable as time goes on.\n\nAll in all, you're probably right to be cautious - after all, nobody can deny that Tesla's revenue from non-automotive business is largely speculation at this point, with little to no past data to rely on. But at the same time, try not to be cautious to the point of dismissal. As the saying goes on the stock market: past performance is no indicator for future performance. And when you look beyond balance sheets, you will notice that Tesla is increasing its efforts in the energy sector at a staggering pace right now. Just look at what kinds of large scale battery installations they've signed or completed in the recent months. Or the way they're aggressively moving away from SolarCity's lease model towards direct sales, which generate instant revenue. The way their Powerpack and Powerwall products are literally selling faster than they can produce them, even factoring in an ongoing production ramp at a factory that's growing in size on a monthly basis and is expecting to hire thousands of additional workers this year alone. The fact that less than three months ago, they started manufacturing a new kind of battery cell that beats their previous cell in every performance metric. And, not to mention the fact that they are less than one month away from launching a highly expected new product - a roofing material that's claimed to include solar cells at the same price point as comparable traditional roofing that doesn't have them, while simultaneously being more sturdy too. (No idea if they can deliver on those promises, but historically every Tesla product has matched what was promised relatively well.)\n\nThese are all things you can verify yourself with the help of a search engine. And because of these things, people are valuing Tesla very highly right now. It would definitely be more prudent to actually wait to see the business results of these efforts on a balance sheet, but there's a certain feel of momentum to the company's actions, and many investors translate that into a feeling of momentum in regards to the stock and want to get in early, which results in a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The question now is how far Tesla can ride that momentum. If it turns out that all those flashy moves don't result in significant revenue growth, the stock will turn out to be overvalued. If on the other hand we see a sharp spike in revenue growth from the non-automotive sector over the course of this year, the valuation may well be justified, and the stock will maintain its level (or grow further as investors expect even more Musk Magic(tm)).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3375559449195862}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lol, keep valuing Tesla based on how many cars it sells and let me know how that works out for you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It'll work out fine, because I short them and have done pretty well \ud83d\ude04.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "lol.. clearly.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.015114549547433853}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3296343684196472}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2660443186759949}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16292376816272736}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7953673601150513}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7953673601150513}], "tickers": ["tsla"]}
