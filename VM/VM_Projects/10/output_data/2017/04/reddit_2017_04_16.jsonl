{"title": "Shorting the weed ETF (TSX: HMMJ)?", "selftext": "Hey everyone, tried to make this post in r/weedstocks but my account is too young.\n\nSo it seems the consensus on weed stocks is that we are either in or will be in a big speculative bubble during the whole legalization process. In order to play it safe, many investors are turning to the new index ETF (TSX: HMMJ) to spread their risk. But if were in a bubble, wouldnt it make more sense to short the ETF since it reflects the index as a whole, and even though some companies will survive the bubble the majority will crash? Wondering about your thoughts on this, personally im too scared of the unlimited losses possible with shorting to actually do it lol, but this seems like a classic \"everyones looking at this the wrong way\" investment.", "id": "65mkvt", "created_utc": 1492304656.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Until you can value whether or not an asset is over or undervalued, you cant really go long OR short.  \n  \nLearn analysis.  \n  \nAlso, a bubble means something being priced far above its intrinsic value, relative to its cash flows; so when you look that some of these companies could be trading around 5-10x FCF in the first year, before industry growth....", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Watch the underlying index and know the quarterly rebalancing dates.
