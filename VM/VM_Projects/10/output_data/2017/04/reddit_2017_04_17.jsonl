Awesome work - going to go and look at your other videos :) \n\nCouple things:\n1) International streaming turning a profit. I think you're being optimistic here. While it does show that across current markets they're turning a profit, you don't talk about which markets they're seeing that profit in. Point is, we don't know where the expanse in those channels lie and if there is potential for them to go back in the red due to more effort required to capture the market. \n2) Chinese growth will be difficult if not impossible. The Chinese market is a huge honey pot that kills startups. The market doesn't accept foreign owned entities well and very few have succeeded against the Chinese clones. The other massive opportunity - the Indian market is interesting, but international music streaming services there haven't done that well - I'm not sure if there are parallels to be drawn from that\n3) the $25 subscription is unlikely. I think the analyst was more discussing a bigger library of shows beyond Netflix content. Netflix content for the most part is already accessible across multiple countries. And I don't think a a subscriber is ready to pay a premium for just Netflix content. At that point, they'd be the most expensive network - HBO memberships are even less\n\nStill think the stock is a big buy.

So\nwe are seeing some lumpiness in the quarters, depending on when we launch certain content, but the big picture is remarkably steady, and so we\nhave a huge quarter like Q4. This quarter, it is a little bit less, and so think of it, really, as this big adoption of Internet TV. It has been somewhat\ninfluenced by the content in the short-term, and then you asked about the international expansion, which has been remarkably steady. Again, if\nyou do not look at it by the quarter, but you look at it by the year, what we have seen in Latin America, steady growth; Europe as a whole, has been\nreally picking up momentum for us; and Asia, we are just getting started.\n\nSo it looks like Europe as a whole has started to pick up momentum!

The reason music streaming services haven't done so well there is because 1.) Nobody wants to pay for music. I would venture to say that 95% of the music is pirated and saved as mp3 files in devices. 2.) Mobile data is still expensive because the carriers want to continue squeezing more and more money. Prepaid is still the dominant form of mobile connections where a user would pay X to get Y amount of data. In this scenario most users would rather pay the least amount of money and just pirate/torrent their music rather than pay more for data and pay for music streaming as well.\n\nVideo streaming is however picking up because wired internet is slowly getting cheaper (higher data caps) as well as smart TVs  becoming common.
