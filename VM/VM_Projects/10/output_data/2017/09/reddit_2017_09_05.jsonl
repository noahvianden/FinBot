{"title": "DD: Short Reinsurers", "selftext": "My rationale is that most people are going to be looking at the typical primary insurers (AIG, Zurich, XL, CNA...etc) which is a played out strategy at this point post-harvey. Fewer investors are going to be looking at the reinsurers so there may still be time to short these as the true implications and total losses have not been valued yet so any move in pricing is speculative and not data driven. \n\nRe: Irma: Florida property is notoriously difficult to insure due to low elevations and flooding and geological makeup (specifically sinkholes). As such, towers (or layered insurance) tend to be higher as losses are more frequently catastrophic. So with that in mind these tranches of risk are often pooled in what are called catastrophe bonds which are zero-sum in many cases. Meaning if a loss trigger the payout then the reinsurer losses all associated premium. \n\nRounding out the reinsurance perspective, I believe their solvency requirements (with respects to US IFSF (US) and Solvency II (UK)) differ from primary insurers who hold \"first dollar\" coverage which means that their available cash on hand to pay claims is less, and therefore the economic impact to these institutions should be greater.
