As the chart from 2011 proves, given how much higher vol was in 2011 but how much lower XIV is than 2011 levels.\n\nThe way these ETFs rebalance makes the PATH of volatility EXTREMELY important. They implicitly double down. This means as vol goes down, your shorting even more, and as vol spikes up, you get short much less. They buy high, and sell low. Works when the market is TRENDING. Is HORRIBLE when the market is not.\n\nThis makes it more suited for short term trading imo where it approximates a short vix position more accurately.\n\nTLDR: XIV is more suited for short term trading given the rebalancing mechanism.
