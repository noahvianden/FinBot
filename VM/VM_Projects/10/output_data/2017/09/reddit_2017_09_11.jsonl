{"title": "Time to look at Twitter?? [DD Inside]", "selftext": "[My current stake](http://imgur.com/a/x625P) - 101 Calls of October 20, $19 Strikes\n, began a position around 15.9 a couple weeks ago in October 20, $15 strikes, sold out with a profit about a week ago, entered into a new position subsequently after in September 29, $17 calls, sold out at a minor profit early last week and entered what you see above. I am hoping to leave this position this week at a profit and possibly buy the stock outright, or december calls.\n__________________________________________\n**TL/DR:**\n\nTwitter Stock is up more than 10% in the last month. I believe Twitter has strength moving forward due to its live streaming service expanding immensely Quarter over Quarter, during a time when much of Wall Street is paying attention to cord cutting and direct to consumer entertainment. \n______________________________________________\n**Summary:**\n\nI believe Twitter's stock price is currently in a gap fill to the upside following its Q2 earnings mega drop from approximately $20 pre earnings, to a low of 15.75 post Q2 earnings. In the past month, twitter has gone up 10%. Currently sitting at $17.45. Most of this action has come in the past 2 weeks with immense buying power.\n\n**For this analysis, all of my sources will be numbered and hyperlinked**\n\nMy reasoning for this is \u2013\n\nA)\t**Twitter Live Streaming** \n\nAlthough earnings saw a large drop in Twitters PPS, their relatively new live streaming has grown quarter over quarter. \n\nB)\t**External Factors**\n\nThe past month has exploded with commentary surrounding live streaming / direct to consumer / cable cord cutting, etc. (Netflix, Disney,  HBO, Comcast, etc)\n\nC)\t**Buyout Rumors**\n\nAnd last but not least, buyout \u201crumors\u201d have been surfacing(albeit unsubstantial). \n_____________________________________________\n**DD:**\n\nA)\t**Twitter Live Streaming** \n\nIn case any of you are unfamiliar with what Twitter Live is, Twitter Live allows Twitter to partner up with other companies / organizations to live stream their content directly on twitter. Organizations that have partnered with Twitter to stream their content include, but are not limited to, Bloomberg, WNBA, and MTC. MTC aka dreamhack and ESL for all things esports related. \n\nMTC CEO Marcus Lindmark sums up the value of Twitter live pretty well in my opinion. [1]( https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/twitter-will-live-stream-1500-hours-of-esports-including-original-content/)\n\u201cThis will be a shortcut for fans, as they can both watch and engage on the platform at the same time\u201d \u2013 Marcus Lindmark\n\nThis is what makes Twitter such an interesting prospect for all sports related content. Twitter is already the go to place to talk about sports, and its positioning to be the place to watch the sports as well.\n\nTwitters live streaming service has been expanding quarter over quarter. Here is a spreadsheet [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/vf6mf) highlighting their live services growth over the past few quarters. [2]( https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/09/twitter-claims-31-million-unique-viewers-across-600-hours-of-live-premium-video-in-q4-2016/)[3](https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/26/twitter-800-hours-of-live-premium-video-was-viewed-by-45-million-viewers-in-q1-2017-up-by-31/)[4]( https://investorplace.com/2017/08/twitter-inc-twtr-stock-needs-hero/#.WbYj4LKGOpo)\n\nSo what does this all mean? Twitter Live is growing at rocket propulsion levels. More and more Companies are partnering with Twitter to stream their content directly to Twitter users.\n\nB) **External Factors:**\n\n**\u201cMore people than ever are cutting the cord and ditching cable and satellite TV subscriptions\u201d**[5, Newsweek Article Dated 8/9/2017]( http://www.newsweek.com/cable-tv-streaming-subscriptions-decline-fastest-rate-hbo-comcast-dish-network-648650)\n\nWallstreet is heads over heels about direct to consumer / cord cutting prospects at the moment. In the past 3 months, Netflix stock has gone crazy, while companies like Comcast and Disney(ESPN), who attest a large amount of their revenues to customer cable subscriptions, have flatlined or declined.\n\nThis past Thursday, Comcast announced that the company expects to lose approximately 100,000-150,000 cable subscribers. [6]( https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/07/comcast-shares-down-on-subscriber-loss-news.html)\n\nSo what happened to the stock? It plunged 7%. Other Cable companies like Fox and CBS both dropped more than 2% as well. [7]( https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/07/disney-shares-drop-2-point-9-percent-as-iger-talks-earnings-guidance.html)\n\nDisney, who has been struggling with its subscriber base for ESPN, dropped 5% or so on the same day, as it announced that it expected approximately the same EPS as 2016 for 2017. [8](http://nypost.com/2017/09/07/disney-shares-tumble-as-ceo-warns-earnings-wont-rise/)\n\nC) **Buyout Rumors:**\n\nThere have been 2 buyout \u201crumors\u201d that I am aware of since I have been following twitter the past month following earnings. Each of these \u201crumors\u201d seemed to affect the stock price.\n\nThe first came from Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino, who tweeted, on August 23, 2017, \u201cBanker chatter abt $dis buying $twtr I\u2019m dubious but I know smart people who say it makes sense from an over the top cord cutting standpoint.\u201d [9](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/900411680986943492) \n\nThis rumor moved the stock price approximately 1%.\n\nThe second buyout rumor (I can hardly even call either of these rumors \u201crumors\u201d, but twitter moved up more then 3% on Thursday / Friday) came this past Thursday, as BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said in a call in response to Disneys EPS announcement that \u201cDisney needs to own Twitter to keep ahead of where sports viewing is headed. [10](http://www.barrons.com/articles/twitter-disney-needs-to-own-them-says-btig-1504801295)\n\nWith that said, this section is more speculative and less fact based then the first 2 sections, I weigh the first 2 sections much more heavily then hoping twitter gets bought out.\n\n_________________________________________\n**Devils Advocate Thoughts:**\n\n**A)**\tMAU\u2019s (Monthly Average Users) in the past year + has essentially plateaued, hence why the stock price has been in this specific range the past 2 years. Twitter has moved its efforts to DAU\u2019s (Daily average users) with services such as live for this reason in my opinion.\n\n**B)**\tThe rally in the past month could be attested to people hoping for a buyout. We saw this last year when actual buyout rumors came out and the price surged from approx. 17 to 25. BUT, twitter has been surging after the Earnings drop, and before any talk of Twitter needing to be bought out. The buyout talk has definitely helped buoy the price as explained above though.\n\n**C)**\tThe surge since the earnings drop could be attested to the fact that the drop might have been simply an overreaction?\n\n**D)**\tCompetition for Twitter($12b company)\u2013 Other social media companies like Facebook ($500b company) and Snap inc.
