Historically, these phones have been proven to be a CASH COW for $AAPL. Apple holds ~$250b in cash overseas, yes, but they've been clear - they're not bringing it back. They just refinanced debt (~$6b) for share buybacks. That being said, back to my original point, the issues are not going away until reports emerge that either confirm or assuage investor concern. Recent reports this weekend suggest empty lines in China where $AAPL just spent a lot of money trying to break into. Additionally, India escaped them too. These are NOT good signs. Too many people are complacent with their old phones and don't want to upgrade. The accessories they created for the iPhone don't function either. Heard of this bitch called $BBRY?
