{"title": "VIX, VIX contract pricing, and /VX.", "selftext": "The VIX is the CBOE market volatility index, which measures the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index for a 30-day period (expressed as an annualized percentage). For example, a VIX of 15 represents an implied move of 15% in the S&P 500 over the next year. \n\nThis product is commonly referred to as the fear gauge or fear index. This is a cash settled product, meaning that at expiration no shares are called away or put to us, the options simply settle to cash. VIX option prices are derived from /VX prices. The VIX has a non-standard expiration that expires on Wednesday, so the last day to trade it is on Tuesday. \n\nOne of the most important aspects to know about the VIX is that front and back month options do not have a linear mathematical relationship. For example, calendar spreads are non-linear, so our back month option does not necessarily cover our short front month option. \n\n(from TastyTrade)\n\nhttps://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-vix-futures\n", "id": "6yhiuy", "created_utc": 1504722785.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Fucking finally.
