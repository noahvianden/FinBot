{"title": "questions on the Monster VIX position", "selftext": "From Business Insider:\n\n*To fund it, the investor sold 262,000 VIX puts expiring in October, with a strike price of 12. The trader then used those proceeds to buy a VIX 1\u00d72 call spread, which involves buying 262,000 October contracts with a strike price of 15 and selling 524,000 October contracts with a strike price of 25. For reference, bullish call spreads are used when a moderate rise in the underlying asset is expected. Traders buy call options at a specific strike price while selling the same number of calls of the same asset and expiration date at a higher strike. In a perfect scenario, where the VIX hits but doesn\u2019t exceed 25 before October expiration, the trader would see a whopping $262 million payout. It is possible for the VIX to spike too much. If it increased beyond 35.2, the investor would start to lose money since they used a call spread, even though they got the direction of the trade correct. For context, VIX October futures are trading at 13.6, while the spot index closed at 9.62 on Thursday. All data is from Bloomberg and was reviewed by a person familiar with the trade.*\n\nnoko:\n\nWho takes the other side of this trade? I was looking at the chain and the expiries on either side have less than a tenth as much open interest. It would seem as though the market maker is taking an enormous counter position, probably enough to break many firms. Are MMs bound to fill this if their price is hit?\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about a few tens of contracts, I have confidence the ebb and flow covers the risk. Here, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nMore generally, if there\u2019s no open interest in an expiry, is the MM always bound to filling the order at the right price. Usually, pricing tails out into the single digits of delta for a lot of underlyings. How does this work?\n\nI\u2019ve been watching this position and note substantial piling in. I\u2019m looking at the position with the market closed, but it isn\u2019t any tighter than any of the expiries. The IV is in line with the surrounding expiries as well. I would expect that, but somehow it seems like this thing would punch a hole in the fabric.\nAny other insight into a position like this?\n\nnoko\n", "id": "6q19po", "created_utc": 1501213256.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "The market is capable of taking on a ton of size.

I added two new columns as requested (U@O and U@C, underlying at open and underlying at close, respectively). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Screenshot of sheets](http://i.imgur.com/kTAbsSk.png)\n\n[TD transactions](http://i.imgur.com/Lu5yWWv.png)\n\n[Google sheets version with notes etc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1skqT4JuI6_3noRHj4Krw8A3ygkkjub1KNaHIcIeRs2w/edit#gid=123210005)\n\n[Last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6oqomf/active_weekly_options_credit_spreads_3103/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Review**\n\nLet's be real I got very lucky this week. My huge SPX win at the start of the week was supposed to be about a $2,000 loss 20 minutes away from close, but the dip saved me.\n\nFor MCD, I tried playing credit put spread selling after a big beat, but my gut told me to get out and it turned out for the better... but I took a loss there. I'm mostly used to tech stocks and indicies as it shows on the sheet, so that may be another reason why I didn't feel very confident here.\n\nBoth of the \"longer\", much higher days to expiration plays this week, I exited really really early at a loss. Idk, I feel like I'm not just patient enough and I'm still trying get a good feel for those. I'll get it eventually. It might also be just the overall everyone-saying-the-market-is-gonna-crash-everyday atmosphere that makes me uneasy about longer dated plays. \n\nI took pretty good advantage of the dip on Thursday by selling bear call spreads on NVDA and NFLX. NFLX I was already pretty confident wouldn't shoot through the rest of the week so I opened that up before the huge dip, but with NVDA I rode it down the dip. \n\nFor AMZN earnings, I had a feeling that the dip would be eaten up with the bulk of the sentiment going around. So very near open I sold a credit put spread below the 1000 strike and closed it out at around 60-70% profit since it wasn't very long after it hit that point, and I didn't want to get bamboozled by another tech bloodshed.\n\nAnyway, I feel like this week should realistically be more like +$0 or -$1,000 because of that wild luck on Monday, so taking these numbers with a grain of salt. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Stats**\n\n7/10-7/14: 19 trades, +$2,275\n\n7/17-7/21: 11 trades, +$3,103\n\n7/24-7/28: 16 trades, +$4,362\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Note on commissions & account**\n\nSince a lot of people have asked, I'm getting $4.95 flat and 50c per contract from TDA, negotiated. If the numbers don't add up slightly, it might mean that I legged into a trade, causing a bit higher commission. \n\nThis account (margin account) started at around ~$50K, with around $40K of it long in VTI/BND.\n", "id": "6q6ipe", "created_utc": 1501273708.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like the capped profit that comes with spreads is what really puts people off, but I actually like having capped profits because it makes it way easier emotionally to take profits early and be able to exit without getting greedy.
