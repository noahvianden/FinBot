{"title": "Semiconductors in home devices", "selftext": "Reading about AAPL and their upcoming HomePod product got me thinking about the parts that will be going into those and competitor products. So we've already got Amazon Echo/Alexa, Google home, and probably some others out there.  Apple brings the Apple fans that seem to make these things grow in popularity. This product line seems in its early stages, so I don't know how much is priced in already. These aren't premium priced products yet, so I'm guessing chip suppliers for the home devices aren't making the margin they would on other chips, processors, etc.., but there still has to be meaningful growth for some semi sector companies as these items ramp up. \n\nGoogle home uses the same parts as chromecast. Looks like MRVL is a supplier along with ARM(which appears to be owned by SoftBank Group). TXN, QCOM, Samsung, & SNDK supply Amazon echo. I haven't found anything useful on Apple's Homepod yet.\n\n I listened in on the last ER call for MRVL but I can't recall if they believed Google Home was a growth area for them, but maybe the Apple Homepod brings the digital home assistant to mainstream like smart phones are now. Maybe a product life span even less than a smart phone so it's replaced annually or bi-annually by the average consumer. With Apple bringing the apple fans into the fold with these home devices, can we expect a product surge in this area that will have a signif meaningful impact on the chip suppliers' top and bottom line?\n\n\n\nOn mobile so formatting may suck.\n\n", "id": "6oqvfy", "created_utc": 1500671347.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 9, "comments": [{"body": "Soxl?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02631807141005993}, {"body": "$FORM", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.003439946100115776}, {"body": "Avgo do this at all or you look at them at all?\n\nI believe they do cable boxes and modems so home necessities through 3rd party is one of their markets.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just tried to find what was in the 3 devices that I think will be the big players in this market.
