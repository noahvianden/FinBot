First no one knows when a new report will be listed, second it's hard to know how a stock will react or the degree in which it will react. Algos can surely react faster than any human trader and there's tons of paid services that agregate analyst reports and price targets (Bloomberg, Reuters, Factset, Capital IQ) any investment firm worth their weight pays for these services. Goldman reasearch is not just for the uber wealthy it's information is used by a myriad of corporations. Typically people sell a stock when they hear a well know bank releases a price target that is below current trading value. In my opinion a lot of this has to do with \"herd mentality\" rather than a true understanding or agreement with an analysts consensus. The real number to track in my opinion is what the consensus price target (all analyst) have in relation to the current trading price.
