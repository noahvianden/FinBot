Lately I've been thinking of what would be a sell price with the thought that the shares will dip hard in the near future.\n\nIt seems every couple years AAPL goes through this cycle.  Stock reaches all time high.  Then 6-9 months later it drops 30-40%.  The last 2 times this has happenned after a big iPhone release.\n\n**In 2012 the stock hit an All time high of $100. Then in 2013 it tanked to $55**\n\n**In 2015 the stock hit an All time high of $133. Then in 2016 it tanked to $90**\n\nCould we see the same thing in 2017/2018?  Could AAPL hit $180 and then drop massively to $120 level?\n\nThere are couple things that may prevent this massive drop:\n\n1. Wall Street trusts Tim Cook now.  He has proven his worth. Wall Street did not really trust Tim Cook to take over Jobs in 2012.\n\n2. Apple services.  Wall Street loves services and hates hardware.  If services become a bigger and bigger part of the company (Apple services is already bigger than Facebook and Netflix combined) then Wall Street won't be as scared if the latest iPhone isn't a blockbuster.  In 2016 the iPhone 6s was not as big as Wall Street wanted (along with China weakness) and the stock tanked 30%.\n\n**My plan is to sell 50% of my shares when the stock reaches $180 this year or early 2018.
