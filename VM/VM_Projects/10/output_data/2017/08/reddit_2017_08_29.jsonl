{"title": "Great strategy for Stocks you want to hold for Long Term?", "selftext": "Lets say you own AAPL which you are planing to hold for very long term. I'm talking 5+ years or longer.  So you have no intention of selling.\n\nWhat if you sell covered calls about 5-10% out of the money that expires in about 3 months?  AAPL is about $162 and you can sell Nov $170 Calls for about $4.35. Three things can happen:\n\n1. Stock goes down. You get to keep a nice $4.35 premium. That's about a 10% annualized return.\n\n2. Stock goes up but not beyond $174.  You still make the entire premium as long as the stock is below $170.  Still make some profit below $174.\n\n3. Stock explodes upward. Maybe $180+.  This is where the strategy happens. You buy back those $170 Calls right before they expire and then sell Calls at a higher strike 2 or 3 months in the future.\n\nSo basically you will be collecting Call premiums and time value all the time you hold the stock.  And you were willing to hold the stock anyway.  As long as the stock does not go up in a straight line for years you should be able to use time value to break even on your calls eventually. And that's the worse case. More than likely the stock will have ups and downs and you will be able to make about 10% annualized selling/buying calls throughout the year.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n", "id": "6wrrfa", "created_utc": 1504018800.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "The devil will be in the details.\n\n> What if you sell covered calls **about** 5-10%\n\nNo, fuck that.

And how do I pick the expiration date?\n\n> You buy back those $170 calls right before they expire\n\nAnd that could wipe out your previous gains, couldn't it?\n\nPlus, you have to use proper probabilistic methods to price your results: You make 10% annualized return in case 1 and 2, but you'd take a loss in case 3. How likely is case 3? Both now and in the future? That will lower your expected annualized return from 10% to something lower. How much lower? Depends...\n\nIf it was this easy to make money selling covered calls, big institutions would be doing it up to the point where it's not worth it any more.\n\nAnyway, this strategy is simple enough that if you *really* want to pitch it (to us? to yourself?) you could probably work out how to run a proper backtest on a platform like Quantopian.

By November expiration the shares are now worth $180. So instead of getting my shares called away I buy back the $170 Calls I sold for $10.00\n\n3.

Then you are buying back deep in the money calls for what's essentially the spread between current share price and strike price. To avoid that loss, you will now have to somehow sell an out-the-money option with a pretty large premium.\n\nHonestly... this reminds me of discussions I'd have on physics forums where someone comes up with a genius idea for a perpetuum mobile.

But I would have held Apple anyway.\n\nI just think this is a good way to make profit for holding a stock for a long time.\n\nAnother options is to sell calls way out of the money.  The return will be less, but the chances of the options expiring OTM is very high. For example I could sell Sept18 $200 strike for $5.
