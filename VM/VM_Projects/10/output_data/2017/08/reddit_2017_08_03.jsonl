TTD currently makes 20% (take rate) for all gross spend on their platform. I'm not sure that 20% is sustainable in the long term, no matter how much value the TTD platform provides. \n\nI personally don't have any experience with the industry or the platform. Is the platform scalable to the extent that ad agencies can be completely removed from the process, so that ad buyers can use the platform on their own? I know there was a post on here 3 months ago discussing that TTD is in the pockets of the ad agencies, and that a lot of TTD's business comes from ad agency recommendations. As such, TTD could be severely impacted if companies realize that ad agencies aren't providing enough value to the equation.\n\nAnother point, I'm sure it won't affect TTD earnings too much, but an article came out 2 weeks ago that P&G (a customer that JUST started using TTD's platform) is reducing digital ad buying by $100m. One hopes that's because they're banking on programmatic ad buying more efficiently use their ad spend, but that's definitely not a guarantee.\n\nThat being said, I agree with all your points, and I think it's undervalued, even at its current price. The reason I think that investors are weary to properly value TTD is because of the FUEL and RUBI shitshows. FWIW, I don't think its reasonable to anticipate a buyout from Google or Facebook, as that instantly alienates clients on their platform. If a sell-side ad company like Facebook bought TTD, and suddenly gave their own ads priority in TTD's inventory, clients would immediately jump ship due to conflict of interest.
