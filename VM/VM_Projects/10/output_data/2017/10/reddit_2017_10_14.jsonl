{"title": "Hedging Black Swan Event on Income Trades", "selftext": "Hi /r/options, \n\nLike everyone here who are income traders, I'm very happy for the Nov. 2016 (10% SPX in 2 weeks) and Sept 2017 market meltup (10% RUT in 3 weeks), \n\nFrom this xp, I learned a lot on how to manage a delta-neutral book and turned a profit in both meltup cases while maintaining structure that could withstand a -3% daily drops; \n\nI'm hoping that this bull market and low vol environment continues, \n\nHowever I am worried about Black-Swan event where the combination of say a 6% intra-day drop (1 in 5 year event) and extreme spike on VIX from 9's to say 30's will incur catastrophic result on my options portfolio, \n\nI'm curious how you guys are hedging against Black-Swan events; buying OTM leaps SPX puts, VIX calls and financing them by selling something else? Or using some other instrument; or no hedging at all, but hedging by position sizing? \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n ", "id": "76dvwd", "created_utc": 1508006213.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Position sizing is your best bet.\n\nNot that you can really protect from the tail risk, just minimize the pain. If you have immediate access to the platform and have futures, maybe you can catch a falling knife and get short delta exposure in bulk. But normally it's about having a directional opinion and setting up the portfolio for it. Nothing protects from black swan better than static short delta, but it also difficult to keep it in check and rebalance all the time.\n\nYou see the trend?

Keeping delta neutral protects against small changes in the price of the underlying, so if you're worried about larger changes start looking at gamma (and for even larger changes, go to the third order, and etc.). Works the same way for volatility. Small changes in the volatility can be hedged away by staying vega neutral, and for larger changes in vol you need higher order greeks (ex. vomma). \n\nGranted, this can very quickly get expensive if you're retail trading.
