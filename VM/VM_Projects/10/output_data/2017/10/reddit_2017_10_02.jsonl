The defense industry is huge (look at the defense budget) and seen as very essential, especially in a post-9/11 world. Both Democrats and certainly Republicans won't mess with it. Moreover, American allies such as Japan, South Korea, etc. rely on their products as well. For example, look at [LMT's THAAD.](http://www.investors.com/news/south-korea-back-plans-to-deploy-thaad-early-after-failed-north-korea-missile-test/)\n2. It's very much political. These defense contractors (especially the huge ones such as LMT and RTN) employ many thousands of people. Moreover, they are spread all over the country rather than focused on one or a few specific areas. Therefore, politicians don't want to risk losing votes due to jobs loss for a wide array of politicians if contracts are cut or not granted. That's why you get [stuff like this.](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/28/pentagon-tells-congress-to-stop-buying-equipment-it-doesnt-need.html)  Don't forget that they're also in the [pockets of politicians and their campaigns.](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?Ind=D) \n3. It's a constantly innovating sector and these companies keep on making new, high-tech products. Right now you might buy Lockheed Martin for the F-35, and hold onto it for decades as you see it come out with fighter aircraft with lasers, that go to space, etc. The equipment of today will inevitably be replaced with something in the future.
