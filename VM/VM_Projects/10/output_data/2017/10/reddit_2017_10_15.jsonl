{"title": "Could someone kindly explain to me why Amazon's share price is more than 6 times Apple's share price?", "selftext": "I am sorry for asking what is probably a very newbie question, I promise that I have looked for answers. It seems confusing to me because Apple as a company is nearly twice as valuable. Any explanation would be greatly appreciated. ", "id": "76jduw", "created_utc": 1508079472.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "I'm not sure why people are down-voting your post. It strikes me as a sincere question, so I'll try and give you a somewhat in-depth answer.\n\n\nShare price is not how the value of a company is measured. That role belongs to market capitalization (often shortened to \"mkt cap\").\n\n    Market capitalization = [Share price] x [Shares outstanding]\n\n\n**Market capitalization** has many definitions, but the most practical one (and also unanimously accepted pretty much everywhere) is that it is the value the market (i.e. investors, traders and other participants) puts on a company. It is essentially the price a buyer will pay in order to purchase the entirety of the company; although in many real cases, the buyer typically ends up paying a premium on top that price.\n\n\n**Shares outstanding** is the total number of shares a company has. The number changes as a company issues more shares, or as they retire previously issued shares. In other words, shares outstanding is the sum of all shares that have ever been issued minus all shares that have been retired.\n\n\n**Stock split**: When a company splits their shares, the shares outstanding change as well, but the market cap typically stays the same (if nothing else about the company changes) because the worth and value of the company has not changed. But since the number of shares went up and the market cap has to stay the same, then the price per share (a.k.a the stock price) therefore drops so that the formula for market cap stays true. \n\n\n*Stock split example*: in a 1-for-2 stock split, the company converts each share into two shares. Essentially they issue an extra share for each one that is already active. So if you owned 100 shares of the company, after the stock split, you would own 200. The new stock price, in the case of a 1-for-2 stock split, will be half the price before the stock split, and the shares outstanding will be twice the number before the stock split, while the market cap remains the same. Therefore if the 100 shares owned before the split had a tag of $10 per share, then after the split you would own 200 shares with tag of $5 per share.\n\n\n**Float**: Not all the shares outstanding are necessarily listed on a stock exchange. A company can decide to list only a portion of their shares for the public to trade, and decide to keep the remaining for insiders (typically for the founders and executives). The publicly listed ones are called the floating stock (or simply \"float\"). This can lead to confusion, i.e. the float gets quoted as the shares outstanding, especially if the company is not a big name. You can actually see an example of this right now: look up the stock information for Freshii in any of your favorite online venues, and you'll likely see 25 million shares for shares outstanding, but that is actually the float (the real number is around 30 million according to their financial statements). \n\n\n**Class structure of shares and how it impacts shares outstanding**: A company may decide to structure their shares into different classes, usually in order to skew voting rights or for tax issues. The different class of shares get traded under different ticker symbols (e.g. Alphabet is listed as GOOG and GOOGL; Bombardier is listed as BBD.A and BBD.B). The classes each have their own shares outstanding, but the total shares outstanding for the company is the sum of the shares outstanding of all the different classes; and it is this total that is used in calculating market cap of the company. Also the stock price of each class tends to differ. \n\n\nTrivia: Alphabet (a.k.a Google) has three classes of shares. Two of them are listed on stock exchanges and are therefore publicly traded, but the third class is comprised of non-Floating stocks and has ten times the voting power of the other classes (and of course is owned by the founders).", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the awesome response which is very helpful. One more question that I have not really been able to find a solid answer about if you don't mind. Why would a company, particularly the monster companies like Apple, Google etc. still have any public shares? Surely they don't need the extra money right? Why wouldn't they just but them all back or retire them and go 100% private. Last question from me (for today) and again, I greatly appreciate your time to help a newbie!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> Last question from me (for today) and again, I greatly appreciate your time to help a newbie!\n\n\nDon't sweat it. I love discussing about financial markets.\n\n\n> Why would a company, particularly the monster companies like Apple, Google etc. still have any public shares? Surely they don't need the extra money right? Why wouldn't they just but them all back or retire them and go 100% private.\n\n\nThe biggest reason is that **it will cost Larry and Sergey too much money** to buy back Google\u2019s shares. Even if they were to somehow coerce the board of directors to allow the company to do the buying for them, then the company will have to liquidate a lot of assets to be able to buy back the shares. It will end up being a shell of its former self. Neither the company nor the founders can afford or even raise $600+ billion in cash without going broke. \n\n\nFurthermore, **the market cap (and therefore the stock price) will likely go through the roof** if the market realizes that the buyers are willing to do whatever it takes to buy back all the shares, because everyone (including myself) will suspect that the buyers have learned about something that will completely change the profitability and financial value of the company exponentially. Also, lawsuits will likely follow as opportunists will try to make even more money from the chaos. The lawsuits would go along the line of \u201cyou guys are hiding some important information that shareholders deserve to know, and therefore you\u2019re trying to execute an illegal insider-trade\u201d. All these will send the effective cost of the buyback through the roof. And oh, they can\u2019t buy up the shares secretly. The law requires insiders to file every significant transaction of shares with the SEC. You can see them for yourselves on sec.gov/edgar.\n\n\nMoreover, **there is no incentive for them to even want to ever think about such an idea**, because they already control the voting rights of the company through their 45 million Class B shares that carry super-voting powers and are not publicly listed. Each of Google\u2019s Class A  share (GOOG) gets 1 vote, Class B (not public) gets 10 votes, and Class C (GOOGL) gets zero vote. While owning less than ~~20%~~ 10% of the shares outstanding, Larry, Sergey and a handful of other executives hold about 60% of the voting power. They will have to fight among themselves or sell their Class B shares (which converts to Class A once in the public market) for them to ever lose control of the company.\n\n\nBy the way, **companies do engage in share buybacks**. It\u2019s another way they return value to shareholders; the other being via dividends. By buying back shares (usually just about 1 to 10% of shares outstanding per year as no one has the stomach to afford higher lol), the stock price of the company goes up even when the market cap doesn\u2019t change. But usually the market cap also jumps on the announcement of a buyback, since it gives the impression that the company is confident in their current and future finances to be able to do this stuff. That\u2019s a company everyone wants to own. But I\u2019ve seen price trend downward after a buyback is announced, and the culprit is usually investors getting a feel that the company is more concerned with putting up a front instead of actually fixing issues.\n\n\nFinally, **there are just too many pecks in being a publicly traded company**. But I don\u2019t have the strength to go into this topic in this writeup. But one important peck is the flexibility of buying up other companies with your shares instead of cash. Another is bragging rights that help in deals with banks and jawboning other companies. And on bragging rights, the company gets to confidently say, \"the mass of humanity in the world, after looking through our financial standing and business operation, have decided that we are worth $$$ billion.\"", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, again, thank you so much for the incredible response.

These reserves were supposed to stimulate the banking system, which at the time was under stress and arguably on the brink of total collapse. But on the flip side, the Fed had to also pay these big banks IOR (interest on reserves), and there are many reasons for this and they are not very straightforward (but one of the simpler reasons is that it gives the big banks enough incentive to not to come asking for their assets that was held by the Fed). But now, the big banks deem IOR as safer investments than getting the reserves to actual work. Essentially, the banks don't really trust the real market to give them a better return on investment.\n\n\nYellen (the Fed Chair) got grilled by Congress on this matter in February 2016.
