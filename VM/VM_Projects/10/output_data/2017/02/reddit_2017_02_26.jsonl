{"title": "Thoughts on NOK", "selftext": "What do you guys think?\n   \nNokia is my favorite stock right now for a variety of reasons.  \nThe main one is the comeback of Nokia phones. Now keep in mind that Nokia doesn't produce them. HMD Global is the one bringing them to the market. The advantage for Nokia is that they receive royalty payments and don't have any expenses. Essentially free money.   \n   \nAlso Nokia is on the forefront when it comes to 5G Networks. I think once any carrier picks up 5G it is going to take off relatively quick. Also 5G will introduce IOT, which means that it will be much more far reaching than 4G etc... Bottom line, there is a lot of money to be made, and if Nokia is the first one out there, they might just take the largest piece of the pie. Powered by Intel (hint hint)  \n   \nEagerly waiting for a Nokia 8 announcement.
