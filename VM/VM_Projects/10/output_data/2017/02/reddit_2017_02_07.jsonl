{"title": "Most common newbie questions (and mistakes)", "selftext": "These seem to be among the most common questions. If you asked one of them, that's ok. Everyone was new once. For resources, see the sidebar (if on mobile, Tastytrade, the CBOE site are two most suggested).\n\n1) Do I have to exercise my option to get my profits.\n> No, just sell the option to close the position.\n\n2) How do I trade with not much money? \n> Buying puts and calls is Level 1 authorization. To do spreads at least $2000 and a margin account is needed. In retirement accounts, only covered calls, cash secured puts, and other types of level 1 trades are permitted. At some brokers, a steady job, some experience, decent amount in assets, are needed to get higher levels of authorization. If you are going to lie in writing, that's your business, but I would not suggest that.\n\n3) I need to double my account, like within three to six months. Please tell me a low risk, easy way to do that? A variant: I found this strategy that makes 3% a week, please tell me how to continue to make this kind of money, but with no risk.\n> Biggest mistake newbies make is trading too big for their account. So while it is good to want to get started with a small account, the cliche that it takes money to make money applies. Yes, there is that one-in-a-million talent that can do it, but for average folks, doubling and quadrupling your account is an unrealistic goal. Most that try, will eventually blow up their account.\n\n4) I have this crap position, what do I do now? (illiquid options). \n> Second biggest mistake is trading illiquid options. This friction makes the probability of long term profits approach zero. For novices, I suggest no more than a 10% bid/ask spread. So for a 50 cent option, 50 cent bid, 55 cent ask. For a $2 option, $2.00 bid, $2.20 ask. Of course, narrower is better, but wider than that, and it is going to be up hill.\n\n5) I have this crazy complicated trade with like six or eight or 10 legs. It has to be good because I've covered almost every possibility.\n> Most of the time, simpler is better. I suggest focusing on the Greeks and finding an equivalent position with far fewer legs. The more legs, the more it costs to enter, to exit, and adjust. Again, long term friction is what eats away at probability of profit for the account. This is another mistake, a person struggles with simple trades and reaches for complexity. If a person can't trade simple, complex often makes things worse.\n\n6) Stale quotes, option screeners, or paper trading. \n> Stale quotes are old and no longer valid. Paper trading sometimes uses stale quotes to give their dummy fills. Option screeners often use stale quote data to filter. Paper trading also often gives fills that will not happen in live trading. While paper trading can be a useful tool to learn the basics, I suggest going to live trading with small size as soon as a person can.\n\n7) What should I do now? How do I get better?\n> Go into every trade with a plan. If you had no plan, bail out, and start a new trade with a plan. I suggest keeping a trade journal, that and go into every trade with a plan. Go over that journal, every now and again, and you'll learn. Each person needs to find a strategy that fits their personality, their temperament. What works for one person may be a terrible fit for another person.\n\n8) Backtesting. \n> We've had about nine years of bull market. It doesn't take a back test (or a genius) to determine winning strategies that worked well. Be aware that the biggest money makers in a bull market, sometimes become the biggest losers in a bear market.\n", "id": "5sm1yz", "created_utc": 1486481975.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "6) Why did my call go down in value when the stock went up?\n\n>This can happen when the implied volatility of the option drops.  It's a common occurrence after an earnings announcement but can happen anytime.  If the option is out of the money, the value will decay away leading into expiration.\n\n7) Can't I just buy a call and put and be guaranteed to make money?\n\n>If only.

It could make money, but it will lose more often.\n\n", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "This doesn't seem like a Q/A thread but just in case:  There is one question I've asked and seen asked so many times and I still have trouble understanding the answer. \n\n>How can a spread or IC have a maximum loss if the short side gets called?  \n\nI think I need a diagram or something.

Last week (when NVDA was hovering south of $110), I noted in one of the many NVDA threads that I was expecting this modest earnings beat to give NVDA a descent price bump up to the $120 range.\n\nWell . . . the stock has been hovering in the $119-120 range today, and we're still 2 days out from earnings.  No change in fundamentals or outlook, maybe a little spillover euphoria from the INTC and AMD earnings (as discussed in several other threads), but I think we can all agree there has been nothing that would justify a 10% run-up.\n\nHow high is this thing going to have to rise before Thursday's earnings release to get you NVDA bulls to dump your calls before earnings?
