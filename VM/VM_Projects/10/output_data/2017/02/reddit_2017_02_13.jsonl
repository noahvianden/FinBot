Just to be a devils advocate.\n\n*There is only the hype train. They lose money year after year to the tune of half a billion dollars. I was originally going to complain that they don't offer a dividend, but after seeing their financials it's good that they don't.They have a beta of triple the market, and if you look at them for any time span that isn't just the past year the chart itself looks awful.\n\n*I don't have NAK in my system for some reason. The only thing that bugs me with them at a quick glance is that it seems that they are promoting their stock as much if not more than their actual product. That's usually a warning sign to stay away. But really it can go either way - I just don't know anything about the company.\n\n*I'm actually liking ARTX. They have been losing money for the past couple of years, but it's been getting better. They just put up their first positive quarter. They have a Piotroski Score of 7 and aren't that volatile. Their P/E is a little high if you are interested in the value investing side of things, but I can't see anything massively wrong with the company at first glance. I would do some more digging though.\n\n*I don't have CRBP either - we typically focus on larger companies, so these small ones sometimes slip through the cracks of our data.\n\n*Why I have CBIS and not CRBP I have no idea, but whatever. The first thing I notice with CBIS is that they have a negative beta. Meaning that the correlation to the overall market is actually negative. They aren't making any money. Their sales for the past year were just $40,000 with expenses going up into the $15+ million. They have a huge whole to dig themselves out of before they see stable price growth or even profit at all.\n\n*PLX is just volatile as hell and probably something I'd stay away from if you're looking for longer term earnings. If you're interested in short term growth with high risk, something like this would work perfectly.
