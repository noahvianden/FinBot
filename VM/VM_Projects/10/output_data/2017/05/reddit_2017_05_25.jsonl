{"title": "Crazy swings in options valuations", "selftext": "I've been watching some AAPL options and noticed that yesterday the Jan 2018 $160 calls were selling at $8.65. Today, after AAPL's 0.3% drop (.46 points), the same options were selling at $8.15...so the options lost $50 of value while the underlying lost $46 of value (considering you were holding 100 shares of the underlying to make it comparable to holding the option). So basically, for this to make sense, unless you have a delta of over 1 (which is impossible), you have to assume that IV must have dropped quite a lot and that theta decay took a big chunk out of the option. The thing is though that IV actually INCREASED which should actually add to the value of the option and the theta of the option is only about -.02 which would, in theory, explain only $2 of the $50 drop in value of the option. So basically, even ignoring the increase in IV, you have $48 that you have to explain away when the underlying only dropped by .46 points. The delta of the option is about .44 which would only explain less than half of the drop in value of the option. I know the greeks aren't perfect and only act as a guide but how the heck, in the case of a decrease in the underlying, can you lose MORE by holding an option than by holding the underlying itself (considering IV doesn't drop and considering that theta doesn't have time to decay the price of the option, as is the case here)?

I can't remember.  I just know I love seeing it rise and fall.  I imagine the VXAPL is 30 days or three months also.  I used to trade Apple a few years ago before the last stock split and I found VXAPL to be helpful.  \nAs for \"vix increases but the IV on SPX options decrease\", I don't see that unless you are talking about a \"volatility collapse\" later in the day.  For example, the VIX can spike up three or four points in the morning and maintain that spike throughout the day, but the options sort of deflate by the end of the day...the option was up 100% at 10:00 and now it's only up 60% at 2:30 in the afternoon and yet the VIX is still spiked...but not as much as it was...so now we see a volatility collapse in the options themselves.  It's not a perfect answer, but I see this often and count on it in my trading. \nI should add I've seen call options increase in value (some what) even though the market is tanking due to the spike in the VIX.  In other words, I've been short calls on the SPX and still lost money while the market was tanking.  \nAs for the point of the greeks, they are certainly necessary.  Options are derivatives of an underlying and have expiration dates.  In order to determine price for a derivative with an expiration date, you have to devise a fancy algorithm to achieve this goal.  The algorithm must determine the value based on all sorts of variables like time left till expiration, probability of expiring ITM/OTM/ATM, volatility, etc.  Again, their purpose goes toward determining the price.  The greeks will respond to the movement of the underlying and the underlying responds to demand (including lack of demand).  \nI don't advise worrying too much about the greeks.  I do recommend understanding how they work, but I don't worry about their values too much.  I focus on the delta I want to short and get into the rhythm of how the underlying is moving.

{"title": "DD", "selftext": "Hello there i've been a part of this sub a while now and have made money off advice from this sub, others and my own DD. Nevertheless, DD processes are very unique to everyone and everyone has their own way of getting it done, i am aware of that. My advice request is for anyone, to personally explain their own DD process. I know not only me, but also alot of people on this sub would benefit from constructive responses. Also saying \"check P/E ratios\" to see if its good etc is to broad an advice for any rookie to understand completely, what number is a good P/E, what numbers are you looking for in a company and why it fits for that company specifically. The idea of doing one's own DD is out there but i guess to some extent only in concept. Many of us (including myself) dont study econ or can't currently, some are investing with 1k others 10k or 25k. Personally my DD process goes as follows (like i said i don't study econ or finance my studies are limited to med school and evreything related, i do this with my free time, excuse if my process is not completely based on facts and numbers):\n\n-check the company i want either by following the portfolios of big-time investors or through reddit(discover teh company)\n-I check everywhere possible until i understand how that company makes money, i put myself in the position of whoever runs that company and try to adress how i can make more profits if i was running the company, if i can't, or is challenging its a good sign for me. (Call it it gets a \"yes\" point)\n-I check if the company is in debt, if it is, it is not exactly a 'No\", i check to see how much will it take the company to get out of debt, following the tendency of their latest Q earnings. More than 5 years is a \"no\" less is a \"yes\". With some exeptions depending on how big this company is. If its something like Apple/amazon/nvdia i can pass it as a yes in some cases.\nNext i try to further my research to what they are doing to innovate in their field, if it is soemthing i would buy, or if its something people in that field would see as an investment. Example: i know nothing about farming but if a farming company is creating a seed that grows 5 plants instead of 1 per seed and costs 150 bucks each is this something farming companies would buy to bump up their gains or its somehting that is not viable for companies that would ACTUALLy use em then its a \"no\" if it is somehting viable then a \"yes\".\n-STOCK PRICE- i don't know if it should even matter this much but if the stock price is higher im more inclined to buy it, although i know some people can't just go and buy a share of amazon thats $995 as of now. I try to see how much i would gain if the company raises 5%/10%, if its $10 for a 10% increase or its $150 for a 10% increase in stock price. For me thats very f*kin attractive.\n-How much im willing to lose- All the money i invest in a single company has a lose margin, i give myself a number of the most im willing to lose if this comany goes bad even after my DD is done. I weight this part though at the end of my DD mostly.\n-Of course to set a number of how much im willing to lose i gotta know how much i want to put into a stock, this is something completely based on feeling and not on factual analysis( rookie mistake maybe?)Nevertheless i have never lost money and that which i HAVE lost i have recovered so.. yeah thats that. \n-I weigh the yes and no's, more yeses i but it, more no's i dont, its that simple, for me atleast. \n-I dont look at the stock for a single day, afterthat its monitoring and gainz.. most of teh times. \n\nThis has worked for ME, i have lost great oppportunities because of my method, same as i have caught other good ones, this is the reason behind this post.
