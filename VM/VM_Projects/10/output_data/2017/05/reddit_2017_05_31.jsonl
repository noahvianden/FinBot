It's important so let me say that again...**BUY THEM BACK IF THEY TURN AGAINST YOU.** Selling the Call is functionally like shorting the stock at that strike price. If you can't afford to short it, you can't afford to accept assignment, so make sure you don't play \"wait and see\" if it moves against you. I've also found that except in rare cases operating with the mindset of \"I can accept assignment\" is usually pretty toxic. The points you're getting assigned at generally will be pretty bad spots/conditions to be assigned in the first place. You'll get assigned on a Call in the face of enormous upside momentum or on a Put in the face of enormous downside momentum. \n\nIf you're using technicals to set your strikes, you'll be getting assigned on breakouts, breakdowns, trend breaks, etc. You would essentially need to be calling the top or bottom almost flawlessly which if you can do, more power to you. After that it's $100 a point for every option you got assigned on. So my advice is if you're going to take the risk, at least lock in the idea that if the option doubles (or increases by some other predetermined amount) in your face, you're buying it back. After that, set your position size accordingly. That way you at least have your risk-reward theoretically structured at 1 to 1 which I've found isn't too bad in the case of options where probability of success on any given trade is pretty high.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "If he holds the position on 350 call option and and the option is exercised at expiration in the money at 350.60.

If he didn't have the money to even accept the assignment in the first place, there are brokerages that will just auto-liquidate the option before it gets assigned.

The goal of the auto-liquidation is to square away the cash in the account with the margin required on any given position. \n\nWhen the cash in the account doesn't meet the margin required, the auto-liquidation takes place. I don't know which brokerages auto-liquidate and I don't know what those procedures look like in really egregious offenses.
