{"title": "Tesla's Semi", "selftext": "Just doing some research regarding the hype for Tesla's semi, and thought I post my... thoughts here. \n\nWith the initiatives that the Ontario government is providing for Tesla's electric semis, the price is reasonable for companies compared to other semi's on the market. With the rising cost of fuel, the savings are very attractive and should provide a good incentive for companies to buy electric semi's. \n\nThe limitations are two items: range, and charging times. \n\nWith electric vehicles, charging times are relatively long, and has never been an issue with gasoline vehicles. Using a supercharger, we have a charging rate of [22 miles per hour](https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/). Their semi has at most a range of 500 miles. That's a charging time of 22 hours and 43 minutes. I'll let someone more qualified figure out the impact to logistics, but my impressions is that even though it might be feasible, they would need to have spare semis to compensate for this charging time. This would decrease the robustness of the system, but they might still retain their gasoline fleet as backup. \n\nFrom Detroit to Sudbury, we have a driving distance of 441 miles, which is well within the operating range of said semi's. Looking at only the GTA area where the population is concentrated, this range is further decreased, rendering electric semi's to be feasible in this region.  \n\nOverall, realistically speaking, electric semi's aren't a universal solution to transport over highways, but rather a niche solution pertaining to local deliveries. With these two points in mind, we can narrow down the market for these vehicles to a more realistic range. \n\n* Companies with a large number of franchises or customers in a small area (operating range)\n\n* Companies based in Ontario (government rebates)\n\n* Companies which can afford double the amount of vehicles required (charging time)\n\nedit: I am sorely disappointed at the lack of intelligent discussion in this thread. \n\nedit2: instead of spare semi's, they could use spare batteries.

With the now mandated E-logs, there is no way to bypass this hours issue. \nThe 11 hours start once the driver turns the key in the ignition.l and continues for 11 hours straight, including load and unload time. \nJust to give an example, we have a lot of shipments out of Marion,OH.

Industry standard live-load time takes 2 hours. So now for a driver to simply drive to the shipper and get loaded, it takes 3 of his/her 11 hours, leaving 8 hours to drive.
