I had the video on 2x speed and still understood it which means you talk too slow and video is too long, Lots of errs and uhhs too. The information you presented perhaps can be done in under 1 minute. The lack of graphics and amateur graphics was slightly annoying but that might be learned over time..\n\nYou give a good look at average investor sentiment to people who don't know much about the stock. But you really should pick a direction, a price target, and an investment time length. You started hyping it up and then said it's over valued but it's promising so you should buy it if you like the company. That kind of statement wouldn't have helped anyone though. The three choices should be buy/hold/sell. In general all tech companies are speculative buys and all of them are over valued from a P/E ratio standpoint and future earnings potential.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate the feedback.
