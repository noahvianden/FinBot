{"title": "Buying Puts on an overhyped stock (tell me where I could be wrong)", "selftext": "If any of you have been following the $WATT hypetrain, I'm sure you know that it took a deep tumble this morning. They were trading around ~$9 at the beginning of this week before they got FCC approval for their truly wireless charging tech and then soared to a high of $33 yesterday. \n\nToday was day 3 of their run up and it finally tanked to close below $19.50 today. I bought into 50 $20 Jan 19 puts for $1.25 when the stock was around the $28 mark. I profited $4250 because of the downward tumble. \n\nSo this begs the question for me... is it a good strategy to use a stock screener to find stocks that have had overhyped run ups for a day or two, do some research to make sure that their run ups are unjustified/unsustainable, and then buy near-expiry (1 month max) puts to profit on their inevitable short-term crash? \n\nOf course, I understand that this might not always be a profitable strategy (just look at $ROKU) and that the stock might go up the wrong way for me. However, more often than not, especially with small cap stocks, it seems like it's relatively predictable that a stock is going to come back down to Earth soon after a big run up. $HMNY is a another great example of this back in mid-September when it went all the way up to $38 before crashing to around $12.\n\n$TRXC (which I'm long on common stock btw) is another instance. It spiked to $5 from $1.50 on FDA approval and then settled back down to the $3 range.\n\nAnyone want to chime in and tell me where I'm wrong in this strategy? My logic is that with puts, the most money I can lose is my original investment in case the stock continues to run upwards. In addition, it's hard to predict when a stock will go UP because we don't know when a catalyst might land. However, it's a bit easier to predict when a stock will start going DOWN because we'll be able to base our judgement off the previous run up and how long it's gone up.\n\nSomeone help poke holes in this strategy (which I'm sure is not new), so I can understand how to improve it or where I might be wrong.
