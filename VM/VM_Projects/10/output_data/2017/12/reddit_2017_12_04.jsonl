I don't have any interest in a BAC and I'm not going to buy a bounce in BAC because it gets a tax benefit.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Trump Trade\" rotation after the election saw people flying out of techs and into things like steel stocks. X is down YTD. There's going to be people who panic out of names that are getting sold in this rotation and then chase things that are benefitting from the rotation after they've already run - you could panic out of names being sold only to buy something that's already run a lot based on the belief it will benefit from reform and see it turn lower.

If you don't mind me asking--how \"diversified\" among sectors are you?

I don't own energy, don't own staples, don't own basic materials.\n\nI've always been of the view that people should have some diversification, but only to the degree that it makes sense. If you can't tell me why you should own energy, then don't. Don't buy an energy stock because you feel you have to own something in every sector, then you're forcing an investment. I don't own energy because if I look 3-5+ years out, I couldn't give you a reason why. I don't own anything that I don't have a significant longer-term thesis for and I don't own anything that I'm not excited about looking long-term.\n\nThat said, if someone is 100% tech, then I hope they know what they've signed up for. When you're reliant upon something and everything is going great, feels good. However, when you're reliant upon something and this happens, feels bad. I think this rotation is probably closer to over at this point, but if you're totally reliant upon one thing, you have to accept the idea that you may have months or years where you underperform.  If you're an expert in tech, great. If you're riding momentum in a sector, then you can see how fast that reverses.\n\nIt's understandable that tech may have gotten a little ahead of itself, but that doesn't mean, \"OMG I GOTTA SELL Tencent and buy Macy's. Macy's may benefit from a better-than-expected holiday and tax reform, but looking even a little longer out, I don't see Macy's as having a compelling future. If people can trade that,then okay, but I think the concern that I have is that this is a very severe move that will probably play out in a fairly short time period. There will be retail investors who see, \"OMG look at Macy's go\" and chase it after the majority of the short-term move has happened.\n\nThis period really shows that there isn't a lot of new money. It's just this mass of money that can be in something for months or years, then the break happens and when it happens, people flee in such a swift manner. It's frustrating to watch because admittedly many people aren't positioned for this, but also because: we have seen this before and additionally, a lot of it is this dash to companies that haven't performed as well this year (in many cases, not all) for a reason.\n", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the detailed response/pep talk, our portfolios sound a bit similar.

Personally, what has helped me is moving away from the day-to-day and really having more of an over-the-horizon view. Did you buy BAT because of tomorrow, or because you believe in making a bet on the Chinese consumer in the years ahead? If the latter (which I'm guessing is very likely the case) then yeah the last week was not fun but you can look for opportunities to add if you weren't overweight these names already.\n\nAs for the move into more value stocks over the last week, I think the problem that I have with a lot of value names is that they appear to be value names because so many things are in the process of being disrupted. What you almost have to do is be able to spot quality when pessimism gets too high. If you look at the mall REITs, people were acting like the mall is going away entirely with \"END OF RETAIL\" headlines. The class A malls have a lot of nice real estate.\n\nThere will be a lot of malls that will go away over the next 5 years, but the biggest/best will ultimately evolve (GGP partnering with an apartment REIT to put apartments on some mall sites.) That doesn't make it an exciting business in the future, but at the right price some of the top names are a nice yield and nice real estate. Just because Macy's bounced on tax reform and a decent holiday doesn't change the fact that the business doesn't have a compelling path forward.\n\nSo yeah, sometimes money just rushes one way very swiftly and it may not always make sense - or better yet, the reasoning may seem like very short-term thinking. In that case, a lot of times what's being thrown out is where the opportunities often are. If people can trade these moves, then great, but if someone's longer-term, stay with the longer-term view.\n\nEdited: Also, you can see the reversal in some of the names that have gotten a boost over the last few days, like FL down 6%. The thing that concerns me with this sort of rotation that people thinking that FL's business is now somehow a-okay when it's not and they chase it right into the reversal. That also kind of goes back to the idea of long-term names you feel very strongly about and sticking with them rather than chasing moves like that.\n\nGood luck.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6454727649688721}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37445908784866333}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6835716962814331}], "tickers": ["bac"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I think I'll stick around in the long run.
