The EPYC platform offers big cost/performance benefits over Intel.. and the way the web is all cloud/resource based now, cost/performance ratio is far and away the most important factor for businesses selling raw compute resources.\n\nI see datacenters adopting EPYC in a big way.  Something like Azure or AWS runs millions of servers, selling compute resources to millions of customers.  The cost of these severs is enormous, and even a small savings is a big difference to the bottom line.  There is a **ton** of potential money to be made for AMD right now.\n\nFor example, the EPYC 7601 offers 32 cores at 2.2-3.2GHz for $4200, whereas Intel's Xeon 8160 offers 24 cores at 2.1-3.7GHz for $4700.  That's 11% cheaper with 25% more threads.  EPYC is going to cause a major disruption.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is ARM.  They've been dipping their toes in the server market and they could shake things up too.  AMD and Intel have decades of legacy instructions sets and CPU features they need to support that adds overhead to the raw performance.  ARM is new and doesn't need to support legacy technologies.  If they can scale up performance, that could be a game changer.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "A problem with the servers though is they are much more about power consumption.
