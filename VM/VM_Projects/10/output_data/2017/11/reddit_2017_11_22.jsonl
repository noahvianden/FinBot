Of this $80B are from acquisitions - goodwill created by paying over book for other businesses - and $40B in research & development, patents, trademarks, etc. When we write these down by 2/3 which is a common way to assess a balance sheet on a conservative basis - particularly goodwill - the balance sheet actually has negative equity.\n\nWhat is likely to happen in Q4 of this year  that will likely bring about a buying opportunity in the stock:\n\n(1) They will take an accounting bath through dispositions and voluntary write downs of bad acquisitions. Thereby reducing goodwill and their profit for the quarter. As an extension of (1) they will reduce the aggressiveness on their accounting all around. Revenue recognition, backlog, inventory valuations, intangibles, etc. This will in turn set up many positive quarters in Q1. Q1 & Q2 is also when I think the real transformation will begin via asset sales and restructuring. Not much going to be done entering Christmas season.\n\n(2) There will be substantial tax loss selling as it has been an excellent year on the DOW and the broad markets, and institutional and retail investors will exit GE to generated capital losses to offset their capital gains thereby reducing taxes payable.\n\nThis combination means that the stock will likely get crushed until after Q4 reports in Feb. 2018.

(on a related note, \"Force Awakens\" came out in December 2015 - the stock is about $15 under where it was in mid-November 2015.\n\nBlack Friday has been thought about. You can make a judgement that Black Friday will be better than the market expects for one or more retailers if you believe you have some sort of information edge.

From there, they worked up a mathematical regression to come up with a prediction of the company\u2019s quarterly revenue each month.\"\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/id/38722872 (and that was 2010; there's been plenty more since.)\n\n_____________________\nRemote-Sensing-Metrics-uses-satellites-to-spot-market-and-sales-trends-for-investors-like-hedge-funds\nPhoto by Kendall Karmanian Tom Diamond watches places like parking lots\nThe drop-in visit is a favorite tool of the diligent investor: You pop into a factory or store to see if the activity matches the company's guidance. But what happens when you're trying to keep tabs on thousands of locations?\n\nChicago-based Remote Sensing Metrics has the answer: You get satellites to stop by for you. RS Metrics uses satellite photos of parking lot traffic at big-box stores like Bed Bath & Beyond, as well as factory activity at manufacturers such as Caterpillar, to forecast performance. Its customers, mostly hedge funds, use the information to get a jump on public companies' quarterly investor reports.\n\nFor example, RS Metrics detected a traffic slowdown in March at retailer Pier 1 Imports, alerting investors on April 10. On April 13, Pier 1 lowered its sales projections for the quarter. In January, RS Metrics noticed an uptick in traffic at Panera Bread locations and forecast sales growth in its February, March and April reports; on April 26, the restaurant announced it had exceeded its revenue estimates.\" (http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160721/ISSUE01/160729993/another-way-hedge-funds-get-the-jump-on-regular-investors)", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I never expected institutions to go that far to nit-pick numbers.
