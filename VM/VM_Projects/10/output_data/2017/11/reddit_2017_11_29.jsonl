In total I am $125 down on the position, which isn't terrible considering the capital at stake.\n\nTSLA has obviously dipped far below the lower strikes, putting them ITM.  \n\nThis is my first IC trade, and despite the reading and videos I've watched, I still feel uncertain how best to proceed with managing these positions.\n\n- Should I close out of one side of the trade to lock in profits, and ride the other until it is more profitable?\n\n- Should I roll one Vertical closer or further to the current underlying to collect credit or reduce risk?\n\nAnother component of this that I think may throw a huge ugly wrench in things is that my broker (ETRADE) will not allow me to hold any naked call position.  So I'm just now figuring out how exactly that will (negatively) affect my ability to strategically close out of this position leg by leg.\n\nAny thoughts / advice would be greatly greatly appreciated.

I honestly didn\u2019t put too much thought into the underlying price or strikes, I just kind of jumped in to get my feet wet (previously only bought 1 leg positions or sold covered straddles). \n\nSo, say I were to close these out and reopen an IC on TSLA. How wide would you recommend for a stock around that cap?  $15? That would increase my likelihood of profit but also my max potential loss, correct? \n\nHow about the idea I posted above about opening or closing the Condors 1 leg at a time.

Are you comfortable being long 1000 shares of TSLA at $317 (minus your credit)? Granted you are now fully in the money protected by your long puts.\n\n- You did not give yourself enough time in this trade, I would have sold January options. I don't trade ICs closer than 30 days out typically.\n\nIf you had sold January options I would say sit tight and do nothing. Today was a big tech sell-off and will likely rebound, but I'm not sure if it will come back quickly enough.\n\nI would contemplate rolling the short call down to 317.5 to create an iron butterfly if you can get a decent credit (say $1.00).  That will lower your breakeven and reduce your max loss if Tesla stays down. It does increase the risk of being whipsawed to the upside though.\n\nYou could also widen your call spread by rolling the long call higher for a credit. This increases your risk to the upside again, but decreases your risk to the downside.\n\nIf Tesla rebounds close to your short put strike but still below near expiration, look to roll this out to January for a credit. Right now you can't roll out for a credit with the put side fully breached.\n\nMost importantly don't panic. You only have a paper loss at this point.
