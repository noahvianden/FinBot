{"title": "What Investors Keep Missing About Tesla Stock", "selftext": "**Take a Closer Look at TSLA Stock**\nIf I asked you to describe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), what would you say? Most people would give the stock answer; that Tesla is a maker of electric cars. It would appear they have good reason to say so, too.\nYahoo! Finance classifies Tesla under \u201cMajor \u2013 Auto Manufacturers.\u201d And Google Finance lists Daimler AG (OTCMKTS:DDAIY), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as Tesla\u2019s main competitors. Not a single solar energy firm makes the list.\n\nI find this odd.\nLess than a year has passed since Tesla acquired SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ:SCTY). The $2.6-billion deal made Tesla one of the leading solar providers in North America, so why are we still pretending that TSLA stock is a pure-play on vehicles?\n**Full Article:** http://www.profitconfidential.com/stock/investors-keep-missing-tesla-stock/", "id": "6h0gon", "created_utc": 1497366591.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Over the past couple years their battery experts have given a number of extensive presentations discussing how they will achieve better battery technology. Economies of scale is a big part of it, but nowhere near all of it. A recent article described the cost of the 60KW Chevy Volt at $195 / KWH after removing a 25% gross margin (in my opinion being very generous). We already know based on public information that Tesla's current price is at most $190/KWH and declining - by their claims ~30% decline expected. Slightly changing the battery size, adjusting the chemical composition to use less of the rare/expensive components such as Cobalt, and economies of scale combined are pretty compelling cases to get to at least 25% reduction. \n\nI think it's important to recognize that the combination of solar to the electric vehicle is joined at the stationary storage component. That's the primary overlap between these two businesses from a manufacturing standpoint. It's also a seamless interaction when a customer wants to buy into the whole system - Charge car and home with solar panels and store the excess energy - A.K.A everything that is Tesla Energy. \n\nAs a shareholder of course you want Tesla to be able to upsell the entire system. I think dismissing the projects they've already executed on at the utility scale level would be a huge oversight in 2-3 years. They're building the body of evidence required to convince heavily regulated utilities that this is a worthwhile project that often takes years of advanced planning for a major utility to execute on.
