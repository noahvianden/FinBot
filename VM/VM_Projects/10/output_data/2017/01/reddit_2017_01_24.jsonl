{"title": "Bear VXX Vertical Spreads", "selftext": "Long time lurker here....\n\nI've been doing looking to getting into the world of options for some time now and have gone through almost the entire tastytrade gauntlet. Wanted to get some feedback on a trading idea I have.\n\nEssentially, I want to bet on VIX Contango using VXX options as the vehicle and maintain a defined-risk bearish position on the VXX at all times due to decay. I recognize that the skew on the VXX options is pretty high and that decay is already factored into the options pricing.\n\nMy thinking is to mechanically open a $1 OTM Bearish Call Credit Spread every two weeks with 50-70 days of duration (incase the VIX spikes) and collect ~.25-.30 for a $1 wide spread. If the VIX spikes and the trade goes bad, then I would likely heavy up on the bet and open a new bearish position betting on VIX crush. Even so, it seems like this strategy would work way too well.\n\nIs this too good to be true?

You are better off buying puts when VIX is below 19.\n\nThe reason is simple. If VXX had been trading in 2008, it would have spiked by 400% due to backwardation. 2008 is a bit of an outlier, so you could still be correct on the general movement of the underlying being slightly more pronounced when VIX is above 19. A smarter strategy might be to wait until the relevant futures curve moves from backwardation to contango.\n\nSo now lets look at the options prices.\n\nIf you buy puts on VXX at ask, you will probably lose money on anything that has an expiration shorter than 50-90 days. There is a premium you pay when buying options, and it takes a while for the underlying drift to make up for the excess premium. \n\nLastly, these are just averages. If you bet too much of your account buying options, you will end up going to zero. You can use the kelly criteria to approximate what portion of your account you should bet, or you can just simply bet your excess savings.\n\nedit: I just realized you were asking about bearish call spreads.
