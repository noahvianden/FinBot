This question gets asked all the time by novice equity traders. Trading the underlying straight up is similar, but without the leverage, and time decay of options.\n\nBasic novice idea: buy XYZ wait until it goes up 5 cents or whatever, and sell. Wait until it goes back down that 5 cents and get back in. Repeat. It is almost the same game as outlined above. The equity model has slightly better odds than the options strategy outlined because of better liquidity.\n\nIMHO both are newbie ideas that may work for a little bit, but will almost certainly lose money over time, because of commissions, fees, slippage. The odds at the casino are not in your favor. The odds of simple daytrading setups as described, have a very similar \"rake\" to casino games. The rake in this case is the percentage lost to commissions, fees, slippage. Even if commissions and fees were zero, the 9 cents to 10 cents is 10% per trip. Most casino games have better odds than a 10% rake.\n\nThe conclusion might be that a person will have a better chance at a casino, repeated gambling, than playing the model presented here.
