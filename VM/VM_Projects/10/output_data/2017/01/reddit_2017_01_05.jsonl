Investing heavily into a single sector is never a good idea unless you plan to ride it out during the bad rotations. Tech is always the future, so the sector itself won't suffer big anytime soon. But you picked two semiconductors and two over-valued (in my personal opinion) companies.\n\nA good beginner's tip that helped me was to sit down and think of a list of 50 products, services, or companies you use often. Food, electronics, utilities, energy, apparel, appliances, etc.; make a list and research those companies and how they compare to others in the same industry. From there, allocate 1-5% of your capital to each company. That should give you some diversification and some protection against systematic risk.\n\nStock trading isn't something you just jump into without research or patience.

Out of all of these industries, I hand pick the few which have a low distribution of ROA's among the companies. This indicates that there is heavy competition within the company. \n\nFrom the list that I hand-picked, I take a look at each individual industry. I look at the distribution of each companies' assets, and the distribution of their income. Eg: where their money is going to. And from each industry, I will choose one or two 'winning' companies. \n\nI then look at the charts of each of the winning companies, and use a bit of technical analysis to find out if now is the right time to buy. Most of what I described, I wrote a couple programs to do for me. All of this takes about an hour or two to complete. Technical analysis is a bit tricky to program, so I do that by hand. \n\nBut you know, all of this means jack shit. Just buy some index funds if you want the best returns.
