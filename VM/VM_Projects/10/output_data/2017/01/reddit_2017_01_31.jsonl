The reason I ran a BPS as my strategy prior to earnings is because I felt that if AMD didn't meet expectations there would be a small 2-5% drop. The point I am making in my post is that buying long calls/puts is not the best way to express a short term view on an underlying. If you buy an ATM put and the stock moves against you, you will loose 100% of the premium if the put expires OTM. On the other hand, selling OTM strikes allows you to reduce your cost basis to partially cover your losses, without taking away your upside on a small 2-5% move. I think that one of the problems on this sub is that people always go into an event assuming that there will be a big move if something outperforms, etc. However, the reality is that the market reaction is unpredictable to a large degree and running a BPS is better than putting on a naked short play. \n\nIt turned out that AMD beat expectations and the stock rallied 3.57% in after hours. My Feb17 short puts saved me some money - Without them, my losses on the long puts would have been larger. However, the earnings release does not change my long term view on AMD - I still feel that the stock is overvalued in relation to fundamentals. Bulls are betting on a turnaround here - Perhaps the current valuation will be justified if AMD gains more marketshare in the CPU/GPU markets and starts generating positive FCF but this will be a long shot.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "100% agree about selling over buying.
