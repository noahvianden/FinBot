Notably, even the smallest model variant of ReALM realized absolute performance gains exceeding 5% for on-screen references.\n\nComparison with GPT Models: The paper benchmarks ReALM against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with the smallest ReALM model matching the performance of GPT-4. Larger ReALM models substantially outperform GPT-4, underscoring the system's efficiency and effectiveness in reference resolution tasks.\n\nHandling Ambiguous References: The ability to comprehend ambiguous references, such as \"they\" or \"that,\" given the context, is highlighted as crucial for conversational assistants. ReALM is designed to enable users to naturally communicate their needs or engage in conversations with an agent, including queries about visible entities on their screen for a hands-free experience.\n\nInnovative Encoding Techniques: The paper outlines novel methods for encoding entities that are present on the screen into a language model, using textual representations that preserve the relative spatial positions of these entities. This technique contributes to ReALM's strong performance, especially in scenarios where understanding the spatial context of screen elements is critical.\n\nFuture Directions: The paper concludes with considerations for future work, particularly the exploration of more complex approaches to better capture nuanced positional understanding necessary for resolving complex user queries. Suggestions include dividing the screen into a grid and encoding these relative spatial positions into text.\n\nIn summary, \"ReALM: Reference Resolution As Language Modeling\" demonstrates how LLMs can be effectively utilized for reference resolution, including for non-conversational entities, by reconceptualizing the task as a language modeling problem. The system achieves notable improvements over existing models and offers a promising direction for future advancements in conversational AI .", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.040667466819286346}], "tickers": ["aapl"]}

A figure that implied the Q1 estimates would not be hit, estimates that had already been revised down). Because of that, many market participants loaded up on puts before Tuesday, and sold to close between Tuesday and today. So the delta-neutral Market Makers started closing their short positions (that they had opened to hedge) as the puts were being sold by the options buyers, resulting in the price action that we witnessed since Tuesday and which culminated in today's \"unexpected\" move. The grindy short covering between 10am and 11:40 also left many day traders trapped (who kept selling short as the stock moved upwards), which further contributed to that mini-squeeze.\n\nWould be glad to hear other opinions.

Currently stock X price is $5. In this scenario would/could there be any advantage to buying an option as opposed to simply buying the stock?\n\nIf I had $500 and I knew a $5 stock was definitely going to go to $10, I could buy the stock and have $1000 at the end. Or I could buy 1000 $5 call options (depends on the premium, for this example it's 10% which would be kinda high for a call that's so far out of the money), and at the end each of those options would be worth $5. Except that's *per share*, so it's actually worth $500. I'd have 1000 x $500 = $500,000.\n\nBasically, the above calculation is the reason that insider trading is so crazy illegal.
