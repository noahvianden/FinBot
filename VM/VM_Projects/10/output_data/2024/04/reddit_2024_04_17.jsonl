I like to stay right at the breakeven for maximum extrinsic value subject to theta decay..  You can choose to sell further out of the money to give room for the stock price to run.  \n\nIf INTC instead drops back to 30, resell the 30P to again lower your breakeven and roll the short call back down toward that breakeven for more credit.  The objective is to keep lowering the breakeven point of the trade so that you can collect a decent amount of credit from the short call.\n\nAs you can see, it will take a bit of work to keep track of your debits and credits so that you have an accurate gauge of your breakeven price.  Breakeven if the long call strike plus any net debit, or minus any net credit.  The short put is a drag on returns since it's fully collateralized, so it's only open when it helps lower the breakeven on the position and closed as soon as feasible to free that buying power back up. \n\nBecause this strategy is calendarized, it's difficult to project P/L.  It's still possible to be in profit even if the trade has moved past your short call or fallen toward your long call.  If you can close all legs at your profit target, then there's no harm in taking that money and waiting for an additional pullback in the stock to re-enter the trade if desired.  Generally, if I can close the position for a credit of at least 150% of my net debit, I'll do that.

Good luck with that. You'll be at the mercy of your broker's contingent order execution system.\n\nBecause the first hour (especially the first 30 minutes) of the regular trading session is typically the most volatile.  Yes, I'm trying to catch a large move up or down at the open, hence the straddle.  I've traded long straddles at the open before and have been, for the most part, successful, I also have no issues with my broker.  The issue I had with the long straddle was the times that it didn't make a sufficiently large move, and I had a very large portion of my capital tied to it (+80%); the solution I implemented at the time was to sell the profitable leg and average down on the unprofitable leg, but again, I already had so much of my capital tied to a directional trade and no capital to hedge against the position, resulting in a very large loss.  That's the reason for the 15% initial capital allocation and the structure of capital allocation in the contingency phases.\n\n>Because? If the gap up/down didn't happen by 11:30, it might happen later?\n\nCorrect, SPY typically (not always) pivots at around between 12 and 1 PM and again at 3 PM.\n\n>That's a lot of your portfolio value to pile onto a sinking ship.\n\nAgreed, however, I have a small account.  40% is the maximum capital allocation to attempt to get the average price to a higher probability of profit.
