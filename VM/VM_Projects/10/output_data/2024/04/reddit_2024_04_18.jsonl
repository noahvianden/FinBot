H200 is on track to beat MI300X to volume deliveries.\n\n- Not clear if Venado is fully ready to go, but deployment time seems quick (delivered in March, ribbon-cutting on 4/15).  There was news earlier that the new European supercomputer (Jupiter) was designed for quick deployment with factory-built trailer-sized units.  Contrast this with the MI300-based El Capitan supercomputer (admittedly a much larger system) that started installation in 7/23, expected to be finished in mid-2024.\n\n- Venado is the first system I have heard about that is deploying Grace cpus (count = 920) separately from Grace-Hopper units.  Amd and Intel cpus are no longer needed for HPC supercomputer work?\n\n- There have been reports that some GH200 customers have been converting orders to GB200s.  Dylan Patel from Semianalysis described the Grace cpu in a GH200 as a \"very expensive memory controller\" (with one cpu per gpu).  One Grace cpu per 4 Blackwell chiplets in a GB200 is much more cost-effective.  All this should speed up the deployment of the 40 supercomputer wins announced at the Supercomputing 2023 conference in 11/23.\n\n[https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-upgrades-project-ceiba-to-feature-20736-nvidia-blackwell-gpus-boosting-power-6x-to-414-ai-exaflops/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-upgrades-project-ceiba-to-feature-20736-nvidia-blackwell-gpus-boosting-power-6x-to-414-ai-exaflops/)\n\n\"Originally [announced last November](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/project-ceiba-aws-and-nvidia-plan-to-build-worlds-largest-cloud-ai-supercomputer/) with 16,384 GH200s, Ceiba will now have 10,368 GB200s.\"", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Good analysis!", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.060401372611522675}, {"body": "I think 1 to 1 pairing is intended to support RAG, the retrieval portion works much better on a CPU.

Look at Netflix today: absolutely blows past all expectations: -5% after hours. Look at Tesla. Illumina or Paypal, etc. \n\nYou are right about aggressive, but you're doing it wrong in picking stocks. You need to beat the market over a very long time and that won't work with stuff that has already has the big returns. This is how I would do it if I could go back to 23 with what I know now:\n\nAgressively buy Google and Amazon, up to 25% weighting for each. They are absolutely dominating giants, market caps the size of countries who control our very way of live. They print free cash flow like theres no tomorrow and they're still growing like crazy. \n\nGoogle has no debt, in 2025 they'll likely have as much cash as the entire GPD of Morocco. Basically all of the world's internet traffic runs through them, they have a duopoly with Meta in online Advertising. Duopoly with Apple with Android/Play Store. Oligopoly with Microsoft and Amazon in Cloud Services. Only self-driving car already in commercial operation (Waymo). Only competitor with Microsoft Office (Google Workspace). Fully owns DeepMind, who pioneered Machine Learning, which was the foundation for what is now AI. \n\nAmazon's FCF is exploding already and margins in retail are still low at the moment. FCF in 2025 will be at least $120 billion, it's insane. They have cemented their position, no chance any competitor can build their kind of network in the US ever again, because of the simple reason money will never be free again like it used to be pre-2022. They dominate in cloud computing (multiple times larger than Azure from Microsoft) and that sector still has a big runway for Market-beating growth the next 15 years. Amazon is not even buying back shares yet! \n\nI guarantee you these two will outperform even the Nasdaq over the next 15 years. Contrary to popular belief, Google and Amazon aren't even that expensive at the moment. Especially compared to Nvidia, Costco, Microsoft, Apple, Novo Nordisk and the likes. \n\nWith the other 50%, buy an S&P500 tracker and a world ETF like IWDA or some other individual stocks you like. Slowly dip your toe in picking stocks, its harder than you think. I would recommend watching/reading Warren Buffett stuff and the Berkshire annual letters to shareholders. I would also recommend Terry Smith and his Fundsmith fund. Look up the stocks in his portfolio. Watch Joseph Carlson on YouTube. \n\nFocus on free cash flow yield, free cash flow growth, margins, and a strong moat (economic/strategic adventage that shields a company from competition and gives them pricing power). Perfect example of this is Intuitive Surgical with their DaVinci-robot. There is literally no competition in robotic surgery systems. EVERY SINGLE tool used in every single robotic surgery performed worldwide is sold by them. Quality is important.

What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
