{"title": "Your Thoughts on $CLS Celestica", "selftext": "Earnings on 4/24/2024. I hold stock and debating whether to pick up a call or two. Here are some bullish thoughts from my broker's research department:\n\nBottom Line: \nWe remain Outperform on CLS and have raised our estimates and target price ahead of Q1/24 results\u2014as we believe that CLS will continue to benefit, both in the near-term and longer-term, from the large AI-driven capex investments being made by its hyperscaler customers. We believe the stock's valuation doesn't adequately reflect its market position and exposure with respect to this opportunity, nor the fact that Street estimates (and our own) are likely conservative.\n\nKey Points\nWe anticipate a solid quarter and guidance raise. Consensus Q1/24 estimates call for revenue of $2.1b and adj. EPS of $0.72, while FY2024 consensus is at $8.78b for revenue and $2.93 for adj. EPS. Current FY2024 guidance calls for revenue of >$8.5b and adj. EPS of $2.70; however we believe it's clear that this is too conservative\u2014given subsequent capex guidance from key customers, which suggests that demand is accelerating. Our expectation is that FY2024 guidance will be raised to a level that's similar to, although perhaps not above, current consensus.\n\nWe're unclear on where buyside consensus might stand, but in our view, the stock's current valuation and significant pullback from its recent peak suggest that a sizable beat isn't currently being priced in.\n\nProprietary silicon servers, and 800G, should drive ongoing share gains. We believe that CLS has stronger competitive differentiation with respect to AI servers that are based on proprietary silicon vs. NVIDIA. Large hyperscalers such as Google and Microsoft appear likely to shift a growing proportion of their server spend towards the former vs. the latter, and we expect that CLS should benefit from this dynamic. Additionally, CLS has been awarded 800G design wins from some of its hyperscaler customers, which are slated to ramp later this year and into FY2025.\n\nWhile competition is a key risk (particularly given CLS's customer concentration), we believe that this is mitigated by the aforementioned factors, and the fact that Street estimates are only assuming single-digit revenue growth in FY2025 despite strong demand tailwinds. Further, the Street isn't forecasting much in the way of margin expansion next year, and we believe this may also represent a source of incremental upside.\n\nWe've raised our target price to US$48, reflecting 15x CY2025E adj. P/E and 8.8x EV/EBITDA.\n\nOur Thesis\nWe rate Celestica shares Outperform. We believe the stock's historical valuation discount to peers should continue to narrow given its revenue and margin trajectory, the significant improvements that CLS has made to its revenue mix in recent years, and its AI exposure.\n\nValuation\nOur US$48 target price is based on a CY2025E adj. P/E multiple of 15x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.8x. We believe this is appropriate in the context of CLS's peer group given its relative size, growth profile and revenue mix.\n\nUpside Scenario\n$55.00\nOur upside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate increases by 7%, perhaps driven by a stronger recovery in semi equipment and better-than-expected hyperscaler demand, and the stock's multiple expands to 16x adj. P/E.\n\nDownside Scenario\n$34.00\nOur downside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate decreases by 7%, perhaps due to a softer demand backdrop, and the stock's multiple contracts to 11.5x adj.

The beat, and the raise, seem to have been driven primarly by strength in the Communications segment (400G/800G networking gear for hyperscalers), which is in turn contributing to better operating leverage. This is more than offsetting a more cautious full-year outlook for ATS, which is being impacted by weakness in the Industrial segment.\n\nKey Points\nRevenue/EPS beat. Revenue was $2.21B (+20% y/y) vs. consensus of $2.10B; the adj. EBITA margin was 6.2% (+30bps q/q, +100bps y/y), driven by stronger CCS margins; and adj. EPS was $0.86 vs. consensus of $0.72 (with $0.05 of the beat stemming from a lower-than-expected tax rate). CLS's largest customer represented 34% of revenue, up from 29% in Q4/23.\n\nStrong guidance. Q2/24 guidance calls for revenue of $2.175-2.325B (+12-20% y/y) vs. consensus of $2.141B and adj. EPS of $0.75-0.85 (+21-39% y/y) vs. consensus of $0.72. FY2024 guidance calls for revenue of $9.1B (+14% y/y) vs. prior guidance of >$8.5B and consensus of $8.79B, and adj. EPS of $3.30 vs. previous guidance of >$2.70 and consensus of $2.93. CLS raised its FY2024 FCF guidance to $250mm vs. prior guidance of >$200mm.\n\nUnexpected Comms strength. CCS revenue was $1.44B (+38% y/y) vs. consensus of $1.24B. Communications revenue of $754mm was +17% y/y vs. prior guidance of low-single-digit growth\u2014and CLS is anticipating mid-40% growth in the upcoming quarter. Enterprise revenue of $687mm was +72% y/y vs. prior guidance of high-60% growth, with Q2/24 guidance calling for low-20% growth. CCS is expected to grow in the mid-20% range for the full year.\n\nATS softness. ATS revenue of $768mm was -3% y/y, in line with prior guidance, with the decline driven by demand softness in the Industrial segment. Guidance calls for a high-single-digit y/y ATS decline in Q2/24, with a recovery in the second half, leading to flat ATS growth on a full-year basis (vs. prior guidance for mid-single-digit growth).\n\nSmall acquisition. CLS entered into an agreement to acquire NCS Global Services, an IT asset management and recycling company, for $36mm. The acquisition is expected to close in Q2/24. We don't believe this was a meaningful contributor to CLS's guidance raise (~$6mm TTM EBITDA).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "still riding $cls?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3958819508552551}, {"body": "Holy shit.

OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance.

{"title": "Let's discuss Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $FNMA and $FMCC", "selftext": "I have no idea what I am doing, but maybe somebody smarter than me  can do something with this information. I am also too regarded to input  images. This is my first post ever. Please be gentle fellow regards. **THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PLAY. Only shares atm.** \n\nDo you remember the housing market crash in 2008? Me neither! Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government conservatorship through the FHFA since September 2008. [This article](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2)  written in 2022 is part 2 of a well written future outlook for the two  mortgage lending giants that were on the front lines during the 2008  housing crash. As I understand it, in order for the two companies to  escape from the conservatorship, they must first raise enough capital to  IPO, which is a massive undertaking. However, things are slowly looking  up. In 2019 the Trump administration authorized the two companies to  start building capital again by accruing retained earnings. Their  combined equity is cresting 100 billion. [It is thought that for both companies to IPO, a combined 150 billion dollars in capital would be required](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2),  which is thought to be massive for an IPO. I believe these two  companies are in for massive gains in the upcoming years as they  continue to rebuild their coffers and potentially exit conservatorship.\n\n  \n\nBut don't take my  word for it. Do a one year chart comparison of  the two companies (I would have included that, but I am so god damn  regarded). You might notice that things started to pick up around August  of 2023. I did some digging to find out what was going on around that  time, and lo and behold, [a  federal jury ruled in favor $FMCC and $FNMA, stating that the sweeping  of all their profits into the US treasury due to an amended stock  purchase agreement in 2012 was unconstitutional.](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/bsf-prevails-at-trial-in-decade-long-battle-against-fhfa.html) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese two companies are in control of \\~**7 trillion dollars worth of assets (**[$FNMA](https://companiesmarketcap.com/fannie-mae/total-assets/#google_vignette) [$FMCC](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090423A)) combined. I have no idea what that means, but those are pretty big  numbers right? Too big to fail, in fact? One might think....   \n\nWith the housing market going crazy, [and a potential Trump win which would be highly favorable for FNMA and FMCC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/a-trump-reelection-seen-as-bullish-for-fannie-freddie-shares),  these are two stocks that I think we should all have our eyes on, as  they seem fairly undervalued at the moment. People have forgotten about  them, and they shouldn't.   \n\n[Here is an excellent interview transcript from the CEO of Fannie Mae, Priscilla Almodovar](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ceo-fannie-mae-believes-100000781.html).  She is a relatively new CEO (2022 instated) as is the CEO of Freddie  Mac for that matter. She speaks very optimistically about the road ahead  for FNMA, and discusses the lessons learned over the past 15 years. [There](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/fannie-mae-ceo-discusses-government-conservatorship-of-gse) [are](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230137-anticipation-grows-for-end-of-gse-conservatorship?v=preview) [so many god damn](https://www.crefc.org/cre/content/News/Items/advocacy-items/Fannie_Mae_Envisions_Independence_from_Government_Control.aspx) [paywalled  articles from this year or last year in which the CEO and important  people are talking about the end of conservatorship](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230116-the-gses-have-been-profitable-since-2012-maybe-its-time-to-end-the-conservatorships?v=preview). So annoying.   \n\nOptions are not available for these two companies (maybe that has  something to do with the conservatorship, I have no idea), but the  shares I believe are extremely undervalued for what they could become  down the road. Please don't take this as advice.   \n\nI have $2000 invested in both $FNMA and $FMCC for a total of $4000  because that's what I can afford right now.
