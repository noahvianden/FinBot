{"title": "Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain", "selftext": "What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: \"Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.\"  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.\n\nThere are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf\n\nSpeaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.\n\nLESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  \n\nThe vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.\n\nThe next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.\n\nThe best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.\n\nPositions:   \nShort the Stock\n$5 puts expiring 11/15.\n\ntl;dr: I'm terminally stupid, hate pools, and no one should listen to me.", "id": "1c0pinl", "created_utc": 1712765876.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 15 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.026723941788077354}, {"body": "The real question is; Would having AIDS in the water be a bullish or bearish signal?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "RIP Habbo Hotel.
