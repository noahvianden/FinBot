Netflix has scale, Disney has scale & a diverse hand (Hulu, D+, ESPN+), Max leads market in quality. As for Paramount+ & Peacock! they seem like money pits to me.* \n\n***This comes from the*** [***Hollywood Reporter***](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/comcast-earnings-peacock-loss-2023-nbcuniversal-1235805822/)***: CFO Jason Armstrong on Peacock:*** \n\n*Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong told analysts during a morning call that the 3 million new Peacock subscribers during the latest financial quarter came in part from viewers drawn to NFL and Big Ten football games, without specifying actual numbers. NBCU\u2019s loss related to Peacock amounted to $825 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a year-ago loss of $978 million on revenue of $660 million.*  \n*Cavanagh during the conference call talked up Peacock streaming a Saturday night wildcard NFL playoff game, which averaged 23 million viewers on the flagship online platform, local NBC affiliates in the teams\u2019 home markets and on the NFL+ mobile app.*  \n*\u201cOur investment in the network and our technology platforms built over decades enabled us to shine, delivering a seamless experience on the Internet and Peacock, demonstrating that our company is in an excellent position to win in this era of high bandwidth,\u201d he told analysts.* \n\n*To additionally bolster Peacock, Cavanagh reiterated that Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar-nominated Oppenheimer biopic will exclusively stream on Peacock from Feb. 16, well after its theatrical release from July 2023. And he touted the 2024 Olympics set to stream on Peacock live, with many of the events also airing live on NBC and other NBCUniversal TV platforms.*  \n*Cavanagh called Peacock \u201cthe fastest growing streamer in the U.S.,\u201d as he looked beyond continuing operating losses to leveraging the streamer as part an overall and expanding TV offering for consumers across a range of NBCUniversal platforms treated as one holistic ecosystem. CFO Armstrong told analysts: \u201c2023 marked the peak in annual losses at Peacock and for 2024 we expect to show meaningful improvements in losses, versus 2023.\u201d The entertainment conglomerate previously had vowed to reach \u201cpeak losses\u201d at around $2.8 billion for Peacock in 2023, down from $3 billion previously. On Thursday, it disclosed that the 2023 loss had amounted to $2.75 billion. Peacock\u2019s revenue continued to grow in the latest period and for all of 2023.*  \n*Cavanagh told analysts he was more focused on how Peacock was faring amidst NBCUniversal TV\u2019s overall strategy, than on its own. \u201cI\u2019m less focused on what standalone Peacock losses are doing than I am on doing what\u2019s right fro the long term and the totality of the media business, which is linear and streaming. I think we\u2019ve navigated a very good path for us,\u201d he said.*  \n*As legacy media cedes streaming subscriber scale to Netflix, streaming profits have been in focus for Wall Street. For comparison, in its most recent quarter Warner Bros. Discovery posted a $111 million profit for its direct-to-consumer division that includes Max/Discovery+, while Paramount Global disclosed a $424 million streaming loss and Disney lost $387 million on its Disney+/ESPN+/Hulu combined business.*  \n*The latest Peacock updates were part of Comcast\u2019s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report.*\n\n***....................End of Article.....................***\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "19fcdy7", "created_utc": 1706197822.0, "score": 101, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "List of things I would rather do than buy Comcast stock:\n\n* Shower with a bear\n* Adopt a child\n* Learn to play the harp\n* French kiss a hobo\n* Spend all day at the mall with McNabb", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "I almost had a conniption fit about shower beer slander, but no it\u2019s just \ud83c\udf08 slander.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12362765520811081}, {"body": "If it\u2019s Donovan McNabb I may draw the line there, personally.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17266978323459625}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3554597496986389}, {"body": "I think they\u2019re overlooking the housewives franchise, exclusively in peacock.
