However, I invariably have to fiddle with the duration of the back month, the duration of the front month or both to get a decent setup.\n\nSometimes you have to go out longer-dated with the short call than you'd like or start over looking at a shorter-dated 90 long if there's just too much extrinsic in the back month that you'd ideally want to camp out in such that you can sell a 30 delta that pays for all of the extrinsic in the long.
