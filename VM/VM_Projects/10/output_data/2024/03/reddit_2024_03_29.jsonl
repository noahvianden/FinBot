I\u2019m not going to go full deep dive since I\u2019m banging this out on my phone but at a high level the big networking technologies relevant to NVIDIA are:\n\nInfiniBand: nobody else has IB and no one will. They bought Mellanox a few years ago and own the full stack. This is the standard for high performance interconnect for HPC/AI cluster type workloads where low latency is key (Google MPI for bonus reading). There are some alternatives that will never be mainstream OmniPath from Cornelis Networks (formerly Intel) and Slingshot from HPE which is on gen 2 with gen 3 dev way behind schedule. \n\nNVLink which is their chip to chip or GPU to GPU fabric. This exists because PCIe is relatively slow. DGX uses this and you\u2019ll see it listed as SXM and then a generation. Basically 8 GPUs are soldered onto the same PCB. AMD is a ways behind but is going to have similar-ish tech with infinity fabric\n\nDPU/NPU/IPU/xPU these are processors other than GPU or CPU and they\u2019re typically mounted on a NIC. NVIDIA calls theirs Bluefield and it\u2019s been kind of vaporware in the industry so far. BF3 looks real and they\u2019ll force it on you with their SpectrumX Ethernet product line. Net-net these products are about offloading functions from other more expensive compute. Everybody has one, but NVIDIA has the full ecosystem. \n\nEthernet is an open standard for networking and is the most broadly deployed networking tech in the world. Everybody makes this (Broadcom, Juniper, Cisco, NVIDIA, etc). The big problem for Ethernet isn\u2019t bandwidth it\u2019s latency because it\u2019s an old. Which is why InfiniBand is so dominant in HPC. Many big players have formed the Ultra Ethernet Coalition to flatten the Ethernet stack and reduce latency making it more competitive with IB. NVIDIA is not part of the UEC but they could join in the future. NVIDIA does not have a moat in Ethernet. \n\nBroadcom and AMD are working to enable Infinity Fabric over PCIe when PCIe gen 7 launches in 12-18 months. So NVIDIA has plenty of runway and competitive advantage in areas like GPU, IB, software, and ecosystem. \n\nIf I put my WSB hat on I think their biggest threat is how they operate anticompetitively (if a company publicly patchers with AMD or Intel it is well known that NVIDIA will restrict their GPU allocation) and the SEC has been going after big tech (Google, Apple).

Knowing the moneyness of your trade is almost always essential information. I originally thought you had ITM puts that already had a gain. Looks like 160ish is the weighted average, so you're quite a bit OTM, around 20 to 30 delta. Now I'm leaning towards questioning whether you'll make a profit at all, on either date, not how how best to take profits. You also have a significant IV crush risk, which wasn't clear before either. Even if your stock moves happen as expected, you might still lose money to IV crush.\n\nHaving so many contracts also makes a difference. If both dates are profitable as you expect, you don't have to commit the whole trade either way. Close some on 4/2 and let the rest run. You can use the risk/reward analysis I already mentioned to figure out how much to close on 4/2 for the likely outcomes.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1 more question please!

Definitely correct me if im wrong but isnt IV crush negligible for ITM options? Doesnt theta decay slow down significantly as well too for ITM?\n\nIt would be more accurate to say that the more time value in the contract, the more you can be IV crushed. ITM options tend to have less time value than OTM, all else equal, but \"negligible\" would only be true if the time value was also negligible.\n\nBut all of that is beside the point since you have **OTM puts**, not ITM.\n\n> Using my $165 contracts as example. Yes they will experience iv crush, but if the 4/2 event causes them to now be ITM, isnt IV crush a negligible factor for this contract since it will now be ITM?\n\nNot ITM enough, not by a long shot. And in any case, since you bought the puts OTM, that means **100% of the cost basis of the puts is time value, and thus subject to IV crush**. You didn't say how much you paid for them, but you should assume you may lose all of what you paid, so you want the puts to go ITM by at least that much. So if you paid $.69, the puts have to go at least $.69 ITM before you are certain to make a profit. It probably won't be quite that bad, since 5/17 is a lot of time from 4/2, so some time value will survive, you probably won't lose 100% in your scenario.

It can be any strike, but the success is behind getting all the symbols as close as possible to each other.  This tool represents the Pure Value of the option relative to some peers & the Index ETF (not just the option price).  \n**BLUE PVI-** indicates the strike is trading at 1/2 the PVI of the Index ETF. They are at a 2:1, DEEP DISCOUNT relative to the ETF! It is not advisable to SELL BLUE (you're not getting the premium for your RISK)  \n**WHITE PVI-** are trading at a DISCOUNT, relative to the Index ETF (QQQ or SPY)  \n**ORANGE PVI-** trading at a PREMIUM, relative to the Index ETF (QQQ or SPY)  \n**RED PVI-** trading at an Extreme PREMIUM...the RED PVI are more than 2x the Index ETF.

This table is from Thursday's closing option prices and will change at the opening bell on Monday. I'm primarily interested in BUYING BLUE & WHITE options as a swing trade for the week. Each set of Delta strikes may differ in their comparison. An example could be that AAPL 40 Delta might be White or Orange and have different values relative to the Index ETF or its peers.\n\n**Hypothetical Example for next week:**  \nSay you're Bullish & interested in AMZN, MSFT, and NFLX for next week.  Delta might use this analysis for LONG CALLS-  \n$AMZN 185 Calls ($0.55) 20D have a PVI rating of 28  \n$MSFT 430 Calls ($0.86) 18D have a PVI rating of 65  \n$NFLX 632.5 Calls ($1.52) 14D have a PVI rating of 104 (don't BUY Red)  \nAMZN is the best value relative to the $QQQ 453 Calls ($0.57):  \nPrice .55 vs .57 (QQQ)  \nDelta 20 vs 15 (QQQ)  \nPVI 28 vs 39 (QQQ)  \nand you can do the same by comparing AMZN PVI to the PVI for MSFT & NFLX.  \n28 / 65 (1:2 relative to MSFT)  \n28 / 104 1:3.5 relative to NFLX)  \n  \nFor THETA, the INVERSE is True for SELLING (don't SELL BLUE)!!!  If you still had those 3 stocks on your radar, you would look at the ratios on selling opposite side puts where NFLX (106), is higher than MSFT (69) is higher than AMZN (29)\n\nHave a Blessed Easter weekend, and feel free to ask questions  \n-Vet  \n**#TradersHelpingTraders**", "id": "1bqw6sm", "created_utc": 1711736303.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "It's a concept...I still need to run all the PVI Models and data to see where they finalize for the PVI Spreadsheet.  \nBut on the OPM, the PVI ratio is all I care about to know where VALUE truly exists from the Options Pricing vantage point...it's an Apples to Apples comparison.
