{"title": "Simple Breakdown of Future Businesses", "selftext": "With all the negativity around I figured I'd just write some thoughts about Tesla's future businesses and why I'm optimistic.\n\n**Insurance:** when you're a company with tens of millions of cars on the road that you repair yourself and can modify the car and reduce repair costs in-house, plus you have cameras all over the very cars you are insurance, that sounds like a pretty advantageous setup for this business doing well in the future.\n\n**Energy:** Some people claim 'the margins will dry up,' but with lithium refining, battery manufacture, scale, software, inverters and other technology, experience, and auto-bidding, there is a lot more than just 'putting batteries in a box.' If Tesla adds value and their vertically integrated supply chain and battery manufacture plus long term battery supply negotiation means they pay less per KWH than competitors, their margins should be fine. This business grew 125% last year and should be huge in the future.\n\n**Autonomous Cars:** Is there a good case that somebody else might crack this before Tesla? Probably not. The 'Data Moat' of having millions of cars with cameras on the road, plus Apple giving up, the likelihood that someone else with a dearth of data and without tens of millions (in a few years) cars on the road is going to beat Tesla to this is highly unlikely. Even if it takes a while, the 'Tesla will be first to car autonomy' idea is still intact.\n\n**Humanoid Robots:** The stuff FigureAI and some other companies are making seems pretty impressive, but being a massive manufacturer already gives two HUGE advantages.\n\n1. You are more likely to be able to cheapen and scale up production of the robot\n2. The car manufacturing business makes you for first customer. The fact that Tesla could operate even at a loss for a few years ironing out the kinks and adopt+practice using their own robots at mass scale gives them a huge advantage. Then also: It is likely that only the humanoid robotics companies who are also highly proficient in AI are going to win (leaving OpenAI and Tesla)\n\n**PowerWall:** CATL says battery costs will drop 50%/kwh in the next year or so. I think people are going to be surprised how cheap and performant green energy/batteries are going to be within the next few years. We're at this inflection point where green stuff is competitive with, but not profoundly better than the alternatives. In a few years, the economics will be so tilted that one would be stupid to not use wind, solar, batteries. If enormous numbers of people get on powerwalls that dream of Tesla autobidder + powerwall + solar panels essentially becoming like a power utility sounds possible.\n\n**Then a huge catalyst** - as the AI revolution continues, many people are speculating that electricity is going to become the bottleneck for training AI models. We're going to 2x-3x our energy needs in not that long.\n\nThere are out-sized returns on making wind turbines larger - the largest wind turbines are starting to generate 16MW of power. This means that only 60 of them are as good as a full blown Nuclear power plant.\n\nA Nuclear Power Plant costs $2-10/MW  \nLarge wind turbines cost $1.2M/MW\n\nIf wind turbines keep improving, the economics of Wind Turbines + Megapacks is going to be insane.\n\n20% of US energy is renewable already. Investment, capability, and cost per MH are all improving rapidly. You only need to double that a few times and you're literally >100% of our current total production in renewables.\n\nWe're at the beginning of some serious Tony Seba style shenanigans.", "id": "1bfm48t", "created_utc": 1710530589.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "These are some really good points and I like the idea that AI demand drives energy demand which then means more profits for Tesla and higher margins for longer.\n\nRe Insurance what happened to it?

They can also improve their own insurance margins by preventing accidents with software.\n\nAll of this sounds like a dynamo that is going to recursively improve and improve its business in a way no other car insurance company can.\n\nWhen there are10x as many Teslas on the road in 7-10 years, it will probably make more sense to push hard to expand availability from the 12 to all 50 states. 10x as many cars, available in 5x as many states, with higher % adoption.\n\nThey might choose to never have good margins on their insurance - having very cheap very good first party insurance could be a selling point making people want to buy the cars.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Cheaper to repair a tesla?

Watch for ex-divi dates as the shares can be called away for the buyer to collect the dividend, but by not letting trades for longer past the 50% profit and rolling if needed, it should have enough extrinsic value to avoid being called away for the divi. To be 100% sure this doesn't happen would be to time the CCs to not be open over the ex-div date.\n\nAs another post indicates, the wheel is where you sell puts to collect premiums without being assigned, but if assigned then sell CCs on the shares.
