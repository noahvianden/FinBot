Despite what experienced people with very good grasps of money will recommend, feel free to have a bigger savings account of 1 to 2 years, especially if you're inexperienced and don't have a firm grasp of your spending or just financials as a whole. Everyone is different and if you're taking lots of risk in life, like experimenting with a career where you can easily not get paid for half a year or longer, focus on not being taken out financially first before investing.\n\nNext, for long term, invest in low cost, total market index funds like ETFs, and slowly shift towards bonds as you reach retirement. Recessions will kill countless promising companies, big or small. But the market as a whole always recovers, and investing in a good low cost total market ETF will make you beat 80% if professional investors in your lifetime, and probably 90+% of active investors on communities like this that discuss individual stocks, without even needing to think or read anything.\n\nWhen recessions come, do not sell your total market ETFs. That's where your savings account comes in. It'll push you through financial difficulties without selling the assets that have the most potential to grow. If possible, invest more into these ETFs when they drop during recessions, but only if possible. Do not go into debt with investments.\n\nFinally, if you want to gamble money to scratch that itch, feel free to dump it into individual stocks like NVDA, and know full well it'll go up and down, and perhaps stay down when you desperately need to cash out. \n\nThat's just the reality of how it works. You'll find many people get mad at hearing the boring, tried and true methods, but it is what it is.

This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.\n\nAt the time of this post, Google stock is currently down 4.26%.\n\nSource: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/google-loses-doj-antitrust-suit-over-search?srnd=homepage-americas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/google-loses-doj-antitrust-suit-over-search?srnd=homepage-americas)", "id": "1ekwv7v", "created_utc": 1722886434.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "This is bad for Apple and Samsung, not Google.

{"title": "How does VIX correlate to the market and what does it mean?", "selftext": "Hey reddit, I had 2 main questions:\n\n1. Recently the VIX hit 60+, levels only seen during during the dotcom bubble, '08 and covid. Generally the vix just shows volatility so here it means stocks can fluctuate +/-60% (I understand that's not exactly it but for simplicity sake) but historically it basically just means stocks will crash. Volatility works both ways but you would never see markets rally 10% let alone higher levels  when VIX is so high so why do people say it can mean fluctuations (implying down or UP movements) when it exclusively has only related to the down movements?\n\n\n2. I saw people online saying that when the VIX was at severe lows in the 10s in 2021, that the top was in and the market was gonna crash. How is this possible because doesn't this mean less volatility which is a good thing? Less volatility = less fluctuating = better chance of simply trading sideways no? Is it because there's no volatility/movement most people will take their profits so it goes down? Because by this logic when VIX is low its a bad sign when VIX is high its a bad sign, then what the hell is it good for?\n\nSome basic ideas I just want to say before the comments roll in, I understand the vix = volatility isn't that simple and technically it's the rolling average of options prices for the next 30 days etc etc, but in an eli5 sense sources can equate VIX to volatility with the idea that it's inversely correlated to the market and historically this simple explanation seems true.\n\nIn addition, I understand in isolation the VIX doesn't mean much, I'm not basing my entire thesis off of just this index however I'm simply trying to get a better understanding of how it operates. \n\nThank you for the help and I apologize if I made any mistakes!", "id": "1ekmz51", "created_utc": 1722862281.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "VIX is simply an indicator of implied volatility in SPY options.

{"title": "Global Asset Bust | Yen Carry Trade Unwind Explainer", "selftext": "# Background\n\nA yen carry trade is a popular currency trading strategy that involves borrowing money in Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing it in assets or currencies with higher yields. Here are the key aspects of a yen carry trade:\n\n1. Mechanism: Investors borrow yen at Japan's low interest rates and convert it to another currency, typically investing in higher-yielding assets like stocks, bonds, or currencies of countries with higher interest rates.\n2. Popularity: The yen has been a favored currency for carry trades because Japan has maintained near-zero interest rates for over two decades to combat deflation.\n3. Profitability: The strategy aims to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the target investment country. For example, borrowing at 0.5% in Japan and investing at 4% in the US could yield a 3.5% profit (before accounting for exchange rate fluctuations).\n4. Risk: The main risk is exchange rate fluctuations. If the yen strengthens against the investment currency, it can erode or eliminate profits and potentially lead to losses.\n5. Market impact: Large-scale yen carry trades can influence global financial markets. When the yen strengthens significantly, investors may rush to unwind their positions, potentially causing volatility in various asset classes, including equities.\n6. Historical context: Yen carry trades have been partly blamed for contributing to market instability, such as during the 2008 financial crisis.\n7. Current relevance: Recent strengthening of the yen and changes in Bank of Japan policy have led to speculation about the unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially affecting global markets, including US equities.\n\nIt's important to note that while yen carry trades can be profitable, they also carry significant risks and can have far-reaching effects on global financial markets.\n\n# Relationship with Big Tech Stocks\n\nThe yen carry trade is a sophisticated financial strategy that involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing in higher-yielding assets. This approach has gained popularity due to Japan's long-standing policy of maintaining near-zero interest rates to combat deflation. One common application of this strategy is selling yen to buy U.S. big tech stocks. \n\nTo initiate a yen carry trade, a trader first borrows yen from a Japanese bank. Japan's low interest rates make borrowing yen an attractive option for investors seeking to leverage their investments. Once the yen is borrowed, the next step is to convert it into U.S. dollars. This can be accomplished through a currency exchange service or a forex trading platform. For instance, if a trader borrows 10 million yen at an interest rate of 0.1%, and the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 110 JPY, the trader would exchange the 10 million yen for approximately $90,909.With the U.S. dollars in hand, the trader then invests in U.S. big tech stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft, or Google. These companies are often chosen because they are expected to yield higher returns compared to the cost of borrowing the yen. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States, as well as the potential appreciation of the tech stocks. However, this strategy is not without risks. \n\nOne significant risk is exchange rate fluctuation. If the yen appreciates against the dollar, the trader may incur losses when converting the dollars back to yen to repay the loan. Additionally, there is market risk, as the value of the U.S. tech stocks may decline, leading to potential investment losses. Furthermore, changes in interest rates in Japan or the U.S. can impact the profitability of the carry trade. For example, if U.S. interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing yen may become less attractive, reducing the potential gains from the investment.Recent market conditions have added another layer of complexity to the yen carry trade. The yen has been strengthening, and there are growing concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. This has led to a mass deleveraging, where investors sell assets, including U.S. tech stocks, to cover their losses and repay yen-denominated loans.\n\n# Bank of Japan Raised Interest Rate to the 0.25 on July 31, 2024\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/)\n\n# The Yen Carry Trade Unwind\n\nThe Bank of Japan's recent decision to raise interest rates to 0.25% has triggered a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy that has long influenced global financial markets.  This policy made the yen an attractive currency for carry trades, where investors borrow yen at low rates and invest in higher-yielding assets abroad, often including U.S. big tech stocks. The profitability of this strategy relies on the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries, as well as the relative stability of exchange rates.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's move to raise interest rates, although still low by global standards, signals a shift towards normalizing monetary policy. This change has profound implications for the yen carry trade. As the interest rate differential narrows, the profitability of the carry trade diminishes, prompting investors to unwind their positions.The unwinding process typically involves selling the assets purchased with borrowed yen and converting the proceeds back to yen to repay the loans. In the context of U.S. big tech stocks, which have been a favored destination for carry trade investments, this means large-scale selling of these equities.\u00a0\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index, home to many of these big tech stocks, often experiences heightened volatility during such periods.The impact of this unwinding extends beyond just the stock market. As investors rush to close their positions, demand for yen increases, causing the currency to appreciate. This appreciation further accelerates the unwinding process, as it makes the carry trade even less profitable and potentially leads to losses for those who don't exit their positions quickly enough.The ripple effects of this unwinding can be felt across global financial markets. As large volumes of U.S. tech stocks are sold, it can lead to broader market selloffs. \n\n# Forced Selling\n\nThe recent decision by the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to 0.25% has led to a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow yen at low-interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets. This unwinding is driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and substantial price drawdowns in the assets being sold off, particularly U.S. big tech stocks.\n\n.The yen carry trade relies on the stability or depreciation of the yen and low-interest rates in Japan. Investors borrow yen at minimal costs, convert it to U.S. dollars, and invest in assets like U.S. big tech stocks, which offer higher returns. However, the recent appreciation of the yen and the narrowing interest rate differential between Japan and the U.S. have made this strategy less profitable. As the yen strengthens, the cost of repaying yen-denominated loans increases, eroding the gains from investments in higher-yielding assets .The depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar has exacerbated the situation.\n\n When the yen appreciates, investors who borrowed in yen face higher costs when converting their returns back to yen to repay their loans. This scenario forces investors to unwind their positions to avoid mounting losses. The process of unwinding involves selling off the assets purchased with borrowed yen, such as U.S. big tech stocks, and converting the proceeds back to yen. This forced selling creates downward pressure on the prices of these assets, leading to significant price drawdowns.The large price drawdowns in U.S. big tech stocks are a direct consequence of this forced selling. As investors rush to liquidate their positions, the increased supply of stocks on the market drives prices down. This selloff is not necessarily a reflection of the underlying fundamentals of these companies but rather a reaction to the changing dynamics of the yen carry trade. \n\nThe sharp declines in stock prices can trigger further selling as investors seek to cut their losses, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of declining asset prices and rising yen value. The broader implications of the yen carry trade unwinding are significant. The forced selling of U.S. big tech stocks can lead to increased volatility in global financial markets. As these stocks are widely held and influential in major indices, their price movements can impact market sentiment and investor behavior across various asset classes. Additionally, the appreciation of the yen can have ripple effects on other currencies and markets, as investors adjust their positions in response to the changing exchange rate environment.\n\n# TLDR;\n\nThe Bank of Japan's interest rate hike to 0.25% has triggered a substantial unwinding of the yen carry trade, driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and significant price drawdowns in the assets being sold off. This forced selling has led to increased volatility in U.S. big tech stocks and broader financial markets, highlighting the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the far-reaching consequences of changes in monetary policy.", "id": "1ekm6al", "created_utc": 1722859834.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 583 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cso979/barrick_gold_gold_bull_case/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cujnts/petrodollar_recycling_into_gold_instead_of_us/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eifepq/intc_2026_leap_bull_case/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ekm6al/global_asset_bust_yen_carry_trade_unwind_explainer/) \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41494035720825195}, {"body": "my brain grew some wrinkles ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) but it doesn't change the fact that my portfolio is underwater ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1664201021194458}, {"body": "Holy Hell WTF is this Chat GPT generated nonsense?  \nI dare you to repeat once more that \"...a trader borrows low interest Yen and invest it in stock, bonds, or...\"", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6114574670791626}, {"body": "Better run this through ChatGPT a few more times", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.019379623234272003}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.010842453688383102}, {"body": "Put prices ??", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Too late, implied vol has spiked.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34777945280075073}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14336813986301422}, {"body": "I asked for an extra large McFlurry, not medium.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.07882186025381088}, {"body": "Thanks.

{"title": "CRE crash incoming?", "selftext": "* Commercial properties are financed almost solely, even by big investment firms.\n* interest-only loans, typically for 5-7 years.\n* This allows them to leverage their investment by making only interest payments.\n* Monthly payments cover only interest, not the principal.\n* These loans require 50% equity ownership. For a $200M building, they put up $100M, and the bank finances the other $100M at 3.25% for 5 years.\n* Monthly interest payments are $270K, deductible as a business expense.\n* After 5 years, the building\u2019s value might appreciate to $232M, a 3% return.\n* They\u2019ve paid $16.2M in interest, used as a tax deduction.\n* The property increased in value by $32M, but they still owe $100M in principal.\n* If the building\u2019s value drops to $80M, they can\u2019t refinance for the original $100M loan.\n* Without the ability to refinance, owners must pay off the remaining $100M principal out of pocket.\n* Many owners won\u2019t have the cash, leading to foreclosures.\n* Banks won\u2019t offer a $100M loan on a property now worth $80M.\n* Foreclosures increase, further depressing property values.\n* High vacancies and falling rents make it hard to cover building costs and interest payments.\n\nFrom what I can see commercial loans expire 5-7 years and most are due in 2024 and 2025 so the defaults are coming:\n\n\u2022 Office building owners are defaulting.\n\n\u2022 Many office building loans are non-recourse, allowing owners to return the buildings to the banks instead of paying the loan.\n\n\u2022 Banks only receive the building in such cases.\n\n\u2022 The buildings are often worth less than the loans.\n\n\u2022 Banks are taking losses on these loans.\n\n\u2022 Regional banks are already suffering from misplaying interest rates.\n\n1 Interest rates skyrocketing \u00a0\n\n2 Construction pricing (labor and materials) continuing to increase (maybe flattened out now but not at a sustainable place)\n\n3 Tenant demand at all-time lows\u00a0\n\n4 Financing impossible to get (re-fi or new)\n\nBanks are issuing loans generously, despite significant risks due to fluctuating interest rates, leading to increased leverage and higher risk. Interest-only loans for five years exacerbate the issue as building owners eventually face principal repayments, which banks are ill-equipped to cover. The insufficient interest rates for high-value buildings further expose banks to risks, necessitating continuous liquidity measures that may lead to faster defaults, echoing the 2008 financial crisis. Balance sheets reflect struggles with deposits and liquidity, with banks like Zion National Bank showing high CRE exposure and significant losses. The failure of FRC highlights the dangers of high exposure to luxury CRE and inadequate capital adequacy. Smaller properties and residential units face higher interest rates due to perceived higher risks, but high-value properties get lower rates, which isn't sustainable at scale.\n\nhere is an example bank and the research associated to it based on the most recent 10-K filing:\n\n**PFS:NYSE**\n\nProvident Bank's CRE loans, including multi-family and construction loans, totaled $6.98 billion, which is 64.81% of their total loan portfolio.\n\n**Breakdown of CRE Loans:**\n\nMulti-family: $2.31 billion (33.1%)\n\nRetail: $1.80 billion (25.8%)\n\nIndustrial: $1.33 billion (19.0%)\n\nOffice: $505.9 million (7.2%)\n\nMixed: $456.2 million (6.5%)\n\nSpecial use property: $231.1 million (3.3%)\n\nResidential: $161.9 million (2.3%)\n\nHotel: $151.2 million (2.2%)\n\nLand: $36.7 million (0.5%)\n\n**Total Mortgage Loans:**\n\nWithin One Year: $951.7 million\n\nOne Through Five Years: $2.84 billion\n\nFive Through Fifteen Years: $3.23 billion\n\nGreater than Fifteen Years: $1.12 billion\n\nTotal: $8.14 billion\n\n**Commercial Mortgage Loans:**\n\nWithin One Year: $463.9 million\n\nOne Through Five Years: $1.91 billion\n\nFive Through Fifteen Years: $1.92 billion\n\nGreater than Fifteen Years: $211.2 million\n\nTotal: $4.51 billion\n\n**Multi-family Mortgage Loans:**\n\nWithin One Year: $109.1 million\n\nOne Through Five Years: $700.5 million\n\nFive Through Fifteen Years: $899.9 million\n\nGreater than Fifteen Years: $103.1 million\n\nTotal: $1.81 billion\n\n**Construction Loans:**\n\nWithin One Year: $376.9 million\n\nOne Through Five Years: $208.0 million\n\nFive Through Fifteen Years: $67.8 million\n\nGreater than Fifteen Years: $0.5 million\n\nTotal: $653.2 million\n\n**Loan Type and Risk**\n\nCommercial Real Estate Loans totaled 41.9% of the total loan portfolio.\n\nConstruction and land development portfolio balance to capital ratio was approximately 47%.\n\nMulti-family Loans: Accounted for 16.8% of the total loan portfolio.\n\n**Commercial Mortgage Loans:**\n\nFixed-Rate: $2.24 billion\n\nAdjustable-Rate: $1.81 billion\n\nTotal: $4.05 billion\n\n**Multi-family Mortgage Loans:**\n\nFixed-Rate: $748.8 million\n\nAdjustable-Rate: $954.6 million\n\nTotal: $1.70 billion\n\n**Construction Loans:**\n\nFixed-Rate: $48.7 million\n\nAdjustable-Rate: $227.6 million\n\nTotal: $276.3 million\n\n**Geographic Concentration**\n\nThe bank's lending is predominantly in New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and Nassau and Queens, New York\n\n", "id": "1ekvclb", "created_utc": 1722882834.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.1181267499923706}, {"body": "The government wants lower rates.

Influenced by a purge of large-cap tech, every market indicator has signs pointing towards a large correction.\n\nThis leads me to wonder -\u00a0**is investing in artificial intelligence just a trendy pick or will it produce tangible returns?**\u00a0On Monday, August 5th, Bloomberg reported that Nvidia fell 12%, Apple lost 9.3%, Amazon dropped 7.4%, and Meta lost 7.6%. This is an unprecedented sell-off in both scale and range. All 4 companies have recently re-committed to pushing out an increased amount of bleeding-edge artificial intelligence that powers their products. These Silicon Valley giants are getting hammered - and when and will the rout end?\n\nIt will end, right?\n\nInvestors are starting to question if artificial intelligence is worth the investment. Despite looming worries,\u00a0**artificial intelligence is the most sure-fire investment of the 21st century.**\u00a0Denying that there is a future where artificial intelligence is integrated in namely every facet of daily life is simply ridiculous. Nearly every major corporation uses it in conjunction with analysts to efficiently run scalable operations. Every phone, computer, and piece of technology has some type of artificial intelligence running in the background. However, the volatility in the short-term can sometimes prove to be turn-offs when considering how to structure a small and mid-sized portfolio. No non-tech sector can boast such gaudy returns over time. Day-to-day, the tech bubble may appear to crack, but long-term, it will never pop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wd0k1ptiwgd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ded64f498ff60ccea468c0ef14830ae178bcb611\n\nFrom CNN: \"Some investors had even anticipated that this would be the quarter that tech giants would start to signal that they were backing off their AI infrastructure investments since 'AI is not delivering the returns that they were expecting.' \\[But\\] the opposite happened \u2014 Google, Microsoft and Meta all signaled that they plan to spend even more as they lay the groundwork for what they hope is an AI future.\"\n\nIts use in analytics and everyday products has proved its effectiveness. Google, Microsoft, and Meta are correctly doubling-down and seizing the infinitely large-sized market. It is certainly a hefty investment, but I believe that it is a necessary one to set-up future success. The gap between this mega-cap tech market and everyone else will only continue to grow as AI is refined and polished.\n\nTL;DR: AI is a very risk-heavy investment.
