{"title": "Apple Intelligence Has a Long Way to Go to Match Its Marketing Hype ", "selftext": "Selected Excerpts:\n\n> \u201cAfter testing the first beta version\u00a0of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the features don\u2019t yet live up to the excitement. In their current state, they\u2019re a far cry from the game-changing technology that fans and investors hope Apple Intelligence will become.\u201d\n\n> \u201cYou even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.\u201d**\n\n> \u201cLet me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\n> Now, it\u2019s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve\u00a0it over the next few months. But I suspect that\u00a0we\u2019re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around\u00a0October.\u00a0\n\n> \u201cI found the ability to summarize emails\u00a0to be useful:\u00a0It provided an excellent distillation of the message\u2019s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email.\u00a0But the summaries of text message conversations \u2014\u00a0particularly for fast-moving group chats \u2014\u00a0were\u00a0a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don\u2019t foresee that being a particularly popular feature.\u00a0\u201c\n\n> \u201cThe most impressive features so far are\u00a0Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools\u00a0are\u00a0essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that\u2019s been available\u00a0on Android phones for a while now.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe most impressive features so far are\u00a0Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries.

It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that\u2019s been available\u00a0on Android phones for a while now.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don\u2019t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just\u00a0the last message in the thread.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get\u00a0a transcript of the conversation\u00a0as well as\u00a0a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It\u2019s certainly a nice time saver.\u201d\n\n> \u201cType to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIn any case, these\u00a0are mainly\u00a0niceties, not necessities.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThere is nothing so compelling yet\u00a0that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.\u201d\n\n> \u201cSome key\u00a0Apple Intelligence features aren\u2019t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. \n\n> \u201cUsers will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.\u201d\n\n> \u201cBut even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up.

What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
