The company works as follows: The software division offers a marketplace, among other less important services, where companies can advertise on their apps, and other companies can place ads for their apps. These desired ads are then sorted by an in-house AI called \"Axon,\" which ensures the ads reach the appropriate viewers.\n\nWhat makes this AI special is that it is fed with data from 700 million mobile gamers, which, according to the company, makes it very effective.\n\nThe software division is currently growing by about 50% annually, and in the last quarter, revenue grew by 37%.\n\nNaturally, AppLovin has very good margins, with a gross margin of 70% and a net income margin of 20%. I also foresee growth in the net income margin through cost-cutting.\n\nIn the mobile app ad business, AppLovin is well-regarded despite large competitors like Google, and it is used by many developers, overshadowing other providers like Unity.\n\nThe CEO is also the founder and holds a significant number of shares. It's also positive for shareholders that the company is buying back shares\u20142.5% last year and 6.6% TTM.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, there are also negative points:\n\nI have studied the company for a long time and found some things that I don't find ideal for an investment. Regarding ad publishers, I've seen studies showing that companies make more money when they advertise through Google's program (AdMob) than with AppLovin. I've also seen many reviews where people described how their AppLovin account, which they used to run ads on their apps, was suddenly banned without any notice or warning.\n\nIn itself, I don't believe these individual issues will impact revenue, but I fear this might just be the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI also fear headwinds from privacy changes by Apple or even competition from Google.\n\nFor me personally, I think I\u2019ll buy a small position at first because this way, I have less risk.

Infineon Technologies AG CEO Jochen Hanebeck said that China\u2019s resilience helped the German chipmaker\u2019s bottom line even as a broader recovery from the EV slump remains elusive. For Texas Instruments Inc., China business is up as much as 20% across all five of its product markets.\n\nDeepening engagement with China could become a double-edged sword for these chipmakers as geopolitical tensions expand into the automotive arena. The European Union and the US have imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports and Beijing is threatening a response. Now, even supplies of mature, so-called legacy chips are under scrutiny in Washington and Brussels.\n\nUS-China tensions over technology have to date focused on Washington\u2019s efforts to curb Beijing\u2019s access to leading-edge semiconductors and the equipment used to make them. That\u2019s prompted a Chinese push to build out its technological self-sufficiency, notably in automotive chips. Since these don\u2019t depend on the latest manufacturing processes and are largely unaffected by US export controls, there\u2019s little to stop China from ramping up their development, and displacing foreign chipmakers down the line.\n\n\u201cJust as a strong automotive industry in the EU has supported European leaders in automotive chips such as Infineon, NXP and STMicroelectronics, the world-leading expansion of China\u2019s EV industry is boosting development of Chinese vendors of such chips,\u201d researchers John Lee and Jan-Peter Kleinhans wrote in a recent report for the German Council on Foreign Relations. That helps Chinese carmakers become more competitive, \u201cwith potentially major impacts for European firms and national economies,\u201d they said. Automotive chips, a market McKinsey forecasts will be worth $150 billion by 2030, is one area of the semiconductor industry where Europe punches above its weight. Its expansion is due to increasingly sophisticated technology that\u2019s turning cars, and especially EVs, into computers on wheels, with climate control, infotainment, self-driving functions and safety features now completely dependent on the tiny electronic components.\n\nChina is both the largest producer and the world\u2019s biggest market for EVs: Shenzhen-based BYD Co. reported deliveries of a record 340,800 passenger vehicles in July, up 31% from the same month last year. Yet Chinese manufacturers mostly rely on foreign companies for the multiple chips that modern high-end cars require, including sensors, power chips for regulating the flow of electricity, and microcontroller units, or MCUs, which are effectively small computers used for functions like braking.\n\nChina\u2019s automotive chipmakers can only meet about 10% of domestic demand at present, according to Lee and Kleinhans. That\u2019s a boon for Infineon, NXP and French-Italian concern STMicroelectronics NV, which each earn about a third of their revenue from China. For Renesas Electronics Corp. of Japan and Texas Instruments, two of the other main players, it\u2019s about 25% and 20%, respectively.\n\nThe Chinese government has asked EV firms such as BYD and Nio to increase their purchases from local auto chipmakers, and most new chip fabrication plants being built in China are for automotive. As a result, the European Commission is raising concerns that its chipmakers are at risk of losing substantial market share in China, Bloomberg News reported in June.\n\nWhile quarterly results are not usually broken down by region, presentations made to investors this season offer some insight into just how critical China is to European chipmakers, especially in the current challenging times: Shares in Tokyo-based Renesas fell the most in more than 15 years on July 25 after its operating profit underwhelmed.\n\nInfineon\u2019s Hanebeck, reporting disappointing third-quarter sales on Aug. 5, cited \u201ctepid\u201d demand in Western markets while singling out China as a bright spot witnessing \u201chealthy consumer demand, which helps us particularly given our No. 1 automotive market position there.\u201d STMicro, while lowering its revenue forecast, sending its stock down the most in four years, stressed the potential upside of a long-term agreement announced in June with China\u2019s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. to supply it with silicon carbide power devices for EVs, along with a joint lab \u201cto share knowledge and explore innovative solutions.\u201d\n\nThat follows a joint venture it announced last year with Sanan Optoelectronics for silicon carbide device manufacturing in China. Germany\u2019s Robert Bosch GmbH, another autochip player, meanwhile signed a $1 billion, 10-year contract for the development of silicon-carbide power modules in Suzhou, China. Also last year, Volkswagen AG announced a joint venture with China-based autonomous driving chip developer Horizon Robotics.\n\n\u201cEuropean auto chipmakers appear to be following in the footsteps of German automakers in choosing to deepen partnerships with Chinese entities as an insurance policy in the China market,\u201d Rhodium Group researchers led by Reva Goujon said in a May report.\n\nThe question is whether either the EU or the US is ready to act against China\u2019s capacity to produce its own autochips. In April, the EU-US Trade and Technology Council expressed concerns aimed at China about \u201cnon-market economic policies and practices\u201d that may lead to excessive dependencies for legacy chips, saying they may develop \u201cjoint or cooperative measures\u201d to address distortionary effects. For Goujon, though, European joint ventures with China \u2014 what she calls \u201centanglements\u201d \u2014 make it less likely that countries like Germany \u201cwould endorse economic security measures that entail unwinding transactions in China \u2014 unless they were already losing significant market share, revenue, and jobs in the Chinese market with little left to lose.\u201d\n\nChipmakers are of course aware of the dangers, but at least in public they have adopted varying degrees of concern. \u201cWe all know that Chinese local competition is coming,\u201d starting with \u201clow-end\u201d MCUs, NXP\u2019s Sievers said July 23. His answer is to push his company\u2019s development into higher performance processors.\n\nChina\u2019s attempts to localize its chip supply will \u201cbe a slow process given foreign chipmakers still offer quality and reliability,\u201d which are particularly important assets in the automotive market, said Ken Hui, a senior technology analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Given that China is adding more chip manufacturing capacity than the rest of the world combined, it may be only a matter of time before it catches up.\n\nTexas Instruments CEO Haviv Ilan certainly sounds far from sanguine about China. While he said July 24 that \u201cwe can compete and we can win business,\u201d he acknowledged that competition was growing stronger. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake for us to think that these guys are only doing, you know, simple parts,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are very ambitious, highly educated competitors.\u201d", "id": "1eprqnl", "created_utc": 1723400787.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
