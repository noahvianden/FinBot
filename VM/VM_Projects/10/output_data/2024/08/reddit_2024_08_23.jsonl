{"title": "I asked ChatGPT to write a PSA for college kids trading NVDA options", "selftext": "Bruce had always been the quiet, introspective type, a college student more comfortable with his textbooks than with the loud, chaotic social scene around him. He was majoring in computer science, pouring over algorithms and code, and had developed a keen interest in technology stocks. The world of tech was booming, and Bruce had been carefully watching Nvidia (NVDA), a company at the forefront of AI and gaming technology.\n\nHe first heard about Nvidia through a friend in one of his programming classes. \"Man, if you want to get rich quick, you've got to try options trading,\" his friend had said one afternoon as they worked on a project together. Bruce had never traded options before, but the idea intrigued him. The potential for big gains in a short amount of time seemed like a golden opportunity, especially since he'd been hearing so much about how Nvidia was poised for explosive growth.\n\nBruce spent hours reading up on options, learning the terminology, and watching videos on how to trade them. The risk was high, but the potential reward was intoxicating. After much deliberation, he decided to take the plunge. He scraped together his savings, a modest sum he'd earned from a part-time job and some money his parents had given him for emergencies. It was risky, but Bruce felt it was a calculated gamble.\n\nHe bought $140 out-of-the-money (OTM) NVDA call options, which were set to expire in just a week. The price of Nvidia shares was currently at $130, and Bruce was betting that it would surge past $140 in the next few days. If it did, his options would be worth a fortune. The excitement and anxiety were palpable as he placed the order, his heart racing with the thrill of potentially striking it rich.\n\nBut the market is a fickle beast, and Bruce soon found himself in a downward spiral. The following days were brutal. Instead of the surge Bruce had hoped for, Nvidia's stock started to dip. The initial drop was small, but with every passing day, the price inched further away from his strike price. $129, $127, $125\u2014each tick down felt like a punch to the gut. \n\nAs the days went by, Bruce\u2019s anxiety turned into sheer panic. The value of his options was eroding rapidly, and with the expiration date looming, he could see his dream of making a big profit slipping through his fingers. He turned to Reddit, joining options trading forums to seek solace and advice. But instead of finding comfort, Bruce found himself lashing out. He began spamming the forums, posting repeatedly that buying the $140 NVDA calls had been a huge mistake. \"This was the worst decision of my life,\" he typed angrily. \"If this thing drops below $100, I'm dumping my whole portfolio.\"\n\nBruce's posts were filled with panic and frustration. He was looking for validation, for someone to tell him he wasn't alone in his fear. But instead, he was met with a mix of sympathy and criticism. Some users told him to hold on, that the market could still turn around, while others mocked him for his lack of patience and his risky bet. The conflicting advice only deepened Bruce's anxiety.\n\nAs the expiration date approached, Bruce knew he was in trouble. Nvidia\u2019s stock was hovering around $125, nowhere near the $140 strike price he needed. The value of his options had dwindled to almost nothing. On the last day before expiration, he watched helplessly as the price of the options became worthless, the numbers on his screen turning to zeros. In the blink of an eye, his investment was gone, evaporated into thin air.\n\nBruce stared at his computer screen in disbelief. He had lost every penny he had put into those options\u2014money he couldn\u2019t easily replace. But more than that, he felt like he had lost a part of himself, the part that believed he could take control of his future, that he could be smart and successful. The devastation was unlike anything he had ever felt. It wasn\u2019t just about the money, though that hurt too. It was the crushing sense of failure, the feeling that he had made a mistake he couldn\u2019t undo.\n\nThe next day, Bruce walked through campus with a heavy heart. The world around him seemed muted, the colors less vibrant, the sounds distant. He went through the motions, attending classes, nodding at acquaintances, but inside, he was a whirlwind of regret and disappointment.\n\nA month later, Bruce checked the stock price out of morbid curiosity, expecting nothing but bad news. But to his dismay, he saw that Nvidia had climbed back up to $129\u2014so close to the $140 mark he had hoped for. Though the stock didn\u2019t quite hit his strike price, it had come close enough to make him wonder if he had just been a little too early, a little too impatient. The realization that the stock had rebounded hit him like a freight train. It was as if the universe was mocking him, rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nMeanwhile, Bruce\u2019s friend\u2014the one who had first introduced him to options trading\u2014had taken a different approach. Instead of buying the short-term calls like Bruce, his friend had purchased $140 call options that were set to expire in a year. The longer timeframe gave his friend more room for the market to recover, and he wasn\u2019t as rattled by the short-term fluctuations. In fact, as Bruce watched his options expire worthless, his friend was calmly holding onto his, waiting for the next big catalyst: Nvidia\u2019s earnings call on August 28th.\n\nBruce\u2019s friend believed that the earnings report would be strong, potentially driving the stock price higher. If Nvidia\u2019s stock did take off after the call, his friend stood to make a substantial profit. The thought of this only deepened Bruce\u2019s regret. While he had panicked and lost everything in a week, his friend had been patient, willing to wait out the market\u2019s turbulence.\n\nThe regret, which had already been heavy, now felt unbearable. Bruce couldn't believe his luck\u2014or lack thereof. The options he had so desperately bought and then watched expire worthless could have been profitable if he had just given himself more time. If only he had waited. If only he had been more patient, like his friend. The questions and the what-ifs plagued him, keeping him up at night, replaying that fateful decision over and over in his mind.\n\nAs time passed, Bruce slowly began to recover. He focused on his studies, threw himself into his coding projects, and tried to put the whole ordeal behind him. But the experience had left a mark. Bruce knew he had learned a harsh lesson about the unpredictability of the market, the dangers of getting in over your head, and the importance of being prepared for anything.\n\nYet, even as he tried to move on, Bruce couldn't help but wonder what might have been. What if he had bought a longer-term option? What if he had waited for the market to turn? What if he had never bought the options in the first place? These questions lingered in his mind, echoes of a decision that had changed the course of his life.\n\nIn the end, Bruce knew he had to let go of the past and look forward. But the memory of those $140 calls expiring worthless, Nvidia climbing back up to $129, and his friend patiently waiting for a potential windfall after the August 28th earnings call would always be with him\u2014a reminder of the risks and rewards that come with stepping into the volatile world of options trading.", "id": "1ezit5v", "created_utc": 1724434616.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Next GPT will be writing movie scripts.

After that it really depends if the robotics pursuit pays off. At some point AI needs to be profitable for hyper-scalers. Once the AI training reaches an operational level, a lot of the compute will be handled on the edge. This will cause CAPEX to slow on building out AI training data centers. The end user is where the money is long term in AI. The best way to profit off of AI is to sell to consumers. One of the best platforms to do that is with AAPL. Since the majority of consumers will interface AI with handsets. AAPL has a 2 billion user base with iPhones and will be one of the aggregate locations for AI software to be hosted. iPhone sales is one thing but the revenue in services is another that will only increase. Other major players in this are META, MSFT, and GOOGL. Unfortunately these big moves you see in NVDA will eventually slow down.
