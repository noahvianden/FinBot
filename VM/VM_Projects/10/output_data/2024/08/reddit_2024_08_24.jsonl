These factors resulted in late or missed payments from a few of OHI\u2019s tenants. FAD payout ratio briefly exceeded the dangerous 100% level for a couple of quarters, indicating that FAD might not have had sufficient funds and might have had to cut its dividend.\u00a0 (This ratio is now under 100% and decreasing).\n\nThose headwinds are now fading or gone completely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Occupancy**\n\nNation-wide senior housing occupancy levels have now [risen for 12 consecutive quarters](https://www.nic.org/blog/https-www-nic-org-blog-senior-housing-occupancy-increases-for-twelfth-consecutive-quarter-in-second-quarter-2024/?_gl=1*bqqtju*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTIwNTMyNTU2MC4xNzI0MzY4NzA4*_ga_G6FYWY1MVZ*MTcyNDM2ODcwNy4xLjEuMTcyNDM2ODgxMy4wLjAuMA..*_ga_F9QSMQ40K1*MTcyNDM2ODcwNy4xLjEuMTcyNDM2ODgxMy4wLjAuMA) and are now approaching pre-pandemic levels around 86%.\u00a0 But they won\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 Construction activity on new senior living facilities has been very low for years due to pandemic induced headwinds.\u00a0 Investors did not want to fund new senior living projects when current facilities had low occupancy levels. \u00a0 Construction rates have been approximately \u2153 of pre-pandemic levels for 3 full years now.\u00a0 And the 80+ population will increase by 30%, or by 4 million people in the next decade.\n\nThese factors, combined, are projected to cause a serious shortage of senior housing in the near future.\u00a0 This organization [projects a shortfall](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/1-trillion-investment-shortage-in-senior-living-development-expected-by-2040/) of over 500,000 (!) senior housing units by 2030.\u00a0 This shortage will force rental rates higher and create a future spike in revenue for OHI when tenants renew their leases.\u00a0 And it will also cause senior living property values to increase sharply.\u00a0 OHI currently owns billions of dollars of senior living facilities.\u00a0 Shortages in senior housing will result in significant asset appreciation leading to a higher stock price based on increased intrinsic value.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Labor**\n\nThe pandemic forced the borders to remain virtually closed in 2020-21.\u00a0 Immigration dropped to very low levels and a severe labor shortage emerged when economic activity picked up again.\u00a0 The labor shortage peaked in 2022 with 12 million US job openings.\u00a0 This led to extreme wage inflation (relative to pre-2020 levels) peaking at over 10%.\u00a0 The elderly care industry and OHI was particularly hard-hit by this wage growth because they employ so many workers.\u00a0 The government addressed this problem by opening up the borders.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs estimates that net migration to the US is currently at +2 million/year.\u00a0 Many of these immigrants will work in entry level jobs like caregivers or cleaners.\u00a0 They will decrease wage inflation and increase the profit margins for the tenants of OHI.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019m not a financial professional but I think OHI\u2019s dividend of 0.67/share is safe.\u00a0 Incredible tailwinds in the coming quarters and years will tend to decrease the number of distressed tenants.\u00a0 The FAD payout ratio is likely to continue moving down and away from the dangerous 100% level.\u00a0 And these tailwinds will also lead to revenue growth and asset appreciation, which will push the stock price higher. I first posted about the elderly care industry in March of this year [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bspx41/increasing_dementia_will_be_a_long_term_boon_for/), and since then the elderly care tickers I mentioned (ADUS, ENSG, WELL, NHC) have returned over 30% in only 5 months.\u00a0 But, I believe there is still incredible potential in this industry and OHI looks like a fine choice because facility shortages haven\u2019t even started yet with occupancy levels only now approaching pre-2020 levels.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlease do a backtest on your portfolios before making major changes in your portfolio to ensure historical risk and volatility are at acceptable levels.\n\nElderly care positions: ADUS: 300 shares, NHC: 212 shares, OHI:\u00a0 459 shares, ENSG: 125 shares", "id": "1f0374m", "created_utc": 1724499405.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 8 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 59 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cwobk1/fmc_may_soar_on_a_spike_in_pesticide_demand/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f0374m/ohi_7_yield_and_nav_will_moon/) \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4233880639076233}, {"body": "Wages spiked up and stayed high, and assisted living properties have huge staffing needs.

Greetings regards, it has been many months since my last play; TSM and that play costed me a great amount but back then I started off by playing with options on based on how I felt and I was right for 2 weeks straight until I started getting technical and before I knew it I lost my $30,000 gain and lost around $10,000 of my own money. As a 18 year old that just graduated I can definitely afford to risk some more money as my family financials are good enough for me to live off of. Now ever since my TSM play from March I've started to watch more stock news and economic news and slowly saved up money from my fast food job, hell I didn't even really know who daddy Powell was until TSM almost completely wiped out my portfolio. Now March was unlucky for me because of uncertainty with rate cuts and inflation rising which meant stocks would go down. However, we just came out of a big dip and daddy Powell has confirmed cuts and the economy is looking bullish as hell which leads to me my 2nd biggest play of 2024.\n2. Based on what I'm feeling right now NVDA will fly after ER, so I decided to do one final big yolo into NVDX(2x leveraged NVDA) in my ROTH IRA ALL $8000 and around $2000 in options on NVDA calls If this hits I will treat myself to a brand new cologne and the new sun wu kong game\n3.
