The AMD  buy for 147 selling 125 for 22.00 makes it so that you have infinite risk and essentially no profit potential.  Especially since you either get assigned ( some brokers charge for assignments)  or you have to buy back the option in order to not be assigned which causes slippage.  \n\nNow if you said AMD buy to open  shares 147 and sell to open 135c 14 DTE  at 15.00  assuming you pay .65c in options fee on your option sale,  your break even would be 132.01. If amd closes at 135-150 you get max profit of 299.35 on assignment.  \n\nAll your doing  by selling itm covered calls especially that deep is hoping your stock goes below your strike price and stay above your break even to net a profit and not be assigned. In which case just buy a put. \n\n\nThe only way this really works is on a high IV ticker and 21+DTE and an option strike price you believe won't be breeched but the sale value on your option is of enough extrinsic value that it's worth the risk on your shares losing significant value and also worth your time.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "i've edited the example output a few times after some recommendations, this is what I'm getting now\n\n  \nTop 5 Covered Call Opportunities (Ranked by EV):\n\n1.
