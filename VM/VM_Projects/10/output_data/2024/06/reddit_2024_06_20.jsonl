{"title": "Dell and Partners Join Forces to Build AI Factory for Elon Musk's xAI", "selftext": "Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are collaborating to provide server racks for a supercomputer being developed by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI. This supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's generative AI chatbot, Grok, and is expected to be operational by fall 2025.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\n* Dell and Super Micro Computer are providing server racks for xAI's supercomputer.\n* The supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's AI chatbot, Grok.\n* The project is expected to be completed by fall 2025.\n* The collaboration involves Nvidia's advanced AI GPUs.\n\n# Dell and Super Micro's Role\n\nDell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are key players in the development of xAI's supercomputer. Dell is responsible for assembling half of the server racks, while Super Micro, known for its liquid-cooling technology and strong ties with chip firms like Nvidia, will handle the other half. This collaboration was confirmed by Elon Musk on the social media platform X.\n\n# Nvidia's Contribution\n\nNvidia is providing the advanced AI GPUs required for the project. The training of AI models like Grok requires tens of thousands of power-hungry chips. For instance, training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units (GPUs), and future models will require even more. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized the importance of this collaboration in expanding the reach of AI technology.\n\n# The AI Factory\n\nDell CEO Michael Dell announced that the company is building an \"AI factory\" with Nvidia to power Grok. This AI factory will be a comprehensive infrastructure, including CPUs, GPUs, networking switches, software systems, and storage, all connected by miles of cables. The factory aims to make it easier for a broader range of customers to establish their own AI factories.\n\n# Future Prospects\n\nElon Musk has ambitious plans for xAI. The supercomputer, termed the \"Gigafactory of Compute,\" is expected to be operational by fall 2025. This venture aims to enhance the capabilities of the Grok AI chatbot, making it a formidable competitor to existing AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The project will utilize up to 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, potentially making it one of the largest GPU clusters in existence.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe collaboration between Dell, Super Micro, and Nvidia marks a significant milestone in the AI industry. By combining their expertise and resources, these companies are set to create a powerful supercomputer that will drive the next generation of AI technology. With the project expected to be completed by fall 2025, the future looks promising for xAI and its generative AI chatbot, Grok.\n\n# Sources\n\n* [Dell and Partners Join Forces to Build AI Factory for Elon Musk\u2019s xAI](https://www.chatgptguide.ai/2024/06/20/dell-and-partners-join-forces-to-build-ai-factory-for-elon-musks-xai/)\n* [Dell, Super Micro providing server racks for xAI's supercomputer | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/dell-assembling-racks-xais-supercomputer-elon-musk-says-2024-06-19/), Reuters.\n* [Dell is building an AI factory with NVIDIA AI GPUs to train Grok for xAI and Elon Musk](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98907/dell-is-building-an-ai-factory-with-nvidia-gpus-to-train-grok-for-xai-and-elon-musk/index.html), TweakTown.\n* [Dell, Nvidia and SMC collaborate to power Musk's Grok AI factory By Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dell-nvidia-and-smc-collaborate-to-power-musks-grok-ai-factory-3489258), Investing.com.\n* [Elon Musk On Nvidia Collaborator Powering ChatGPT Rival: 'Dell Is Assembling Half Of The Racks for xAI's Supercomputer' - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/06/39403884/elon-musk-on-nvidia-collaborator-powering-chatgpt-rival-dell-is-assembling-half-of-the-racks-for), Benzinga.", "id": "1dk68we", "created_utc": 1718870395.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "This is quite the bombastic way to say that Dell is selling them server racks.", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "AI racks \ud83d\udc4c", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3488607406616211}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38752666115760803}, {"body": "Pretty soon we\u2019ll look back and wonder at all the massive amounts of money that were spent to build *chatbots.*", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Which will still suck.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1584412306547165}, {"body": "Pretty soon we will look back and wonder at the massive amounts of energy that were spent to build AI and alt currency.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6942801475524902}, {"body": "It's like the Canadian Weed boom.

And i think you can actually argue demand for cars will increase.\n\nReality is no one actually knows what will happen when/if true L4/5 autonomous vehicles arrive. Everything is theory until that actually happens.\n\nBut what we do know right now is the global population is increasing, poorer nations are becoming wealthier (which increases demand for things like cars), and car sales are also growing (slowly but still), all of which means that 5-10 years from now there will probably be more cars on the road than there are today, not less.\n\nAnyway i think the whole thing is kind of moot anyway because targetting a production goal based on a moving target of cars on the road and some arbitray opinion about how quickly we should try to replace the global fleet with EV is not how supply/demand works.\n\nIn the end demand will determine the amount of cars Tesla can sell.

{"title": "My Thesis on IonQ\n", "selftext": "Hey there! So, I've been looking into IonQ and it's pretty exciting stuff. Let me fill you in on why it might be a smart investment compared to something like NVIDIA, which has already had a big run-up in stock price.\n\n# Stock Performance\n\nFirst off, IonQ's stock has been all over the place lately. It hit a high of $21.58 last September but has since settled around $7.55. This kind of volatility can be nerve-wracking, but it's also where the potential for big gains lies. Analysts think it could go up to between $11.50 and $21.00, so there\u2019s definitely room for growth.\n\n# What's New with IonQ?\n\nIonQ just hit a major milestone way ahead of schedule: their #AQ 35 benchmark. This basically means their quantum computers can handle really complex problems, and they're getting better at it faster than expected. The market loved this news, and it\u2019s a big reason why people are optimistic about their stock.\n\n# Management Changes\n\nThey\u2019ve also made some smart moves with their leadership. Peter Chapman is now the Chairman of the Board, and Stacey Giamalis is the new Chief Legal Officer. These are seasoned pros who are expected to drive the company\u2019s strategy and growth. Plus, they\u2019ve teamed up with big names like Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on cool projects like improving the US power grid with quantum tech.\n\n# Industry Positioning\n\nIonQ is the only quantum computing company available on all the major cloud platforms\u2014Amazon Braket, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This means they\u2019re super accessible and have a wide reach across different industries like logistics, finance, and even pharma. They're not just in the game; they're making big plays.\n\n# Financials\n\nFinancially, IonQ is looking solid. They made $7.6 million in Q1 2024, which is a 77% increase from last year. They\u2019ve got a lot of cash on hand\u2014$434.4 million\u2014so they\u2019re in a good position to keep pushing their tech forward. Sure, they reported a net loss of $39.6 million, but that's pretty typical for a company investing heavily in its future.\n\n# Why IonQ Over NVIDIA?\n\nNow, why consider IonQ over NVIDIA? Well, NVIDIA is a giant in the GPU and AI market, and their stock has already skyrocketed. If you\u2019re looking for something with high growth potential, IonQ might be the way to go. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Early-Stage Growth**: IonQ is still in the early stages of its growth, whereas NVIDIA is more established. This means there's more potential for IonQ's stock to take off as quantum computing becomes more mainstream.\n2. **Quantum Leap**: Quantum computing is set to revolutionize many industries, and IonQ is leading the charge. NVIDIA is great, but they\u2019re not in the quantum space the way IonQ is.\n3. **Valuation**: IonQ\u2019s stock is relatively undervalued compared to NVIDIA\u2019s, giving you a better entry point if you believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing.\n\nIn summary, IonQ is at the cutting edge of a transformative technology. Their recent achievements, strategic leadership changes, and strong financial position make them a compelling investment opportunity, especially compared to more mature companies like NVIDIA. If you're looking for something with high potential and are okay with a bit of risk, IonQ could be a smart move.", "id": "1dkmiva", "created_utc": 1718917643.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 49 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://i.redd.it/3t2tqlhfuj3d1.jpeg) \n**Account Age** | 3 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11549010872840881}, {"body": "Thanks ChatGPT", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05669957399368286}, {"body": "Will be many many years before a truly useful qc is built that can achieve quantum supremacy on something actually useful.
