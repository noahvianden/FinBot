Also, hyperlinks to Finviz added, hopefully I'll be able to implement this going forward in the future! :)\n\n[**MU**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=MU)**-** Beat earnings estimates, due to strong demand for memory chips, but current quarter forecast wasn\u2019t as positive as investors wanted. Company forecasted next quarter revenue in line with investor expectations. Reported $6.81B vs $6.67B revenue expected. Remember that MU makes the chips that NVDA that are used in the AI processors designed by NVDA. (I will do a writeup explaining semis in the future.)\n\n[**WBA**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=WBA)**-** Fell due to the company missing expectations, slashing profit outlooks, and cited a challenging environment for pharmacies and US consumers. Expects EPS 2.80 vs 2.95 a share for 2024. Reported EPS of .63 vs .68 expected, and revenue of 36.4B vs 35.94 expected. Worth watching if we have any sharp selloffs. CVS down in sympathy.\n\n[**LEVI**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=LEVI)**-** Reported revenue of 1.44B vs 1.45 expected, and EPS of $0.16 vs $0.04. Beat expectations, but CFO warned that consumers have been \u201cgenerally cautious\u201d about spending.\n\n[**AMZN**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMZN)**-** Hitting all time highs, watching 195/200 levels. No \u201cnew news\u201d beyond that, so mainly will be patient for this one.\n\n[**RIVN**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=RIVN)**-** No new news beyond the Volkswagen investment, but still watching this.\n\nEarnings today: NKE\n\nIPO today: WBTN (Webtoon, extremely interested in this.

I wanted to look at shrink levels of Costco.  \n\n\nOne of the first articles I came by from last month lays it out pretty good so I'll just copy some of the data from there. \n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/how-costco-limits-retail-theft-checks-reciepts-2023-5\n\n\n>Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and other major retailers have warned of rising theft rates plaguing stores across the US.\n\n>But one company appears to be immune to the problem: Costco.\n\n>The warehouse chain's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said Thursday that **shrinkage \u2014 or inventory losses due to theft, fraud, or other causes \u2014 was largely unchanged.**\n\n> Galanti said the company saw a slight increase after the rollout of self-checkout three years ago, but those rates have since reverted to the longer-term trend.\n\n> *T*arget**, meanwhile, has said its losses from shrinkage will balloon to more than **$1 billion in 2023, up $500 million over last year.** Walmart's CEO said in December that stores would close if theft didn't slow. Dollar Tree said this week that it was considering locking up more goods in stores as it faces rising shrink.\n\n>Overall, theft helps drive about **$95 billion in losses every year for US retailers,** according to estimates by the National Retail Federation, an industry group.\n\n\n\nCostco has personal information on every customer that goes through their door. Their products are in bulky large packages. and so on... \n\nGist of the matter is that lack of shrinkage these days is a huge competitive advantage which directly translates to increased profits. The more competition's stores close the more shoppers Costco gets. They can reduce prices more if they need to or keep selling it at the same price as their competition. It looks like they've cornered the market for the time being. \n\nObviously dollar stores are leeches that prey on small towns in the US and they are unlikely to be affected by this. But how can Walmart for example keep growing or even prevent loss of revenue over the next few years until perhaps this theft trend changes. \n\n\nAnother player in this category is BJ's Wholesale Club.

{"title": "Carvana is getting squeezed", "selftext": "A lot of people were convinced, and are still convinced (including myself), that Carvana is a dogshit business that is overvalued and that the stock will eventually crash. There has been convincing short seller research publicized with the short sellers taking hefty positions in Carvana at much lower prices compared to where Carvana is now. Everyone has been expecting Carvana to crash back down by now but it hasn't. You see, short positions have inherent risks that long positions don't have and the risks have to be actively managed. The market has been very strong recently and short sellers as an aggregate have been suffering. Based on recent price action, it seems like short sellers are reaching capitulation and are decreasing their short positions or entirely closing them out. I think Carvana is seeing unusually strong price action because short sellers are capitulating and closing out their shorts, resulting in higher and higher prices. \n\nI don't have a position in Carvana yet. I don't blindly short stocks without a catalyst in mind or some other way that I can determine if I'm right or wrong. If the market continues to be very strong, Carvana might continue to squeeze further. It's heavily shorted with the shorts being significantly underwater. One thing that should kill the squeeze is massive dilution, which should happen at some point. The family that controls Carvana is also pretty shady and I wouldn't put it past them to orchestrate a squeeze, sell their own shares, and then issue massive dilution after. It's worth watching this stock right now because a materially good news release can result in further short covering, while a dilution news event should cause a prolonged stock drop.

{"title": "DD FCX", "selftext": "Due Diligence: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)\n\n**Executive Summary**\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the surging demand for copper, which is a critical component in the technology and renewable energy sectors. As a leading global copper producer, FCX is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing needs of AI companies, tech startups, and the broader electrification trend.\n\n**1. Growing Demand for Copper**\n\nA. Technology Sector and AI Boom\n\n- **AI and Tech Startups**: The AI boom and the proliferation of tech startups are driving significant demand for copper. Copper is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, wiring, and other electronic components used in AI infrastructure and devices.\n- **Data Centers**: The expansion of data centers, necessary to support AI workloads, further increases copper demand for electrical wiring and cooling systems.\n\nB. Renewable Energy and Electrification\n\n- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The shift towards electric vehicles is a major copper demand driver. EVs use significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their electric motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure.\n- **Renewable Energy**: Copper is critical in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, as well as in the grid infrastructure required to distribute renewable energy.\n\n**2. Strong Production Capabilities**\n\nA. Diversified Asset Portfolio\n\n- **Major Mines**: FCX operates some of the largest and most productive copper mines globally, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Morenci mine in Arizona. These assets provide a robust production base and economies of scale.\n- **Geographic Diversity**: The company's mining operations span across multiple geographies, reducing risk and exposure to any single region.\n\nB. Production Expansion Plans\n\n- **Capacity Expansion**: FCX is actively investing in expanding its production capacity to meet rising copper demand. Projects like the Grasberg underground transition are set to significantly boost output.\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and cost management are expected to enhance profitability and cash flow.\n\n **3. Favorable Market Conditions**\n\nA. Copper Price Trends\n\n- **Price Appreciation**: Copper prices have shown a strong upward trend driven by supply constraints and increasing demand. Analysts project continued price appreciation, benefiting major producers like FCX.\n- **Inflation Hedge**: Investing in copper producers can serve as a hedge against inflation, as commodity prices often rise with inflationary pressures.\n\nB. Supply Constraints\n\n- **Limited New Supply**: The development of new copper mines is capital-intensive and time-consuming, leading to limited new supply coming online in the near term. This supply constraint supports higher copper prices.\n- **Sustainable Practices**: FCX\u2019s commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices positions it favorably with regulatory bodies and environmentally conscious investors.\n\n**4. Financial Strength and Shareholder Value**\n\nA. Strong Financial Position:\n\n- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: FCX has demonstrated strong revenue and profit growth, driven by high copper prices and efficient production.\n- **Healthy Balance Sheet**: The company maintains a robust balance sheet with manageable debt levels, providing financial stability and flexibility.\n\nB. Shareholder Returns\n\n- **Dividends and Buybacks**: FCX has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Continued strong financial performance is likely to support ongoing shareholder returns.\n- **Investment in Growth**: Strategic investments in expanding production and improving operational efficiency are expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\nInvesting in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) offers a strategic opportunity to gain exposure to the booming demand for copper driven by the AI revolution, technology advancements, and the global shift towards renewable energy. FCX\u2019s strong production capabilities, favorable market conditions, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value make it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the commodities sector.\n\n\nTLDR: booming AI/tech needs copper. These markets keep growing so more copper needed. FCX produces a lot of copper.\n\nAdded benefit it is also used a lot in the market of renewable energy which is also getting a lot of support. Getting in this business is also costly to set up so they kind of have a moat built up through that.\n\n\nPositions:\n3 JUL 05 \u201824 45.5 calls @ 3.02$\nPlanning to load up more.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, be regarded at your own risk.", "id": "1dq1vio", "created_utc": 1719521631.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 7 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dq1vio/dd_fcx/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28114748001098633}, {"body": "I just read your CRSR DD and then looked at the stock.
