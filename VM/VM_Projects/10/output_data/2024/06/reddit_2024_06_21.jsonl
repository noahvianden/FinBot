While getting lucky on a few things, I stayed very disciplined on a lot.\n\nHere are some things I recommend earlier versus later.\n\n1. Have a budget. Know your expenses.\n\n2. Know the difference between pre tax and post tax dollars. If you want to buy something that is $1000, but your income tax is 25% you need to make $1333 in gross income to pay for the $1000 item. [1000/(1-.25)] = 1333.\n\n3. Invest as much early as possible. Compound interest really starts doing the heavy lifting when you have a fat principal balance working for you.\n\n4. If you have a 401k you must at least do the minimum to get you employers maximum match. If you don't you are leaving money off the table. If they match 50 cents on a dollar that is still an immediate 50% rate of return, compared the markets average of 7-10.\n\n5. Max out the 401k if possible. This one is tough if you are not a high earner, but ultimately putting more will save you on income taxes. The IRS maximum for 2024 is $23,000 annually. If your tax rate is 25% this will save you from paying    roughly $5750 annually in taxes. There aren't a lot of other opportunities in life to save thousands on something if you look at it as your going to be investing anyways.\n\n6. Have an after-tax investment account (like your brokerage thru Schwab) in addition to a 401k. Having reserves in something you can pull out of out of versus taking a penalty on your 401k or obtaining debt is advantageous.\n\n6. Avoid debt outside of good debt (ex mortgages). Don't rack up credit cards, don't open up lines of credit on promos.\n\n7. Life well below your means.\n\n8. Have a plan on what you can set aside monthly. Set reasonable expectations on how that money should perform on average over a specific period of time (7-10% on your major stock indexes).\n\n9. Don't get scared at market corrections, don't try and time the market. Don't try and outsmart wall street. Time is your most valuable asset right now and you need to play the long game.\n\n10. Invest in your education. We live in a world of specialization and those who specialize in something get handsomely rewarded for it. \n\n11. Stay diversified in both your portfolio and life.
