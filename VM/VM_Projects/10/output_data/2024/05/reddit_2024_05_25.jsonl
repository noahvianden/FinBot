{"title": "Thoughts on what happened to market post NVDA earnings and dispersion?", "selftext": "Wanted to get some thoughts going on market mechanics and structure here. Relevant in terms of options flows and market maker hedging.\n\nSo everyone saw what happened when chad NVDA blew out earnings again and the result afterwards on Thursday 5/23/24. Nothing like this has happened where a stock that represented >3% of S&P market cap was up but the [broad index was down](https://twitter.com/warrenpies/status/1793957411184587239?s=61&t=e4kVZaaVrKlrFKM8PcFbBA). It's hilarious because with the green pre-market across many names and sentiment, everyone was expecting the NVDA beat to lift the broader market.\n\nFriday 5/24/24 saw a bounce back in broader market with many megacap names getting back to same levels as if nothing had happened, and NVDA maintained its gains, eeking out another +2% (lmao)\n\nNVDA deserved its pop based on those results + guidance. Don't want to hear any arguments of overvaluation or tHe hEdGiEs pumping up one stock.\n\nI follow macro and don't buy any related narratives or data releases that Thursday on why that broad market would've dived as a reaction.\n\nFrom all the sources I follow, the only thing plausible is structural market mechanics. Cem Karsan has [mentioned here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQEGeDh8uaQ) his perspective that vol is well supplied at the index level, not single named stocks, which leads to dispersion. Indices are pinned. When something goes up, something else goes down. Correlations start breaking down across asset classes and we'll see sometimes violent rotations. I don't always agree with Cem... his macro takes are touristy and I know how wishy washy noncommittal he can be with his language, but still respect his opinions regarding market structure.\n\nSo is it as simple as market makers who were most likely short NVDA calls had the need to sell delta across the rest of the market to hedge? Any other thoughts?
