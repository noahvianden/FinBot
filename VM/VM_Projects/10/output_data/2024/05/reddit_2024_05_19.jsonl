When I sold the first call, I thought that it was going to expire  worthless and I'd collect the premium.  Trying to remember, I think it was a 20 Delta, but the market started running. I didn\u2019t want to take cap gains on my shares so I texted a trader and he showed me how to roll it and then roll it again to where I\u2019m currently at, 16 August 520.   \n\nThis is the first roll I\u2019ve ever done, and I\u2019m wondering if this is  extremely conservative, extremely stupid, the way that the theta gang  does it, or something else.

Wanted to see if there\u2019s a better way, or if there  is a way to get out of this\u2026 or do I have to just keep rolling there\u2019s a  significant enough drop to finally take the premium.   \n\nIt feels a bit to me like the guys who sold cc's on NVDA and rolled them and are wondering what to do.\n\nTrying to understand where to go from here\u2026 Thanks for your help\u2026 Trade sequence follows:   \n\nOn November 17, I sold the 29 December 470 call for .96 credit   \n\nOn December 15, I rolled to the 19 April 500 for a .13 credit -1 3.78 .13 +1 3.65 credit   \n\n? At that point, buy back less original credit is a net $269 loss, right?\n\nOn March 24, I rolled to the 16 August 520 for a .71 credit -1. 20.28  .71 +1 19.57 credit   \n\n?At that point, buy back at 1957 less the 3.78 is an additional $1579 loss, right?\n\nIf I were to hold it through expiration (presumably with SPY higher, how does the position net out?\n\nIf I bought back the call tomorrow, how would the position net out?\n\nI'm trying to visualize where this would go if SPY continues up to 560 or so...mitigate the loss, capture more gain.

Somewhere between 60-80% is better from a time standpoint. Sometimes the underlying will sharply reverse and you can recapture a larger percentage, but this is unusual. This is just my personal trading philosophy that I've settled into using live data over time.\n\nIts important to keep the context of this market in mind. We rallied almost 30% in 5 months. That's essentially a market crash, but to the upside. Its far worse than a market crash for premium sellers, because all the while, volatility is dropping like a rock. Its the worst market for anyone carrying short deltas that I can even remember. 2020 was a crazy melt up, but vol was jacked through the roof. It was annoying to get crushed on short calls, but puts were still paying out big time.\n\nBack to today. Pretty much everyone is in the same boat where you have these deep ITM short calls that you've been rolling for months. When we never get a real pullback, no one can get out of any of their positions. I don't know what this means for the market, because of how unusual it is to have this kind of an upward crash.
