To be fair she was probably trying to say that the capacity they can produce with TSMC this year is not limited to a max potential of $4bn in sales. \n\nUltimately I\u2019m like you in that I think she\u2019s spinning things to make demand seem good when it\u2019s not.

I thought it was pretty clear. I mean if you say it's not a supply constraint it's by definition a demand one. I don't see where she ever specified that it wasn't a demand constraint in the second half, she keeps on stressing that it's a supply constraint in the first half though even when answering questions about the second half lol (which by implication means weak demand in the second half).\n\nHere's the full answer that I partially quoted above.\n\n> Vivek Arya\n> \n> Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I just wanted to go back to the supply question and the $4 billion outlook for this year. I think at some point, there was a suggestion that the $4 billion number, right, that there are still supply constraints. But I think at a different point, you said that you have supply visibility significantly beyond that. Given that we are almost at the middle of the year, I would have thought that you would have much better visibility about the back half. So is the $4 billion number of supply constrained number? Or is it a demand constrained number? Or alternatively, if you could give us some sense of what the exit rate of your GPU sales could be. I think on the last call, $1.5 billion was suggested. Could it be a lot more than that in terms of your exit rate of MI for this year?\n> \n> Lisa Su\n> \n> Yes. Vivek, let me try to make sure that we answered this question clearly. From a full-year standpoint, our $4 billion number is not supply capped -- I'm sorry, yes, it's not supply cap. It is -- we do have supply capability above that. It is more back half weighted. So if you're looking at sort of the near-term, I would say, for example, in the second quarter, we do have more demand than we have supply right now, and we're continuing to work on pulling in some of that supply.\n> \n> By the way, I think this is an overall industry issue. This is not at all related to AMD. I think overall, AI demand has exceeded anyone's expectations in 2024. So you've heard it from the memory guys. You've heard it from the foundry guys. We're all ramping capacity as we go through the year.\n> \n> And as it relates to visibility, we do have good visibility into what's happening. As I said, we have great customer engagements that are going forward. My goal is to make sure that we pass all of the milestones as we're ramping products. And as we pass those milestones, we put that into the overall full-year guidance for AI. But in terms of how customer progression things are going, they're actually going quite well, and we continue to bring new customers on and we continue to expand workloads with our current customers. And so hopefully, that clarifies the question, Vivek.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with your interpretation. Just playing devils advocate here.

{"title": "Magnite (MGNI): A Hidden Gem with Explosive Potential Due to Low Float and Strong Partnerships", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share some compelling reasons why I believe Magnite (MGNI) is set for a strong performance this year and why it's a great time to consider adding it to your portfolio. One particularly interesting dynamic is the extremely low float, combined with recent strategic moves that could make this stock soar. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n# 1. Strong Financial Performance\n\nMagnite recently reported Q1 2024 revenue of $149.3 million, a 15% increase from the previous year, and significantly higher than analyst expectations of $124.24 million. Their Contribution ex-TAC also grew by 12% to $111.1 million, indicating strong operational efficiency and market demand.\n\n# 2. Strategic Netflix Partnership\n\nMagnite has secured a key partnership with Netflix, becoming a primary partner for their ad-supported tier. This deal not only boosts Magnite\u2019s revenue potential but also validates its technology and market position. As streaming services grow, especially ad-supported models, this partnership will be crucial.\n\n# 3. Growth in CTV\n\nConnected TV (CTV) revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $55 million. With more consumers shifting to streaming, Magnite is well-positioned to capture increasing ad spend in the CTV space, further enhanced by the Netflix deal.\n\n# 4. Election Year Boost\n\n2024 is a presidential election year, and political ad spending is expected to hit new highs. Previous cycles have shown substantial increases, and 2024 is projected to see digital and CTV ad spending grow exponentially, benefiting companies like Magnite that are well-positioned in these markets.\n\n# 5. Analyst Confidence\n\nAnalysts have issued strong buy ratings and optimistic price targets for MGNI, reflecting confidence in the company\u2019s strategic direction and growth opportunities.\n\n# 6. Institutional Ownership\n\nA whopping 90.01% of MGNI shares are held by institutions, with significant holdings by Vanguard (9.15%), RTL US Holding Inc (8.84%), and BlackRock (7.16%). Additionally, 3.70% of shares are held by employees and C-suite executives, indicating strong long-term confidence and stability.\n\n# 7. Low Float\n\nMagnite has an extraordinarily low float, with only about 8.8 million shares available for individual investors. This is due to the high institutional ownership (90.01%) and insider holdings (3.70%). Such a low float scenario is uncommon and presents a unique opportunity.\n\nWhen a stock has a low float, it means there are fewer shares available for trading. This limited supply can lead to significant price volatility, especially if demand for the stock increases. In the case of Magnite, the recent Netflix partnership and strong financial performance are likely to attract more individual investors. With only a small number of shares available for trading, even a moderate increase in buying interest can drive the stock price up sharply.\n\nThe low float scenario is not typical for most stocks, making this a unique situation. When combined with high institutional confidence and insider ownership, it suggests that those who know the company best believe in its long-term potential. For retail investors, this creates an opening to capitalize on a stock that could see rapid appreciation as more people become aware of its strengths and begin to buy shares.\n\n# 8. Increased Attention\n\nHistorically, MGNI has been a relatively unknown stock with a 30-day volume SMA of 2.17 million shares. However, the Netflix deal has brought new attention from individual investors. With the limited float and increased interest, there\u2019s a strong potential for significant price movement as more investors jump in.\n\n# 9. Short Interest Dynamics\n\nWith 5.6% of shares shorted, there\u2019s potential for a short squeeze. While 5.6% is not an overwhelming amount, combined with the low float and high institutional ownership, any positive news or strong buying activity could compound quickly, forcing short sellers to cover their positions and driving the stock price up rapidly.\n\n**Conclusion**: With strong financial performance, strategic partnerships, growth in CTV, the upcoming election year boost, analyst confidence, significant institutional ownership, a low float, and increased attention from investors, Magnite (MGNI) is well-positioned for explosive growth in 2024. It\u2019s a stock worth considering for your portfolio.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor. This post is not financial advice.
