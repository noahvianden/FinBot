{"title": "Selling Iron Condors AFTER Earnings", "selftext": "Hi, I want to get people's thoughts on this.  Hopefully you've tried it and can tell me how well it's worked for you or hasn't.  \n\nI'm revisiting Iron Condors.  \nThe other day I read (again) that they're a \"selling volatility\" play, and that resonated with me this time.  \nWhen is IV typically highest?  On Earnings day. (Other times too, but those are usually unknowable beforehand.)\n\nSo what if we sold ICs the day AFTER earnings?  \nI've searched this subreddit and r/options, but didn't see much about that.\nBut if you look at an options chain for the weeks after earnings week, IV almost invariably goes down.  Until when?  Next earnings, typically.  \n\nAnd I've never seen the point of selling long-dated ICs, especially when everyone recognizes that profit doesn't start coming in until the last days or week or two.  (I know:  *gamma's gonna get me*, but please ignore that for a moment.) \n\n**THESIS:**  \nSell a 2-9DTE IC AFTER earnings.  Benefit from the normal decay of volatility.  Close at 50% Max Profit.  \n\n**MECHANICS:**  \nHigh-volume tickers with weekly options that are liquid 'enough' (up to the user).  I like the short legs of my ICs to be at the Expected Move points.  That usually puts them around 16-20 delta, and makes the Breakevens a little beyond, a nice buffer.  Buy protective wings **at least 10 deltas** beyond.  \n\nSo just playing around last Wednesday 7/24 at the open I put 2DTE ICs with those parameters on **GE**, **UPS**, & **SPOT** (all had earnings 7/23), and **NUE** (earnings 7/22).  \n2 closed at 50% with my BTC orders, and 2 I let expire worthless.  \nNet returns, in order, were:  8%, 8%, 21%, 16% (the 1st 2 would've made 16% if I'd let them run) \n\nDid I get lucky to go 4 for 4?  Maybe, but I put on 2 more trades on Friday 7/26:  **GOOGL** (earnings 7/23 AH), and **CMG** (7/24 AH).  So far they're both behaving.  \n\nBut I waited till the weekend to post this because I wanted to get an idea of IV IN earnings week, as well as after.  \nSo for instance, McDonalds has earnings before the bell Monday, and ThinkOrSwim is showing me weekly option IVs of:  56% for this week, then 38, 34, 31, 28, 26 & 27.  \nI listed them out until they stopped declining, though I plan to only be in the trade for 4 or 5 days.  \n\nSo weekly IV goes from 56% THIS week to 38% NEXT week.  \n*Is there any way to know how much that IV decay is 'worth'?*  Not that it really matters, but as a fine-tuning of this idea we might want to look at that Earnings-week to next-week drop as a go/no-go for the trade.  \n\n**ON** Semiconductor also has earnings before the bell Monday and looks like:  106% IV, 78, 68, 65, 63, etc.  \n\nI'll wait till probably mid-day to give things time to settle down (or just wait till Tuesday), then put on the ICs per the parameters above.  \nI can't say right now what the strikes will be, because the stock prices will move after earnings, but I simply take Spot - EM and that's the Sold Put, then Spot + EM is the Sold Call.  \nThen move *at least 10 deltas out* on each side for the protective wings.  \n\nWhatever credit they fill for, I like to subtract fees, divide by 2, and set the BTC there.  (Option fees on ToS are 0.66 per, so x4 to open an IC, and x4 to close it; so 0.66x8 = 5.28 per round trip.)  \n\nDoes anybody do this routinely?

A few times I've seen the rec to have at least 10 deltas between the short and long, and that's worked out okay for me.  But 10% of spot, wow, that really puts the wings out there!  Is that so it acts more like a Short Strangle?\n\n**TSLA** had a pretty big move today, but I created a Sep 20th 16-delta 20-wide trade AH and got similar numbers:  3.93 credit on 1609 BPE, for 24.4% max return.  That's 8 weeks out, so 3% per week.  \n\nInteresting in your 25-wide that ROC went *down* while POP only got a tiny bit better.  From that could we say that 20-wide was 'better'?  Certainly more flexibility for adjusting with the wider spread, but other than that?  \n\n\"EM strike at 30 delta\" and \"2x EM at 16 delta,\" I guess I'm confused.  Maybe I'm just not understanding what ToS is showing me in the upper right corner of the weekly option chain, but right now AH for **TSLA** it's showing plus/minus 11.75:  is that the 1-SD move, or 2-SD?  Because when I subtract it from spot it lands at 18 delta on the Put side (close enough to 16 delta), and when I add it I land between 20 and 25 delta.  But then I'm used to seeing that, higher delta on the Call side.  Is that IV skew?  \n\nAnyway, so 25 delta is considered the sweet spot for ICs?  Seems tight to me, but okay.  Building a 25-delta 20-wide trade on **TSLA** tonight I get similar numbers (both legs spot on 25-delta):  6.91 credit on BPE of 13.06, 52.9% ROC at max.  And it's about 1/3rd:  6.91/20 = 0.35  \nAnd 52.9% over 8 weeks is 6.6% per week, more than twice the 16-delta trade.  Hmmmmm...  \n\nDo you typically manage these?  Or just set a 25% profit closing order and revisit them at some point?  \n\nAnd I'd like to ask you this:  why not do these weekly for much better weekly returns?  There must be a downside, and it's probably that there's not time to react or to \"be right.\"  But I set up a 2Aug 25-delta 20-wide trade (4DTE) **TSLA** IC and got:  350 credit on 1650 BPE for 21% ROC.  \n\nGranted, 350 is nowhere near 1/3rd the width, nor 1/2 the BPE.

Kept full credit of 1.58, so it made 31%.*  \n\nAll of these I looked subjectively at the 5-day and 3-month price action, and would choose not to trade these two:  \n**AFRM** 0.64/2.00, 39.5P/\\40C  \n*Would've lost 21%.*  \n**ULTA** 1.80/5.00, 350P/\\367.5C  \n*Would've made 34%.*\n\nI'll come back after the close on Friday 9/6 and add the closing price for each ticker.  If it's between the inside strikes, then the ROC will be from the numbers quoted (minus some fees).  \nIf the ending price is inside one of the wings, I'll calculate the loss there, subtract it from the Credit, and come up with an overall P/L for the trade.  \nIf the closing price is all the way through a wing, then of course it'll be a loss of the wing width, minus the credit received.  \n\nLet's see how these play out!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["hpq", "crm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["ups", "googl"]}
