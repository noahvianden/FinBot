Perhaps my joke about hindsight didn't land as I intended. The point I tried to make is that hindsight can trick you into thinking that you could have made a better decision. That's a trap. The name of the game is making the best decision you can *in that moment, with all the information available to you at that time*, and don't sweat what happens next, because what happens next is outside of your control.

I understand what you're saying. In theory, my ATM straddle should have an EV of 0, if future volatility is priced correctly. That's what truly confuses me here. Prices are continuous as you said, and IV should recalculate as new information comes out. I'm curious as to why it wasn't priced in instead. I know I'm speaking from a place of na\u00efvety but this is what I see. Looking at the IV30 chart Tesla was at the lower range over the past year, around 42 when I took the trade when the average is 47. The 52-week low was 39. If this delivery report ended up being a complete dud and volatility decreased I'm not sure it would've had tons of room to fall. I could've used a volatility-based stop where if it drops that 3 points I begin closing my position (which isn't massive, I'm an individual).\n\nThat's why I feel like it was \"mispriced\". What happened probably was a low-probability event, but IV30 is now 65. Massive increase. I feel like in essence what I'm doing is taking a swing where I see fit. Truly it's a gamble, but one that I think is calculated in some form or another. Worst case, I lose the points on Vega and some theta for a day. Even if Vols didn't increase the way they did I could've made plenty of money scalping gamma and it would've been an overall profitable endeavor. Even then, earnings were in 2 weeks and I doubt implied volatility goes down into that. Insurance contracts on a company like Tesla are nice to have when earnings come around.\n\nI'm going to give you an award for your time.

To truly say the option was mispriced, you\u2019d have to show that the price exceeded the range implied by volatility. At that point you can show an actual volatility underestimate.

It's a matter of actively working the auction for the spread.\n\n>MSFT Sold CALL spread 445/450 exp July 26 ( 23 days to exp)\n\nFor how much? You left out the most important information for this discussion, which is all the pricing. Fortunately you included enough info in the trade description for us to look it up.\n\n>If I close the position, it will be a debit of twice as much as I receive in the premium. I wanted to mitigate the loss so I tried to roll instead of closing. so even though rolling the position is a debit, it's better than closing.\n\nThis is a misunderstanding. A roll is a close. There's no difference on the closing end of it. The only difference is that, in addition to the close of the old position, you add an open for a new position to the same order ticket. Both orders must fill in order for the entire roll to go through. So now two things have to go right to succeed, instead of just one if you were to close and open with separate orders.\n\nIf you are trying to buy back a short position and you are not getting a fill, you are not offering enough money. That's literally all there is to it. Offer more money and the closing order will fill. Likewise, ask for less money on the new sell order in the roll. Combine those two actions and I guarantee the roll will fill (as long as all of the legs have a bid -- if there is a no-bid leg, it might be tougher to fill, but not impossible).\n\nThe market is not your friend. The price for getting a fill is not required to be beneficial to you. It's an extremely common situation for there to be no price that you would find acceptable that will fill your order. Happens to everyone. Happens to me on a daily basis.\n\nI'll also add that rescuing this trade might not be the best idea in the first place.

This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2024-08-16.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option.

Life360 seems to be the most applicable app for location sharing among families or friends due to it being available on both Android and Apple. When the IPO occurred I talked to my sister who is still in highschool if she likes life360 and she told me she bought the premium subscription for it. Therefore leading me to my bull thesis and deeper due diligence.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThe balance sheet if looking back since 2020 seems pretty strong with cash and equivalents being greater than the total debt, therefore meaning won't go bust in the face of economic downturn. The total assets were also increasing since 2020 up to 2023 along with the debt decreasing or coming back to about what is was in 2020 in 2023.\n\nThe losses are decreasing yoy, the revenue from both service and hardware is increasing yoy,\u00a0and therefore the losses are shrinking yoy.\n\nI have discovered while doing my research that LIF owns Tile and Jiobit. Tile seems to be around a lot if you look for them while talking to people. Their brand isn't just the app but also physical products as well which shows they are expanding.\n\n**Technical**\n\nThe trend beings displayed is upwards in the daily charts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9e2nhvmiydad1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eb90c7709012738173941964402e0026da58f33\n\n**Narrative**\n\nBased on my readings about Peter Lynch's trading ideology and the idea of narrative economics by Robert J. Shiller, here is my narrative.\n\nPeople in my daily life are using life360 all around me and I see their products in people's wallets and keys. Even I use the products they have and my sister buys their subscription service. My girlfriends whole family uses it as well. In a quick summary, everybody uses it and people who didn't use it are starting to because it is a \"trend.\" This seems to fit the ideology about having a good story by Peter Lynch.\n\nHowever, to add more on to this; there is way more to the narrative. The trend has already started and people are willing to pay for a free app to get more benefits out of it and a lot of times guys who use it or never used it don't really care about it. What is one thing every guy will do as they get older of just live? They will start dating and getting partners. Along with a growing want for safety with location sharing, the girlfriends of the boyfriends would want them to have a location sharing app and especially if they have differing phone brands it increases the need for a universal location sharing product. Even families will want location sharing for family safety which means the consumers are not just teenagers or young adults but older people as well.\n\nThe growth of the usage of the app seems pretty dang expansive and with our world become more integrated with technology and people's willingness to buy subscriptions, the business seems to be just at the start of growing bigger. Since subscriptions aren't as easily noticeable by the buyer like a physical product, they will be less inclined to\u00a0consider it a big expense and keep it steady which equals continuous profit. As long as people want a universal app for safety, this company can provide for as long as possible.\n\nI am not sure if they are allowed to sell data, but they could also seel that data for AI purposes down the line since AI is starting to hit a barrier where they are running out of data to train it with.\n\nAdditionally, life360 has a social media presence and in my experience, a sns presence equates to a growing company. The feelings of the mass that is displayed in social media such as tiktok or instragram also provides a good idea on if the stock is doing good or bad at the moment.\n\n**Position and NOT FA**\n\nIDK how to post multiple images on here so I will just comment by position. My position isn't that big but it is about 83% of my portfolio because I am broke.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nFundamentals and technical analysis is good. The company seems to be able to expand more. The stock tells a good narrative. If following socials, life360 has a positive and growing vibe around it. I have a big position in regards to my portfolio size.
