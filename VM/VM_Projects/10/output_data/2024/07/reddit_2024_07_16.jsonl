{"title": "Calendar or diagonal spreads, road to earnings", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI find myself more confortable trading options based on volatility rather than taking directional trades based on predicting the underlying move. As such, I find very interesting strategies such as calendars, and I would love to get your view on these approach I am writing below\n\nOne of my favourite trades is leveraging double diagonals or calendar spreads to take advantage of bidirectional increases in implied volatility (IV). Understanding the key factors influencing an option's extrinsic value\u2014time value, IV, and price action\u2014is crucial. Additionally, days to expiration (DTE) and moneyness play significant roles. In a calendar (or diagonal) option trade, we can exploit these dynamics effectively.\n\nBefore deep-diving, I wanted to let you know that I learned this by reading \"Options as a strategic investment\" by Lawrence McMillan\n\nWhen we anticipate high IV situations, such as earnings announcements, we can strategically use calendar or diagonal spreads. As earnings approach, options with expirations immediately following the earnings report experience a sharp rise in IV, whereas contracts with later expirations do not see such a pronounced increase. This creates a favorable IV skew that we can capitalize on.\n\nBy selling options that expire right after the earnings report and buying options that expire one or two months later, we capture the inflated premium of the front month options. Despite the likelihood of the front month options experiencing a rise in IV during the time in which we are in the trade, which could negatively impact our sold leg, time decay will play a more significant role. The rapid decay of the front month options, due to their shorter expiration, typically outweighs the potential loss from rising IV (according to Lawrence McMillan).\n\nOn the other hand, the back month options, which we have purchased, will experience slower time decay. If the purchased leg maintains its IV, we benefit from the extrinsic value loss of the sold leg while potentially profiting from the IV increase in the later expiration leg. This strategic positioning allows us to leverage both time decay and IV dynamics, maximizing our potential for profit.\n\nThis strategy gives you the possibility of holding until expiration, closing before the volatile event (in this case earnings), or close the short leg and hold the long leg to leverage the earnings move. In my case, I would rather close the full trade, but that is a personal preference\n\n**Between Calendars and Double Diagonals, the Second One is My Preferred Choice**\n\nWhen comparing calendar spreads to double diagonal spreads, my preference leans towards double diagonals. This choice is primarily driven by these key factors:\n\n* **Broader Breakeven Points**: Double diagonal spreads typically offer a wider profit area compared to calendar spreads. This means that the underlying asset has more room to move while still allowing the trade to remain profitable. This broader range provides more flexibility and a higher probability of success.\n* **Lower Vega and Delta**: As we are trading out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes, double diagonals exhibit lower sensitibity to vega and delta. This characteristic makes the strategy less sensitive to sharp price movements and implied volatility (IV) variations.\n* **Higher Theta**: The higher theta in double diagonals results in faster time decay profits. This increased theta ensures that the position profits more quickly from the passage of time.\n\nNonetheless, there are also some inconveniences:\n\n* **Reduced IV Impact on Long Legs**: As the long legs of a double diagonal spread have OTM strikes, any potential rise in IV will not significantly inflate the price of these options. This is in contrast to calendar spreads, where the long legs are more sensitive to IV increases\n* **Broader spread**: overall trade spread will be wider, as we are trading 4 contracts instead of 2\n* **Higher max loss and margin requirements**: where as in calendar spreads, the max loss is the debit paid, in double diagonals the max loss is proportionatelly much higher\n\nIn order to reduce these risks, my suggestions are:\n\n* Place the sold legs at least in the **strikes where the move after earnings is expected**. Then, when buying the contracts with furher expiration and further OTM, breakeven points will be highly wide, enough to give us security for the trade duration (breakeven point swill of course vary during the time we are in the trade, that's why bread breakevens are initially suggested).\n* Trade instruments with high options volume, in order to have **liquidity to exit the trade** in case it moves against us\n* Personally, I would not execute this trades in highly volatile stocks (e.g. TSLA). Although the potential for profit will be higher, the fast moves these stocks typically have may make the trade too volatile. If you have the time and the ability to properly monitor and psychologically manage this volatility, go fr tit! Reward will be higher\n\nFollowing this strategy, I have now 3 trades open for AMZN, GOOGL, PYPL, and will possibly open one additional trade tomorrow either in AAPL or META.\n\n**A practical example:**\n\nAs an example, find an illustration here below regarding my potential trade on META:\n\n[https://optionstrat.com/build/double-diagonal/META/.META240920C565,-.META240802C540,.META240920P430,-.META240802P440](https://optionstrat.com/build/double-diagonal/META/.META240920C565,-.META240802C540,.META240920P430,-.META240802P440)\n\nNote that IV on short legs is 60%, whereas in the long legs it's 40%, reflecting the skew I was mentioning above. I like to place this trades in a delta neutral position, but you can play around with the strikes in case you are slightly biased towards one direction. Also, note that the initial breakeven points are like 30 $ away from the expected move, which is provides some safety.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o5rgtnjqycd1.png?width=2442&format=png&auto=webp&s=687e6366378848d6cedd3ff885c708cf639f4dd2", "id": "1e51e6s", "created_utc": 1721167748.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I've extensively traded earnings with options for a while now. I've researched and experimented with a ton of stuff, including some stuff published in various posts, videos, and reports like [this one](https://quantcha.com/news/an-analysis-of-trading-earnings-releases-using-options/).\n\nOne of the key things critical to trading options with earnings *at any level* is IV crush. It comes up all the time with new investors trying to figure out why their naked calls or puts aren't printing after a good report, but it's just as important for professionals, regardless of whether they're trading on price, IV, or anything else.\n\nIt's not hard to look at the historical IV and determine what to expect options to crush to. However, crush doesn't usually have the immediate impact people expect it to. For example, the weekly ATM call trading at 40% might be expected to crush to 20% based on how it's priced outside of earnings. But the reality is that short-dated options often don't crush as expected. Sometimes they'll stay elevated above that historical mark and sometimes they'll dip below. This could be due to change in sentiment driven by earnings report revelations, simple market dynamics of investors closing/shifting positions, or just about anything else.\n\nWe (Quantcha) had so many discussions about this with clients that we actually developed a method to measure the IV crush priced in by the market for the shortest-dated ATM options expiring after earnings. It's just a number you can multiply against the current IV to understand what the market has priced them to trade at after earnings. This solved a lot of problems because it was otherwise very difficult to reasonably project the value of a book of options post-earnings. There are details about using the Earnings Crush Rate [here](https://quantcha.blob.core.windows.net/public/data/Quantcha%20US%20Equity%20Option%20Ratings%20(QOR).pdf).\n\nAnyway, one of the things that always needs to come up whenever we have discussions about trading earnings is that every trade is directional, whether you want it to be or not. There's simply no way to trade these extremely volatile events without having to care about the movement of the underlying. When you trade something like a calendar straddle/strangle (or any combination of diagonals) the movement of the underlying is really what you're betting on, even if you start off delta neutral.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey!

Companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft thrived as demand for digital services, remote work solutions, and e-commerce skyrocketed. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, which includes a broader range of industries such as energy, travel, and retail, lagged behind because these sectors were severely impacted by lockdowns and economic disruptions.\n\nThis divergence highlights a few critical factors that could indicate a potential market drop. Firstly, when tech stocks become overvalued, there's a heightened risk of a correction. If investors start doubting the sustainability of these high valuations, it can trigger a sell-off, dragging down the overall market. Secondly, sector rotation can play a significant role. Investors might shift their focus from overvalued tech stocks to undervalued sectors, causing tech stock prices to fall and impacting indices like the NASDAQ.\n\nEconomic data and earnings reports are also crucial. Negative economic indicators or disappointing earnings from major companies can spark a market-wide sell-off. Given the NASDAQ's heavy reliance on a few large tech companies, any negative news from these firms can significantly affect the index. Additionally, changes in interest rates can influence market movements. Rising interest rates typically hurt high-growth tech stocks more than others, as future earnings become less attractive. This can lead to a broader market decline, especially in the tech-heavy NASDAQ.\n\nHistorically, we've seen similar patterns during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The NASDAQ surged due to overvaluation of tech companies, leading to a significant gap compared to the S&P 500. When the bubble burst, the NASDAQ experienced a sharp decline, while the S&P 500, although affected, did not drop as severely.\n\nIn summary, while the divergence between the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 can highlight the strength of technology stocks, it also serves as a warning. Overvaluation, sector rotation, economic data, earnings reports, and interest rate changes are all critical factors that could signal a broader market drop. \n\nBe scared", "id": "1e4y9xm", "created_utc": 1721160030.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 618 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 7 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06304801255464554}, {"body": "No", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.045905232429504395}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.045905232429504395}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06637133657932281}, {"body": "Show your positions big guy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03179159015417099}, {"body": "it took chat gpt 2 seconds to write this", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "It doesn't really matter who wrote this.
