{"title": "Rumble: Huge Asymmetric Opportunity to the Upside? Multiple Catalysts ", "selftext": "Here is my second attempt at posting. Rumble stock ownership breakdown: (1) Insiders 62% (2) Dan Bongino 10% (3) Institutions 23%. That comes out to 95% ownership 1,2 and 3. How is it possible that 14 million shares are currently held short and listed as 16% of the float? The math here isn't adding up. Until I realized that the outstanding shares used to calculate float also includes warrants (i.e. call options) that were issued when Rumble went SPAC/IPO that have strike prices of $10 and $17. Given that the stock is currently trading at $5.27, it makes no sense that the warrants should also be calculated in the float size. Anyways, it is clear that there is some funny business (naked shorting a definite) going on here.\n\nAs for the business, Rumble web traffic is up nearly 40% year over year and the share price hasn't reflected this bump at all. Also, this is only year 1 that Rumble started monetizing its platform with ads (started in 2024) and also launched a cloud service (started in April). In year 1, they are already on pace to have $100 million in revenue. That's pretty insane for any business.\u00a0\n\nFor comparison, Redditt has a market cap of $10 billion with a similar small (compared to other platforms like Meta, etc) but very devoted user base like Rumble. I don't see why Rumble couldn't 2-3x its market cap with such a high growth rate and monetization has only just started. For instance, their cloud business has already landed two big names in Hard Rock Hotel and Miami Dolphins only a few months after launching the service.\n\nThoughts: Given the strange math in the share ownership (likely heavily naked short) and rapidly growing business. I think this is a great risk to reward play. Not to mention that IF Trump were to win, the stock could easily double in a few days. The stock price moves almost in tandem with the election odds for Trump. I'm not going to make a guess at who wins, but it's a 50/50 at this point and the short term upside is huge.\u00a0", "id": "1fkdh7a", "created_utc": 1726723406.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 6 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 2 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18341034650802612}, {"body": "Damn\u2026..this is actually coherent.
