{"title": "Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos", "selftext": "Larry Ellison\u00a0turned 80 last month. It\u2019s been a celebratory year.\n\nWhile fellow legacy tech players\u00a0Intel\u00a0and\u00a0Cisco\u00a0struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.\n\nFollowing a better-than-expected\u00a0[earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html)\u00a0after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company\u2019s cloud businesses. The stock didn\u2019t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe excitement is back,\u201d Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting \u201cmomentum across all business.\u201d\n\nOracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0\u2014 up 136% \u2014 among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is\u00a0Meta, which has gained 45%.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced\u00a0major layoffs\u00a0in their\u00a0earnings reports\u00a0last month.\n\nThe biggest financial winner from Oracle\u2019s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to\u00a0Forbes. Only\u00a0Tesla\u00a0CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0($251 billion) and Amazon founder\u00a0Jeff Bezos\u00a0($202 billion) are wealthier.\n\nBy the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.\n\nRevenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.\n\nSince 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth \u2014 18% in fiscal 2023 \u2014 and four times the company has contracted.\n\n\u201cAfter 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,\u201d JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. \u201cWe remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.\u201d\n\nOracle is currently in the midst of its\u00a0CloudWorld\u00a0conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company\u2019s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.\n\nWhile Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Google\u00a0in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.\n\nIn addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.\n\nA year ago, Ellison\u00a0visited Microsoft\u2019s headquarters\u00a0outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he\u2019d competed with for more than 30 years.\n\nOn Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.\n\n\u201cWe believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,\u201d Ellison said on Monday\u2019s earnings call.\n\nOracle didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment for this story.\n\n# \u2018No more passwords\u2019\n\nFor years, Ellison described Oracle\u2019s database as \u201cautonomous,\u201d playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla\u2019s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn\u2019t need manual patching and wouldn\u2019t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he\u2019s benefitted from playing nice.\n\nAfter years of\u00a0criticizing AWS\u00a0at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon\u2019s market-leading cloud with Oracle\u2019s full-featured database.\n\n\u201cOf course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,\u201d AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.\n\nGarman, who\u00a0replaced\u00a0Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.\n\nAs Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he\u2019s now taking on passwords, which he calls \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d because they\u2019re insecure and can be \u201ceasily hacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the way log-on is going to work,\u201d Ellison said on the earnings call. \u201cI\u2019m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, \u2018OK, Hi Larry.\u2019 We\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there\u2019s no reason his computer shouldn\u2019t be able to the same.\n\n\u201cNo more passwords,\u201d he said. \u201cThose have got to go.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/oracle-trails-only-nvidia-among-large-cap-tech-in-2024-ellison-wins.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/oracle-trails-only-nvidia-among-large-cap-tech-in-2024-ellison-wins.html)", "id": "1feqk2z", "created_utc": 1726103727.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "I want Larry Ellison\u2019s physique at 80\n\nI\u2019m just saying that Larry Ellison will live longer from this point than Jim Cramer.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "you need Larry Ellison\u2019s\u00a0money", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Oh for sure, and throw me a couple inches on the ol\u2019 schnitzel as well.

Cash from operating activities was $40.9 million, representing a margin of 18%. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $37.1 million, representing free cash flow margin of 17%.\n- They also have a ratio of 8:1 in terms of total current assets to total current liabilities. Meaning they can payoff their short term debt 8x. This is good news. \nId also like to add an investment piece they have \u201cWe have excluded the impact of the Shopify investment option of 15,743,174 shares at $88.93 per share as it was out of the money as of June 30, 2024. The investment option expires on July 28, 2030.\u201d\n\nThey have a phat relationship with Shopify and are expecting to grow with them and capitalize on their company growth.\n\nAll of this can be found on their earnings report: https://investors.klaviyo.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx\n\n**Good News**\n\nExpanded SMS offering to 12 countries with availability in Austria, Switzerland and Spain.Announced new integrations with Toast, BazaarVoice, TikTok, and Pinterest, adding to the company's more than 350 third-party integrations.New and expansion deals closed with Samsonite, Herschel Supply Company, and Barstool Sports and others during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.Over 151,000 customers were using Klaviyo to drive their own revenue growth as of June 30, 2024, compared to over 130,000 customers as of June 30, 2023.\nIncreased penetration up market, ending the quarter with 2,386 customers generating over $50,000 of ARR, compared to 1,458 at the end of the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 64% year-over-year. Also good to note this is the highest number of greater than 50,000 ARR customers that they have in their company's history.\n\nAccording to Klaviyo's own data - more than 20,000 brands have switched from Mailchimp to Klaviyo (note Mailchimp was acquired by intuit back in 2021). \n\nKlaviyo virtually integrates with every eCommerce platform and app you'll ever need. It has over 200+ pre-built integrations to customer support tools, SMS tools, loyalty programs, user-generated content, subscription tools, payments, and virtually any app you have in your tech stack.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nNeedham: $40 (9/4/24)\nBarclays: Overweight ($32) (8/8/24)\nKeyblanc: ($33) (8/8/24)\n\n**Financial Outlook**\nRevenue: Q3 (225M) -> Q4 (910M)\nNon-GAAP: Q3 (21.5M) -> Q4 (103M)\n\n\nTheir spending on R&D and G&A were both down by 100+ basis points on their recent earnings report. As they increased their spending on Sales and Marketing which they already stated would be happening in the previous quarters. \n\nTLDR: KVYO good deals, solid growth projections, great leadership/board, entry price slightly higher than IPO price, starting to dominate its industry and acquiring customers from Mailchimp. \n\nThis is *just* DD I have no positions currently, but I *AM* looking to acquire shares, and most likely calls for the next earnings in November.
