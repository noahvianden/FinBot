{"title": "New AI models could really be a catalyst", "selftext": "I think we're about to see a major shift that could really benefit NVDA. OpenAI just dropped their new model called o1, and it's not just another chatbot - this thing can actually reason and solve complex problems.\n\nHere's my take: Everyone's been worried about the ROI on these massive AI models; like, are they actually worth the insane compute costs? I think o1 and the next generation of models (Q* or \"strawberry models\") are gonna change that equation. These new models aren't just party tricks. They'll be solving real, hard problems in math, science, and coding, o1 model scored in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions and crushed some serious math and science tests. That's the kind of AI that businesses can actually use to boost productivity. We may be hitting a tipping point where AI starts to actually replace human labor in cognitive tasks. Not just in boring data entry stuff, but in high-level problem-solving. \n\nSo yes, competition's heating up, and there's always the chance of regulatory issues or export controls, plus NVDA's not exactly cheap right now. But I think the market's still underestimating just how big this next wave of AI could be.. Would love to hear your thoughts", "id": "1ffqbio", "created_utc": 1726218707.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "100% - this is finally a glimpse at a second iteration model: a model that couldn't exist without the previous model capabilities at training time.\n\n\nGpt 3/3.5 were the first to undeniably \"understand language\". They could be clever, but that was mostly a function of language comprehension and data exposure. \n\nGpt 4 was a nudge in the parameter direction - certainly a broad uptick in all capabilities, but not a significant shift in training paradigm (mixture of experts is essentially just having clones/multiples).\n\n\no1 is different - the language comprehension of 3.5/4 exposed to us the ability for things like Chain of Thought/Think step by step/RAG to increase the capability of the model. Essentially, only after bringing 3.5/4 into existence could we actually learn the strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAnd so they took that new understanding and perspective and leveraged it into a new training paradigm - now chain of thought exists at the training level, meaning the ways gpt 3.5/4 would still hallucinate/fail using CoT can finally be addressed and corrected. This is a fundamental change in the performance functions for models.\n\n\nAnd they say as much: train-time compute and test-time compute both scale with performance, parameters held constant.\n\n\n\nFor us, the important conclusion is it is no longer just parameter count we scale, we will scale train-time test-time compute, too.\n\n\nAnd thinking ahead, what might o1 capabilities teach us, and what might the strategy only now possible with o1 that was impossible before be? (And who's products will make it the fastest and easiest to search this space? \ud83d\ude09)\n\n\nAlso this looks exactly like what the core reasoning model of a robot should be based on - durable, inspectable, correctable, logic.

I\u2019ll summarize for myself and others. o1 is not a jump in parameters (brain size/scale) it is a change in both training and inference techniques. Those inference techniques now being included in the training.\n\nIn other words, they have now trained a model on how to think more carefully and iteratively. This will move us from zero shot to multi step prompting essentially natively, except that since this happens inside of the model it is far more useful, efficient and capable since there is no interface barrier between the humans and models to deal with.\n\nWhat this means for Nvidia is that not only are we going to be scaling parameters for models (which will obviously massively increase hardware reqs for both training and inference) but we will also be scaling inference compute needs exponentially. This chain of thought native to each prompt will need to be cut down from 1 minute to seconds. Hours to minutes. \n\nCould you imagine pairing this with GPT5? I mean GPT5 alone with the old zero shot would have been something extraordinary. With this chain of thought reasoning it may exceed AGI requirements without being sentient.\n\nI say without being sentient only because this \u201cthing\u201d will only have \u201clife\u201d while it is reasoning, and then it will cease to \u201cexist\u201d before simply becoming another instance.\n\nAnyway since this is a stock subreddit - this means printing more money for NVIDIA. Honestly I don\u2019t think there is a ceiling that makes sense to us today. $100 trillion in 10 years may not be unreasonable. It will be something wild and outlandish and will only be believed once it happens.\n\nThe scale at which this is happening is just incredible, and due to the nature of competition no one is backing down. They\u2019re ramping up. More players are entering. It\u2019s a feeding frenzy for Nvidia.\n\nBut seriously, this o1 is an absolute paradigm shift. Anyone complaining about this stuff going too slowly is delusional. Things are happening so rapidly it\u2019s hard to even keep up with the developments. OpenAI themselves is clearly still unpacking the capabilities of GPT4 level parameter sizes.\n\nLikely GPT4 is capable of something close to AGI with steady state neural activity and this chain of thought reasoning (internal thought).\n\nJust insane.

Could be anything actually, but for CSPs people say delta 30. Why do people do that? If OTM, the chances of it expiring are high and you can keep on rolling. But people use ATM also, or sometimes ITM also. Why? The theta is high. You want theta.\n\nBetween the range of 30-70 where 30 is at the edge of good theta zone on the left side, and 70 is the edge of good theta on the right side, you can keep on rolling. There is no need to adjust. Every roll is going to yield some money.\n\nSome may say that a range of 25-75 would be also be reasonable. I agree.\n\nNov 24, 250 covered call is at delta 43, well within the above ranges and an awesome place to be in to roll. You should not worry about adjusting until the option goes out of this range.\n\nBut would you not get assigned?\n\nIt is my observation from 100s of trades that you will not get assigned if your option has 0.2% of CMP still left as extrinsic. So for a price of 250, does the option have 50 cents left over in extrinsic? If no, then you are at risk of assignment, otherwise no. No one wants to pay an extra 50 cents in assigning you when they can buy / sell it cheaper against the market, including slippage. Apart from earning days, this can be managed.\n\nI suggest you hold the option as is, and adjust it only it goes out of bound - delta is below 25 or above 75, OR extrinsic drops to below 50 cents. Squeeze the max juice out of current theta set up.\n\nTheta burn is the highest in an options last days (unless it is far OTM/ITM) so use it to the max and roll only when there is no juice to be squeezed.\n\nWhat if you still get assigned?\n\nApart from tax implications, what is stopping you from writing a 250 put as soon as you get assigned? Technically it will be the same set up.\n\n78$ for December 2026 sounds awesome but it is 27 months away, and what you are betting on is a bunch of 10 dollar (or even lower) rolls to give you lot more than 78$ in those 27 months. Let's say the price went to 300 tomorrow, I am sure you could still roll the call to December 2026 and get some juice, although it may not be 78$. For example, the extrinsic for 180 strike (50 points below market) is 53$ for the same expiry so you are only giving up 25 points, but do note that your current option has some extrinsic and you will need to deduct that.\n\nEdit: See the roll I did on Tesla just yesterday: [https://imgur.com/a/rtO4N0l](https://imgur.com/a/rtO4N0l) - I could have held on a few more days but it finally was out of my comfort zone. But I made in 1 roll the equivalent of what you will your 3-6 months of alternate adjustments. Of course I can not get it every month, but if I can get half as much roll for 12 months out of your 27, I am home free, aint i? - I am traveling in Asian Time zone so the timestamps are a bit wonky.\n\nEdit 2: But why can't I just roll? You do not know which way the market is going? It may be going up, up and up like it did for NVDA until recently, or it may reverse. I do not want to be caught in a whipsaw and regret the roll so I defer it till the last minute. Could I be wrong, sure, but price has to go from 180 to 200 to 250 to 300 before it starts hurting me.

{"title": "Heading into next week", "selftext": "Last week, exactly when the news was saying to not buy or increase exposure is when I said that it's a good buying opportunity and my other post was deleted (I did sth right or wrote the R word too many times and we are more sensitive nowadays). Lets see if this one gets removed....\n\nSo going into next week with the Fed meeting I expect the market to trend sideways or slightly down (SPY around 553-563). Looking at index divergence QQQ definitely experienced sharper drops and is lagging SPY and DIA. For a bullish case into late sept-oct we need to see QQQ catching up, but we could also see a selloff of SPY and DIA, which isn't that great for bulls.\n\nThe most likely outcome for a rate cut is 25bp, there could still be a 50bp cut, but I believe the outcome that guarantees smooth sailing into the future months is a 25bp cut and the Fed more or less hinting towards another 2-3 rate cuts later into the year. The 50bp cut will just signal something is wrong with the economy. The no cut scenario might be the worse one, but giving it only a 1% chance since the dual mandate of the Fed involves keeping inflation close to the 2% target and maximum employment. They haven't been doing too great on the employment part so future cuts is the more likely outcome.\n\nI would recommend taking profits if you did buy the lows and waiting it out until after the meeting. Hopefully this will save some of you guys from buying the top (if it pumps before the Fed meeting) or selling the bottom (if it drops too much beforehand). There was some rotation from big money into bond etfs though I'm not sure if the cuts are already priced in or not so this is rather risky unless IV is low and you can play both sides before the announcement. Large insder buys/sells wise I am pretty much seeing only Buffet dump BAC shares either to have cash or rotate into something else. I think banks won't be doing too well if rates go lower, but it should benefit tech, real estate and companies that need to do some debt restructuring. \n\nI think generally you'll want to take some profits and wait out Wednesday to see the direction. If it's looking bullish then buying dips and holding for longer is gonna be a good plan, if it's looking bearish it's better to buy large dips and then take profits on retracements in the same day.", "id": "1ffrbip", "created_utc": 1726223008.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 4 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 43 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0578438974916935}, {"body": "Dot plots will matter for currency strength.\n\n\n\nA 25 bps cut that is showing another 50 bps to 100 bps lower EFFR in the next 12- to 24-months will lead to a steep decline of the dollar.\n\n  \nThe trade of the day might be positive.

Supposedly Romania has 5% inflation, but I've been cutting prices a lot recently (hospitality and b2b print services) just to stay relevant. Idk how they calculate inflation, maybe they take smoke and alcohol prices into account which have gone up, but a beer is still pretty much the same as 0.5L of bottled water in UK, US or Germany. I'm borrowing in our currency and betting for the EUR/USD to rise against it and for roughly 5y now it essentially let my company borrow for free.
