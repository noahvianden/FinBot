China has no restriction in getting Nvidia SW.\n\nWhat I mean is that if you have a scaling SW then a chip restriction can be bypassed by scaling clusters.

Why?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Current $3T companies are making 3x their revenue and have diversified product lines. They are also Nvidia's biggest customers. Blackwell will increase their guidance as they haven't had anything for the last 6 months to really give it a boost other than data centre sales catching up from their 0 revenue it was generating to where it's going to settle and grow linearly as sales naturally decline when orders are filled. These tech companies don't want to fall behind in the AI race but once they have the infrastructure and are front runners if it does take off further they don't really have to worry as much about the possibility of missing out. --- This is baked into the current price. \n\nOnce Nvidia starts to calm down and profits drop to low double digit growth (again I seem to need to reiterate I don't think they're going to fail they'll still be making tens of billions per year) but ~70% profit margin is difficult to maintain when they've scaled this big, it will likely continue to drop closer to the 45% level. \n\nThen you have the other Mag 7 companies to look at. Microsoft and Apple have been around for decades and stood the test of time, Nvidia has seen 2 years of success. Back to the diversified product lines, Apple's flagship product, the iPhone, still only accounts for 46% of their total revenue while data centres for Nvidia are 86%. That means any disruption to the data centre business such as delays, TSMC factory issues, lower demand, etc. is going to have a massive impact on their revenue stream. I think any number of those things could happen and lower demand will be the most likely. \n\nA $90 stock price would still put them at around a $2.3T market cap, the third most valuable company in the world. People think that's bad!? It's realistic. Many companies have tried to topple Apple and Microsoft and failed. \n\nLet's look at Amazon's earnings for the last year where they've had around $140B in revenue per quarter, a 12% increase YOY, but as of their recent earnings net profit is up 99.78%, their EPS beat expectations by 20%+ the last 3 quarters and 58% last September, their shares are currently the same price they were back in 2021 and have a $1.87T market cap and those share prices were during the surge of the pandemic (ie their ceiling) which is exactly what I think Blackwell is going to do for Nvidia.\n\nOnce the online shopping trend died down as the world began returning to normal their share price returned to pre-pandemic levels of around $90 and it's taken 2 years for them to recover (again, this was achieved by more than tripling their net income YOY) we'll see a similar cycle with Nvidia between chip releases is my prediction as it's not a consumer product. It relies on heavy investment and large purchases from the rest of the Mag7 so they're not going to be buying new tech every year like people do with iPhones or Microsoft's office and cloud services. \n\nYou can also compare them to Tesla having one product that hinges on hype remaining at an all time high but speculation is now turning into looking for results and people will lose faith in the AI revolution if they aren't up to expectations (which given the hype, are pretty high as was proven by earnings dropping the price) \n\nSo TLDR I think chip releases will increase the price substantially as revenue will be well above their normal growth those years and in between generations the price will drop in line with their actual growth. In order to maintain its $3T+ valuation the company needs to find new sources of revenue outside data centres that is going to be a continuous income source, one earthquake takes out TSMC and this company loses 86% of its value. The current growth levels it's seen are unsustainable so the stock price is unsustainable. A 10% drop from its current price doesn't seem unreasonable.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The Internet is no place for this sort of reason and nuance.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07611118257045746}], "tickers": ["msft", "nvda", "tsla", "aapl", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Overvalued.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3083542585372925}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22578021883964539}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05084523558616638}], "tickers": []}

{"title": "Salesforce to acquire startup Own for $1.9 billion in cash ", "selftext": "Salesforce announced Thursday that it would pay $1.9 billion in cash for Own Co., a startup specializing in tools for backing up data in cloud-based applications. Salesforce intends to close the deal in the quarter ending in January 2025 if regulators give it their blessing, according to a statement.\n\nThe startup, formerly known as OwnBackup, was valued at $3.35 billion in a 2021 funding round. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud software company\u2019s venture arm, invested in that round and earlier ones.\n\nThe proposed deal would mark the return of sizable deals for Salesforce, less than two years after co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said the board was eliminating a committee on mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBenioff\u2019s pronouncement came after activist investors bought stakes in Salesforce and raised questions about profitability after the company had splurged on expensive assets, including MuleSoft and Slack, without delivering major growth in return.\n\nThe decline in value for Own reflects a more sluggish backdrop for software companies.\n\nIn late 2021, investors became less interested in cloud software, which had seen a surge in adoption in 2020 thanks to remote-work policies instituted after Covid. Central banks raised rates to ward off inflation, prompting money-losing cloud companies to focus more on profitability. Enterprises aiming to slim down information-technology budgets consolidated their purchases, burdening single-product companies, including startups and publicly traded companies.\n\nAnaplan, Avalara, Coupa, Everbridge, Qualtrics, Sumo Logic and Zendesk all went private.\n\nOwn, which had specialized in helping Salesforce clients, sought to diversify. In its 2021 funding announcement, it touted its intent to work with Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics enterprise software that competes with Salesforce\u2019s core applications. Support for ServiceNow followed.\n\nSalesforce in recent weeks has also revealed plans to buy smaller startups PredictSpring and Tenyx.\n\nSalesforce said the Own acquisition wouldn\u2019t impact Salesforce\u2019s shareholder return initiatives, and said the deal would be accretive to free cash flow starting in the second year after the deal closes.\n\nIn April, data-management software maker Informatica said it was not in talks to be acquired after media outlets reported Salesforce was interested in buying the company for around $10 billion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at products organically, but, yes, we will continue to look at products inorganically,\u201d Benioff told analysts on Salesforce\u2019s May earnings call. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve committed to you, if we\u2019re looking at a large-scale acquisition, we\u2019re going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers, that it\u2019s accretive, that it has the right metrics.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/salesforce-to-acquire-own-for-1point9-billion-in-cash.html", "id": "1fa2bgd", "created_utc": 1725583329.0, "score": 105, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "after the news larry ellison was buying paramount, i thought salesforce was buying oprah winfrey\u2019s tv channels at first when i read the headline", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Ditto, 100 per cent", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13560828566551208}, {"body": "That would be sad if she win from another scam.\u00a0", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2501898407936096}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4431796371936798}, {"body": "Wow, I\u2019m very familiar with this company from my network and this is a really tough return on equity for their employees if this goes through.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "As in they\u2019re all not in the money at this valuation?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m sure a good % are, but the last valuation was like $4b so that\u2019s a pretty tough pay cut", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "The alternative was IPO which would be an even bigger disaster.

{"title": "First DD: Bullish on Delta (DAL) through both technical and fundamental analysis in the medium term", "selftext": "**Overview**\u00a0\n\nThe airline industry is known for being highly competitive, with fuel prices exposure, high customer power, and sector overcrowding driving downward pressure on margins as well as shareholder returns. Airlines are also extremely capital-intensive and require large amounts of debt to finance their Boeing and Airbus fleets. This leads to large interest payments that further narrow margins. The large amount of debt also increases equity volatility, causing airline stocks to be more volatile. Therefore, it is no surprise that the airline industry underperforms the broader market significantly; since its inception in August 2014, the US JETS ETF has returned a total of \u201321% to shareholders over 10 years, or about \u20132% per year. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nDelta is a leader in this industry. In the past 4 months, Delta has dropped from its high of 54 to a low of around 38, a 30% drop characteristic of this volatile sector. This drop can be attributed to three key factors: 1) rising jet fuel prices and declining margins, 2) lower expectations for consumer confidence and air travel growth, and 3)\u00a0the CrowdStrike outage that wiped out 380 million in direct revenue for DAL. Delta currently hovers around 42 with a trailing PE of 6.1 and a forward PE of 5.9. In comparison, the broader airline industry trades at a median PE of 6.9 and forward PE of 5.6.\u00a0\n\nIt is empirically true that good companies in weak sectors can still generate strong returns; this is the case for Delta, a large company with strong FCF that many ignore or overlook due to the airline sector performance as a whole. My favorite long plays are on stocks with high volatility, attractive valuation, strong cash flows, and recent negative press that fails to fundamentally change its value proposition. Unfortunately, DAL fits all these criteria, and as a result I have come forth with a long thesis. \u00a0\n\n**Technical Analysis**\u00a0\n\n[20, 50, 200 MA for Delta on the daily chart from 2022-2024; signals 1, 2, 3 labeled](https://preview.redd.it/opj7jg4u33nd1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89e90d67a5cf9d1fc7f7934ccc65246100c162f)\n\nLooking at the past 3 years (post-COVID) graph of Delta, it becomes clear that airlines are volatile but also momentous in the longer term. The graph has long stretches of both bullish and bearish runs; to be profitable a trader will seek to time entries into long and shorts within the transition period between bearish and bullish, maximizing\u00a0exposure to\u00a0the longer-term trend. My thesis is that we are currently in one of these transition periods.\u00a0\n\nThe red, blue, and gold lines represent the 20, 50, and 200 MA on the daily chart, respectively. We use a combination of three bullish signals to propose a long entry:\u00a0\n\n* Signal 1: A downward trending 20MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart\u00a0\n   * Out of the 11 occurrences in the past 3 years (red events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 10/11 (91%) times\u00a0\n   * Red event 4 is the only event that fails this signal, while red event 8 lead the bullish run by 1-2 months\u00a0\n   * In the past year, there has been 3 such occurrences, and DAL has continued a bullish trend 100% of the time\u00a0\n   * The last occurrence was 2 weeks ago\u00a0\n* Signal 2: A downward trending 50MA crosses upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks\u00a0\n   * Out of the 7 occurrences in the past 3 years (blue events), DAL has continued a bullish trend 7/7 (100%) times\u00a0\n   * The 8th occurrence was yesterday\u00a0\n* Signal 3: An upward trending 200MA crosses a faster, upward trending DAL on the daily chart, typically following signal 2 after 1-3 weeks\u00a0\n   * Out of the 2 occurrences in the past 2 years (yellow events), DAL has continued a long bullish trend 2/2 (100%) times\u00a0\n   * The 200MA has begun trending upward post COVID since April 2023 and continues its momentum\u00a0\n   * The 3^(rd) occurrence will likely be within the next 2 weeks\n\nThese three signals consecutively have signaled strong bullish trends lasting 2-5 months representing 46% and 40% returns, respectively (34-50 and (34-50 and 38-53). We are now sitting at 42, with these three signals poised to align again. The current RSI14 is not high or low but rising, indicating growing momentum. However, we may be cautionary due to the lower-than-average trading volume during the past 2-3 weeks.\u00a0\n\nTaken together, we project a conservative price target of 56, representing 34% return, within the next 4 months.\u00a0\n\nNow, before we lose our entire portfolio, let's turn to the fundamentals, as just looking at technical signals is like driving a car by only looking through the rear-view mirror.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\u00a0\n\nDespite the underperforming and highly competitive airlines industry, Delta is well positioned in the industry. Competition and strategic differentiation by price currently favor premium airlines (see: [Budget Airlines Want to Go Premium. That\u2019s Easier Said Than Done.](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/budget-airlines-premium-perks-245a1d61)) As other airlines struggle to compete, Delta can capture a larger percentage of the total market in the short term. As a premium airline with brand strength, Delta\u2019s pricing power will remain until its competitors can effectively compete on quality and experience.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, the airline industry has excess capacity as airlines were overly optimistic about demand forecasts post-COVID. As volume players correct overexpansion of routes while shifting away from volume towards quality, we can expect more rational price discipline and subsequent price premiums (and margins) to increase. While 90% of corporations do not expect corporate air travel demand to soften ([Delta Air Lines, Inc. - Delta Air Lines Announces June Quarter 2024 Financial Results)](https://ir.delta.com/news/news-details/2024/Delta-Air-Lines-Announces-June-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx), slowing growth coupled with higher ROIC is preferable to value destruction; Delta\u2019s key ratios ([DAL (Delta Air Lines) 1-Year ROIIC % (gurufocus.com),](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/roiic-1y/DAL) [DAL | Overview (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/overview)) show ROIC strength compared to industry peers, as well as ROIC higher than cost of capital.\u00a0\n\nFuel cost impacts on margin may also trend favorably for airlines, as oil prices drop in the short term. With the markets potentially pricing in a Trump presidency, we may see fuel-cost tailwinds for Delta.\u00a0\n\nAnother short-term consideration has been the CrowdStrike outage; while investors have been pricing in the revenue hit, the scale and timeline of Delta\u2019s recovery is still in speculation.\u00a0Known for their operational prowess, this one-time, one-week fiasco is unlikely to have changed much except for the direct revenue hit. This event may have led to DAL being oversold in the short term (2 weeks ago). \u00a0\n\nA 5-year growth-exit DCF valuation gives a fair value of 64, well above our price target of 56 from earlier:\u00a0[Delta DCF Valuation | Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL) (valueinvesting.io)](https://valueinvesting.io/DAL/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y)\u00a0\n\n* Above model makes reasonable revenue growth assumptions\u00a0\n   * Model projects DAL revenue CAGR of 4.77%\u00a0\n      * Past 15 years, DAL revenue CAGR is 5.75%, or 6.24% removing COVID years\u00a0\n      * Growth projection supported by DAL 200MA\u00a0\n   * CAPEX assumptions are reasonable (11% consistent with historical)\u00a0\n   * Terminal growth rate of 0.5%, Terminal Value 75% of EV \u2013 reasonable\u00a0\n      * US population growth of 0.4% but trending downward\u00a0\n      * US GDP growth 2-3%\u00a0\n   * Airline industry unlikely to be replaced in the next decades\u00a0\n* Note: if you check out the other valuation models at the above link, all but the earnings power value model forecasts a much higher fair value than the current price of 42\u00a0\n   * This is due to the earnings power value model being reliant on historical earnings, which are heavily skewed due to COVID in 2020 and 2021\u00a0\n\nOther notes:\u00a0\n\n* Delta\u2019s fleet is 40% airbus, making it less exposed to Boeing than other airlines\u00a0\n* Recent US Dept. Of Transportation inquiry may impact share price(airlines including DAL must submit a report within 90 days: [Federal probe targets airline frequent flyer programs | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/travel/airline-loyalty-frequent-flyer-dot-probe/index.html)\u00a0\n* Ongoing litigation with CRWD and MSFT, burden of proof\u00a0\n\nOur fundamental analysis reaches the conclusion that DAL is undervalued, with the reason for lower multiplies possibly being attributable to the competitiveness of the industry, macroeconomic and consumer spend caution in the short term,\u00a0jet fuel price uncertainty, and negative events in the short term. DAL should continue to enjoy strong cash flows as it reduces debt,\u00a0strengthens its\u00a0brand, and diversifies cash flows (56% of revenue from premium, loyalty, and other streams) in the unattractive airline industry. \u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining technical and fundamental, we can confidently enter long on DAL with a time horizon of the next two quarters; I am looking to trade DAL at a good time, not a long time. Given this timeframe, here are my (updated) positions:\u00a0\n\n* 30 Dec20-24 50 calls at 1.07 -> 3210\n* 20 Jan17-25 50 calls at 1.4 -> 3800\n* 40 Jan17-25 55 calls at 0.67 -> 2680\n\nThese positions represent a net cost value of 9.69k.

They didn't just rip the week of earnings, but the week after. That is why for a week later.\n\n***IF,*** and again, I emphasize the ***IF*** part heavily, COST announces a split, it will be nuts. ***IF*** COST announces a split, this breaks $1000 easy. Way easy.\n\nI'm wrong, I lose 2% of my capital. If I'm right though? I've got COST call options that are $10-50 ITM overnight, on the week of earnings, with 1 week left until the options expire (time decay).\n\nYou make money on the velocity of the price increase/decrease.\n\nTake the DLTR 65p for example.\n\nMarket opens, $DLTR was trading for $66/share. Yet, the 65p were worth $2.00/each, right? What happened a few minutes/hours later though? Those options actually got in the money, albeit slightly. The 65p went from being $1 OTM, to just barely ITM. Yet, when those 65p were ITM, they were only worth $1.50/each. Why?\n\nVelocity, aka Gamma, in 'greeks' terms.\n\nOptions are priced based off of 2 things: Intrinsic and extrinsic value.\n\nDLTR goes from 85 to 66 overnight, that is extrinsic value. There is no intrinsic value, the option is $1 OTM. But the day before, that same option was \\~$20 OTM. Going from being $20 OTM to $1 OTM is extrinsic value (gamma in 'the greeks'). That is why the options were worth $2.00/each, despite being $1 OTM.\n\nNow what happens hours later, when DLTR goes to $63/share. Those 65p are now $2 ITM, yet are worth the same as when they were $1 OTM hours ago. Why? Extrinsic value. Those options went from being $20 OTM to $1 OTM to $2 ITM. Extrinsic value.\n\nWe bought those options when they were 0.28/each. Before this extrinsic value event (25% drop) happened. Now, they're worth more. Overnight. But what happens when that 25% drop is finally priced in? You no longer have extrinsic value, only intrinsic value. AKA, those same options that were worth $2.00 at open, are now only worth $1.00-$1.25/each. Despite the stocks price being the same.\n\nWhy? The extrinsic value event (25% price drop) has already happened. AKA, it is already priced in. Now, you only have intrinsic value (ITM or OTM) instead of extrinsic value.\n\nThis is why, hours later when the 65p were $2 ITM, they were worth the same exact price as when the stock was $1 OTM, extrinsic value (the 25% drop). Now that the 25% drop (extrinsic event) has already happened, you're only left with intrinsic value (ITM or OTM).\n\nThat is why those of us that sold the 65p at open ($1 OTM) made the same amount of money as those that sold hours later, when the 65p were $2 ITM.\n\nWe didn't just have the intrinsic value, but also the extrinsic value as well (25% drop). That 25% drop already happens? No more extrinsic value, only intrinsic.\n\nSo, back to the COST play. Not only will those option be ITM (intrinsic value) but will also have extrinsic value (being $100 OTM to $10-$50 ITM overnight)\n\nThat is how you make money with options. You buy them for their intrinsic value, before they have any extrinsic value. Once they have extrinsic value? You \"sell the dream\" to someone else and let it be their problem, selling the option that you bought for cheap, for a 'premium'.\n\nThe people that sold me the $INTC 25p for 0.03/each were probably laughing.\n\n\"Free premium bro. INTC will never drop to the price.\"\n\nThen INTC had ER and those options were suddenly $4 ITM, with the extrinsic value of the stock dropping from $28 down to $20. Plus the intrinsic value of them being $4 ITM.\n\nMake sense?\n\nApologies for the rant. But I feel this information will be useful to others.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

You buy even just a 100c option on $SHIT. Overnight, the stock goes from $50/share to $75/share. \n\nThat option is still $25 OTM, but the night before it was $50 OTM. Now the premium (price) of the 100c is much larger than it was the day before. Why? \n\nExtrinsic value. That 100c is still $25 OTM. But yesterday, it was $50 OTM. The option went from being $50 OTM to $25 OTM. So, the option is not ITM (intrinsic value) it still holds extrinsic value because it went from being $50 OTM to $25 OTM. \n\nIf this option in particular has weeks to expiration instead of days? That is even more extrinsic value. \n\nGoing from being $50 OTM to $25 OTM on an option contract that expires that same Friday is one thing. But when you've got time (weeks from expiration instead of days), now you've got even more extrinsic value. \n\nFor 1) the extrinsic value is from the fact that your option went from being $50 OTM to $25 OTM over night.\n\nFor 2) Time = extrinsic value. \n\nSuper super basic example, and it doesn't always apply, but it demonstrates the point well enough. \n\nTime = money.
