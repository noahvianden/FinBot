{"title": "A chance to make back tendies with regarded ARM moves", "selftext": "PE Ratio is a nice 1,580.00, Arm's calendar Q4 (FY Q3) revenue was up 28% yoy at $746 million for EBITDA of $450 million. Market Cap sits at a cool 129.949B now. In short these numbers are horrendous and make NVDA, SMCI look like bargains.\n\nARM holdings is probably one of the most volatile companies at its current market cap. Should be public knowledge that Softbank is able to dump a shit ton of shares starting around mid March and it's likely going to tank following that. Maybe it's going to pull a CAVA, you never now, but shit it not going to be worth the hold to find out. Anyway that's still about a month away.\n\nSo why is it doing this stupid shit? Two reasons. One reason is that the 90% of the shares that Softbank owns are currently locked up and can't be sold. So out of that 129.949B 90% are locked up, that leaves us with 12.9B or 102 million shares at current prices. Nvidia just reported a 1.96M share stake in ARM, so you can make that a cool round 100 million shares. A few more institutional investors and the float of shares that can be freely traded by us regards gets into the xx million shares.\n\nQuoting [reuter's](https://www.reuters.com/technology/arm-shares-soar-ai-fueled-boom-brightens-growth-prospects-2024-02-08/):\n\n> The question now is what SoftBank, which is currently restricted from selling Arm shares as part of its agreement to take the company public, does in March, when it\u2019s permitted to begin selling Arm shares again. SoftBank could fuel a buyback of its own shares by selling Arm stock \u2014 or decide to sit on that stock instead.\n\nSecond reason, there's an absolute mind boggling amount of calls out there: Feb 16 (expiring in 2 days!) with a staggering 135k calls. Most regarded of them all the 12 thousand 185C's that a few of you regards probably own. High probability they gonna expire worthless, but you still have two days to find out. Then there's also a regraded amount of LEAP 2026 calls (about 100k around 65-80 strikes) that are deep ITM now and likely caused the earnings spike. This had been picked up pre-ER by a few stock news websites. Also some WSB users commented on it (didn't see it unfortunately). Whoever you are, I hope you're swimming in sweet sweet tendies now.\n\nThe logical thing would be some kind of ultra regarded move into 200+ followed by a crash/fade into the March lockup expiry. But who the fuck knows my last two ER DD's were an absolute shit show (FSLY, ANET) so you should probably just stop reading this and trade something else.\n\nPositions: small number of shares (100). Calls are expensive.\n\n**TL;DR our new regard brother $ARM is a turbo speed racer that's gonna fly high and eventually crash into a wall**", "id": "1ar11ta", "created_utc": 1707953150.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|8068|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sa2b8l/missed_the_nflx_er_a_look_at_upcoming_earnings/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1958390474319458}, {"body": "Strike price, exp date, and bag size or ban.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "For jizzability", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13183173537254333}, {"body": "Added my position.

Two reasons. One reason is that the 90% of the shares that Softbank owns are currently locked up and can't be sold. So out of that 129.949B 90% are locked up, that leaves us with 12.9B or 102 million shares at current prices. Nvidia just reported a 1.96M share stake in ARM, so you can make that a cool round 100 million shares. A few more institutional investors and the float of shares that can be freely traded by us regards gets into the xx million shares.\n\nThe lockup is for early shareholders and employees of existing RSU's (restricted stock units).\n\nIt has nothing to do with the 90% of the stake softbank owns in the company. Why the fuck would they just dump shares out onto the market suddenly right after a lockup expiry? It's makes absolutely no sense. They could do it but I hardly find that date an appropriate time to even think of such a dumbass thing.\n\nMore than likely they would do it if they needed to raise some capital and they absolutely know ARM is in a great position itself. Like 2 more quarters of just great growth and then yea I could see them saying ok if we NEED to raise money we have this option. And it wouldn't be a day dump but probably over a year or so on listed dates. Meaning, they would do it so the market could absorb it appropriately.\n\nNext, RSU's don't just sell into the market but rather \"transfer\" to the employees ownership. They go from being the companies to being the employees.\n\nThey simply endup in a brokerage account.\n\nNow, unlike Palantir or perhaps like Palantir as it remains to be seen. If the employees value their company they most likely will simply let the shares just sit there. For example I exercise my RSU's but i've never actually sold out of anything and cashed in.\n\nNow, each company is obviously different. And this is a first time large windfall so to be fair it could be more impactful this time. As well, even if you don't want to sell your RSU's you might want to sell some to cover the tax burden.\n\nBut point is. If you believe your company is cooking with a hot stock and you KNOW internally there is more on the table coming. It may be telling if there is NOT a big hit on that day or thereafter.\n\nAlso, the timing of the call market. Palantir has proven to sell when the stock goes up a lot. Again, each company and culture is different. I can't really speak to ARMs.\n\nHowever, one last thing to consider. The lockup ends on the 12th. The call date is the 15th. Now, I don't know if you're imaging a boiler room situation but like I said, a person would have to call actively release the RSU's and then call their brokerage and do something.\n\nAgain, if you're not worried about it you may just sit there for weeks and not do anything. Years. You may do the transfer and just again not do anything. So the idea that by the 15th there is going to be a massive sell-off is just silly. it may not really be much.\n\nI'm thinking about selling puts here if this is the mindset that people have about an RSU lockup period confabulated with softbanks outstanding ownership.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Added a [reuter's](https://www.reuters.com/technology/arm-shares-soar-ai-fueled-boom-brightens-growth-prospects-2024-02-08/) quote:\n\n> The question now is what SoftBank, which is currently restricted from selling Arm shares as part of its agreement to take the company public, does in March, when it\u2019s permitted to begin selling Arm shares again.

The earnings came out and were stellar, they aren't losing as much money as they use to and are on an exponential growth path. Tomorrow they will be up BIG! However, I don't think this one is done. I am rolling my options (I have about this many in Robinhood and SOFI as well) out a couple months to give myself some more time. I think they keep running for the next couple of weeks for the following reasons:\n\n\\- Good earnings (duh).\n\n\\- Short interest is decent and will need to cover over the next couple days.\n\n\\- Low volume on this stock can cause it to swing super fast if we get some movement. I've been watching and the downswings are on lower volume than the upswings. I don't think there are a ton of people who want to sell shares.\n\n\\- $40 strike calls are already in the money and I think $45s will be tomorrow causing pressure up.\n\n\\- People are looking for the next NVDA, and this fits the bill (AI, works with all the big players AMZN, GOOG, etc, and machine learning)\n\n What do you think? How dumb am I?\n\nPosition right now, expiring Friday: 257 $40c, 167 $45c, 45 $50c", "id": "1ar1bsx", "created_utc": 1707953847.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|403|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16659152507781982}, {"body": "Im in at 50.
