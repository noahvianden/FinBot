Bonds value are inversely correlated to rates.\n\n\"Bond values are inversely correlated to rates\" is true, but not really for BIL. This is because BIL is 1-3 month bonds, extremely short duration. Think about it this way, if you have a coupon paying 10% a year for 100 years and now interest rates across the board fell and now everyone is accepting 2% a year for 100 years, what happens to the value of your 10% coupon?

Well if interest rates fell to 2%, then your 10% coupon would be slightly more valuable because it was only 10% for 1 month and then 2% for 11 months. Your 10% for 1 month then 2% for 11 month is obviously only slightly better than 2% for 1 year. This is called bond convexity, the longer the duration of the bond, the higher change in value compared to a change in interest rates.\n\nIf the Fed cut rates in <1% increments not 10% to 2% then the price change for 1 month bonds would be even less, basically negligible. But like I said, your yields would go down because again, BIL is only paying you the current interest rate for 1-3 months.

Investors can get out as quickly as they can get in, so there is no risk.\n\nWhat will happen when the Fed cuts rates is simple - the dividend paid out by BIL will drop accordingly by a similar amount.

{"title": "[DD] Arm is the Future of Edge AI with ~7000 Patents and Only More Coming - Risc-V is No Risk but Rather a Welcome Addition", "selftext": "For reference, Cathie Wood just said on CNBC that she hadn't taken a position (\"took a point of view\") on the stock and that Risc-V will be a disrupter on the space because it is Open Source Software.\n\nWhile still pusing 2000K TSLA and Robo-Taxis.\n\nTo her credit she did say she would take a look at it overnight and I for one welcome that analysis tomorrow. /s\n\nAs well, I think Tim Cook said it best when asked about the high price of the Apple Vision Pro. He mic-checked the hell out of anyone who was thinking stupidly about this with a purple eggplant swing - Check out my 5000 patents. And that's the game folks. You can't just come out and say you're making something and NOT worry about those patents.\n\nNevertheless, people keep mentioning Risc-V and open source. Ok. Welcome. I don't think there is anything wrong with competition. In fact, I think competition is very good for this space. AMD is Nvidia's competition and innovation and progress drives from this and it is good. It's the way it should be. Moreso, the revenues can actually help each other out because that would mean people are coming into the space that need paid for their innovation. Arm can raise prices and so can Risc-V.\n\nOpen Source Software does NOT mean FREE.\n\nOpen Source Software simply means that this PART is free but everything else like install, consultation, support, expertise, referrals, compute, cloud, data centers will ALL cost you.\n\nIt's how open source makes money.\n\nThankfully the foundations of some Open Source Software technology is well founded for the purpose of making core and important technologies available in a pure Open Source Software way.\n\n* The Linux Foundation\n* Linux Kernel Development\n* Apache Software Foundation\n* Mozilla Foundation\n* Free Software Foundation\n* OSI\n* Google Summer of Code GSoC\n* Chrome\n\nJust to name a few. These foundations are powered by money from the biggest names in tech and that often are never realized by regular non-tech industry people and more so they sure the hell aren't even thanked by anyone really for doing it.\n\nFrom individual contributors to\n\n* IBM\n* Microsoft\n* Google\n* ARM\n* Apple\n* Oracle\n* Many Others\n\nAll give real dollars to these projects to stay alive and afloat.\n\nHowever, other Open Source Software goes into the business without great institutional support. Examples of this are even publicly traded companies such as MongoDB.\n\nThey give you Open Source Software but they also provide a hand holding version via their cloud business.\n\nRedis is another great example of this but they are not publicly traded.\n\nOther Open Source Software such as Risc-V has other plans of profiting and that is completely OK. I just think the mistake is thinking someone is going to jump in with free software and that is going to kill someone else business.\n\nRemember when Microsoft damn near cried (joking) when Linux arrived? What happened? Well, now Ubuntu is probably the most dominant OS on the planet BECAUSE of all the cloud vendors providing it for cloud compute. You wouldn't realize Linux is the most dominant OS but it is.\n\nWith data centers, Android, and you could argue Unix(Apple) is all Linux kernel based.\n\nFor this reason Open Source Software is the dominant OS on the planet developed by 1 man. Crazy.\n\nAs you see Microsoft sure does well even though the other reality people may not realize is something different.\n\nWith all of that there is nothing that prevents ARM using Risc-V as their own architecture IF they actually wanted to. The same as there was nothing stopping Microsoft from using Chrome in their Edge browser. If it makes financial sense they'll do it.\n\nHardware is HARD. The upward hill climb for Open Source Software to be the exact thing your billion dollar business needs without ANY help/consulting or tooling is NET ZERO. Somewhere in that cycle there is going to be something you pay for. Again, Open Source Software does NOT MEAN FREE.\n\nARM has a ridiculously LOW royalty rate to boot. It's not like their getting a dollar a phone they're getting PENNIES for all that goodness.\n\nStill there is room for others such as Risc-V.\n\nLastly, ARMS army of patents is nothing to sleep on and at \\~7000 patents is the definition of a MOAT if you ask me and an R&D in the 100's of millions I don't think you're going to get Open Source Software penetrating that for years to come.\n\nTop that off with AI and well you see where this is going...\n\nCathie - If you're listening - here's your DD now do the right thing.", "id": "1aljrk5", "created_utc": 1707355962.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|769|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04059289023280144}, {"body": "Dude said Edge AND AI..?
