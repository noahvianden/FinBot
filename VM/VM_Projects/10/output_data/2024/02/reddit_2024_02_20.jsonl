{"title": "[OC] The case for Peloton (PTON) 3 points to consider:", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThere is no doubt that Peloton stock has had a roller coaster ride since 2020.\n\nWhen Peloton IPO'd in 2019, it was priced around $25-$30 a share.  When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.\n\nThis huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  \"sunk cost fallacy\" trap. Which states: \"It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.\"  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The \"sunk cost fallacy\" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.\n\n**Points to consider:**\n\nIt is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as \"turning the corner\", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.\n\n1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the \"treadmill for the rich\" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new \"video game\" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun).\n2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the \"household\" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is\n3. **\"Great product not a great stock\"** \\- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow \"separate\" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks \"great\"., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant \"moats\" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.\n\nI would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.\n\nThanks!", "id": "1avwr3x", "created_utc": 1708472519.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "You spoke a lot about the product and little about the business. \n\nWhat are you willing to pay for a company that lost ~$800M in the last 12 months, lost $2.8B in FY 2022, lost ~$200M in FY 2021, lost ~$70M in FY 2020, and lost ~$200M in FY 2019.\n\nA company that is engaging in massive shareholder dilution. 23 million shares in 2019 to 347 million in 2023\n\nA company with $787M in net debt and a negative ~$450M in free cash flow to firm.\n\nWhat do you think that business is worth?", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "You beat me by one minute...", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.020641621202230453}, {"body": "Not only that but they have no moat.
