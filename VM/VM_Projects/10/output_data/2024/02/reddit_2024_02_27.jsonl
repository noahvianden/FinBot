{"title": "Increase AAPL holdings", "selftext": "Hi together, I'm looking for some insights on whether I should increase my holdings in AAPL at the moment. I initially bought into AAPL during the COVID dip back in 2020, and my holdings have grown to approximately 4,600 EUR since then, constituting around 15% of my total stock and index fund portfolio.\n\nI am playing with the idea of increasing my AAPL holdings as I believe AAPL will remain relevant and continue to grow its revenue while having an excellent return on capital (ROIC). However, I'm hesitant about the timing. As a long-term investor, I shouldn't care about timing, I know. But I still want to buy it at a \"discount\".\n\nGiven that AAPL is currently trading below its 200-day moving average, do you think now is a good time to increase AAPL exposure, or would it be wiser to wait a bit longer?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and insights!  \n\n\n*(I know, no financial advice, etc.)*", "id": "1b19pr2", "created_utc": 1709033637.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Looking back over the last 17 years of owning AAPL, I\u2019ve never regretted buying on a dip.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Same", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1567978858947754}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "**tl;dr:** I would **not** buy more AAPL in your position. This sub is incredibly bullish and biased *towards* AAPL (as am I), but you *still* shouldn't buy AAPL. Read on if you want my reasoning.\n\nYou didn't give enough information for people to answer this question properly, but I'm going to run with what I have.\n\nIf you want to be an investor in *individual* stock, you have to take steps *before* you ever start investing. Do you have any debt (not counting a mortgage)? Pay that off (credit cards, student loans, etc.). Do you have 6 months of *expenses* set aside in case you lose your job? Start saving in a HYSA if not. Do you have a fully funded Roth IRA? If not, get one. Are you getting a match at work from your 403b/401k? Make sure you're taking advantage of that. Some of these steps can be done concurrently (like you should *both* contribute to your Roth and 401k *while* building your 6 month emergency fund).\n\nI could go on with the above, but if you don't have your basics covered *before* you start buying individual stock, you are just opening yourself up to unwelcome and unnecessary risk. You don't want to be forced to liquidate when the stock is down to buy a new car transmission for example. You don't want to have to take a \"hardship\" loan from your 401k and have to stop contributing (thus losing both your match and the time in the market).\n\nBut let's say **all of the above** is taken care of, and you are ready to really start putting money into the market. Write up a plan so you don't *have* to ask questions like yours. Write up a plan so you are not buying or selling emotionally. Write up a plan so you can be a dispassionate investor who *never* experiences FOMO or panic selling.\n\nI did this. This is a simplified version of my plan:\n\n1. Never have more than 15% of your portfolio in any **one** stock.  \n2. Never have more than 30% of your portfolio in any particular market sector (i.e. Pharma, tech, real estate, etc.).  \n3. Keep *half* your portfolio in index funds or a boggle heads \"three fund\" mix.  \n4. Rebalance by *selling* as seldom as possible.  \n5. Rebalancing through *buying* is better (when possible).  \n6. Automate, automate, automate.  \n7. Steadily increase what you are investing as your income increases.  \n8. Do your utmost best to ignore daily, weekly, or even *monthly* swings.\n\nThat's a simplified version of my rules. Your rules can be **entirely** different. Do what works for *you,* but **write it down.**\n\nFrom what you wrote, AAPL is *already* 15% of your portfolio. *I* wouldn't go higher. Still want more AAPL? Then increase the other areas first. Also, remember, many many many funds have AAPL in them, so you have probably already violated my first rule. My 403b has a decent exposure to AAPL. So does my Roth IRA funds *and* my supplemental 403b account. I also own individual shares of AAPL. I've blown past my rule one (AAPL went up too much!). So future contributions went into other stocks. I bought MSFT and it went up pretty damn fast as well, and my various funds also had MSFT exposure, so now I was/am in violation of rule 2.\n\nAgain, your rules may differ from mine.\n\nMost people would tell you not to invest in individual stocks *at all,* but I think investing should be *fun* (you will have some people argue with you on this one), but if something isn't fun, you'll be less likely to do it. If it feels like a chore, your will be reluctant to do it. This is why I suggest trying to automate your trades. DCAing into your stocks is the best way.\n\nI know I gave a US centric answer to this question, but I am assuming you have access to the EU versions of 401k and Roth and whatever (tax shielded retirements accounts).\n\nOther subs I like relating to investing:\n\nr/investing  \nr/bogleheads  \nr/options", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed reply! It's true, a lot more information is needed to answer my question thoroughly.\n\nI am 25 and live in Germany. I have no debts and lots of cash savings. I could easily live off my cash savings for a year if I had no income. Also, I'm self-employed, so there's no one to support an investment plan (unfortunately). But I do invest (via automatic savings plans) at least 15% of my average monthly income in 3 ETFs to build a market portfolio. And occasionally I buy shares of the ETFs when the market dips.\n\nBut true, my AAPL exposure is pretty high right now, but I expect my ETF exposure to lower my AAPL exposure again as I continue with my savings plans. I know I don't need to justify myself, but since you responded in such detail, I'd like to share my perspective.\n\nI also like your opinion on buying individual stocks versus ETFs. I was unsure for a long time about focusing only on ETFs, but then again, I've had good experiences with stocks. I have actually read a lot about rational investing and building a market portfolio is the best thing to do for a long term investment horizon. In the long run, I definitely want to have a large ETF portfolio and hold stocks just for the fun of it.\n\n*Edit: Savings specified as cash savings*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like you have a pretty good start. At 25 you're doing fine.\n\nI didn't start until I was 40. I made *a lot* of mistakes. *Some* of them even worked out to my favor. My first investment outside of my Roth IRA and my work retirement plan was to buy AAPL. I bought what I considered to be *a lot* at the time. 200 shares at ~$95 a share. I kept adding to it until I thought it was too expensive to buy more (ha ha), so started splashing around with other tech and meme stocks (MSFT, AMD, PLTR, Pharma and pot stocks, etc.). I finally decided I didn't understand some of the stuff I was invested in, so I sold *everything* except the MSFT and AAPL. I would have *lost* money on most of the meme stocks were I *still* holding them, but I got out with a profit. I would have done *somewhat* better had I kept the other tech stocks (I don't know *how* much better, but selling AMD was a mistake even if I put the proceeds into AAPL).\n\nThere's no point in investing in individual stocks if you don't hope to beat the market. If that's *not* your intention, then one should just invest in the market, but to me, picking \"winners\" is fun. Had I kept ALL of my early stock picks, I would have lost money on many of them (some of the pot and Pharma companies I was in have actually folded and been delisted), but this would have been balanced out by the big winners like AMD (I bought at $5 and sold at $12). I kick myself every time I see where that stock is today. This is why I started rebalancing through *buying* rather than *selling.*\n\nI'm overweight in tech, and I am overweight in AAPL.

{"title": "Are stocks facing a decade of stagnation? (Analysis from The Economist)", "selftext": "The Economist is [painting a pretty grim picture](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/25/stockmarkets-are-booming-but-the-good-times-are-unlikely-to-last) for the future of the stock market. Please discuss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Everywhere you look, stockmarkets are breaking records. American equities, as measured by the s&p 500 index, hit their first all-time high in more than two years in January, surged above 5,000 points in February and roared well above that level on February 22nd when Nvidia, a maker of hardware essential for artificial intelligence (ai), released spectacular results. The same day, Europe\u2019s stoxx 600 set its own record. Even before Nvidia\u2019s results had been announced, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 had surpassed its previous best, set in 1989. Little surprise, then, that a widely watched global stockmarket index recently hit an all-time high, too (see chart 1).  \nThis is quite a turnaround. Stocks slumped in 2022, when faced with fast-rising interest rates, and wobbled last March, during a banking panic. Now, though, both episodes look like brief interruptions in equities\u2019 long march higher. Despite middling economic growth and the covid-19 pandemic, stockmarkets have offered annual returns, after inflation, of more than 8% a year since 2010, including dividends (cash payments to shareholders, funded by company profits) and capital gains (when the price of a share increases). These returns have been better than those produced by bonds and housing. Indeed, they have been better than those produced by just about any other asset class.  \nIf the boom has a home, it is America. A hundred dollars invested in the s&p 500 on January 1st 2010 is now worth $600 (or $430 at 2010\u2019s prices). However you measure them, American returns have outclassed those elsewhere. Almost 60% of Americans now report owning stocks, the most since reliable data began to be collected in the late 1980s. Many of them, as well as many professional investors, have a question. Is the stockmarket surge sustainable or the prelude to a correction?  \nFor as long as stockmarkets have existed there have been those predicting an imminent crash. But today, in addition to the usual doomsaying, a chorus of academics and market researchers argues that it will be tough for American firms to deliver what is required over the long-term to reproduce the extraordinary stockmarket returns seen in recent years. Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve has written about the \u201cend of an era\u201d, and warned of \u201csignificantly lower profit growth and stock returns in the future\u201d. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has suggested that the \u201ctailwinds of the last 30 years are unlikely to provide much boost in the coming years\u201d. Jordan Brooks of aqr Capital Management, a quantitative hedge fund, has concluded that \u201ca repeat of the past decade\u2019s equity market performance would require a heroic set of assumptions.\u201d  \nThat is, in part, because valuations are already at eye-popping levels. The most closely followed measure of them was devised by Robert Shiller of Yale University. It compares prices with inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous decade\u2014a long enough period to smooth out the economic cycle. The resulting cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or cape, has never been higher than 44.2, a record reached in 1999, during the dotcom bubble. The previous peak was in 1929, when the cape hit 31.5. It now stands at 34.3 (see chart 2).  \nRarely have corporate profits been valued so highly. And the outlook for the profits themselves is also challenging. To understand why, consider the fundamental sources of their recent growth. We have employed Mr Smolyansky\u2019s methodology to examine national-accounts data for American corporations. Between 1962 and 1989 net profits increased in real terms by 2% a year. After that, profits accelerated. Between 1989 and 2019 they increased by more than 4% a year. We find similar trends across the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries. As a share of gdp, corporate profits were steady from the 1970s to the 1990s, then doubled (see chart 3).  \nMarket of mirrors  \nYet much of this strong performance is, in a sense, a mirage. Politicians have reduced the tax burden facing corporations: from 1989 to 2019 the effective corporation-tax rate on American firms dropped by three-fifths. Since companies were giving less money to the state, corporate profits rose, leaving them with more money to pass on to shareholders. Meanwhile, over the same period borrowing became cheaper. From 1989 to 2019 the average interest rate facing American corporations fell by two-thirds.  \nMirroring Mr Smolyansky, we find that in America the difference in profit growth during the 1962-1989 period and the 1989-2019 period is \u201centirely due to the decline in interest and corporate-tax rates\u201d. Extending this analysis to the rich world as a whole, we find similar trends. The surge in net profits is really an artefact of lower taxes and interest bills. Measures of underlying profits have grown less impressively.  \nNow companies face a serious problem. The decades-long slide in interest rates has reversed. Risk-free interest rates across the rich world are about twice as high as they were in 2019. There is no guarantee that they will fall back to these lows\u2014let alone decline fairly steadily, as they tended to in the decades before the pandemic.  \nAs for taxes, the political winds have changed. True, Donald Trump may see fit to cut America\u2019s corporation-tax rate if he wins in November. But our analysis of 142 countries finds that in 2022 and 2023 the median statutory corporate-tax rate rose for the first time in decades. For instance, in 2023 Britain increased its main rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Governments have also established a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15% on large multinational enterprises. Once it has bedded in, such companies will probably pay between 6.5% and 8.1% more tax, leaving a smaller pool of net profits.  \nWhat needs to happen, then, for American stocks to keep offering exceptional returns? One possibility is that investors pay for even more stretched valuations. In a world in which interest and tax bills remain constant for the next decade while real earnings grow at 6% a year\u2014an optimistic scenario\u2014America\u2019s cape would need to rise to 51 to reproduce the overall returns seen from 2013 to 2023. That would be higher than it has ever gone before.  \nNow make things grimmer and assume that valuations revert towards their means. The cape drifts towards 27, near the average since the end of the dotcom bubble. Assume, too, that interest and tax bills rise. Rather than clocking in at 25% of earnings, they drift up to 35%, or around the level in the first half of the 2010s. In this more realistic world, to generate even half the returns equity investors enjoyed since 2010, real earnings would have to grow at 9% per year. Only twice in the post-war period has America achieved this sort of growth, according to Mr Brooks, and in both cases the economy was rebounding from busts\u2014once from the dotcom bubble and once from the global financial crisis of 2007-09.  \nMany investors hope that ai will ride to the rescue. Surveys of chief executives suggest great enthusiasm for tools that rely on the technology. Some companies are already adopting them, and claim that they are producing transformative productivity gains. If deployed more widely, the tools may allow companies to cut costs and produce more value, juicing economic growth and corporate profits.  \nPlay the fool  \nNeedless to say, this is a heavy burden for a technology that is still nascent. Moreover, technological developments are far from the only trend that will affect business in the coming years. Firms face an uncertain geopolitical climate, with global trade flat or declining depending on the measure. In America both parties are sceptical of big business. The battle against inflation is also not yet won: interest rates may not fall as far or as fast as investors expect. In recent decades you would have been foolish to bet against stockmarkets, and timing a downturn is almost impossible. But the corporate world is about to face an almighty test. \n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1b1jw61", "created_utc": 1709060471.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.39, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "The standard answer: nobody knows.

{"title": "Streaming to Overtake Pay TV Subscription Revenue in the U.S. This Year: it will hit $17.3 billion, topping $16.7 billion from pay TV.", "selftext": "***Hollywood Reporter:*** \n\n*Streaming revenue will overtake pay TV subscription revenue in the U.S. for the first time later in 2024, helped by the addition of ad tiers by various streamers, according to a new forecast.*\r  \n\r  \n*Total revenues from streaming, including subscription and advertising revenue, will start topping revenue from pay TV subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, research company Ampere Analysis projects in a new study unveiled on Monday. \u201cStreaming will continue to race ahead as traditional pay TV declines \u2013 with the value of pay TV in 2028 expected to fall to half the value it saw at its peak in 2017,\u201d it predicts.*\n\n\r*Streaming subscribers overtook pay TV subs in the U.S. in 2016, but \u201cstreaming\u2019s lower average revenue per user (ARPU), which currently sits at around a tenth that of pay TV, means that revenue is only now catching up,\u201d Ampere explained.*  \n*U.S. pay TV revenue will still be narrowly ahead of streaming revenue in the second quarter at $17.1 billion to $17 billion, followed by a $17.3 billion to $16.7 billion streaming lead in the third quarter, according to the research firm\u2019s projections.*  \n*The ad tiers that streamers have added, from Netflix and Amazon Prime to Disney+ and the streaming services of other Hollywood giants, are one driving force of revenue. Streaming advertising revenue will pass the $9 billion mark in the U.S. this year, the Ampere study forecasts. \u201cThe introduction of cheaper ad tiers has been successful not only in increasing new subscriber growth in previously saturated markets, but also in acting as an additional revenue source for streaming services,\u201d the firm explained. Revenue will be further \u201cbolstered\u201d by Amazon Prime Video\u2019s new advertising tier launched this quarter, it highlighted.*\n\n*\u201cMost major streaming services in the U.S. have launched their hybrid advertising tiers, which, along with increasing clampdowns on password sharing, have been successful at reigniting growth in the streaming market,\u201d said Rory Gooderick, senior analyst at Ampere.*\r  \n\r  \n*Goodrick added, \u201cThere is still a way forward for pay TV, however. Disney and Charter\u2019s recent deal in the U.S., which gave almost 15 million Charter subscribers access to Disney+\u2019s advertising tier, shows how the two businesses can work together to maximize streaming\u2019s reach to domestic subscribers and highlights the importance of traditional distribution platforms as service aggregators. Longer-term contracts and the reduction in churn make this an attractive proposition for streamers, while control over the billing relationship also means there\u2019s something in it for the pay-TV provider.\u201d*\n\n\r\n\n***.....End of article.....***\n\n***Source***: *https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-overtake-pay-tv-subscription-revenue-us-q3-2024-ampere-analysis-1235835978/*", "id": "1b1kg1z", "created_utc": 1709061797.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Youtube is at $31.5 billion in revs.  Streaming by them overtook pay many years ago already.", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6972360014915466}, {"body": "Let the enshittification begin", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10261187702417374}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Why is this horrible for consumers?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not benderunit9000, but adding commercials to streaming services is incentivized now.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "More ads and cheaper prices will happen in the future.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "When Cable TV first started part of the appeal was that it had no commercials since you were already paying for the Cable channel.

{"title": "MSTR DD", "selftext": "Sup tards. I've been trading crypto since 2013 and crypto stocks since 2021. Bought my first btc at $600. Currently I am up over 100% on a variety of crypto companies (mstr, mara, riot, coin and a few others). Here's why I think MSTR is the move:\n1) it's basically a crypto etf as they hold 193k btc and continue to buy. They don't have management fees though.\n2) short interest: currently at 20% of float with 3.5 days to cover (fintel). 3.5ish days to cover. With Blackrock's etf doing 1.3B in volume today and the price action of btc after hours, I think it's safe to say this was mostly inflows. With the halving coming up and miners holding onto their coin to sell at top dollar, it's reasonable to assume this upwards momentum will continue.

{"title": "$CRON's - Weed is back.", "selftext": " Sup . I know Crohn's is known for making you uncontrollably shit, but I'm talking about $CRON, something that will make you shit long, fat and green logs.\n\n**Regard reading:**\n\n$CRON is severely undervalued. Your next Wendy's pay-cheque would suffice to make you enough gains to be clinically diagnosed with gardism so that you can just chill and gamble on the markets for the rest of your life.\n\n**High regard reading:**\n\nI'm boots on the ground in Canada, and have been at the forefront of self conducted product testing. For those that do not have cannabis federally regulated, I am sorry. This US Schedule (1) substance allowed me to tackle a lot of hard things in my life.\n\n**Financials:**\n\n**- (877M) in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.**\n\n**- Market capitalization of (860M)**\n\nThat is all you really need to know, it is a company worth its cash balance, so business included.\n\nPeople will always come in here and try to find a flaw in an argument, and they are usual the gay regards who's resume got rejected from manager Chad at Wendy's. This company is positioned to grow in Canada, with a new premium brand and an already established highly regarded retail brand. I'm too lazy to give you fucks in depth details, so you can look into the brands yourself.\n\n**Cannabis Industry:**\n\nThe entire industry has taken a fat shit since the initial massive pump, and has currently cratered to the point where valuations have proven mind boggling. Cronos is positioned to grow and expand further than Canada as more countries adopt cannabis federal regulation. Germany recently announced new adoptions of cannabis, and I am sure they are the first of many in the European area. They do have a business in Israel, but am leaving that out right now for obvious reasons, but they are seeing minimal drop-off in growth. The ticking green candle bomb is obviously US regulation however, and with Cronos' healthy balance sheet, they are poised to take action as soon as the regulations come through. I don't give a fuck if it will take years, this will pay off for those who are willing to squeeze your nuts and put a rag in your mouth.\n\n**Cronos:**\n\nThis company around five years ago tried to make biological advancements with biological modification company $DNA. They had a facility in Winnipeg and people were hyped about the potential revolutionary discoveries and products to come. It failed, the company abandoned its US business and biological R&D facility in Winnipeg as the sale was announced. The company has since shifted its focus to the retail segment, with growth coming from Canada this year, and more to come with Germany in 2024. Also, it is important to note that Cronos' premium brand is just starting to release its products at our local stores in Canada, therefor I see a increase in revenue coming as more of these premium products are adopted.\n\nWithout even thinking about US regulation, this is a business that have streamlined its processes and tightened its margins to the eventual point of positive FCF.\n\nI am expecting a big year from Cronos, and the entire cannabis industry. Side note, yes, I am literally driving Elon's new Tesla Rover on mars right now. But I do not think that makes me any less wrong.\n\nBe safe out there guys \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n780ejh4y1lc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb9aa5a0aa668606094cafd20a6d9bac5825a6fa", "id": "1b12h8f", "created_utc": 1709006745.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 7 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.025244638323783875}, {"body": "That's a lot of words to say you like investing in farming.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "No farms no brownies.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.346602201461792}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.217788428068161}, {"body": "How much money does it lose every quarter?", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14474830031394958}, {"body": "I also got crons!!!!

While it's unnerving to see a banking giant like Blackrock forge a partnership with SOFI, it's encouraging that they have an offramp for selling off loans that they restructure instead of having to wait the term of the loan to realize the profits.\n\nThe loan restructurings have continued to increase dramatically, most notably they reported $919.3 million in student loan originations which was $268M more than expected for Q4 last year and at the same time, their total deposits in conventional accounts grew 23% Q/Q to $15.7B.\n\nI feel like with the election coming up, and the likelihood of student loan forgiveness disappearing, we might see continued restructuring and loan consolidations, which SOFI will continue to just sell off to Blackrock.
