{"title": "Machine Learning and Daily Realized Volatility in SPY", "selftext": "For the past year and change I've been trying to use various machine learning techniques to predict stock prices, volatility, etc. For my most recent project, I decided to try to predict daily volatility for SPY for use in same-day options trading. Given the difficulty in predicting daily ups/downs (i.e. calls and puts) i decided to try to predict maximum movement, regardless of direction, which would be well suited for an straddle/strangle strategy.\n\nUsing Yahoo finance, I pulled SPY price data from 2009 onwards and calculated numerous metrics (e.g. absolute price changes, moving averages of these changes, daily volatility, etc.). I then used 5 years of data in the training set (e.g. 2009 to 2013) and the following year (e.g. 2014) as the test set. The aim was predict the next day's realized volatility.\n\nTo narrow down the number of predicts, I used a LASSO method for variable selection. Following this, I used a simple linear regression to predict the next day's volatility. I then categorized the data as \"Up\" if a swing of 0.7%+ was predicted (the median of my dataset from 2009 to present, calculated by using the % change from that day's opening and the day's high and low values), and \"Down\" for changes under this.\n\nWhen looking at the results overall, we see that this method is 74% accurate in categorizing days as \"Up\" and \"Down\" - significantly more accurate than the guess rate (52%). When looking at how accurate the model is at identifying \"Up\" (the signal for 0DTE straddles) days we see the model is \\~78% accurate (i.e. when the model indicates \"up\" it is correct 78% of the time). I've attached the confusion matrix below with these/additional details.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aab83x2uhxud1.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdebf1b3bed8d2cf2508bc8682368c82224006b4\n\nThere is quite a bit of variation from year to year as to the number of trades, and ability to predict \"Ups\" as can be seen in the table below.\n\n|Year|\"Up\" Predicted (#)|Accuracy|\"Up\" Guess Rate|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2014|33|69.7%|39.7%|\n|2015|80|75.0%|45.6%|\n|2016|66|71.2%|36.9%|\n|2017|8|25.0%|12.7%|\n|2018|99|85.9%|52.6%|\n|2019|58|60.3%|36.5%|\n|2020|213|75.1%|68.0%|\n|2021|93|77.4%|46.0%|\n|2022|213|90.1%|89.2%|\n|2023|105|73.3%|50.4%|\n|2024 (to date)|41|68.3%|39.9%|\n\nSo again, there is significant variation from year-to-year, but the model tends to perform better than guess almost every year when predicting \"Ups\" though the model itself is not statistically significant every year in years where there is very high volatility despite being significant over the whole period.\n\nI look forward to people's thoughts, criticisms, etc. on the usefulness of this.

Have you tried testing how the performance changes if you use more years for training? It might also be worth considering excluding the data from 2017, as it doesn\u2019t seem to align well with the other patterns and could potentially skew the model.\n\n\n\nHere, I have asked ChatGPT regarding this topic, maybe it can give some inspiration: \n\n\u201eIn the context of time series prediction, especially in the stock market, the split of 4 years for training and 10 years for testing doesn\u2019t follow standard practices. Typically, the training set is larger than the test set to ensure the model learns patterns over a significant historical period before being tested on unseen data. In most cases, a common split might be 70-80% of the data for training and 20-30% for testing.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n\t1.\tTime Series Dependency: Stock market data is highly dependent on past events. A small training window, such as 4 years, may not capture enough market cycles, trends, or external influences, which are essential for making accurate predictions over a long horizon.\n\t2.\tTesting on a Larger Period: Using 10 years for testing and only 4 years for training means you are asking the model to predict for a longer time horizon based on relatively limited knowledge. This often results in poor generalization, as the model may not have been exposed to enough historical variability.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\n\t\u2022\tTraining on a Larger Set: A more balanced approach could be using 70-80% of the data for training (around 10 years, in your case) and the remaining 20-30% (2-3 years) for testing. This allows the model to learn from a broader set of data, including different market conditions, while still testing on unseen data to evaluate performance.\n\t\u2022\tRolling Window Cross-Validation: Another approach for time series is rolling-window cross-validation, where the model is trained on an initial period (e.g., 4 years), then tested on the next year, and this window is shifted forward through time. This helps to evaluate model performance across different periods and market conditions.\n\nBy increasing the training data and considering a more standard split, your model could have better predictive power and generalization.\u201c", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry perhaps it wasn't clear in my description, but it's a rolling window.

Here is the WHNSC's response.\n\nBloomberg: [US Weighs Capping Exports of AI Chips From Nvidia and AMD to Some Countries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/us-weighs-capping-exports-of-ai-chips-from-nvidia-and-amd-to-some-countries?leadSource=uverify%20wall&embedded-checkout=true)\n\n>A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent\u00a0[joint statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/23/united-states-and-united-arab-emirates-cooperation-on-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20and%20the%20UAE%20look%20forward%20to%20deepening%20collaboration,%2C%20secure%2C%20and%20trustworthy%20AI.)\u00a0by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the \u201ctremendous potential of AI for good,\u201d as well as the \u201cchallenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.\u201d\n\nThe council responds with a no comment while directing them to a positive statement. To me, this greatly diminishes whomever the Bloomberg contact is.\n\nThis is the second time that Bloomberg goes out of their way citing a leaky government source that on it's own merits isn't really that sensational at all. The headline is sensational the reality is not.\n\n>The approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of **anonymity**. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said.\n\nThis isn't even news. Reuters reported on this a month ago with a much more neutral to positive tone. Which it is.\n\n[Reuters: US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sets-new-rule-that-could-spur-ai-chips-middle-east-2024-09-30/)\n\n>WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia\u00a0to data centers in the Middle East.Since October 2023, U.S. exporters have been required to obtain licenses before shipping advanced chips to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.Under the new rule, data centers will be able to apply for Validated End User status that will allow them to receive chips under a general authorization, rather than requiring their U.S. suppliers to obtain individual licenses to ship to them.\n\nIf you're tracking, this simply seems to be the 2nd half of that original conversation. There are already chip restrictions. Nvidia is already not delivering the most advanced chips to those countries. The framework proposed would allow Nvidia to deliver chips under certain restrictions and guidelines.\n\nBloomberg acknowledges this towards the tail end of the article.\n\n>While officials have debated the best approach, they\u2019ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why does Bloomberg like to make things salacious when they're seemingly not. There is 0 chips to parts of the Middle-East today, but the U.S. government is working on a framework that may relieve that. Reuter story from a month ago. The end.\n\nWhen you read the headline one would believe that they are already selling these chips to the UAE and they're not.", "id": "1g4ff6b", "created_utc": 1729018716.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 4567 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12696538865566254}, {"body": "The OI on 138 and 140 calls expiring this Friday is tremendous.
