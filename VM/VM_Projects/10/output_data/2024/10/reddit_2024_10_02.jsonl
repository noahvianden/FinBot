Sales in the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 25, were slightly short of the average analyst estimate, while its Americas division posted a revenue decline in the period.\u00a0\n\nThe shares fell 8.1% at 4:47 p.m. in extended New York trading. The stock has gained 27% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, outpacing the advance of the S&P Total Market Index over the same period.\u00a0\n\nLevi is making a push to generate more sales through its own channels. While the company is making progress on that front, its wholesale business is deteriorating, with a decline of 6% in the latest quarter from a year earlier. The company wants to use its own stores, website and app for sales as shoppers increasingly move away from the department stores that have traditionally been crucial for big apparel brands.\u00a0\n\nChief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said the company\u2019s namesake brand is gaining ground, and touted \u201canother great quarter of strength\u201d for the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer segment. That division, which includes Levi\u2019s own website and stores, posted 10% growth.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe revenue miss is causing some knee-jerk pressure in the in the stock, but the core Levi\u2019s brand performed well,\u201d Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli wrote in a research note. He added that margins, which outperformed expectations, \u201cwere a bright spot.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe company is also reviewing options for its Dockers brand, \u201cwhich could include a potential sale or other strategic transaction,\u201d and has hired Bank of America as a financial adviser in the process.

{"title": "Gold is Overvalued, Right? Wrong. (DD)", "selftext": "# Why GLD Could Cross $252 by November 8th\n\nGold has been on a serious run lately, and there are a few key reasons why GLD (SPDR Gold Shares) could keep climbing and hit $252 by November 8th.\n\n1. **Election Uncertainty**: The U.S. election is coming up on November 5th, and elections always create uncertainty in the market. People don\u2019t know how the results will affect the economy, so they often look for safer assets. Gold has been that go-to \"safe haven\" for years during times like this, and with the level of political division we're seeing, it\u2019s likely that more investors will flock to gold.\n2. **Declining Reliance on the USD**: Countries are starting to move away from relying heavily on the U.S. dollar. China, Russia, and others are looking at alternatives, which could weaken the dollar\u2019s power. When the dollar weakens, gold tends to rise in value. A weaker dollar makes gold more attractive to investors globally, and this could push GLD higher as people look for stability outside of the dollar.\n3. **Gold\u2019s Recent All-Time Highs**: Gold has been hitting all-time highs recently, driven by inflation concerns, central bank moves, and global instability. It\u2019s clear that investors are leaning into gold, expecting it to hold value better than other assets. If this trend continues, GLD could easily break through the $252 mark.\n4. **Trust in Gold as a Store of Value**: Fiat currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, are losing trust due to things like money printing and inflation. Gold, on the other hand, has been a reliable store of value for centuries. As trust in the dollar fades, more people will likely turn to gold, pushing GLD up even further.\n\n  \ntl;dr: With the U.S. election bringing uncertainty, global reliance on the U.S. dollar declining, gold hitting all-time highs, and trust in fiat currencies like the USD eroding, GLD (SPDR Gold Shares) could easily cross $252 by November 8th. Gold remains a reliable store of value, and these factors make it an attractive investment during turbulent times.", "id": "1fuiwyx", "created_utc": 1727882844.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 3 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 10 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07109358161687851}, {"body": "This is gold Jerry", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17803268134593964}, {"body": "The long term trend is likely up.
