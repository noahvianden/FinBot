If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.\n\n**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**\n\nGoogle\u2019s self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.\n\n**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.\n\n**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that\u2019s over 26 million rides annually.\n\n**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.\n\n**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!\n\n**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**\n\nGoogle's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.\n\n**Overall AI Expertise**\n\nWhile Google\u2019s search business is under threat, it\u2019s important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.\n\n**Android**\n\nAndroid is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff.

However, just because ChatGPT has taken the world by storm doesn't mean it's commercially viable atm.

Yeah, sure, ChatGPT is making headlines, but headlines don't mean anything if you are unable to grow and steal clients away.

YouTube, Google dot com, Gmail, Mapps, etc, Waymo. Gemini will be integrated in all of these and people will eventually default to them. What service can Microsoft and ChatGPT push consumers into ChatGPT? Microsoft is already running into some challenges because the cost of Copilot is enormous. ChatGPT recently reported taking tons of losses in the billions because ChatGPT just isn't profitable. \n\nI'm not saying that can't change, but Google already has the momentum and a huge benefit in having products that people don't ditch, making the prospect of Gemini becoming more integral in people's lives way more likely. The risks and controversies with Google have certainly caught up with them, but they are making strides in fixing these issues.
