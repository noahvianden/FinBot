It took awhile for it to impact the broader economy. Part of that was financial instruments tied to housing which left losses on the books of a lot of major financial institutions, and caused panic selling when liquidity dried up. A lot predicted the housing bubble would collapse. Not as many predicted the financial crisis which followed. Once we were in the financial crisis, there was lots of talk of recession, and that if the government didn't act quickly it could even cause depression.

There is one important indicator, the yield curve near to inversion, which has some worried. And the stock market itself can be an indicator. But all other traditional leading indicators seem to look good. There's a minor debt bubble perhaps in corporate debt, but nothing as serious as 2007. \n\nBut there are bigger worries in the global economy. China has more of a debt problem than the U.S. right now, and is slowing in response to trade tensions. Several other emerging economies are struggling with adjustments due to the strong dollar. Argentina for example is in recession. \n\nMy take is, falling equities prices alone, if they fall far enough, could eventually trigger some degree of slowdown in the US. But it will be mild. I don't think there's anything that will cause the financial conditions that exacerbated things in 2007-2008.
