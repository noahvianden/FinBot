{"title": "[Discussion] Legalities of Tesla/SpaceX/Boring interplay", "selftext": "Something I haven't seen much of a deep dive on are the legalities of interplay between Musk's big three companies.\n\nMy premise is that Musk's bonus plan with Tesla will have him do anything to achieve the $640B valuation so he gets max payout.\n\nLet's assume for a minute that some of the big goals won't happen. Car sales get diluted by competition, same for solar/energy, FSD and therefore fleet don't happen, et. al.\n\nDoes Musk have free reign to work across companies to boost Tesla revenue?\n\nSome examples, with extreme values for illustration:\n\n1. SpaceX leases Starlink constellation to Tesla for $1/year. Tesla takes all revenue.\n2. Boring purchases Tesla Model X passenger pods (or dirt haulers) for $200K+$50K FSD/vehicle\n3. SpaceX develops some super-material to be used for ~~BFR~~ Mars spacecraft hull. Tesla licenses the patent for $1/year to use for car frames.\n\nLet's not belabor whether these things make sense (although a separate thread on this would be cool).\n\nWhat I'd like to discuss is what legal hurdles Musk might face if he does something like this.\n\nFor example, if he announces today that all three things are happening, I would think it would be manipulation because it should have been disclosed before.\n\nBut if he does these things over, say, five years, with some early \"thinking about doing\" announcements, then maybe it's fine.\n\nIs there a clear legal precedent for this, or is it one of those things you can do, but just not \"abusively\"?", "id": "a3z5dv", "created_utc": 1544183142.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "+1 for a good question, but no idea.\n\nGonna be kind of difficult to fence the smuggling of IP between Hawthorne and Fremont in Elons brain.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, that's what started my thinking.

I would wager a vast majority of shareholders across all of his companies are fine with IP going between companies because so far it's only been a benefit to all.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, if an RFP goes out and another company can do it better, Tesla absolutely should do that since they still have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.\n\nI would say if he could only pick one company to run the rest of his life, he'd absolutely pick SpaceX, so I don't think there's any worries about him doing anything harmful to them.

Musk owes these to Boring company.  Musk owes these to Spacex. Doesn't matter if it's public or private they applyto all, but can be waived in very limited ways.  More simply, there are obligations for interested party transactions.\n\nThis was the core of the allegations on SolarCity, that it was an interested party transaction and breached the duty of loyalty and didn't give stockholders sufficient value.  So if Musk tried to merge Boring company into Tesla (something quite plausible), that would be an interested party transaction and subject to scrutiny.  There is a long and nuanced way to sanitize this but generally, Musk would recuse himself from the approval, a disinterested board committee would approve, and perhaps a disinterested majority of stockholders would be needed to sanitize the deal.  This is why Musk recused himself in the go private talks and a committee was formed.\n\nIn the commercial contact context a similar analysis applies.  If the transaction is not approved by a disinterested majority of the board, or a disinterested majority of the stockholders then if the transaction isn't entirely fair to the company there could be a stockholder derivative suit seeking damages.  So a spacex stockholder could sue Elon and/or Spacex for such a sweetheart deal to Tesla if proper sanitation was not done.  Having a 'bidding process' per another comment or having a disinterested party negotiate terms are good evidentiary facts showing they were on arms length fair terms but are not quite the right test.\n\nI haven't read the exact terms of the deal but there may be dilution considerations such that Musk can't buy Google and Uber with Tesla stock and say 'hey look I built a $1T company, give me my full bonus in stock'.  That would have been smart to protect Tesla.\n\nAs an executive as a public company he has certain disclosure obligations.  He at least claims his costly tweets we're an attempt to be transparent with shareholders stemming from his disclosure obligations.  If Elon had undisclosed plans of funneling Boring revenue to Tesla to game his bonus that could be a '10b-5' violation, or stock fraud.  But somewhat oddly it wouldn't be Tesla harmed, it would really be Boring company harmed.\n\nLastly, there is a concept of corporate opportunities under the penumbra of fiduciary duties.  This says you have to bring business opportunities to a company you owe duties to and can't usurp that opportunity to go exploit it yourself.   So, the default rule is that Musk would be presumed to have to bring business opportunities to his existing enterprise and not exploit them for himself.
