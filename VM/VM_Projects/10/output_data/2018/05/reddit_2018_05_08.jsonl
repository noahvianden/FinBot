But on the plus side, the applications stay continously updated and errors are fixed quickly. There is also usually \"free\" technical support if you're on a subscription service.\n\nThere's basically only pro's to making apps a subscription service. That is the future, to milk consumers for as much income as they can get.\n\nSo IMO, the answer to your question is.. Yes, the profits will continue by creating additional support services paid for by subscription. One-time applications are dead for all but indy teams.
