If they can scale up their production and don\u2019t have any massive \u201ccars randomly kill its occupants by driving into oncoming traffic\u201d type recalls.  But if not here are my predictions.\n\nFirst building things is hard.  Building cars even more so.  Building cars at a rate that exceeds 30 per hour is very difficult.  Doing it with \u201cworld class\u201d quality and dependability, something we don\u2019t even know if Tesla has or not since they haven\u2019t built enough vehicles over enough years (think Camry or F150) is extremely hard and the big makers have hundreds of engineers who do nothing but try to ensure quality and dependability.  To that end I think a non automaker, even a very wealthy one like Apple, is going to struggle with a takeover scenario.  Apple doesn\u2019t even build *anything*, they farm it all out.  Taking over production mid cycle is *extremely* hard so a \u201cthis plant was going to shut down before we bought them out\u201d scenario is a nightmare.\n\nIf it\u2019s another automaker I think it\u2019ll be domestic and I think it would be either Ford or Chrysler.\n\nFord \u2013 probably has the best chance of \u2018succeeding\u2019 with Tesla, and by succeeding I mean taking whatever useful IP Tesla owns, copying it into Ford (and Lincoln) vehicles, then probably bastardizing Tesla and Lincoln down the road.  I think Ford would come out more or less OK and able to better compete with the other big global players \n\nChrysler \u2013 would probably try the same move as I think Ford would but I have less faith in Chrysler to execute as well as Ford.  I think Chrysler would get dinged hard and end up dropping further in the world as they rack up debt from this move\n\nNon automaker.  I have less faith this type of \u201cmarriage\u201d would work well mainly because the big names I can think of don\u2019t build anything right now.  They would end up needing to either hire a new team of executives to run Tesla, or trust with the new company\u2019s guidance that the current execs (minus Elon) could do better under new leadership.\n\nApple or Alphabet \u2013 they practically print money at this point.  They know how to design things people want.  What they lack is manufacturing expertise.  They would need to go on a hiring spree, or just keep on the current Tesla upper management.  They do have a huge leg up on the automakers I mentioned in terms of free cash so if done well an Apple/Tesla or Google/Tesla might just do better than Ford/Tesla, but it would be tough.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "AAPL has far more manufacturing expertise than you give them credit for.

If anything, they would cherry-pick the right people out of that dumpster fire, and leave the so-called TSLA IP to burn with the rest of the garbage. A core group of strategic acquisitions in personnel makes more sense for AAPL than buying any of the existing TSLA baggage.
