People already have Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Amazon Prime all at once. I think I remember reading Disney plans on their streaming service to be aimed at children mostly and Hulu will be their more mature audience. Netflix right now covers all audiences and I think that might complicate things having the user base split into two different services when Netflix has a kids section and user accounts that you can set to be just for kids, while keeping the more adult stuff. \n\n\nI think Disney has a couple things going for it that Netflix doesn\u2019t.  I think what you said about your colleague being able to put on a Disney movie while he falls asleep is an area they can capitalize on. Non parents put Netflix on for entertainment, while loads of parents use it almost like a babysitter during the day. One is almost a need while the other is a luxury. I see parents willing to shell out more than any other streaming service charges currently to get all the Disney IP in one place for their kids to watch. And the Disney IP is probably the most valuable expansive IP to have. I can also see them having a marketplace of some kind integrated into the service to make it easy to buy a Finding Nemo blanket or whatever else is related to what the kids are watching and that\u2019s something no other service has the ability to really capitalize on. Adults also don\u2019t binge the same movie on Netflix over and over; Kids will watch Frozen 60 times in a row. I think that gives Disney something the others don\u2019t have. I just don\u2019t know how they capitalize on that exactly. \n\n\nSorry this is kind of a long response, I\u2019m just really interested to see what happens and how it will change the streaming ecosystem.
