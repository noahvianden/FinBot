{"title": "Covered Calls Income - October Recap", "selftext": "The title is a lie. This month was not about covered calls. I couldn't resist the degeneracy that comes with buying calls. I'm just making this post because it may benefit someone reading it or at least provide some entertainment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Covered Calls Income](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95675f/covered_calls_income/)\n\n[Covered Calls Income - August Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9ci1dy/covered_calls_income_august_recap/)\n\n[Covered Calls Income - September Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9jzbvl/covered_calls_income_september_recap/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are [my trades](https://imgur.com/gallery/FIj8m8z). I'll go through them and explain the thought process.\n\n1. IQ Calls **\\[NET GAIN: $113.75\\]** : I collected my premiums on this trade, and the 2 calls I sold expired worthless. I'm still bagholding 200 shares of this hot pile-of-garbage. My original cost basis (not factoring in premiums I collected by selling calls) is $31.05/share. It's not a loss until you sell, right?\n2. BABA Call **\\[NET GAIN: $86.40\\]** : I collected my premium on this trade, and the call I sold expired worthless. Before Red October happened, I remember looking at the premium I could've collected ($400) and thinking, *let me wait a day or two and I can collect more than $400.* I wanted to make my monthly goal on that one trade. That didn't work out too well lol.\n3. BABA Calls **\\[NET LOSS: $719.50\\]** : This is a $160.00 strike 11/16 expiry call. I had 2 calls. BABA was droppin' like it was hot, and I thought $160 would be the bottom. I was going to lose on this position NO MATTER WHAT, so I opened a parallel trade with a higher delta, rather than averaging down on this position.\n4. BABA Calls **\\[NET GAIN: $2,250.60\\]** : This is a $150.00 strike 12/21 expiry call. I had 11 calls. I kept averaging down on this position, and once BABA popped, I sold this position and the previous position at the same time.\n5. BABA Calls **\\[NET GAIN: $3,490.25\\]** : This is a $140.00 strike 12/21 expiry call. I had 20 calls. I kept averaging down on this position, and BABA popped again, I sold this position. If I had held this position one more day, I would've made $16,000 on this trade alone, and $18,000 for this month.\n\nI took u/stormwillpass's advice and opened a TastyTrade account. I called Schwab, and they offered me 15 free trades which I'm still working though. I'm also still learning to use TastyWorks, and I feel a little more comfortable with it now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAAPL and BABA Calls are the future.", "id": "9uff47", "created_utc": 1541438227.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks you Kanye, very Insightful.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Yo I\u2019m sitting here with trump, got anything to tell him?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Please inform god emperor trump that trade war is indeed good and easy to win.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "He said the trade war was just a prank bro.
