{"title": "How to get into algorithmic trading?", "selftext": "The idea of creating an automatic trading system is very appealing to me. Spending time creating a system and then backtesting it and putting into place, and then just letting it sit and make money while working on other systems seems better for my risk tolerance. Most of my losses these past few weeks have been either sitting on a position for too long , hoping for those extra profits (I should have set a specific exit I know) or exiting them too early and losing profit there. This shoots down my confidence and makes me dream of just having a system to make those hard decisions for me and continuously make money in the background.\n\nThe emotional side of trading is the hardest part to conquer for me at this point at the early stages of my trading career. Algo trading seems like both the best use of my time, development, and research going forward. Obviously I have years of information to learn before I can finally create a complex algorithmic system that I can be fully content with, however I'm just looking for a place to get started.\n\nIn my next 3 semesters of school, I'm taking a basic python class, a \"Program Design and Abstraction\" class, and a \"Database Management Systems\" class to obtain just a \"Fundamentals of Programming\" certificate on top of my Finance and Econ majors. However, I'm not sure the best way to both supplement these classes and make as much progress as I can to eventually create an automatic trading system.\n\nGoing through the booklist, works such as  *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* by Marcos Lopez de Prado ,  *Algorithmic Trading* by Ernie Chan , and the books under the \"advanced options\" titles catch my eye. However, with little programming and algorithmic trading experience I fear that these may be far over my head. Will these titles be too difficult to understand at my early stages?\n\nSo to conclude, are there any algorithmic, automatic system-based traders here that could give any tips on my best starting point? Any books or resources that you would highly recommend / a certain pathway I can take? Is my only hope to really break into this field is to go institutional for a few years to gain that experience within a quant-trading firm such as SIG? I just started getting into options trading in general last June, so I'm just looking for a starting point regarding getting into the algo-trading world.

{"title": "My Stock Adventure #3", "selftext": "Original: [MSA #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xv0gi/my_stock_adventure_1/)\n\nContinuation from: [MSA #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xzu9k/my_stock_adventure_2/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2018.10.31\n\nReceived a dividend from PEGI, this one was for $8.44. Given that this stock has lost money from my initial trade, the dividend was a soothing relief. Not nearly enough to cover the total loss, but enough to assuage any jitters. With 2018.11.16's positions, this dividend brings my total unrealized loss to \\~$7 for PEGI. Unless the \"Total Gain/Loss\" in Fidelity tracks dividends as well when calculating that bit, although I'm under the impression that it only accounts for market movement.\n\n# 2018.11.1\n\nReceived a dividend from CNSL for $3.87. Not as much as PEGI, but that's to be expected considering the amount of shares I've bought compared to PEGI as well as their respective dividend percentages. I didn't spend the dividend from PEGI, so this gave me about \\~$12 in my core account to mess around with.\n\n# 2018.11.9\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|UEPS|Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc|50|$4.73|$241.45|\n\nI've seen a lot of references to \"catching a falling knife\" in an analogous way to describe stocks that aren't experiencing a \"dip\" so much as a serious correction or even bankruptcy/free fall. When I looked at this stock, I felt as though this corporation might be an example of that. As I did a bit of research, I came to the conclusion that their business would likely come up again rather than stay at low levels. So I bought in.\n\nIn Q3, there were no reports. In Q4, they beat estimates by $0.01, for $0.28/share. It's a foreign company, based in South Africa. South Africa is currently going through a ton of societal, governmental, and existential issues, so this is a company that I didn't want to get involved with long term. I intend to sell this stock between 11.19 and 11.21, but we'll see how it does. The company provides internet access and job boards to people, so this seems like a business that could thrive better than most in the area.\n\nTheir stock has a 52-week high of $13.20. In September, they took a massive hit, dropping from \\~$9.50 to \\~$6.50.  It happened again shortly before I bought the shares, dropping from \\~$7.00 in early November to \\~4.50.\n\n# 2018.11.14\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ENPH|Enphase Energy, Inc|23|$5.43|$129.84|\n\nEnphase Energy is a company that I think will eventually provide a decent market cap, then a dividend.\n\n* Q1 of 2018 was unprofitable, but they beat estimates by $0.02 for -$0.01/share.\n* Q2 had a similar experience; beat estimates by $0.01 for $0.02/share.\n* Q3 is incremental, met estimates for $0.04/share.\n\nThey're borrowing money, but that's to be expected for expansion. Seem to have new partnerships and contracts consistently. Long term, this will be a great buy I think and will add to it a few more times.\n\n# 2018.11.15\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CWEN|Clearway Energy, Inc|20|$16.82|$341.27|\n|HMMR|Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corporation|300|$0.34|$107.85|\n\nClearway Energy is one that I've had on my watch list for several weeks, and noticed that it's gone down by a drastic amount for it's history. I did a bit of research, and the only thing I could come up with was that their projects in California were subject to some of the wildfires and investors decided to sell before losses were tallied. They have some natural gas plants which I'm against, but their other sites outweigh that portion.\n\nI perceived it as a dip, and bought it. In the morning, I'll sell UEPS if it's profitable and buy more CWEN.\n\nHammer Fiber Optics is one that I was iffy on. It's a penny stock, which typically aren't what I'm looking for. But their business is intriguing. Fiber optics is a much more powerful tool for communication throughput than copper or other mediums. They're seemingly at the tail end of their stock price, diving from highs of $40 in 2017 to under $0.35 today. This is nothing short of a bet, although intuition is saying it'll pay off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2018.11.16\n\nSadly both CWEN went up in price and UEPS went down from profitable, so I didn't purchase more of CWEN. Almost wish I did yesterday, but markets were already closed.\n\nOn the bright side, today is the first day I've felt as though I've \"beaten\" the market with this experiment. Managed to come up about $50 for \\~1.6% gain in my portfolio while DJIA is +0.49%, NASDAQ is -0.15%, and S&P 500 is +0.22%. That's after a few losses, mind you.\n\nI've got a heavy concentration in renewable energy which I like, but isn't good for diversification. It's one of the reasons my stocks have been less profitable than market average, renewables haven't done spectacularly since I've bought them. That's short term stuff though, so it's not an issue to me. In order to counter this, future purchases will likely reside somewhere in the mining sector for lithium and related metals. It'll provide a synergistic approach to my portfolio. My concern is finding a mining company that isn't completely and utterly terrible for the environment, which mining is by its nature.\n\nI'm also looking at Sony ($SNE) as a buy, but would have to sell other shares to do so. May buy 4-5 shares with the UEPS sale.\n\nOther buys I'm looking at:\n\n* $GE @ \\~$5: If they manage their debt well after their asset sales and come strong with renewable innovation, in my opinion GE could rise well over what their market cap was at their height. But that's a big if. Waiting for their quarterly reports after these asset sales show up to decide if I buy in.\n* $FB @ $110: I don't agree with Facebook's privacy or their other creepy shit (lookin' at you, nude selfie database), but there's little denying that they're going to be around for awhile. Maybe not as a social media company, but definitely as a company. Betting heavily on AI, virtual reality, and quantum computing.\n* $TSLA @ $250: I mean, you could say \"no shit\", but personally my opinion is that TSLA is too overvalued for the economy. When an economic crash comes, that's when I'm going to buy into Tesla, and I'm going to buy in hard. Watching their battery developments closely.\n* $NVDA @ $100: This is just a byproduct of a vicious cycle. Personally think investors will keep being spooked and it'll devastate the share price to \\~$80 by January. Prediction: it'll snap back to $170 by Fall of 2019 and hover there until new innovations come out. Not ballsy (or knowledgeable) enough for options at this point in my stock adventure, but will be interesting to watch and see if I'm right.\n* $PBI @ under $9: Pitney Bowes, Inc is a company on my watch list that I think is going to spike. Great dividend, and don't have a wildly fluctuating earnings report for each quarter. Will eventually buy this with some funds assuming they're still under $9 when said funds are available.\n\nHere are screenshots of my positions and purchases: [https://imgur.com/a/FiyL17Y](https://imgur.com/a/FiyL17Y)", "id": "9yakuz", "created_utc": 1542580566.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "GE is a lost cause.

Forget the absurdity or unlikelihood of the situation, that's not what I'm asking.\n\nIn that event, which US S&P sectors will be most negatively affected?  Least negatively affected?  Benefited?\n\nIf I were to venture a guess, I'll posit the following:\n\nMost negative: Financial, Technology (esp. consumer facing technology so I think AAPL will be more affected than IBM), Energy\n\nLeast negative: Telecom (AT&T and Verizon don't operate in China as far as I know), Utilities\n\nConsumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary will be affected but not as much.

They might suffer somewhat from lack of China demand but that might be made up for by US demand.  e.g. Chinese firms not buy/lease CAT tractors to build stuff in China, but you could have US municipalities buy/lease them to repair roads.\n\nThoughts?
