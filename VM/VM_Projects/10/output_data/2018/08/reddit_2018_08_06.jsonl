Factors that could trigger a notice include major market-moving news, supply-demand imbalances in S&P 500 options or turbulent trading overnight.\n\nThe announcement is part of Cboe\u2019s campaign to soothe worries that the monthly VIX settlement has been manipulated by traders -- an allegation made by [a University of Texas professor](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/is-the-vix-being-gamed-a-sudden-swoon-has-traders-talking-again) and [some analysts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/vix-rigging-talk-erupts-on-wall-street-after-another-wild-swing). Cboe has dismissed those concerns, which were fueled by several instances where the settlement price widely diverged from prevailing prices just before the monthly auction. Cboe has already introduced [other enhancements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/cboe-reveals-more-ways-to-fix-the-vix-after-first-tweaks-helped) to the settlement process, and auctions since then have gone smoothly, quieting complaints.\n\nTraders will receive a notice before the market opens on the day the monthly options and futures on the VIX Index expire. Cboe won\u2019t issue a notice if it doesn\u2019t see any unusual activity, the exchange said.", "id": "9540h9", "created_utc": 1533581439.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I've never participated in the auction stuff but the blatant manipulation I saw when trading it (mostly 2012-2013) was when groups would buy large numbers of teeny options the day before the VIX settle and open the SPX options Wednesday morning (when VIX settles) in a fashion that would make those teeny option buys worth tons of money.

{"title": "Forget Apple, Goldman Says, Flagging New $1 Trillion for S&P 500", "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500)\n\nInvestors fixated on one 13-digit milestone last week, Apple Inc.\u2019s value. But another trillion-dollar threshold is in sight and is more relevant to the bull market in U.S. equities, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nIt\u2019s the volume of stock buybacks that corporate America is likely to announce this year. The total for S&P 500 firms will jump 46 percent from 2017 to an annual record, according to an increased estimate from the Goldman unit that executes share repurchases for clients.\n\nThe new forecast highlights accelerating demand from companies, a sign that any weakness in stocks is likely to be met with unbridled corporate buying. While August has been one of scariest months of the year for equities in the past decade, it\u2019s also the busiest in terms of buybacks, accounting for 13 percent of the annual total.\n\nNow, with more than 80 percent of S&P 500 members done with quarterly financial reporting, most companies can boost discretionary buybacks, concluding a blackout period that typically restricts share repurchases.\n\n\u201cInvestors should focus on a different $1 trillion number that will have a key influence on the market: total buyback authorizations,\u201d strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the company but the use of the cash that matters.\u201d\n\nWith a year-end forecast of 2,850 for the S&P 500, a level that\u2019s less than 10 points above Friday\u2019s close, Kostin is far from being the biggest bull among [Wall Street strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PB38C4SYF01T) tracked by Bloomberg. Yet he said that the growing alarm around equities, particularly tech stocks, is unwarranted.\n\nAt the end of last month, Morgan Stanley\u2019s [Mike Wilson](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says) predicted that declines in stocks such as Facebook was a precursor to a correction that would be more painful that the February rout. At the same time, strategists at Bank of America and Credit Suisse sent separate [warnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/credit-suisse-joins-bofa-in-warning-of-tech-stock-crowding-risk) about the crowding risk in tech stocks, particularly the FAANG bloc of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.\n\n\u201cOur analysis leads to a different conclusion,\u201d Kostin wrote. \u201cTech is less of a \u2018crowded trade\u201d than many investors believe,\u201d he said, adding the firm\u2019s weekly data on hedge fund clients showed 26 percent net exposure to tech stocks. That compared with 25 percent for the broad industry positioning at the end of the first quarter, which declined from levels in 2016 and 2017.\n\nMoreover, there is still untapped buying power left from tech companies themselves. While the sector has announced 40 percent more repurchases this year, their actual buybacks are up at only half the pace.\n\n\u201cBy extension, significant potential demand remains for tech shares as firms look to complete their existing programs,\u201d the strategists wrote.", "id": "952huo", "created_utc": 1533571138.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Directions unclear.

Assume the value per share is composed of 100 (company value) plus 25 cash that it plans to distribute. Also assume 10 EPS.\n\nThe company can pay a dividend and the stock will decline accordingly, so now for each share you have a share worth 100 + 25 cash.  The company is now worth 100 million dollars but shareholders have 25 million extra cash. P/E goes from 12.5 to 10.\n\nAlternatively, the company can buy back 20% of shares outstanding (200,000) at the 125 price for 25 million.  There are now 800,000 shares still trading at the 125 price.  People who wanted to cash out and sell the stock got 25mn cash while the remaining shares are still worth 100mm (just as they were in the dividend example).  Shares are still worth 125 each. EPS goes from 10 to 12.5 since there are fewer shares outstanding. P/E goes from 12.5 to 10, same as dividend example.\n\nThe act of buying back stock doesn't inherently increase the market value of a company over the long run, but it will shift return from dividends to price return (capital gains) so will have higher share prices with less shares.  They are just a more shareholder friendly (tax efficient) form of capital distribution since the people who have to pay taxes are those who wanted to sell their shares anyway.  If you look at a chart of the dividend yield over time, it has been decreasing, this is partially explained by buybacks. http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield/'\n\nAlthough the number of shares decrease post buyback and EPS increases, you can't keep a constant p/e immediately before and after buyback - the reason is that the company is more leveraged so should have a lower P/E.  Another way of putting this is the company is valued as it's intrinsic value (future cash flows) + distributable cash.  The intrinsic value doesn't change just because the number of shares do.\n\nBuybacks can also be seen as a way of increasing leverage (decreasing equity), and are bad only if companies underinvest in future growth prospects with good ROEs, or become too leveraged and are unable to meet short term funding needs in a stress scenario.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "thank you! very helpful ", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.012259166687726974}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5091273784637451}, {"body": "I like buybacks in the short run, but I really question long term health and natural cycles of the market with them.
