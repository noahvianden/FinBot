Amazon is currently focused on growth which causes it to have lower earnings and thus distorts the P/E ratio. Amazon has the ability to switch from growth to earnings. Moreover, Amazon has significant intangible assets which are not reflected in book value. The overall result is that P/E and P/B are poor methods of evaluating Amazon as an investment. \n\nIn the world of technology, P/B significantly loses its value as an indicator as you\u2019re dealing with intangible assets. Amazon will never have a P/B to be considered a value company, even if it\u2019s P/E were 5.
