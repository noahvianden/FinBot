As a rule, your probability of success is proportional to your risk/reward ratio, so the fact that yours is ~1:2 suggests this is more of a gamble than you're hoping.\n\nTake a look at the profitability of these different spreads:\n\n[220/230](http://opcalc.com/iDBD)\n\n[215/225](http://opcalc.com/htrP)\n\n[215/220](http://opcalc.com/iDBw)\n\nYour 220/230 spread requires a significant movement in the stock price to be profitable as it nears expiration. In the 215/225 spread, we've shifted the spread down to put one leg ITM, and as a result our profit chart becomes much more forgiving of a weak movement. By tightening the spread to 215/220 we can further improve our chances by taking in more credit from our short leg, further reducing the movement needed to earn a profit. We can improve our odds significantly by switching to a put (since you're bullish) [credit spread](http://opcalc.com/iDBw), which allows us to profit even if the stock moves against our expectations.\n\nThe common advice for those interested in high probability trades is to sell spreads 30-45 days out with a 70-75% probability of profit (which your broker should specify). Of course, these probabilities and strategies are based around the chance of profit on the expiration date, disregarding the intervening time, so high confidence in your fundamental or technical analysis of a stock can make debit spreads like your proposed one a perfectly good option.\n\nIn this case, I would advise against your proposed play because AAPL is currently overbought and is likely due for a pullback soon.

{"title": "Strategy Insight", "selftext": "Hey Guys, thank you for the wealth of information first off. This sub has been great for answering questions and steering me in the right direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter blowing up my Robinhood account with $1100. I moved on to Tastyworks and blew up another $400. Took me $1500 to start learning my lesson and reading Natenberg. I opened a Thinkorswim account with TD Ameritrade and have turned my $400 account into $1100 within the last two weeks by selling credit spreads or buying debit spreads. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo far, i've been leaning towards high IV stocks before their earnings and making a directional assumption based on their 3 month charts after earnings along with my due diligence with articles/news on the stock. I tend to sell $5 wide put credit spreads with 20-30 deltas (about 1 Standard Deviation) on the short leg with 30-40 DTE and try to make sure that the credit I receive is at least equal to the product of the width of the spread and the short legs delta. It has worked pretty well thus far. I've been closing my positions rather early since the underlying I've chosen thus far have made decent directional moves after earnings and I have GTC orders that take in profits at 50%. Is this a viable strategy going forward? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my debit spreads, I typically only trade debit spreads on SPY/SPX as directional movement is less volatile (as of late at least). I use the same $5 wide strategy with 30-45 DTE and make sure my debit is proportional to the width of the spread times the delta/probability ITM. These have worked fairly well on SPY/SPX but I may try the same with some airlines/tech since the spreads are less affected by implied volatility spikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, i'm only really trying to make up my losses from blowing up $1500. I'm a little hesitant to  buy long calls and puts even with high deltas. Currently, my only bad trade has been a 24 put on AMD at $2.42. It's worth about $2.19 right now because of the underlying rallying at market close. Do you guys have any tips/advice/criticisms? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide Note: How can I create an automatic order that exits the trade if my AMD Put option drops to a price of $1.72.

Maybe a bit worse, maybe a bit better.  Wait for benchmarks as far as that is concerned.  If you enable the ray-tracing, the performance dips hard on all preliminary benchmarks that are out.  Again, wait for release benchmarks on that as well. \n\nSo if you want to make use of the ray-tracing features that you are paying a premium for, then you will get much worse performance than current gen.  If you aren't using the Ray Tracing, then you might see a 50% boost in performance for an 70% price increase.   If you are budget conscious, there is no way you are paying for the 2080ti as is.  The pre-order sellout not withstanding.\n\nHowever this is still good news for Nvidia because the 1080 and 1080ti sales still turn a profit and they should increase sales volume once people see that \"wow the 1080it is really cheap now\" even though they haven't lowered the price at all.  So people who swore they would never buy a card for more than $200 are now looking at buying a $700 card because it's a better value than a $1200 card.\n\nThere's no way Nvidia loses money on that marketing strategy.  They've been doing it for a while now.\n\nGTX 580 release price was $500 in 2010\n\n680 was also $500\n\nThe 780 raised the price to $650 (and people complained, but still bought it)\n\nThe 980 dropped back down to $550, but the 980ti came out at the $650 price point\n\nThe 1080 released at $700\n\nand now we have the 2080 releasing at $800\n\nNvidia has been doing price creep for 8 years now and every time they set a new bar, people pony up for the privilege.  There's no reason for them to lose money while doing this.  Even if less people overall buy the 2080, if they are willing to pay the MSRP of the 1080 they are going to make out like bandits.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Actual DD here ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you listen to this dude your a bigger dumbass than he is\n\nFirst they are sold out because benchmark aren\u2019t out yet.
