{"title": "Building your exit plan for trades", "selftext": " /u/Cheshirefuckingcat asked a good question about how to build an exit plan in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/7ysycj/noob_option_trader_needing_advice/dull25f/).  Here are my thoughts (*knowingly simplified*) :\n\nFor me, building an exit plan is based on two things:\n\n* My trade plan / expectancy ratio \n* My original reason(s) for the trade \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLet me explain with an example:\n\n\n\n**Sentiment / Idea** - Combine with good technicals, I believe that TSLA is going to solve their car production problems and have a breakout first quarter in 2018 bringing the price of TSLA to $380 per share no later than May 30th.\n\n\n\n**Trade** - I decide to buy a long Jun call at 350 for a cost of $22.00 per contract = $2,200 in trade. \n\n\n\n**Expectancy** - Due to the *magic of my thinking and experience* my ratio for these types of trades turns out like this:   Over 100 trades, 30 losses for -$300 (max loss), 20 break evens, 50 wins for +$500 (max win).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOK, so what triggers might I use to exit this trade?  \n\n\n1) hitting my max win of +$500  \n\n\n2) hitting my max loss of -$300  \n\n\n3) its past May 30th and the stock is still below $380  \n\n\n4) some major shift in my sentiment causesd by a change in technicals, fundamentals, Q1 report, etc.\n\n\n5) I have hit some threshold for losses in my overall account for the month; e.g. I'm down 10% over my entire portfolio I should exit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nDoes that make sense?
