They were more passionate about Amazon than they were about any other company including Apple, which is known for its indomitable market share and its ravenous fanboys.\n\nReporter Nick Statt analyzed the numbers, inferring that trust in Amazon likely comes from the fact that the company has spent billions of dollars on improving its services and expanding without end. \u201cUnlike Apple, which has the largest cash hoard of any company on the planet,\u201d he wrote, \u201cAmazon maintains the appearance of prioritizing the value and efficiency of its services, like its Prime membership, over financial gain. Following its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods, Amazon\u2019s very first business strategy was to drop the price of avocados, organic eggs, meat, and other popular grocery items.\u201d\n\n\"Sorted by major party affiliation, the findings become even odder, because Democrats and Republicans diverge sharply on almost every point *except* Amazon (and the military, and their loathing of Facebook). The five most trusted institutions for *Democrats* are **Amazon**, colleges and universities, the **military**, Google, and the FBI (bottom: religion, Facebook, political parties, Congress, and the executive branch). The five most trusted institutions for *Republicans* are the **military**, local police, **Amazon**, the executive branch, and religion (bottom: Congress, organized labor, political parties, Facebook, and the press).\"\n\nIt is interesting the only two top trusted institutions for both democrats and republicans are Amazon and the military. This fully confirms my theory HQ2 will be in Northern Virginia, smack right next to the Pentagon, the corporate HQs of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, with Jeff Bezos slowly assimilating the military industrial complex like some borg queen in order to create the most popular institutional platform the world has ever seen complete with an arsenal of stealth bombers and nuclear ICBMs and tens of thousands of engineers who build weapons for a living, the absolute madman.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "9shfpr", "created_utc": 1540848323.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "I buy this.
