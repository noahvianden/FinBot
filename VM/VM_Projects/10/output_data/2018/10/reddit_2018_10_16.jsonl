{"title": "Credit Bullish Iron Butterfly", "selftext": "So I've been playing around with some strategy payouts for a couple trade ideas, and one of them came across to me as rather interesting -- though I couldn't seem to find any similar ones, so I am wondering what is wrong with this idea I had. It goes as follows:\n\nSuppose I expected some increase in a stock -- say NFLX, which is currently at \\~$333. There are some juicy premiums, so I decide to do a short iron butterfly: Short Straddle 350, Long 345C & 355P.\n\nUsing the data here: [https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NFLX/StrategyPayout/](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NFLX/StrategyPayout/)\n\nI'd have a debit of $5.28, max profit at $3.73, max loss of $0.28.\n\nNow, my first question is, is this a bad strategy to use for earnings if I anticipate an increase, but not a huge one?\n\nMy second question is, suppose instead of the Long 345C & 355P, I long 355C & 345P? Instead, I'd have a credit and would not have to put up much capital, and by the same data above I'd have a similar max loss/gain. Is there something wrong with this idea playing into earnings, apart from the low chances of assignment by writing so many contracts? It seems like the reward to risk ratio is immensely favourable. Clearly I'm missing something somewhere, but it's been bugging me that I don't see the problem with this.\n\nWould appreciate any opinions!\n\nEDIT: typo\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/591j7vjldgs11.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4c5250e4f4fe7be4d3fbb759b7bb4494b31b237\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, does anyone have any good, free websites (prefer not to download) for playing around with option strategy payouts that don't only show the expiry profit-loss graphs?", "id": "9oj4gp", "created_utc": 1539654298.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "I use this all the time.

They are *options.* An option (I'll stick to American-style here) gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares at a certain strike price by a certain expiry date. A call option means you expect shares to rise, at which point you can *call* them away from the stockholder for the strike price, which I'm betting will be less than the ~~strike price~~ (edit: share price). The difference is my profit. As the stock rises in price, the option does too, and vice-versa. \n\nWith a call spread, usually you're buying one option and selling another. Since it's a debit call spread, I'm overall being debited (paying up front). That's why it's also called a \"bull spread,\" as I expect the share price to go up either way. I'm selling the $305, because I expect that it won't go above $305, at least within the time I'll sell it. I really only picked $305 because it gave me enough money up front to reduce my *basis* (overall price I paid) enough, and was enough *out-of-the-money* to take less of my gains. For example, I might have paid $1,100 for the $255 and sold the $305 for $400. Overall, I only pay $700. \n\nI don't have to exercise the options, I can sell them as they rise in value and profit that way, without needing the $ to buy 1 contract, which is $100 shares ($25,500) on my *long* call (the one I'm buying).\n\nHTH", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">can call them away from the stockholder for **the strike price**, which I'm betting will be less than the **strike price**.\n\nTypo?\n\nDo I understand correctly that if the price goes over 305 then the share you got will also be automatically sold?\n\nAlso how many shares would your total $700 allow you to call?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, yes typo.
