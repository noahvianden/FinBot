This is an MU trade I initiated yesterday and closed literally at 9:32AM this morning.\n\n* JUN 22 Strangle(s): 65 call, 55 put. Credit = 0.79/spread\n* Expected move from MMM ToS platform = +/-3.488\n* Price was 59.75 at time of trade (2:30PM EST)\n* Delta on 65 call = .15\n* Delta on 55 put = .16\n* Total theta on the position when I opened it was 37.5 \n\nBasically your everyday ER strangle, 1SD out. I noticed that IV was lower on MU than most other ERs, and I tend to like that when placing earnings trades. Given that IV will significantly drop down right after the ER, it seems to help my odds.\n\nAlso, a lower IV than previous ERs (IV rank wasn't even 50%) seems to indicate there is a bit less uncertainty and fear, (which could be good) and might result in a less than expected move. I've started to notice a pattern with that from last earnings season to now.\n\nAnyhow, from glancing at MU's prior ERs, it definitely had the potential to move nearly 10%. I was glad the 1SD strangle was nearly 10% from the current price.\n\nMU reported earnings, and it was practically inline with expectations. It does make me wonder if the lower than normal ER IV had something to do with that. Regardless, I bought back each strangle spread this morning for .15/spread, for 81% profit.
