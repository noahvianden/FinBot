And many new traders only on the buy side, it might be inflating prices slightly for sellers of spreads and naked/covered positions.\n\nBut on the other side you have inexperienced traders setting up margin accounts (Robinhood Gold etc.) where a large market correction could set a lot of margin calls and/or lead to higher downside.\n\nBasically some portion of the market is made up of inexperienced traders making potentially risky and or poor trades, and this portion of investment is increasing because of new apps promising free trades and free stocks to new investors.
