I looked at them about two months ago before ultimately backing out. Part of the reason for not going through with it was that it\u2019s already part of most of my index funds (that are often heavy on tech anyways) so I already have exposure. I am pretty heavy on equities right now and also a bit limited on cash at the moment which didn\u2019t exactly help matters either.\n\nMy biggest concern with Alphabet, most notably Google, is just how dependent it is on advertising for its success. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft have quite a few different streams of revenue that, while they may tend to focus on a particular sector or industry, allow them some sense of diversity. Alphabet has tried to diversify itself but has had a mixed bag of success.\n\nThe google search engine and email platform are widely used and incredibly popular but what else does Alphabet have right now that comes anywhere close to rivaling this and offers some additional diversity? Things like Waymo, Google Fiber, and DeepMind all make exciting headlines and seem to start catching fire then suddenly quiet down and almost appear to disappear overnight. They have tried mergers as well with limited success. YouTube was/is a big hit but again, it relies heavily on advertising dollars.\n\nOutside of advertising, Alphabet deals a lot with data collection. They have flirted with automation/robotics and while I\u2019m optimistic about this branch, it has also moved frustratingly slow at times. To make matters worse, Alphabet seems to operate with little sense of urgency in a sector that moves extremely fast and is filled with the next batch of young competitors looking to overthrow the giants of the sector.\n\nThere are also some concerns about user privacy and data collection, especially in places like Europe. This one is kind of mixed. We saw the outrage with Facebook earlier this year but we also saw how fast that outrage died down. Sentiment in Europe is a bit different and a few European governments appear to be taking a more harder stance with these concerns than the US. Will anything or much happen in the end? That\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess but the potential new regulations/laws along with any bad press could harm Alphabet.\n\nWith all that said, I still think Alphabet has a lot of potential and could make a great part of any portfolio. You may have to be a bit patient and learn to live with some frustrating delays or random dips but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going away anytime soon and will continue to play a major role in our society and our future.

The plan included:     \n\n  \\-- Increasing the Company's quarterly dividend to 39 cents per share       beginning with the third quarter 2018 dividend declaration, subject to       approval by the Company's board of directors;     -- Repurchasing up to $3.4 billion of common shares during the CCAR approval       period of Q3'18 to Q2'19. This new authorization enables the Company to       repurchase up to $1.6 billion of common shares in calendar year 2018, and       up to an additional $1.9 billion in the first half of 2019. \n\nThe plan supports the Company's objectives to restore capital to target        levels while supporting asset growth and distributing capital to        shareholders. As previously announced, the Company plans to resume share        repurchases in the second half of the year.     \n\nThe timing and amount of common shares purchased under the Company's        authorized capital plans will depend on various factors, including the        Company's business plans, financial performance and market conditions.        Repurchase of common shares will be pursuant to the share repurchase        program previously authorized by the Company's board of directors on September        26, 2017.     \n\nAs required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer        Protection Act, the Company has also published on June 21, 2018        a summary of the results of the Company-run stress tests performed under        the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. These disclosures do        not reflect the capital plan described above, but reflect certain        assumptions and capital actions as required under the Federal Reserve's        rules.     \n\nThe results are available on the Company's Investor Relations site at        ir.americanexpress.com.     \n\nAbout American Express \n\nAmerican Express is a global services company, providing customers        with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and        build business success.
