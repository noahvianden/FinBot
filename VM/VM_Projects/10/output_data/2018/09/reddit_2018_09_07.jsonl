{"title": "Why I'm buying INTC calls/stock - actual DD", "selftext": "Try something different for once you degenerates. This isn't a contrarian play, it's just simple valuation. \n\nDD: \n\n-Intel's guidance was recently raised after a big beat.  They now expect 69.5 billion in sales and a non GAAP ePS of 4.15 (10.7% and 19.9% growth). That doesn't sound like a flat lining company to me \n-Yes, the stock got beat down after announcing a 2019 target date for release of 10nm Chip and AMD has been on a tear since then.  What the acting chief executives said on the call was that they aren't too worried about the server market share since they still have a 99% strangehold on the space and that their 14nm chips are competitive. \n-Significant investment in alternative spaces like Internet of things is paying huge dividends.  Revenue for this alone was 5.5 billion on last call.  \n-Cash flow is a whopping 15 billion and under the current stock repurchase program they are poised to buy back almost 7 billion of stock in cash. \n-The AMD threat isn't new. It's 5 decades old and every single time AMD surges then gets destroyed.  Look it up if curious. Happens every ten years.  \n-PEG factoring in current guidance is a paltry 1.2 which is ridiculous for a growth stock even if threats like Ryzen and smaller chips are factored in.  \n- Stock has broken 50day MA and is testing 200day. Last time this happened was fall of 2017 and the stock then proceeded to rocket up 70%.  \n-When the CEO resigned there was much talk of internal replacement but one by one the execs either turned it down or weren't vetted. Which is awesome. I think the board has the cash on hand to woo someone outside the company very desirable and that this announcement will happen a month before next earnings. The right person will maybe light a fire under the share price ... \n\nTL:DR Intel has a terrific amount of bad press because of AMD's recent coverage but some of us have seen this movie before and it always ends the same way.

The range is 60-120. They could all be horribly wrong but i would be suprised. I don\u2019t know if you followed the interview with David Zinsner but he sounded optimistic about Micron\u2019s future and elaborated on the 10B in buybacks during the current fiscal year. Not saying this will improve the stock price drastically but it is a good signal. I never buy options but i am confident Micron will see 50s again sometime in the next year and just opened 2 4/19 46C\u2019s. Buying slow to average down if needed. I am long Micron holding roughly 750 shares until it is evident DRAM prices are trending down. Looking to get out at 55. I may sell half of the shares before earnings and buyback after if things look good. \n\nThey said the recent drop was partially due to NAND prices coming down/china but Zinsner stated that ASP\u2019s are seeing growth and that is where Micron has better margins anyways. He also said he is confident data centers and cloud will continue to see growth.\n\nSomeone else said the call volume is heavy in the coming month so i would not be surprised if the price hangs low for awhile until the noise has passed.
