{"title": "The expansion of Azure into Retail, Financials, and Defense", "selftext": " \n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nMicrosoft Azure is continuing to gain market share and leads only second to Amazon\u2019s AWS.  The competition is proving to be advantageous for Azure specifically in retail. Microsoft continues to expand Azure to three distinct sectors Retail, Financials, and Defense (FDR). \n\nRetail\n\nOn June 21,2017 the Wall Street Journal published an article reporting Wal-Mart was suggesting to their vendors, developers, and partners to consider moving off AWS for Azure \\[1\\].  This news came on the announcement of Amazon planning on acquiring Whole Foods Market.  Nearly a year later on July 17, 2018 Walmart announces they are establishing a strategic partnership with Microsoft \\[2\\].  The five-year agreement includes Azure and 365 for enterprise-wide use while working alongside Microsoft to move existing applications to the cloud, samsclub is also being moved over to Azure as well \\[2\\].  Microsoft also secured a deal with retailer Costco not to long after Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods.  Lowes also partnered up with Microsoft while its competitor Home Depot went with Google.\n\nFinancials\n\nRetailers aren't the only companies partying in the clouds.  Saxo Bank partnered with Microsoft to move their banking platform to the cloud back in April 24, 2018 \\[3\\].  This partnership came nearly four months after Bank of America chose Microsoft as its personal cloud service \\[4\\].  Other financial institutions that subscribe to Microsoft and utilize its cloud include but aren\u2019t limited to TD bank, UBS, and the State Bank of India \\[5\\]**.** The banking software company Temenos also partnered up with Microsoft to move existing apps and development into the cloud. Robinhood actually uses AWS in case you faggots were curious.\n\nDefense \n\nWith the deadline date for proposals to be submitted for the JEDI contract approaching despite the deadline extension to October it is important to note some of Microsoft's recent accomplishment in the terms of defense awards and contracts.  Near the closing weeks of 2016 Microsoft was awarded a contract valued over $900 million by the Department of Defense.  The contract was to bring Windows 10 to all four million of its employees and to provide tech support \\[6\\].  Microsoft did not back out of its contract with ICE for facial recognition technology because of internal disagreement \\[7\\] unlike its cohort Google which will not renew a contract with the pentagon due to internal employee discourse \\[8\\].  Back in May of this year Microsoft and Dell were awarded an agreement by the U.S. Intelligence Community which expands on the intelligence communities use of Microsoft products and services from Windows 10 to Cloud \\[9\\]\n\n**Notable Sector Insurance**\n\n**Insurance companies that partnered up with Microsoft to transition to the cloud that I\u2019m too lazy to write about and source include Geico, MetLife, Liberty Mutual, Lockton Affinity, and Progressive.**\n\n**Source:**\n\n1.
