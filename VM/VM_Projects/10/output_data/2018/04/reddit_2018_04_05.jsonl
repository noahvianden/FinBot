Note that the year-over-year results, as well as the results for the last 6 months, come out to 0.2, on average. I'm just going with that. There are also articles floating around that discuss low wage growth, so the most reasonable prediction here is a miss -- which is actually considered a good thing, from the market's perspective.\n\n**WHAT TO EXPECT**\n\nPredicted: Green\n\nResults: Green\n\n**ANY REVISIONS?**\n\n[Remember when I warned you guys about Trump?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/trump-orders-consideration-of-100-billion-in-new-china-tariffs) Futures are red already, $SPY is already down $3 and some change, people are going to want to take profits tomorrow, anyway, and I **strongly doubt** that we're going to end the day anything less than **FUCKING RED.**\n\n**ANYTHING ELSE?**\n\nTo reiterate the way I do shit: I buy puts when the market goes up, and calls when it goes down. This strategy is fine if you stay the fuck away from weeklies, and don't mind being in the red for 1+ week(s). And don't bet against $TSLA.\n\n[**4/5/18 positions**](https://imgur.com/vxLiTg6)\n\n[**4/4/18 positions**](https://imgur.com/lnSjBFS)\n\n**ILLUMINATI:** My hobbies are varied and super interesting, and I feel that I can really add something to your organization.
