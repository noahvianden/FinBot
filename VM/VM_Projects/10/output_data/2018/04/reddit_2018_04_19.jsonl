{"title": "Optimal Beta-Weighted Portfolio Delta?", "selftext": "Hi All! Been a wild 2018....so far so good. I can confidently say that i couldn't have navigated Feb-March without all the knowledge I've gained from the sub over the last few years. I'm currently up 5% YTD and at the worst of the correction, only saw a max drawdown of 1% in a single day. \n\nQuick question around beta-weighted portfolio deltas. I'm currently trading a low 6-figure account and my short term outlook is positive. I generally try and keep 60-70% in cash at all times but i've adjusted this risk for the next 60 days to be 30-40% cash which i'm comfortable with at these levels.\n\nI've been assigned on a few stocks which isn't a big deal. However, my portfolio delta seems inordinately large (Portfolio Delta = +160). I've historically skewed only ever being short/long 30-60 portfolio delta depending on my outlook at the time. \n\nis 160+ delta way too large for this size account? Are the stock positions skewing my delta (TGT, WMT, XOM, MU, SPXL, & T) and theoretically this translates into being long 160 shares of SPY, right? If i wanted to eliminate some delta exposure, would shorting SPY stock be the most efficient use of capital? \n\nI've generally managed delta with long put spreads on SPX but this causes a lot of drag on my theta. I'm interested in getting some perspective on this. \n\nI haven't had goodluck with calendars in the past and i'd like to stay away from Iron Condors, given my outlook.

They basically trade only in monthlys, and own the front and second month contract in proportion to how much time is remaining in the month.  At the very beginning they own all front month (with 30 days to expiration), and then each day sell off a chunk of the front month and roll it into the second, so that by they time the front month is about to expire, they own mostly just the second month contract.  So on average what you really own is VIX about 30 days out.  Mostly that will move in the same direction as the spot at least, but it will usually move less.  Also, if the second month contract is priced higher than the front month, you\u2019ll lose a small % every day just from selling the cheaper contract to buy the more expensive one.  Of course, you benefit from the reverse of this if the front month contract is more expensive than the second month.  \n\nIn the long run, TVIX goes to zero because of this.

It doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of price movement to change IV by a couple of points, so if you had a big derivative position on VIX, it might be worthwhile to bid up a bunch of SP500 options to bump VIX in your direction temporarily.
