{"title": "With 70 Million Subscribers and a Risky IPO Strategy, Is Spotify Too Big to Fail?", "selftext": " Spotify IPO Making Waves\nFEATURECREDIT: CHARLES WILLIAMS FOR VARIETY\nWith 70 Million Subscribers and a Risky IPO Strategy, Is Spotify Too Big to Fail?\nBy Jem Aswad and Janko Roettgers\nManhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood has served as the home of Spotify\u2019s U.S. headquarters since 2010, but not for much longer.\n\nLater this year, the streaming music company plans to move most of its 1,200 New York-based employees into 14 floors at 4 World Trade Center in the rejuvenated Financial District. As part of the deal for the 15-year lease, New York is granting an $11 million rent reduction in exchange for keeping more than 800 jobs in the state and adding 1,000 more employees.\n\nBut Spotify will make its presence felt in Lower Manhattan in 2018 in more ways than one. Sometime in the coming months at the New York Stock Exchange, just blocks away from its new home, the company will embark on what\u2019s known as a direct listing, an unconventional initial public offering method that has never before been attempted on such a large scale.\n\nSpotify and Wall Street aren\u2019t the only ones that will be anxiously watching; count the music industry in as well. Its fortunes are largely bound with Spotify, which is becoming the industry\u2019s top music distributor. Should the Sweden-based firm\u2019s bold move backfire, its partners at the major record labels will feel the pain too.\n\n\u201cJust think about their depth of influence in the world,\u201d says Capitol Music Group chairman-CEO Steve Barnett of Spotify. \u201c[A recent Nielsen] report noted that Americans are spending more than 32 hours a week listening to music \u2014 up from [23.5] hours in two years. That tells you, for all the mistakes the industry made over a long period of time, things have been corrected.\u201d\n\nBut as Spotify increases its lead over even bigger rivals like Apple and Amazon, the direct listing is raising concerns that the company could experience the kind of turbulence currently rocking another digital-media darling, Snap.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty bad scenario,\u201d says a major-label executive who has worked with Spotify for many years. \u201cThe music industry is back to growth, and you can feel investors saying, \u2018Let\u2019s take another shot at music.\u2019 If it crashes and burns, Wall Street and the investment community might say, \u2018Even this second chance didn\u2019t work\u2019 and become paranoid.\u201d\n\nA Spotify rep said its executives are prohibited by SEC regulations from discussing the direct listing or the company\u2019s business plans.\n\nSpotify\u2019s recent growth has been nothing short of explosive. Founded in Sweden in 2006, launched in Europe in 2008 and in the U.S. in 2011, it announced in January that it had passed 70 million paying subscribers and 140 million active users (the latter category defined as free or paying users within the previous 30 days). The service is available in 61 countries.\n\nThe company has managed to avoid the kryptonite that felled or foiled many of its predecessors \u2014 opposition from Universal, Sony and Warner, the three major music groups and the world\u2019s primary music-rights holders \u2014 by making them partners on multiple levels, including giving them a piece of the action in the form of a combined interest in Spotify that has been reported to be as high as 18%, although knowledgeable sources tell Variety it is actually \u201cmuch lower.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the economic catchphrase has held true: As Spotify goes, so goes the music industry. With streaming leading the way, the music business is projected to post its third consecutive year of growth. This success follows 15-odd years of a brutally demoralizing, illegal-downloading-induced downturn that saw global recorded-music revenues plunge from $23.8 billion in 1999 to $14.3 billion in 2014, according to the Intl. Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Today, estimates of Spotify\u2019s market valuation are $19 billion, up from $16 billion in September. \u201cIt\u2019s the golden boy, the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 of the music industry,\u201d says Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, who has been covering Spotify for several years.\n\nIf there\u2019s one golden boy in the picture, it\u2019s Spotify co-founder/CEO Daniel Ek, whose business credentials have drawn enthusiasts and investors like Sean Parker and Scooter Braun (manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, among others) into his orbit. Ek\u2019s low-key demeanor belies his swagger: His 2016 wedding was held on the shores of Italy\u2019s glamorous Lake Como; Chris Rock officiated, Mark Zuckerberg attended and Bruno Mars performed at the reception.\n\nBut Spotify\u2019s expansion strategy has come at a cost. The streaming giant is losing hundreds of millions of dollars every year. For 2016, its net loss was $601 million; $206 million the year before. Its 2016 gross profit was just $502 million. Its headlong rush to market dominance has been fueled by liberal spending on staffing, marketing and product development \u2014 not to mention those new offices. Artists and songwriters complain loudly about what they consider Spotify\u2019s low royalty rates. The company has been dogged by lawsuits from music publishers and songwriters \u2014 including a $1.6 billion suit earlier this month from Wixen Music Publishing \u2014 which get a much smaller slice of the royalty pie than labels. And five days into 2018, its chief content officer of three years, Stefan Blom, who negotiated many of those deal renewals with the majors and led the move into video, surprisingly announced he was stepping down.\n\nRather than filing for a traditional IPO, the company in December secretly filed for a direct listing of its shares, a process in which no new stock is issued \u2014 and no money is raised \u2014 but existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. The rarely used process allows Spotify to skip the multi-week \u201croad show\u201d of sweet-talking key institutional investors. It also won\u2019t need to enlist and pay investment banks to underwrite the offering, and longtime employees and other shareholders won\u2019t be under a lock-up period; they\u2019ll be able to trade their shares on day one.\n\nThe flip side is that forgoing a conventional IPO initially won\u2019t allow Spotify to raise new capital. And without underwriters to calm the waters, the stock could turn out to be a lot more volatile from the start, which is why Revolution Ventures managing partner David Golden is skeptical of the approach. \u201cThis is really a solution looking for a problem,\u201d he says. An IPO would offer a lot more security for not that much more money, he argues. Golden believes that Spotify is out to \u201cpoke their finger in the eye of traditional Wall Street.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees. \u201cIf there is any private company to pull this off, it is Spotify,\u201d argues Rohit Kulkarni, who has been following the service closely as managing partner of SharesPost, a marketplace for pre-IPO shares. Spotify has for years been operating much like a public company, he says. Incorporated in Luxembourg, the company has been filing detailed financial disclosure reports every year with local regulators.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been very shrewd,\u201d says a second major-label executive, who has worked closely with Spotify for many years. \u201cThe public listing is unusual, but from everything we\u2019ve observed, people have a good understanding of the business, and they have a high degree of visibility and interest in the investment community.\u201d\n\nSpotify may draw some inspiration from Amazon, which lost hundreds of millions of dollars in its first few years as a public company, but investors stuck with the stock because the e-tailer reliably grew its business every quarter. On the other hand, Twitter and Snapchat stumbled not because of their monetary losses but primarily because of stalling user growth.\n\n\u201cTrying to conquer a market, gain share and bet on the future seems to be the playbook of the 21st century,\u201d says the second major-label exec. \u201cThere\u2019s always the conventional investor skepticism about \u2018Show me the bottom line,\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to be the binding rule of law with successful enterprises these days.\u201d\n\nInvestors may not insist on Spotify turning profitable for a few more years, but they do want to be assured it has a path to profitability. One way to get there would be more favorable deals with labels. Its business model calls for paying out around 70% of its annual revenue in royalties.\n\nSources tell Variety that when the company hits certain subscriber and revenue targets, its royalty rates will ease, and that its 2017 agreements with the big three music groups also came with lower rates in exchange for some concessions on \u201cwindowing\u201d new releases from its freemium service (which rights holders loathe but many insiders say has helped persuade millions of people to become paying subscribers). The new rates have helped to improve Spotify\u2019s gross margins from 15% in 2016 to 22% in the first half of 2017, according to SharesPost estimates.\n\nBut many rights holders who aren\u2019t major record labels say Spotify\u2019s rates remain unfairly low \u2014 while there is no clear-cut number, the company reports that it pays out between $0.006 and $0.0084 per stream, which works out far better for a superstar artist than a smaller act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at what we pay out every single day, and it\u2019s a lot,\u201d maintains Spotify global head of creator services Troy Carter, former manager of Lady Gaga and Meghan Trainor. \u201cI think there\u2019s a level of complexity to payments: Either an artist doesn\u2019t have the audience at scale on the platform, or the way their deal is set up with their distributor or label means the money isn\u2019t trickling down to them. I\u2019m seeing artists who are generating gross revenues in eight figures, so the payments are being made \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s receiving them.\u201d\n\nAnd while Spotify and the majors often spar over rates and terms and percentages, last year the company struck new licensing deals with all three, as well as with the independent-label collective Merlin. Spotify secured a $1 billion loan in 2016, and in December, it announced a stock swap with Chinese internet goliath Tencent\u2019s music division. Not only does that give Spotify an additional financial cushion, but the two companies complement each other geographically: Spotify is strong in Europe and the Americas; Tencent dominates in Asia.\n\nBut Spotify has to look for other ways to improve its margins. One obvious area is its ad business, which hasn\u2019t been profitable either. Another is infrastructure. Spotify struck a big multiyear deal with Google for the use of the search engine\u2019s cloud services in early 2016, and may be able to marginally improve its cost structure when it renegotiates that agreement down the line. Sources also tell Variety that Spotify is aggressively exploring ways to monetize its data.\n\nFinally, Spotify could be looking to grow other sources of revenue that aren\u2019t dependent on music royalties. This was one of the reasons the company ventured into original video in 2016. However, it quickly realized it had bitten off more than it could chew and scaled back its video efforts a year later. In September, Disney exec Courtney Holt was brought in to restart efforts on that front (see sidebar).\n\nSpotify is still experimenting with some video formats and has been doubling down on audio podcasts. Kulkarni says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the company eventually adds other forms of non-music audio, but he also cautions to not expect too much from these side projects: \u201cIt is still an experimental revenue stream for Spotify.\u201d\n\nInvestors may not necessarily be spooked by Spotify\u2019s losses as long as the company\u2019s user base continues to grow at a strong pace. Of streamers who subscribe, which make up 80% of all on-demand audio streaming in the U.S., according to BuzzAngle, Spotify leads its nearest competitor by 40 million paying users (Apple Music has 30 million).\n\nThe music business seems to be riding Spotify\u2019s coattails; U.S. spending on music surged 17% to almost $4 billion in the first half of 2017, and streaming grew 48%. Streaming now generates more than half the entire U.S. music industry\u2019s revenue.\n\nAll sources generally agree that \u201cit would be a massive speed bump if Spotify did a faceplant,\u201d as the second exec puts it. \u201cBut does that ultimately mean it derails the music business? No. In terms of the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 question, at the end of the day Spotify\u2019s sails are full of the wind of the mega-trend that is the mass migration of consumers to the cloud. It\u2019s the same thing that\u2019s fueling Netflix\u2019s growth and causing disruption across the media landscape.\u201d\n\nLess convinced is music industry attorney Chris Castle. \u201cThere are some companies that just aren\u2019t supposed to be public, and I think [Spotify is] one,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve grown by seeding their business with venture money and their topline is considerable, and there\u2019s nothing to suggest they have any intention of getting their costs under control. If they\u2019re trying to say that they can\u2019t run their money-losing business without having those expensive offices in the World Trade Center, OK, but don\u2019t come crying to me about royalty rates.\u201d\n\nArticle by Variety.com\n\nLink (Source):http://variety.com/2018/music/features/spotify-ipo-wall-street-music-industry-1202674266/", "id": "7tekri", "created_utc": 1517078077.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "I am looking at a $20 Billion market cap on it first day, week of trading.

If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.\n*****\n> Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.\n*****\n> More than a fifth of the S&P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.\n*****\n> The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.\n*****\n> \"I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,\" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.\n*****\n> There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.\n*****\n> The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.\n\n*[(Click Here to read the full article)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/big-week-for-markets-with-fed-meeting-earnings-tsunami-and-trump-state-of-union.html)*\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rrPQp0K.png))**\n\n# **Major Markets snapshot of this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR MARKETS SNAPSHOT OF THIS PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HyEs0lQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vkPnifD.png)**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HyEs0lQ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ai0cpQ6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ntlsPkW.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EDy4ddT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g9h1gil.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gFpKgph.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**\nFebruary\u2019s performance generally improves in midterm years**\n\n> Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the seventh best month for that benchmark.\n\n> In midterm years, February\u2019s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://78.media.tumblr.com/0754f951350330b1088c68b6991c99ce/tumblr_inline_p36isjHqIL1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **The Energizer Market**\n\n> The S&P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.\n\n> As shown, we\u2019re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rallies-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**\n\n> We\u2019ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it\u2019s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That\u2019s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% \u2014 which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 \u2014 feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.\n\n> Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn\u2019t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it\u2019s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.\n\n> Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months.\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**\n\n> If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that\u2019s easily a record going back to 1945!\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/60streak.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.28.17 - The #FOMOMU continues....** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXGlJealAW4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis for Week Ending 1.26.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOLs46mTO2c))**\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$AAPL** \n> * **$BABA** \n> * **$FB** \n> * **$AMZN** \n> * **$AMD** \n> * **$MSFT** \n> * **$BA** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$LMT** \n> * **$GOOGL** \n> * **$V** \n> * **$STX** \n> * **$MCD** \n> * **$T** \n> * **$PFE** \n> * **$ALGN** \n> * **$MA** \n> * **$AKS** \n> * **$UPS** \n> * **$X** \n> * **$EA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$S**\n> * **$XOM** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$QCOM** \n> * **$EBAY** \n> * **$HOG** \n> * **$SIRI** \n> * **$GLW** \n> * **$GPRO** \n> * **$AET** \n> * **$KEM** \n> * **$PHM** \n> * **$D** \n> * **$NOK** \n> * **$CVX** \n> * **$SAP** \n> * **$AMGN** \n> * **$AMG** \n> * **$ADNT** \n> * **$PII** \n> * **$LLY** \n> * **$ANTM** \n> * **$DHR**\n> * **$MO**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ATtERwl.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gqMTPRA.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the most notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming week ahead which includes the time of release & estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers.\n\n*****\n\n# **Monday 1.29.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/mlmgjgR.png))\n\n# **Monday 1.29.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/7mrc37j.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Tuesday 1.30.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/IOemGYO.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/sHQbywu.png))\n\n# **Tuesday 1.30.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/VMovP0C.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Wednesday 1.31.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/TT5oJsG.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/iNdzxIF.png))\n\n# **Wednesday 1.31.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/nXWW6Ml.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/oqzq3fj.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Thursday 2.1.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/FsPnXOz.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/i5jHldk.png))\n\n# **Thursday 2.1.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/zGqBMnF.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/11oSyJ6.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 2.2.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/Inzwdny.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 2.2.18 After Market Close:**\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n#Apple, Inc. $171.51 \n> **Apple, Inc.
