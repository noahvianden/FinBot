{"title": "First time using options", "selftext": "Hey guys!\nI have saved up $10,000 and ready to invest in options for the first time. So far, I have been watching all youtube videos and doing paper trading. This is my first trade with real money. I am really nervous (more than my first time with a girl lol)\n\nI want to invest 80% in a conservative strategy. For remaining 20%, I want to take up more risk.\n\nSo here is what I think should be done\n\n1) Buy leaps for MSFT and WMT (Deep ITM with delta 80+, maximum intrinsic value). Sell monthly covered calls to reduce cost basis. This will result in a debit of around $8000 (for Jan 2020)\n\n2) Sell credit spreads on breakouts for top liquid ETFs and bluechips.\n\nMy maximum risk is $500. I want to take up small position and learn and absolutely don't want any big loss.\nAm I doing it right? Any tips would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance :)\n", "id": "7qfc42", "created_utc": 1515970296.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Running long term diagonals is fine if that's your thing, but your risk is well over $500 even if you just do one contract of MSFT or WMT.\n\nYou're right that by going with deep ITM long calls you're reducing the time value you need to pay, but you're also simulating a long position.\n\nSay you just do one contract of WMT with the stock here at $100 and you buy a $50 strike LEAP. If WMT drops from $100 to $95 your long call will have lost nearly $500. You'd still have the credit from your short call, but it would be small in comparison and it isn't like a $5 move in WMT is as bad as things could get.\n\nI'm not commenting on the strategy itself, just the risk component.

Instead of the Poor Man's Covered Call, you could also keep selling puts against a position and be generating current income until you're assigned.\n\nIt's normal that market participants have a \"long only\" type mindset but you should evaluate your position with regard to the IV environment/position you find yourself in. You may want a credit or debit position but consider that a LEAPS position is entirely at risk--you can put more positions on due to the inherent leverage but that may also not be wise. If things go against you, will you have enough cash to exercise and keep playing if it's a perceived short-term pullback or are you pretty much pinned and have to take whatever the market is giving you to exit the position? I mean, keep in mind all of your various exit strategies BEFORE you enter the position. What is the worst that can happen? What is the best that can happen? What will you do if the stock suddenly surges through your shorter dated strike and faces exercise? What will you do if it suddenly takes a dive? Will you roll down? Will you take profits on the short position and wait to see if it recovers?\n\nHave all these things figured out. Short-term trading is different than long-term investing. You don't always have the choice to \"ride out the dip\" or \"ride out the surge\" as the case may be.
