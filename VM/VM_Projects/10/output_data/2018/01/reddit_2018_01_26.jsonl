And unlike diamonds, which are only valuable because of artificial scarcity, apple products are valued for a completely different reason, that comparison shows some bias in your analysis. Apple products are valued highly by people because people perceive them to be the best in the market. The reason the iphone sells so well is because people believe *you literally can't buy a better phone*. Between the engineering, design, os, and ecosystem, apple quite arguably provides the best experience to its users for a variety of products. If Apple products were just overpriced for the sake of overpriced, eventually the true value would catch up and the price would reflect that.
