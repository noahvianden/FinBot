The company's total stock (market cap) would then be valued at $1,000. If they immediately split the stocks 2:1, the company would now have 200 stocks at $5 each. But still with a market cap of $1,000. So nothing has changed. They can go on to split again 5:1 and have 1,000 shares at $1 each, and again, the market cap is unchanged.\n\nCompanies tend to split their stock after significant run up.\n\nThere is no fundamental reason to do this. They do it a) to make their price seem \"cheap\" and b) so their price is similar to other companies in their sector.\n\nThis is crucial to understand because it is the most prominent fallacy among retail investors. People simply look at the stock price and think a $20 stock has much better potential/value than a $200 stock.\n\nI see this all the time. And no matter how often I explain it, the same person will still think about it incorrectly the next time. It's terrifying because these people are putting tens of thousands of dollars into a company based on a fundamentally incorrect premise.\n\nWhat's interesting is that some stocks never split. Warren Buffet's Berkshire is a famous example of one that has never split. Buffet is 100% focused on value buy-and-hold investing, and doesn't want to encourage people trading in and out of his portfolio. Berkshire IPOed in the 1964 at around $19. Today one share is worth $320,238. (he does offer \"B\" shares that normal people can afford at around $200/share).\n\nSo back to your question: the reason charts aren't showing what you expect is because most charts adjust history to account for splits. Most good charts have an option to show splits. For example, on Yahoo, if you click the full screen chart and show 5 years, you clearly see the 5:1 split that Apple had on 6/9/2014. It's indicated by the S icon along the x axis.\n\n[See chart here](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL#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)\n\nSo do yourself a huge favor and spend a few hours thinking about this until you fully grasp it.
