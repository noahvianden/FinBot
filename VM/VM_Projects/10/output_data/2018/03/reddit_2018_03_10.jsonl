{"title": "I need this strategy critiqued, am I missing anything?", "selftext": "Ok, so I have been trading deep in the money credit spreads, recent example, on Monday I sold to open a bull put spread on FB, it was the 192.50/190 spread with 30 days until expiry for a max credit/max gain of $1440, meanwhile my max loss was only $280\n\nPlaced the trade on Monday when FB was 177, it finished the week at 185 or so and I closed the position for $300 net profit, that's over 100% return in a week.\n\nSo I am looking at a 30 day credit spread on AAPL, it's the 202.50/200 put spread, max loss of $200 with max gain of $4000\n\nIn other words I am betting AAPL is above 202.50 In 30 days.\n\nMy overall strategy is this, if every single month of the year I place a spread with 30 days until expiration, and only just hit on one of them, that would more than make up for the losses I took in the previous 11 months and then still double my money almost ($200 max loss per trade x 11 is $2200 loss but the one trade is gain of over $4000 max profit)\n\nIn other words, place trades that you will lose 9 out of 10 times but the one that you DO win will be such a huge gain it covers your previous losses PLUS you get a big profit.\n\nImagine if this strategy was implemented just a few weeks ago when AAPL was 155 and just 3 weeks later it's now back to 180!

I'm new to the game myself, but I've also been studying for the past year now.  From what I understand, there is no \"Get rich quick!\" scheme in trading.  In terms of trading stocks, 95% of people or 19 out of 20 minimum will fail when trying to trade, and I believe that to be an incredibly conservative estimate.  There is no such thing as a strategy that will consistently bring you \"MASSIVE gains\" as /u/VRgamer84 likes to put it.  Those that are successful still need to overcome the annual inflationary value which is typically in the range of 2-3%.  When it comes to trading options, one can definitely increase their odds of being successful if they play the probabilities correctly, and get the timing right.  The existing strategies for trading options have been around and tested for a very long time by people that are much smarter than myself.  For me to assume that I can somehow come up with an EPIC strategy that nobody else has thought of is a fools experiment, and prone to failure.  You *will* blow out your account if you continue this line of thinking.  As /u/IAmCorrectAMA suggests, you need to go with what works.

I'm not comfortable with the idea of having an opinion on the direction of an underlying.  If I had a crystal ball in front of me that could tell me the direction of an underlying, my opinion may differ.  I'm sure there are other more experienced option traders here that may disagree with this, and trade directional spreads.  Iron Condor's and Strangles allow you to collect premium so long as the underlying stays within a range that you specify.  That range is often derived from the probability of your short strikes being ITM.  You don't typically choose short strikes that have a greater than 30% chance of being ITM, also referred to as 30 deltas, and not usually less than 16 deltas or 1 standard deviation.  Generally you open these positions when the underlying is around 45 DTE +/- 5 days, and when IV Rank of the underlying is greater than 50%.  You should only be trading liquid underlyings which pretty much discounts trading weeklies, and you will want each leg of your strategy to have liquidity as well.  You don't typically want to see a bid/ask spread of greater than 10 cents for each leg as this is important to getting filled quickly when both opening and closing your positions.  Take profits when you've reached 45-50% of the initial credit received, and don't get greedy.  Option trading strategies are all about probabilities, and if you do things right, you can have an 80-90% probability of success.\n\nOther words of wisdom are to trade small, and trade often.  Try not to use more than 2-5% on any given position, and not more than 50% of your total capital on your entire portfolio.  Know what the actual value is of the underlyings that you currently have positions on.  The last thing you want to do is blow out your account if you're ever to get assigned on one of your positions.  Those are the very basics of success as I understand them.  I may have forgot to add a couple of points here or there, and I'm sure others will correct me or add if there's anything that I've missed.

I couldn't understand mgmt's explanation.  Note that I understood last quarter's explanation for lower subs -- and I was good with the explanation -- but this quarter's explanation is still a mystery to me.  Either analysts are getting something I'm not (most likely), or they're all nodding their heads so they don't seem slow.\n\nThe biggest item that I think the market is overlooking, however, is lower guidance... usually that trumps everything... not this Q, though.\n\nAgreed that anyone put'ing needs to keep a sharp eye on it!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37016165256500244}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30669158697128296}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4947017729282379}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5562977194786072}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8220090866088867}, {"body": "Example:\n\nWhen NFLX reported earnings January 22nd, the average analyst raise on the day following earnings was 23%... and the stock popped 10% that day.\n\nWhen ADSK reported earnings March 6th, the average analyst raise was just 9% but the stock popped 15%.\n\nA question could be was there a big run-up in NFLX during the quarter into earnings such that it might have muted the earnings pop... for NFLX it was 14%... but for ADSK 10%... so both stocks ran up in approximately the same ballpark.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying analysts are right or wrong, or that Autodesk is a good or bad company...
