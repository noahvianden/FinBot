Very similar to the covered call but you can limit downside risk. As the other posters noted you have some potential dividend risk as you might get called on the short side around or at ex-date. \n\nThe issue you have with your call setup is you are playing a pretty tight range. Your long call delta at 170 is only 60 so you are opening up yourself to higher Vega and theta risk (Long Vega Short Theta) this also limits your downside potential as you are paying less for the option so there is a positive and a negative to the trade. \n\nIf you want to run a true replacement campaign you should look at something closer to a 75-80 delta long option. With a 100k portfolio this should still be easily affordable. You might have good luck with weeklys in AAPL as it trades a lot of options but you will likely get better spreads and fills in the monthys (APR 20)\n\nHere are a few scenarios for you. \n\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RJA3LqD.png)\n\nIf you buy stock as mentioned below you are putting yourself at a ton of downside risk. Which if you want to own apple you would be willing to accept that risk. The benefit you get is there is no Vega or Theta exposure and you get the full 100 delta of the long position as you have pure delta with stock. \n\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/E6E0FBG.png)\n\nThe second is your scenario. You can see how the profit/loss curve is a lot flatter as you dont control a lot of delta on the long side. \n\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3wvRXQN.png)\n\nThe third scenario. You buy a  NOV 16 2018 145C and sell the 180 Call. You control more delta in this scenario and can see the position resembles more of a native covered call trade. \n\nWhat is the worst that can happen, and what is the best that can happen?\n\nWorst that happens the price falls and you have a long call that is out of the money requiring you to adjust to reposition your trade. Max risk is the difference in price between the long call and short call. \n\nBest case AAPL gets to 179.99 on the 6th and your call expires worthless and you sell another call and collect more premium. Max risk now is lower since you have collected premium on one option and sold a second. Your Reg-T margin will still be the difference between what you bought your long call for minus what you sold the short call for (your cost of the open trade).
