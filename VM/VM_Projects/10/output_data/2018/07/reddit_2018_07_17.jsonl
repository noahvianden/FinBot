And Wall Street keeps sounding a bullish call for the world\u2019s largest software maker.\n\nThe company now has 31 buy ratings, up from 26 at the start of this year and the most since late 2010. While analysts\u2019 earnings-per-share estimates are little changed since May, their average price target for the stock has climbed. They [predict](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) the shares will increase 7.5 percent over the next 12 months, compared with a 5.5 percent average gain seen among the 36 stocks in the S&P Supercomposite Software Industry Index.\n\nMicrosoft, once known for its dominance in desktop computer operating systems, has climbed more than 20 percent this year as investors grow increasingly confident in its push toward cloud computing. While the company has made headway there, it faces tough competition from deep-pocketed rivals including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\n\nJust this week, [Raymond James Financial Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RJF:US) analyst Michael Turits, who has a strong buy recommendation on Microsoft\u2019s shares, increased his target price by 13 percent to $124. He said in a research note that the company\u2019s success in pushing its products through partners and positioning itself as a cloud leader present upsides for long-term growth forecasts and pointed out that PC shipments are up for the first time in six years.\n\nAnalysts at [Bank of America](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BAC:US) and [Piper Jaffray](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PJC:US) each also raised their price targets as the company is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close of trading Thursday. The average earnings-per-share estimate is $1.08.\n\nOptions trading indicates a 3.9 percent move in the shares after the earnings, which is slightly below the average of 4.2 percent, according to [data](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) compiled by Bloomberg. And options investors seem to agree with sell-side analysts who see further strength in Microsoft.

Like I feel amazon prime streaming is a complete bust, but I don't know how much more they plan to commit to that project but clearly their cloud network is producing significantly greater profits than the retail amazon business. And Bezos (while I personally am not of a fan of the man himself) is one of the top business ceos and hes proven it, I would have never thought in a million years he could have produced this empire starting by selling books.  Hes like the anti Daddy Musk, he just lets his business show for it where as musk tweets and pr stunts.  I have 3 reasons why I think amazon is bullish.\n\n1. There is no denying the footprint that amazon has carved out against the retail sector.  Ultimately those companies failed because they didn't adapt, now wmt and tgt have to catch up on the online market before amazon catches up to their retail curve.  I don't know which is harder, but I do see companies working out better deals with amazon over the long haul compared to retail shops.  WMT has been bleeding out small mom and pop shops this way, I think amazon has enough money to do the same and compete with WMT.  I fear for target\n2. I think more and more millennials will want to save time just ordering online. If I go to walmart or a grocery store I have to expect 40 minutes just from checking out and the commute.  Thats not adding to the time of getting ready and if I am taking my daughter that additional time.   I personally am finding myself willing to pay more to save time and I think the majority of millennials will also realize this concept as well.  Because truth be told (bad double dipping :() i can put together a grocery list from my desk at work and have dry goods shipped to me.  Shopping on amazon probably nets me 2 to 2.5 hrs  per week, from not having to shop at the store, getting ready, commute, and checking out.\n3. They are a powerhouse and Bezos clearly is going to continually improve and correct the processes of amazon and also the companies hes acquired like whole foods.  The way I view the future is that business will continue to cut costs through automation and removing workers.  Walmart is starting with retail robots and I think that amazon basically has this solved.  Think about how many employees are doing back inventory for walmart, that can basically be automated like amazons warehouse.  Plus amazon is evolving into drone deliveries to cut costs.  Im not saying its easy, but then next maybe the drone deliveries will be automated as well.\n\nI believe amazon has a direction into providing a good service for a lot of people, walmarts service really is just cheaper goods and the headaches that go with that isn't always worth it.  Thats just from the retail giant that I think amazon will end up gaining more control where they are the new walmart and walmart is like target/kmart.\n\nAmazon is against a lot of big companies and that is scary, but I feel like Bezos isn't done building his legacy where as someone like bill gates is on the downhill trying to determine how he leaves his legacy behind.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["wmt", "amzn", "wmt", "tgt"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "If it is hit hard wouldn\u2019t it be a good time to buy up some shares?

{"title": "Key points to take from Netflix's earnings", "selftext": "Investors are beginning to worry that Netflix may have reached peak growth, and with increased competition coming in the next couple years from AT&T-Time Warner, Disney-Fox or Comcast-Fox, and Daddy Bezos, many of you fuckers are wondering if this bubble has popped. However, there are a few key takeaways from this earnings that may have contributed to this big pullback:\n\n1. NFLX doesn't know what the fuck they are doing when it comes to guidance. They tend to overestimate or underestimate by 1 million subscribers. Netflix has a tough time coming up with proper guidance since they have something like 170 markets to monitor and correct guidance is near impossible. This has worked well in their favor having underestimated most quarters, but once every 4 or 5 quarters they miss guidance and the stock will take a massive shit.\n2. NFLX content this quarter sucked balls. Like that fucking Will Smith movie? That shitty Lost in Space series? Like where the fuck was content this quarter? On top of that, their most popular shows did not have new seasons during Q2. We can likely assume that Q3 won't suck quite so much ass.\n3. The World Cup likely cut into numbers (especially international numbers) more than Netflix expected. The truth is, this World Cup was lit as fuck. How can some shitty Will Smith MIB ripoff compare with the fucking World Cup, especially when soccer is practically a religion for half the global population.\n4. Netflix still beat EPS estimates. This is important since Netflix is borrowing enormous amounts of cash to produce content during rising interest rates. Their entire business model fails if growth fails since they will be fucked by debt, but luckily they are becoming more profitable even in the midst of a weak quarter.\n\nPersonally, I think Netflix is overvalued, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons why this selloff may have been affected by outside factors and why a quarter like this may not remain a trend. If growth continues to wane for another quarter then Netflix starts to look unattractive as competition heats up in 2019 and 2020. Till then, Netflix remains king.\n\nEdit: As I am typing this, Bank of America maintains buy on NFLX, lowering PT to $410.
