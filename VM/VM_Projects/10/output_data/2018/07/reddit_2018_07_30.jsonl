I've only done some basic programming back in college.  Have you tried programming any algos to assist your trading?  I've been toying with the idea of digging into a language for backtesting and algos.  \n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s kind of two parts really. You have to decide how to get and store your data, then you have to decide the structure of your tests. \n\nIn my case, I buy data. It\u2019s many years worth of data, and it gets provided to me in zipped csv files. So it\u2019s comma separated data with one record per line, with a few different files for different data. I get one file per day that covers about 5000 tickers of stock and options data. My entire data set amounts to several GB of data. I can\u2019t really use the data efficiently in csv files, so I write code to convert it into an SQL database. That way I can get at specific data quickly based on a query language called SQL. I can use that language from within python to grab the data I care about. \n\nI have a degree in Computer Science, and code in many languages daily, so doing stuff like this is pretty second nature to me. It\u2019s difficult to answer your question about how long it would take to learn enough, because it really depends on your aptitude and your problem solving skills. I\u2019ve seen many people fail miserably at programming, while others get it pretty quickly. That said, it\u2019s really just organizing your data, doing math, and storing results until you get the answers you want. The tough part for most people is breaking a large problem into smaller pieces and structuring it in code.\n\nI\u2019d recommend just getting good at the basics of python first. The syntax, built in types(lists, tuples, dictionaries, numbers, etc.), flow control (if, while, for, etc) , using files, and using libraries. Once you\u2019ve got a pretty good handle on that, learn about a database. MySQL, SQLite, or something similar should be fine. Databases are really critical to backtesting especially. For algo trading, you\u2019ll be more concerned with real-time data you\u2019d get from a platform. I use interactive brokers, and while they do have a python API, I use their C++ API instead. Mainly because it used to be officially supported, where the python wasn\u2019t. That may have changed. \n\nMost of my trading doesn\u2019t require automation. I tend to use code to find trades to look further into and place manually. Finding something the code flags as undervalued, and then diving into the SEC reports to do further research is my 90% case. Finding good pairs trades is another scenario where code does a great job. Finding correlation coefficients between every pair of tickers for the last year, picking out stocks within similar sectors, and looking for anomalies where the spreads are out of whack would be very tedious without code. With code it\u2019s trivial to find these things, but it\u2019s always necessary to research a little after finding something. Is there a reason why the one stock is underperforming relative to the other? Does the one have a shit balance sheet and is close to defaulting on a bond payment? Code can make it easier to see that kind of stuff, but a little common sense is needed before pulling the trigger in my opinion.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the detailed response buddy.
