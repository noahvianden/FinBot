{"title": "Speculative interest, VIX hedging, put/call ratios- making sense of data.", "selftext": "I've learned a bunch lurking on this subreddit and had a question I thought would be worth running by the options pros out there.  A few articles have caught my eye recently and I'm interested in what data folks here find most helpful.  \n\nBloomberg ran this article a few days ago, discussing how VIX short positions have grown to the highest levels in 3 years: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-09/u-s-index-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-assess-gains.  \n\nThis seemed to line up with a CNBC article highlighting that that speculative longs in the Dow were at all-time highs, coinciding with the new all-time highs the markets were making - http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/investing-stock-prices-are-at-record-highs-and-so-is-speculation.html.  There's also a Zero Hedge article stating there was similar long speculative interest in the NASDAQ.  \n\nOf course this is all kind of obvious since we're hitting new highs, but... Goldman had some research out there recently which stated that the 1m moving average of SPX call volume was at a record high.  With options sellers usually winning this seemed pretty bearish.  I downloaded a bunch of historical data from the CBOE and while the call volume was high, it didn't seem all that ridiculous when looking at put/call ratios for either specific indexes or index ETFs.  \n\nI also follow the speculative sentiment indicator over on DailyFX and according to them, everyone and their brother are bearish on the S&P (at least on the retail CFD side): https://www.dailyfx.com/sentiment.  However, for DailyFX, negative sentiment on their indicator would mean they're still very bullish on the S&P.  I'm not too familiar with CFDs  - my understanding is they're primarily traded in UK/EUR and they allow high levels of leverage like FX trading.  Please correct me here if I'm off.\n\nAnyways, my question - what tools do you use when you're looking at market sentiment and how specific are those tools in breaking down that sentiment?  Going back to my examples, VIX short positions (bullish) seems like something larger institutional or sophisticated investors would engage in.  On the flip side, selling SPX calls also seems sophisticated but bearish.  Are there ways of sorting between these types of data and breaking down not only the \"what\", but the \"who\"?

Options players are a small segment of the market and often hedge their positions using futures, or stock, or whatever. This makes the raw data noisy.\n\nSo back to square one for sentiment. I like to think about the proverbial Joe Six-Pack, the average investor.

Most option traders are sophisticated. Rarely do they make straight bets in large size. Most of the big volume option trades are hedged positions. The news outlets like to report some headline number, saying it means this-or-that, but rarely is that interpretation one that I would agree with.
