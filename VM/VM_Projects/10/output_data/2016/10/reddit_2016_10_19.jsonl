{"title": "It's time to get off of the $A$M$D bandwagon, at least for now - DD post", "selftext": "$NVDA has just released the information about its new answer to AMD's hold on the low-end GPU market- it's the 1050, which will start selling on the 25th. This graphics card is at a significantly lower price than AMD's flagship 480 and will probably have similar performance, meeting the minimum spec for the Oculus Rift for only $109, which will be gaining popularity with the release of its touch controllers. AMD is left with two choices- become second-tier in all regards to Nvidia or drop prices. Either would be devastating to the company's GPU income.\n\nSo with AMD's GPU's out of the picture as far as its stock/earnings reports going to the moon, us faggots are left with simply hoping the zen line excels. Now this is possible, but very unlikely. This has happened time and time again with AMD's new processor lines- the next one will always be the best, the one that drives the company back into the green.\n\nSo, wrapped up- AMD is not releasing zen for a while. The stock is bound to fall in the short term as AMD has few to no viable products on the market. If you are an AMD fanboy, dump your stock now and rebuy shortly before zen is released to take your moonshot.\n\nTLDR; dump AMD in the short term, rebuy before zen if you're a believer\n\nEdit: I may be being cynical. This doesn't murder AMD but it IS a blow. With Nvidia as a viable low-end competitor to cards like the 470, gpu buyers are given a Nvidia card at every price point. It is my guess that a low end gamer will go for the 1050 and a mid-tier buyer is willing to shell out the extra $50 for a 1060 over a 480.
