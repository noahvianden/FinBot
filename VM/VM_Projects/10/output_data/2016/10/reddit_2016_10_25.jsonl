I'm a little disappointed in how some of Google's recent ventures have been going, but remain confident in the long-term view as the company attempts to diversify. \n\nI think Amazon is actually only accelerating. They're going to be the largest apparel retailer by next year, traditional retailing is starting to be forced to admit that retail is overbuilt and they are going to have to shrink - see Macy's CEO finally admitting what has been obvious for years (http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/macys-finally-starts-addressing-the-overstored-retail-landscape.html). \n\nRetailers are going to have to beccome very creative, but why should I be confident in many traditional retailers now becoming creative to think of new growth paths when many of them basically stuck their head in the sand for years hoping that Amazon would go away? They weren't forward-thinking then, why should I have confidence in them being so now? I fully believe the next 5-10 years is going to see massive change for the mall industry where fewer new malls are going to be built and the ones that are are going to be structured more as lifestyle destinations. Many generic strip malls are going to be gone. The end result is a smaller industry dominated by larger players but between now and then it's going to be a rough period for all players.\n\nI'd recommend both but if I had to pick one I'd actually lean towards Amazon. When you step back and look at the broader picture in terms of how retail has changed in this country and how retail will continue to change, there's simply no one that even approaches what Amazon has done. The remarkable thing though is that the industry, through being naive (\"No one's gonna buy clothes online!\", now Amazon will become the largest apparel retailer within a year) or simply ignoring it and hoping it will go away, the industry basically let Amazon get to where it is today. Sears let Wal-Mart pass it by, but pretty much an entire industry let Amazon pass it by.\n\nAnd all of this, among other issues, is why I've said repeatedly that I don't want to be anywhere near the mall in terms of investing, especially mall REITs. Sears will be gone within a year, Macys will be closing stores, JCP, Kohls, Staples and others will be shrinking.\n\n\"To get back to their pre-recession productivity peak, the nation\u2019s top department stores would have to close hundreds of locations, according to a leading real estate analysis firm.\n\nChains such as Sears  SHLD -1.67% , J.C. Penney  JCP -2.22%  and Macy\u2019s  M -1.94%  have been hit by a double whammy: the loss of market share to Amazon  AMZN -0.35%  and specialty stores, coupled with chronic drops in shopper traffic to malls. Collectively, they would need to close some 800 stores for sales per square foot to go back to 2006 levels, Green Street Advisors wrote in a recent research note. That translates to 25% of all department stores nationwide, whose list also includes Dillard\u2019s  DDS -1.47% , Bon-Ton  BONT -1.28%  and Nordstrom  JWN -1.19% .\" (http://fortune.com/2016/04/25/department-stores-closing/) \n\nAnd you can argue valuation with Amazon - as people have for years - but I think the growth story in e-commerce is only going to accelerate, combined with AWS and a management team that seems to rarely make mis-steps.\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "amzn", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Noob Question: Is there a price cap for stocks?
