However Im not sure who wrote it. But this is the explanation for most of the VIX tools you will come into contact with.\n\nVIXX TVIX\n\n\nVIX is the expected volatility over the next 30 days as measured by options activity on the S&P: http://cfe.cboe.com/education/vixprimer/About.aspx\n\nNote that this is not necessarily inversely related to the S&P (though it often is) and also that the market will become immune to the decline of the S&P if it fits in with the expectation of variance. That is, if the market is dropping 1% per day at a given level of VIX, VIX won't necessarily continue to rise as the market continues to fall, because the VIX is already pricing in that rate of negative variation. People not understanding this simple fact of VIX is huge, and it's one reason people are usually way off on their expectations about VIX behavior.\n\nVIX Futures allow people to place bets on the VIX at a future date in time at a forward price. When the current VIX (ie: spot price) of VIX is below the long term expectation of VIX, the price of a futures contract will trade at a premium relative to that price. Right now, for instance, spot VIX is about 15.6, but the June VIX contract (VXM16) is currently trading at 17 and change. The July VIX contract (VXN16) is currently trading over 18. This situation, where the current spot is less than the futures price, is a situation known as \"contango\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contango\n\n) and is normally for VIX futures (and many other futures). This is basically a premium you are buying to buy a VIX future contract ahead of time. Obviously, however, if VIX doesn't rise to meet the future price, you are losing out on the premium paid. This is important. VIX futures are usually in contango (something like 80% of the time).\n\nTVIX is comprised of the \"short term\" futures of the next couple of month's futures contracts, so it currently is comprised of a blend of June and July VIX futures, with a heavy weighting on the June side (the front month). Every week there is roll from the front month to the back month, to adjust the weighing of the security as time goes on. Remember how I said that you'd be losing out on the futures premium (the difference between the spot price and forward price) if spot VIX didn't rise above the forward price? Well, this roll locks those losses (or gains) so that holders of short-term VIX futures contracts are always losing money when VIX stays flat, drops, or goes up only slightly. For securities like VXX, this can mean a loss of 2-3% per week.\n\nNow, TVIX/UVXY, are even more complicated, because they are the daily leveraged movements of the short-term VIX futures. So everything I said before is now magnified by 2x, but adjusted on a daily basis. This means that you can expect TVIX/UVXY to lose roughly 8-15%/week in an environment where VIX is flat or slightly declining and the VIX futures curve is substantially upward sloping (ie: in contango). People often buy TVIX thinking that if VIX goes up, TVIX will necessarily go up. That's not the case, as VIX has to go up enough that the futures market starts to expect a long enough spike to actually alter the future prices AND is has to go up enough to overcome the costs of contango. These are significant hurdles to overcome.\n\nFurthermore, the effects of daily compounding wreak their own havoc on TVIX and UVXY. Because VIX tends to be mean reverting and because of contango, these funds have no clear direction, meaning that they are subject to tremendous volatility. Daily compounding can be very beneficial when you have something with an upward bias (e.g. the broad market) but can be catastrophic when you have something with no clear upward bias and with lots of interday volatility, such as the VIX futures market. So TVIX/UVXY not only have contango working against them twice as much as VXX, but also have daily compounding to erode their value on anything but a long, unbroken string of up days.\n\n  ", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Not OP, but thank you.
