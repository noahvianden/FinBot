{"title": "Today in Trading 2/23/2016", "selftext": "To quote the famous German filmmaker Werner Herzog, \n\n>\"I prefer to be alive, so I'm cautious about taking risks\"\n\nAlthough you can't make any return in trading without risking something, there is a time to risk and then there's a time to be alive. \nToday it feels good to be alive. Oil got demolished. \n\nTo quote someone else from yesterday.\n\n >\"Like always, be on the lookout for anything someone from Saudi says about oil. It can change all of this in a matter of minutes. I am not even in a position right now because oil is still in no-man's land. When in doubt, just be out.\"\n\nAnd sometimes in the investing and trading world being cash when unsure of a trade is better than a high risk shot with uncertain direction. Just don't do it. That is gambling. A long in oil today would have been murdered. All it took was one little sentence from one very greedy Saudi to send oil running for the day.[ Thanks bro...](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-comments-by-saudi-arabias-al-naimi-slammed-oil-futures-2016-02-23) It ended up being a great day for the shorts which was topped off by an inventory build from the API report at 4:30pm. The chart ended up taking a resistance leading trade and wiping out the support, during consolidation, almost immediately...[He says allll the right things....at exaaactly the right times...](http://i.imgur.com/VlixRCh.png). I feel like I need some thicker foil for my hat, it's literally falling apart.\n\nI will dedicate an entire post one day on how to interpret these reports, as there are many factors that determine bullish or bearish from a build. Sometimes a build can be very bullish if it implies someone is pumping more to anticipate more demand in an under supplied market in a January, but an inventory build can be extremely bearish in a January when producers have full tanks and there is an oversupplied environment. This means that the demand isn't outgrowing the current supply. The same numbers have different interpretations in different environments. In this instance today Wall St. didn't seem to think it was that bullish at all. Here was the call from yesterday where I was cash waiting for the reports to come out. [I don't trust any Saudi meeting right now](http://i.imgur.com/HNRp6mB.png) and now the price action today after both major news events is this. [Don't let me be the first to tell you what's going to happen next](http://i.imgur.com/xAImceO.png). Take a guess.\n\nNow as oil was in the middle of still fulfilling its multiple resistance bounces in this consolidating triangle in what I'm still calling no-man's land;  I'm still not chasing it--I'm waiting. And instead of risking my money there I happily watched from the sidelines while managing the sale of my massive long position in equities and ETF's that I stocked up on from the SPX 1800's time. This ended up actually being the biggest swing trade I have made in my life in a single week-ish run. I find it tacky to speak about money so I won't tell you how much, but everyone in chat heard me jumping up and down when I pulled in close to 50% return over a handful of carefully planned swing trades over the course of a few weeks... no not just 50% on a trade--close to 50% on my entire account! This is what leveraged ETF's do. I could have just as well lost it all as well but of course I had stops in place. See, when we called 26.20 as an oil bottom I felt so confident about the trade (and my stops were so tight) that I felt that my risk was negligible compared to the possible return and I was just about all in long, with no hedge short to ride this bump up. We document all of our trades we make in our chat so I was calling all of my entries as I made them...\n\nIt's not always like this, most days I'm grueling out wins and losses just like the next guy. But when you see the perfect setup that has very low risk and you time your entry right, and you have your safety net in place and you trust your discipline, take the trade! \n\nSo for the SPX, [here was yesterday's optimistic chart for a continuation up to at least 2025](http://i.imgur.com/K0Q1dYy.png) but we ended up here [Again Saudi Arabia, thanks for being the oil dorm's RA. Sorry... I'll turn the music down](http://i.imgur.com/bhCStqG.png). My confidence in this move is now half what it was yesterday. It's still possible to move up from here, but the price target will be a tad lower when I figure out what it is after a day or two more of trading. Remember that for now the SPX is still no man's land because if you draw a fib from the 2050's gap down to the 1800's bottom, the middle is... do the math, 1925. Retraces are very common in very large moves, and at this point is where people will be starting to bet again. \n\nWe've been hovering 1925 +/- 20 since last Wednesday, so it's anyone's game at this point. I'm very confident we're entering a bear market, but will it fall straight down from here? I'm still not certain the leg up is over until we close Monday's gap up from Friday and re-enter the sub 1900's range. I suspect a few more strange up and down days in this range might be it. I feel like chasing is a loss, so I recommend cash.\n\nKeeping today's analysis short and sweet, all things are in no man's land, seriously sometimes it's better to have a sandwich than it is to lose money. Tomorrow at 10:30 is the EIA report, and with a move like today I wouldn't be surprised if the DWTI players attack it full force, bullish or bearish.

I'm very confident we're entering a bear market, but will it fall straight down from here?

I feel like chasing is a loss, so I recommend cash.\n\nNo man's land just stole your sandwich if you were chasing a short today in just about anything, huh? So I bet you are all sitting around scratching your heads right, you were burned trying to chase a long on Tuesday, and burned again trying to short in Wednesday. I apologize to anyone who didn't heed the \"being cash might be a good option for you\" warning yesterday. Because if you didn't you probably feel like the worst trader alive right now?\n\nLook man, here's some aloe for the burn--focus. You and EVERY OTHER TRADER OUT THERE. Hopefully if you stick around here your technique will sharpen and you'll learn to not get caught up in the excitement of a one day thing and be the last guy in line throwing your money at it. Trust me when I say that no man's land is not the place for you, it's the place for algo's to fight each other with trillions of dollars that you do not have. Again don't be that guy thinking you know something they who think in nanoseconds don't. Just watch this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fawD7Nj74NA) if you want a little more info about your future robot overlords. And just take from it that you just don't want to be \"that guy\" trying to beat it.\n\nSo ladies and gentlemen get your crayons and your ruler and lets learn how to be someone much better than...that guy. See...I am really good at ~~copying and pasting shit that happened from the past and applying it today~~ being the world's greatest trader and predicting the future, [as you can so plainly see] (http://i.imgur.com/DNQlBP7.png). The SPX is still trading on an absolutely predictable path--thank you again VIX. But unless you are a seasoned pro why even bother? This kind of trade is hard right here. So please for the sake of your retirement accounts, let the robots do their thing before you subscribe to anyone's crazy theories (or your own) about what you or they think will and won't happen. You don't know, I don't know, and even the Crayola gods might not know. Because if you are trading here you are a certainly a glutton for punishment.\n\n\n**SPX**\n\n[On that note I am somewhat of a glutton for punishment](http://i.imgur.com/1PYM1aV.png). I saw SPX fall to 1890, a [price target I've been telling people to watch since 2/19/2016](http://i.imgur.com/nB1glMQ.png), and [again today](http://i.imgur.com/oJH1Dko.png) with everyone in chat shouting that number as early at 7:00am EST like there was a trophy for saying it the most. \n\nThere was no trophy... \n\nBut when that number bounced *and* we filled the 1920 gap I loaded up on some SPXL because it's a high risk trade but with high return, and I have my stop losses in place. And what do you know, that action of clearing the gap down was all it took to send the intraday bears retreating for the hills.\nNow since it's still no man's land, I only took a small position but at least I'm in really low so tomorrow if it's a runaway past the resistance I am costed in lower than the open for the day because of today, which as a day trader...cost averaging into a possible gap up to make sure your entry price is lower than the day's open is like a parachute for your parachute. You ain't gonna die with that setup.\n\n\n**WTI**\n\nAnd I know every one of you thought today's crude build was bearish, which again I need an installment here explaining these reports, but as I said before there is a lot that goes into the pricing of crude that's not just \"supply.\" There is supply against demand, there is time of year, there is time of month, there is oversold and overbought on speculative instruments like DWTI/UWTI, there are options put into the USO and we all watch the OVX and react to that as traders too... not to mention the Saudi's being Saudi and inflating futures prices with fancy words. \n\nOh and those reports also show the thing that people like you and me actually buy. Gasoline and Kerosene (not directly the latter...but you fly, and that fuels your plane). And then distillates (heating oil and diesel for transportation of the things you buy everywhere else)\n\n>Crude oil inventories (previous / weekly change):\t2.1 M barrels\t3.5 M barrels\n\n>Gasoline (previous / weekly change):                       3.0 M barrels\t-2.2 M barrels\n\n>Distillates (previous / weekly change):                    1.4 M barrels\t-1.7 M barrels\n\nAnd again I said that you have to look at how traders respond. They had an awful API report in a build, and a much more tolerable EIA report which showed things to be not as bearish as they were presumed yesterday. Distillate and gasoline inventories went down which say that even in this bad fundamental environment things are proceeding along pretty much like that always do... demand for products isn't necessarily decreasing, so it was a report that wasn't bearish enough to sustain yesterday's short, so traders covered. \n\nIt's still no man's land, it's still a brutal trade; and while I may be a glutton for punishment, I'm definitely not stupid with my money. I didn't chase, I didn't lose. And in my book that's a win...\n\nHope that sheds a little light on the dark stuff. It's still looking bad out there, so peck at your trades and take profits whenever you can. Don't get your hopes up, it will all be over soon and you can get back to just setting it and forgetting it (whichever way that ends up being). But when it happens, you'll know. Feel free to post any questions here or PM me directly and I'll help if I can.

Then you have a second entry today 2/24 at 1890?  What's the size of that entry?  Also, where/why did you set your stop on the initial trade and have you changed the stop with the subsequent trade?  Thanks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The answer to your question depends on the regime in which things are trading. \n\nWhat we call no man's land is the narrow window where long term support meets long term resistance. It's very hard to day trade it, green bar, red bar, green bar kind of days. So the goal here isn't to be right it's to know the tight trading range and trust that it's not going anywhere yet and use the bad days to lower your overall entry price if you need to.\n\nSo flat trading week around a key price point (1925 being the 50% fib on the down move), you can expect price to hang here for a while while algos play a giant game of chicken as to who buckles first. 50% fibs are so important. So I will trust that any break from here will be violent to one direction. +/- 50 pts violent. These +/- 20 pts are just daily noise factoring in a bunch of things\n\nHowever... in a clearly trending day, up or down, yes you are right by ALL MEANS take your loss and get out. But it's very easy to know the difference. A trend usually has more than one data point supporting it ;)  If you are long, and there are two red bar days, probably are on the wrong side. \n\nThat initial trade I closed out on Tuesday morning I believe after the Saudi oil minister spoke about not cutting production rates. I needed to gauge how bad the markets were going to react to it so I went cash and just took my profits. But all the while in our chat we were eyeballing that 1890 support and using it as the place to consider getting back in. I was still being cautious, so I didn't play that and instead I waited for the gap down to fill intraday, cross 1920, and then I entered long there SPXL and in few other things. It's a small position but I bet small when uncertainty is high so I can add more if right, or average in if there's a red day, and I'll exit a long if that green line breaks to the downside or we lose 1890's as support.\n\nStops: when there is an active support and I'm long, I'm trailing just below the green sloped lines (on my chart they are green) with a mental stop. I don't use stop loss orders at all if I can avoid them because you never know when some predatory algo will wipe a thin bid and stop you before the price continues up. Manual is better the way I trade, and when my mental stop is crossed I fire off a market order while day trading using a mental stop (I trade liquid stuff, so I don't care about the one tick loss in a market order...I'll sacrifice that for speed to be first out)\n\nPosition size as % of account varies. In no man's land, I'm not betting big on day trades. 10-20% or less of total account to just play with and use the rest to build positions for a breakout or to average into better entries for swings. But in clear and definitive trends with a clear trend line and support/resistance leading the trade, I won't lie I'm pretty much almost all in in a combination of things. But if you use those lines as stops and you have a rock solid entry, your safety net should keep you from losing much at all if wrong. But it takes patience and experience to get to a point to feel safe with a support/resistance style of trading. I don't recommend this to anyone just getting into trading. Start small and grow into your comfort level based on what you are willing to risk. Maybe 10%, then if that works try 15%, then 20%, etc. Grow into something comfortable for you... \n\nThis inspired me to write something down the road about all these questions.
