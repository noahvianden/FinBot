{"title": "Option Strategy Review: Global Sigma", "selftext": "#Option Strategy Review: Global Sigma\n\nTLDR - Stealthy hedge fund sells 5 delta options with 1 week to expiration, almost never reports a loss, largest trader by volume in S&P500 futures weeklies at one point.\n\n##Background\n* Manager Hanming Rao, CIO - In 2009, Hanming was a model developer in the statistical arbitrage group of Millennium Partners. From 2006 to 2009, he was a Global Macro trader at SAC Capital where he managed global futures and OTC products including short-term options on the S&P500. Prior to SAC, at Ellington Management he worked on various ARM prepayment modeling projects. PhD Engineering Sciences, Masters Computer Science, Harvard University. \n\n##Firm\n* Global Sigma was formed in late 2009 around the same time the weekly expiry options contract on the S&P500 was launched. Global Sigma is a product focused manager and  has become the most\nactive and largest manager of the weekly expiry S&P500 options contract in the CTA industry.\n\n##Strategy\n* Global Sigma Plus is a short term \u201cmean reversion\u201d trading program focused on S&P 500 Futures and Options. It has average 5 days holding period. It generates alpha from both volatility and directional market.\n\n* When we sell options, we typically focus on two standard deviation strikes,\nmeaning about 95% of the time, those options will expire out of money.\n\n* Typically sell puts at local bottom, sell calls at local top or sell strangles during range-bound markets\n\n* The programs will typically trade options with 1 week to expiration\n\n* A drop in volatility after a position is established is usually more favorable to the program (given all other things unchanged). \n\n* However, this does not mean the program will lose money when volatility is rising or the market is trending. \n\n##Trade Management\n* Most of the time, we find that simply admitting the models were incorrect and cutting losses quick is the optimal solution. This scenario typically happens when expirations are still quite away and the position hits a draw down limit specified by the program. \n\n* The strategy hedges the portfolio\u2019s Delta/Gamma exposures by taking positions in the S&P500 futures market and buying\nPuts and Calls. The average daily S&P Delta exposure of the portfolio since inception has been (-0.10). GSP may also hedge using volatility index futures. Neutralize delta and gamma risk when portfolio hits 3% draw down. Liquidate positions when portfolio hits 10% draw down...while using the underlying S&P500 futures contracts to hedge delta/gamma exposures when the portfolio begins to sustain losses of greater than -0.5% of NAV\n\n* GSP trades significantly more frequently than the majority of other CTA programs. Before 2012, the program traded about 8,000 \u2013 16,000 contracts per year per million dollar nominal. For 2012 and 2013, the program traded about 20,000 contracts per year per million dollar nominal. For 2014, the program traded about 22,000 contracts per year per million dollar nominal. \n\n* Both GSP and GSB attempt to optimize for a higher risk adjusted return or Sharpe Ratio. We believe trading the program with a higher frequency is a key factor to achieve that objective.  For some clients, their desired targeted return objective may be the highest absolute return instead of highest risk adjusted. \n\n* Its primary risk is short gamma exposure, which can be forecast and hedged 23 hours a day with S&P 500 futures. And when hedging is required, it is typically only for a few days or less, since the options expire every Friday. \n\n* Since the S&P 500 index has moved significantly upward beginning in Q2 2009, a large amount of the portfolio\u2019s hedging activity has been to hedge the short call exposures.\n\n##Manager Commentary\n* This strategy, explains Rao, is in contrast to the more popular short volatility, premium capture approach, where portfolios have longer holding periods using monthly expiry option contracts. These types of portfolios are exposed to significant volatility risk, which is more difficult to model or forecast and even more challenging to hedge, he says.\n\n* \"The approach is looking to hit singles from day to day, and if the models and Hanming\u2019s discretionary insight don\u2019t sense any particular day offers an attractive risk/reward opportunity, the approach will pass on trading that day,\u201d says Paul Eckel, a partner at Global Sigma, who began marketing for the firm four years ago through his capital raising firm Emerging Manager. The \u201cmissed\u201d profit opportunity is not significant, he says, as a statistically attractive trade should occur over the following few days.\n\n* The strategy will be more profitable when the VIX rises above 15. But he adds that Rao has also been able to adjust to a new, lower VIX environment. Global Sigma has performed as well, or stronger than in the past, when the VIX was higher and assets were much lower \n\n* Hamning Rao (HR): Volatility is very mean reverting and range bound. The average VIX price for the past 20 years has been around 20. In comparison, the S&P500 doubled in value over the last ten years and quadrupled from 1993 to 2013. I don\u2019t know where S&P500 will be for the next 10 years, but it is my opinion the average VIX will most likely still be around 20. Many people say stock markets are random. On the other hand, everyone is talking about fat tails. These two things cannot exist at the same time. If the market is random, there won\u2019t be fat tails. The reason for fat tails, in my opinion, is due to investors herd mentality and risk averse nature of human being. Long term stock market price direction is moved by fundamentals but short term it is a \u201cvoting machine.\u201d That is why economists love long term forecasts and technical analysts love short term plays. From technical stand point of view, it is hard to forecast long term movement because there are too many variables. This is more like butterfly effect: there was a butterfly flapping its wing in Brazil, then you had a tornado in Oklahoma City. You may say the butterfly caused the tornado, but they were too far apart and too many things could\nhappen in the middle, it was hard to draw the conclusion. However, the federal agents warned residents 36 minutes before the tornado. So it\u2019s no longer unpredictable when it\u2019s close. Same thing in the financial markets, in summer 2008, most people believed Lehman would survive. However, the Friday before Lehman filed bankruptcy, people knew either Lehman would be bought by another bank or it would disappear. You only have two choices then and the market quickly priced in what would happen next. I could even argue 911 was not random. You had Airlines sold off unusually hard and VIX climbed 11 points to 32 during the 10 trading days before the attack. It was quite a warning already\n\n* MM: What is your edge? HR: We think we have a better risk control. Generating returns in an option strategy is the easy part. Everyone knows how to sell options. When market is range bounded, both good traders and bad traders make money. Traders without strong risk management actually will make more money. Like in 2012, the S&P500 index didn\u2019t have a big movement compared to 2010 or 2011, and almost every option sellers made nice profit. The only way to distinguish option sellers was when market tanked or had big spikes. It is like what Warren Buffet said: \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201d In order to generate consistent returns over time, you need to focus on risk management. We optimized our program based on risk adjusted return instead of maximum return. We hedge our risk aggressively when we have draw downs -- since big draw downs are not 0 to 1 switch. Big draw downs always followed by smaller draw downs. So you need cut loss aggressively even when you have smaller draw downs. \n\n##My Commentary\n\n\n>Typically sell puts at local bottom, sell calls at local top\n\nThis is probably the hardest part. S&P500 had a huge range in 2016 with a high of 2100 and a low of 1800. The range from the last month isn't as bad at around 2030 to 2100. This week 5/16-5/20 has had a fairly narrow range, opening at 2040 with a high of 2070 and a low of 2020. Large moves aren't actually that common but there are plenty. http://imgur.com/LedTElp\n\n>hedges the portfolio\u2019s Delta/Gamma exposures by taking positions in the S&P500 futures when the portfolio begins to sustain losses of greater than -0.5% of NAV\n\nThis is where the strategy differs from most other premium sellers. I would simply buy the options back and roll or wait for the next trade. One reason for the hedging could be that they're short so many options, it isn't even possible to buy them all back at once. Another possibility is that they're expecting the market to bounce back and the options would still expire worthless even after going in the money.\n\nThe main problem with this type of hedge is the risk of double losses when a whipsaw happens. August 20-30th 2015 was a big whipsaw at a local bottom and caused this fund a large loss. They were probably short puts when the 250 point crash happened, so they went short futures to hedge further down moves. Then the S&P recovered right after they hedged and became net short, leading to another round of huge losses.\n\n>discretionary insight don\u2019t sense any particular\nday offers an attractive risk/reward opportunity\n\nThe premium received from selling 5 delta options averages about 1 dollar credit or $50 per contract (ES futures have 50x multiplier). The losses quickly approach $500-1000 if the S&P500 moves toward your strike. The margin requirement is also pretty bad at around $5000 per contract. Depending on VIX and days to expiration, the distance out of the money of a 5-10 delta option is around 20-50 points. While the chances of the S&P moving 20-50 points and taking you out in 1 day is unlikely, this kind of movement over the course of a week happens fairly often. Positioning after a move has already occurred for the week seems to work a bit better.\n\nIf I were to implement the strategy, I would use call/put spreads and close or roll trades that are tested. My calculations reveal that 10 point wide spreads starting at around 10 delta or 20 points OTM are the most economical.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OCiiROA.png (5 delta put)\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MIorRq6.png (5 delta put with Hedge)\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N3YasAb.png (10 delta spread)\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qibsB0o.png (5 delta spread)\n\n\n##Conclusion\n\nThe strategy works. Smalls gains can be had every week at the expense of taking huge risks. Monitor that risk extremely closely and take small losses when the market goes haywire. The strategy was designed back when the VIX was higher on average and the same premium could be collected at further away strikes. At a lower VIX, the trade entry prices have to be chosen very carefully and will still probably trigger losses a good percentage of the time. The strategy fell apart in August and October 2015 when huge moves occurred that sent the VIX from 14 to 40. The hedging and loss management part of the strategy needs work.\n\n##Sources\n\n* Monthly Returns: http://i.imgur.com/Cob4APl.png (Assets were $300MM until the August 2015 loss that caused investors to withdraw $100MM)\n\n* Interview: http://www.opalesque.com/OFI1357/Short_Volatility_CTA_Discusses_The_Ability_to_Predict357.html\n\n* Full strategy document: http://www.altavra.com/forms/ddocs/globalsigma.pdf\n\n* Website: http://www.globalsigmagroup.com\n\n* Interesting discussion: http://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=168043\n\n* Strategy presentation: http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/302351/file-404430169-pdf/Documents/June_2013_Global_Sigma_Group_Presentation.pdf\n\n* Interview 2: https://efloortradecom.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/cta-intelligence-global-sigma-sept-14.pdf\n\n* Interview 3: http://www.premiacap.com/news/OFI25Jul2013.pdf page 20\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** Permission was not sought and this isn't an advertisement.

Not substantially but 100% noticeable to investors who seem to only care about the subscriber growth numbers. The NUMBER 1 thing investors care about is US sub growth. And this move will bump that number for the few years to come, which is huge in convincing investors to stay on board while Netflix works on it international sub growth by creating localized content.
