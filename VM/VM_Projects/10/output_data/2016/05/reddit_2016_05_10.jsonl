(VZ) and ESPN(DIS) said they have reached a settlement in their yearlong legal dispute over how the sports network is distributed.\n\n>ESPN (DIS), which is majority-owned by Walt Disney Co.(DIS), filed a lawsuit against Verizon(VZ) in April 2015 over so-called \" Custom TV\" packages that the phone giant's FiOS unit had started selling to customers. Those packages allowed people to buy a basic set of channels, including broadcasters and some cable networks, and layer on tiers of channels in genres like sports and kids. At issue was that customers could get a basic package of channels that didn't include ESPN(DIS), which the sports network said violated its contract. ESPN(DIS) had argued that while distributors have the right to exclude its networks in packages, it can't be put into a separate add-on sports tier.\n\n>Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.\n\n>In February, Verizon(VZ) revamped its base packages to include one with sports channels like ESPN(DIS) and one without -- a move widely viewed as an olive branch to ESPN(DIS). A week later, court proceedings in New York Supreme Court were postponed while the companies tried to negotiate a settlement. Verizon(VZ) says uptake for its skinny bundles has increased after modifying the plans.\n\n>The issue of how channels are packaged has been front and center as media companies grapple with pushback from consumers over higher cable bills and competition from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. ESPN(DIS), the most expensive cable network, has been left out of several cheaper channel packages over the years. As more people \"cut the cord\" or downgrade to less-expensive plans, the Disney(DIS) network has experienced subscriber losses that have caught Wall Street's attention.\n\n>Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Bob Iger said in February that the company was in talks with new and existing distribution partners \"to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN(DIS).\" Disney(DIS) is expected to report its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes Tuesday.\n\n>Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["dis", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "What did you pay and are you planning on holding through the day (earnings after close). \n\nI think they will beat.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1.30 and yes", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22102847695350647}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3867854177951813}], "tickers": ["dis"]}

Inc. /MD/ (8.4%) - Vanguard Group Inc. (6.65%) - First Trust Advisors LP (5%) - Blackrock Fund Advisors (3.6%)\n\nFirst off what is RSV?\nRespiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a respiratory virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. Healthy people usually experience mild, cold-like symptoms and recover in a week or two. But RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV is essentially the flu\u2019s lesser known brother and most people will have it at one time in their life (likely mistaking it for the flu). RSV is the most common cause of childhood respiratory infection with a global disease burden of 64 million annual cases and 160k annual deaths. An RSV vaccine would be unimaginably profitable; since it infects mainly the young it is logical to assume that parents would pay any cost to combat and prevent one of the leading causes of childhood hospitalization.\n\nPipe line:\nRSV Vaccine (Older Adults): Phase 3 (Data expected sometime Q3)\nRSV Vaccine (Infants: Maternal Immunization): Phase 3 (Data Expected sometime Q3)\nInfluenza Quadrivalent Seasonal: Negligible compared to RSV\nInfluenza Pandemic: Negligible compared to RSV\nEbola Vaccine: Negligible in profit but proof of concept in expeditious Vaccine Creation\n\nNovavax is a very unique clinical stage biopharma company for a few reasons. They have an 89 million dollar grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, and a 179 million dollar contract from the US Govt. to use their unique technology to develop vaccines. Unlike most clinical startups who partner with a distributer prior to trials Novavax has built up their own infrastructure. In fact, Novavax is still not officially partnered. In their most recent earnings call they heavily hinted that they had been approached by more than one entity and were pleased with how those talks have been progressing. Despite the fact that they refuse to comment on their ongoing PH3 trials there has been some interesting activity. It is reasonable to assume that those at Novavax have some preliminary information regarding their PH3 trials that they are not sharing. \nOn May 3, 2016, the Company entered into a new lease with IP9 1201 Clopper Road, LLC (\u201cLandlord\u201d) for approximately 150,000 square feet of facility space located at 1201 Clopper Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878 (the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d). Under the Lease Agreement, following the rent abatement period discussed below, the annual rent for the premises will be approximately $3.3 million with annual increases of 2.5%. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease Agreement, the Company will receive rental abatement for the premises through November 30, 2017. The Lease Agreement also obligates the Company to pay building operating costs and requires that the Landlord provide the Company with a tenant improvement allowance of $9.6 million. The lease term extends to 2030, unless earlier terminated by the Company in 2026. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Lease Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.4.\nI don\u2019t know about you all but if I was a company in PH3 I would not be leasing a 150,000 sq foot facility if I believed there was any real chance that the drug I was testing would be rejected. The leadership, especially CEO Stanley Erck, all have extensive histories in publically traded companies in the biopharma industry. Chief Medical Officer Louis Fries has a 22 year history of clinical vaccine testing with a focus on the very relevant influenza. President of R&D Dr. Gregory Glenn was medically trained by the army in the Madigan Medical center, specializing in the very relevant field of Pediatrics. Dr Glenn has innumerable scholarly articles and holds multiple patents in the field of vaccine discovery and delivery. Through past positions the management team has connections to Baxter (BAX), and Sanofi (SNY), giving further reason to be confident in their ability to find a suitable distribution partner.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is the stock's price. Last August the stock was at 15$, last month the stock was at 5.60, today the stock is at 4.63. The stock was overhyped. You can look back at old articles and see the insane amount of content written on a security whose main possible source of revenue was still in PH2 clinical trials. Jim Cramer even had a segment on it. They had a 4bn market cap and yet were losing 30 million a quarter. With the most recent earnings report released it was revealed they they had upped their losses to 70 million last quarter, sending the price to what it is now. I expect Novavax to spend more, in fact, I expect them to keep spending more the closer they get to beginning production. The price they are at now is about the price they were at before being thrust into the eyes of the media, which in my opinion is a steal, especially considering between then and now they have been awarded a grant by the BMGF and have progressed into PH3 with very positive PH2 results. \n\nOh yea also you will all be happy to hear that Martin Shkreli said they had interesting RSV data (just check his public investing google drive folder)", "id": "4iq1xy", "created_utc": 1462897885.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for this write up.
