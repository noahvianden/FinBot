{"title": "First stock investment.", "selftext": "So ive finally decided to start pulling the trigger and begin building my portfolio. I don't have lots of disposable income to allocate to stock market investment. I do have enough to begin the process. Was going to go in for 1000 to start. I was thinking about BAC, UA, NVDA, just to start. Then maybe QQQ later on as well as DIS. Starting off small currently. \n\nLet me know what your guys thoughts are.\n\nIf be interested to know if you feel thats a safer long term. 5-10 year holds. Although might have to play the market a bit more for nvidia. \n\nYour input is welcomed,\nPat", "id": "4kj9aw", "created_utc": 1463934604.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah I think those are decent options to go with. I also recently started investing a couple months so my opinion might not be great. However, I do have a few shares in NVDA and slowly I'm continuing to add on. Their future looks promising due to their new GPU, involvement with Tesla/Apple and the rising virtual reality world. It might come down through all the hype but once sales come through for the new released GPUs, I think it'll rise even more. Definitely a hold long term. Good luck!
