It did take quite awhile for it to move after the initial switch to contango.\n\nBut I was thinking that when VIX spot gets under 12 it's not a bad play to look for some increase in vol play. Just like when it gets above 25 it's time to start selling vol.\n\nI truly think after years of doing this using writing long dated naked calls on UVXY,  futures calendar spreads and buying calls on SVXY, that you only need to hit some good set ups once every two years and you don't need to trade anything else.\n\nI'm not sure anyone else agrees with me because people want to trade more frequently rather than just be patient and wait for the market to come to you.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, October was .50 higher than November. They were both around 24 at the time. I used interactive brokers and so I took a position at -$500 per contract where I counted on Oct falling faster than November so that it would return to contango. I got out by the end of August because I didn't want the risk inherent with dealing with September, FOMC and October moving close to front month. Got out at +$1,050 per contract which wasn't the high but as I said it became a time sensitive decision. I'd definitely look to do this again depending on margin impact vs. selling longer dated UVXY calls after a spike.
