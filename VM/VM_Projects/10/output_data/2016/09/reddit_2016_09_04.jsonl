Anything market related that you think might be worth sharing in here for the new week!\n\nI'll kick things off first with some market news/articles/etc to get you ready for the trading week ahead... Hope the reddit formatting of this post comes out okay lol\n\n## **WEEK AHEAD: Time to get back to business and give that jobs report a 'rethink''** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/02/week-ahead-time-to-get-back-to-business-and-give-that-jobs-report-a-rethink.html)*\n\n*****\n\n> ### With not much on the calendar, market focus in the week ahead will move to things like the price of oil, a few economic reports and whatever the winds blow in from overseas.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### August's jobs report Friday was a disappointment with 151,000 nonfarm payrolls, 30,000 fewer than expected, and many traders took it as a sign the Fed won't be hiking rates this month. That was an immediate positive for stocks, which ended the week slightly higher. \n> &nbsp;\n> ### But it also keeps the market focus firmly on data, after jobs data missed forecasts and the U.S. ISM manufacturing survey showed a shocking contraction in activity. The ISM services data is released Tuesday and is seen as the key data for a week that also includes Wednesday's Fed Beige Book release and JOLTS, jobs turnover data, and Friday's wholesale trade.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Over the long Labor Day weekend, China releases services PMI data, and Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda speaks Monday. Central banks will be a big theme in September, with the European Central Bank meeting Thursday. The Bank of Japan and the Fed both meet on Sept. 20 and 21.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### But for the U.S., the coming week could be a relatively quiet one with just two Fed speakers \u2014 San Francisco Fed President John Williams on Tuesday evening and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren Friday morning.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"We've kind of run out of wait-and-see moments,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, referring to the market anticipation around the late August Jackson Hole Fed symposium and Friday's August employment reports.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### \"Look out for a rethink with much higher market participation. On the jobs number, what does it actually mean when we have the players back on the field,\" he said.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### Just the arrival of September signals a higher level of activity in the markets now that the late summer doldrums are over, and analysts have said that could bring more volatility. \n> &nbsp;\n> ### Wall Street is closed Monday, but it could literally be buffeted by hurricane force winds as Hermine makes its way up the East Coast, and it was expected to send high waves to East Coast beaches.\n> &nbsp;\n> ### But volatility in the markets may be slow in making a comeback once September trading gets underway. On Friday, the CBOE's VIX traded below 12. The Volatility Index was last this low on Aug. 23.\n\n([CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL ARTICLE!](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/02/week-ahead-time-to-get-back-to-business-and-give-that-jobs-report-a-rethink.html))\n\n*****\n\n## **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEATMAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](http://finviz.com/publish/090216/sec_w1_172322702.png))\n\n### **Bird's Eye View of the Markets on Friday:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL FUTURES MAP FROM FRIDAY!](http://i.imgur.com/jeFjlT3.png))\n\n#### **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](http://i.imgur.com/hLcnVQv.png))\n\n##### **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=635606603031423800))\n\n## **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/AQ1AG0I.png))\n\n### **Major U.S. Markets Comparison Chart Year-to-Date:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/7u6ijRC.png))\n\n#### **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://i.imgur.com/CG5HyTM.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Trader's Almanac: Day After Labor Day Bullish**\n\n>In the last 21 years, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have all registered average gains of around 0.5% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up four years in a row however, DJIA and S&P 500 have been down in four of the last six years. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.14%. NASDAQ is worst, up only 47.6% of the time with an average loss of 0.13%.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/5a628e658b6a7bac5a0cafb276b64398/tumblr_inline_ocvv52jWhr1spdppr_500.jpg))\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Trader's Almanac: September is Worst Performing Month of the Year for Markets**\n\n> Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same timeframe.\n\n> September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.7% average gains respectively in the last nine election year Septembers.\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://67.media.tumblr.com/ec8cdb27f6c154af3fbfc1a44c7ca9a0/tumblr_inline_ochb6opOfl1spdppr_400.jpg))\n\n> Although the month has opened strong 13 of the last 21 years, once tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to clean house as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (Dow: -11.1%) and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (Dow: -6.0%). Solid September gains in 2010; DJIA\u2019s 7.7%, S&P 500\u2019s 8.8% were the best since 1939, but the month suffered nearly the same magnitude declines in 2011, confirming that September can be a volatile month.\n\n*****\n\n# **Stock Market Technical Analysis Video for Week Ending 9.2.16** \n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaJZQYO7USk))\n\n# **/u/ghostofgbt Chart Analysis from r/StockMarket User Requests:**\n\n> *TSLA, T, BABA, CMG, PSG, UA, NVDA, GOOD, DG, FN, NXPI, HPE, ACIA*\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiKmp0XsY-8))\n\n# **ER due out in the holiday-shortened week ahead:** \n\n> *$KR $HPE $PLAY $MRVL $HQY $HDS $VAL $RH $BKS $HOFT $NX $MBUU $SAIC $FRAN*\n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](http://i.imgur.com/6kGRhKA.jpg))\n\n# **Globex Labor Day Holiday Schedule** \n\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR GLOBEX LABOR DAY SCHEDULE!](http://i.imgur.com/qIF0v4e.png))\n\n*****\n\nLet's see how this thread does this week!
