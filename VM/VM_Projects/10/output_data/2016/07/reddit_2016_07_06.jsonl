Only 9%, 10%, and 8% of Facebook, Google, and YouTube advertisers plan to cut their ad spend; for Twitter, the number is 23%.\" and \"Mahaney states Twitter, which provided soft Q1 guidance last month, \"generally had the weakest results with respect to advertiser budget allocation, expected future spend, and general satisfaction.\" Meanwhile, a record 45% of survey respondents showed an interest in advertising on Snpachat (Private:CHAT), which is reportedly aiming for 2016 revenue of $300M-$350M.\" (http://seekingalpha.com/news/3166058-rbc-google-facebook-dominant-ever-online-advertising-updated)\n\nYou're thinking of Twitter from the standpoint of they have a large user base now so why wouldn't they be around years from now.  You're thinking about it as if Twitter is in an industry by itself and that other services can't take both user attention and advertising dollars. If Twitter had great management, that would be one thing but the problem is it doesn't; every day that goes by where Twitter isn't living up to its full potential is a day where other services are taking advantage. If this continues for a while longer, Twitter could face a snowballing issue as erosion could pick up and they're not profitable as it is (and beyond that, miss estimates quarter after quarter) already. If it gets to that point, then things could turn ugly for Twitter.\n\nHere's the other thing: I guess I don't understand even thinking about stuff that has destroyed so much shareholder value like Twitter because there's so many quality companies that I can invest in, why would I put my hard earned money in a poorly managed POS like Twitter? People have to value quality management and if you're considering Twitter than you are not doing so. This goes back to the idea that Reddit needs to expand its investable universe. Things like Twitter and GoPro shouldn't even be discussed; there's so many great companies in the world that have done tremendously well for shareholders over time that it's baffling to me that garbage like Twitter and GoPro is discussed as much as it is. The only reason I can think of is because people on r/stocks are young and basically not willing to go beyond the universe of companies that they are aware of - and that's too bad. ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It's not frowned upon perhaps as much as I think eventually you have to be able to separate the idea that you like a product from whether it is a good investment or not. You really do have to be able to analyze a company that you're going to be potentially investing a lot of money in. \n\n\nI really don't have much interest in social media, so while Facebook has been considerably successful, it just doesn't even really get on my radar (and that's just me; I'd rather own data center REITs and own the \"infrastructure of data\" in an era where data demand is increasing exponentially and get both growth and a nice dividend yield.) To me, I look at the data center REITs and see a \"growth and income\" play that benefits from increasing social media, increasing video demand, increasing e-commerce and more. So for me I can not be interested in investing in social media but can come at the broader theme of data demand via data center REITs in a manner that allows me to take advantage of the theme and get both growth and income.\n\nNetflix has done very well, but there is the idea that at some point - given the nature of the service - there is a saturation point down the road. They can raise prices and look at other avenues, but for me it really becomes I don't think it's appealing at this valuation and it's not something that really interests me in a broader sense. I may miss it if it goes further but I'm okay with that. If I'm going to have to pick a stock trading at sky-high valuations I'd rather Amazon with its continued expansion in a world where too many B & M retailers have more or less stuck their head in the sand and hoped Amazon would go away. Now it's not only clear that Amazon isn't going away, but I think we've reached the tipping point where you're going to see an over-retailed US have to face the idea that stores like the Gap and Kohl's and others don't need nearly the kind of store count that they have. And Sears will be gone within the the year, probably.\n\nUnder Armour is a very good company, although I think $100 in a couple of years is unrealistic. For me it goes back to the idea that I like to \"get and forget\" to some degree and feel comfortable with letting investments go on autopilot. So in this case I'd lean towards Nike. \n\nSo I don't think these are \"bad\" companies, but when you discuss valuation, none of them are \"cheap\" or really reasonably priced, especially Netflix. You also have to keep in mind that if there is a real downturn, aggressive growth stocks are going to head South and may do so in a significant way. You have to really explore your own risk tolerance and whether or not you're going to be stressed/panicked/etc if we have another period like Jan/Feb and these are down 10% (or more) real quick.\n\n \"You say: \n\"I have 10-12k that I don't need access to in the near future. \"\n\nWhat happens if you put a lot money into volatile stocks and the market goes down a lot in the \"near future\" (and that is kind of vague; what is your time horizon?)\n\nThe other thought is that if you are not going to dig deeper into investing and focus on what you are interested in, perhaps an idea is to invest in indexes instead, although I understand that's not nearly as fun or enjoyable. \n\nWould I invest in any of these? Honestly no, but I think my interests and the kind of investments that I'm looking for are different. I own some tech, but also a lot of real estate, agriculture, and other sectors. Not everything I own pays a dividend but most do from the standpoint of if I'm going to own companies long-term, I like the idea of automatic reinvestment of dividends all along the way and compounding interest. I own tech, but I also own things like Ecolab (ECL), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Fiserv (FISV) and Danaher (DHR). These are quality companies with demonstrated success over the *long* haul. There are a number of others, but those are a few examples.\n\nWith $15K, I think you also have some room to diversify a bit further and look at perhaps 5 names instead of 3. I also wouldn't just buy everything you're going to buy at once.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Personally, I don't think there's one right answer in terms of \"how much of something should I buy.\" The one thing that I wouldn't do - and isn't an issue in this case, it seems - is buy one or two of something. You occasionally see people on here buy 3 shares of something for $20 and pay a $9.99 commission, which is much of the value of the purchase. A lot of people use Robinhood, but occasionally someone isn't.\n\nEither way, in your case when you are looking at $15K, you mentioned 3 companies. Some people may not agree with me (and that's fine), I can see $15 being split between 5-7 companies. \n\nThe issue that I have with saving up for a house if you're in Canada is that you're in one of the most expensive housing markets on the planet. There was that game not that long ago online about the Canadian housing market, \"Crack Shack or Mansion\", where run down houses were revealed to cost astronomical sums of money. \n\nSo I think it's a good idea for you to save up with the view towards getting a house down the road but the issue really becomes where's the top in the Canadian housing market (something that many people have tried to time in recent years but it keeps going onwards) and being prepared for the eventual other side of that (and when that is, who knows.)\n\nMy broad view on investing is that it's a marathon and - to a reasonable degree - people have to pace themselves accordingly. I'd rather consistently get singles, doubles and the occasional triple than continually try to swing at every pitch and whiff. My portfolio isn't boring, but the risk is well-considered and well-researched and risk that I feel very comfortable with. I also get dividends on nearly everything that are automatically reinvested. It's nice to continually see a bit more of this and some more of that as dividends come in and are reinvested without me having to do anything. As more shares come in over time, you're getting dividends on more and more shares. So, to me, there's a real appeal to to dividends, especially when you're owning something with a longer-term viewpoint. \n\nREITs = Real Estate Investment Trusts. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp\n\nREITs can invest in many different sectors, from data centers to offices to cell towers to malls to even things like outdoor advertising spaces. REITs are a good choice for income, but the issue in this day and age is that everyone is looking for yield in a world of ultra-low interest rates, so REITs aren't cheap and it's a crowded trade. Data Center REITs are something that I think is a great long-term story, but I don't think it's prudent to buy more here. Still, if rates go lower, you're going to see demand for things like REITs continue. Still, when you get something like that that's really crowded (everyone wants yield, so they bid up things like staples and REITs and utilities), the more crowded it gets the more significant the eventual pullback becomes. There's a lot of great REITs and while the data center REITs are a good long-term idea, I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending them at these levels (and that doesn't mean they can't go higher, just that I would only feel comfortable recommending them and adding to them after a pullback.)\n\nFor you, the question also becomes how you want to look at your portfolio. If you just want *some* exposure to FB/UA/NFLX long-term, that doesn't mean that they have to be the bulk of your portfolio. Again, these aren't names that I'm interested in/would buy here, but if you are going to get them either way, then you can almost view them as a portfolio within a portfolio. Maybe you devote $5K to FB/NFLX/UA and devote 10K to creating a more stable, long-term core portfolio, looking at names like Danaher (DHR), 3M (MMM), Ecolab (ECL), Canadian National Railway/Canadian Pacific or others. I'm not necessarily recommending those (although I own some of them), but trying to give you an idea of the *kinds* of names that may make up the 10K core portfolio. There's really a lot of ways you can go about constructing your porfolio and there's not one right way to go about it; you can be creative. You can also mix broad funds with individual names.  I do own some actively managed mutual funds along with a lot of individual names. \n\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx", "mmm", "mmm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03622809052467346}], "tickers": ["amzn", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024454601109027863}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024454601109027863}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.01707989163696766}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22414767742156982}, {"body": "Those are terrible picks IMO.
