If you're going to sell, that's fine, but panic doesn't help anyone. You will inevitably puke your shares up right before the market makes a bounce that is a better place to sell into.  If you're going to sell, sell thoughtfully and carefully.\n\nIf you're going to buy, don't just go all in because you think that the market is down so therefore it must be cheap. It can go lower. You do not have to buy all at once for things that you plan to own for a long time. If you just pile in, you now have no flexibility, because you've piled all in. Or you can just sit and wait and hope that you will get a better pitch a week, a month, three months from now. But, if you're panicking and going, \"F this\", you will miss opportunities. TREE down 30% the other day for no apparent reason was a great opportunity. There are going to be other things like that, and maybe they can be played for short-term moves, maybe they are things you want to start a long-term position in, who knows. But if you freak out and just go, \"I'm out\", then you will miss opportunities.\n\nLastly, in terms of the \"I'm going to sell and then buy back later when it's lower\", people often are not good market timers. If the market reverses and ramps higher, they will chase it after selling. Or if the market goes lower in an abrupt way, they won't buy because they'll be too concerned to get back in. People want a pullback, then when they get it, they often flee.\n\nPS: 10% corrections used to be not unheard of. The \"rising tide lifts all boats\" of the last several years has resulted in a mentality that the market is broken when it goes down, but when the market goes down more than a few percent, people conclude that it is \"another 2008.\" It's not a healthy mentality. No one here is saying that \"don't take things seriously.\" Do evaluate the world economy in a thoughtful manner. But the whole thing that every pullback is a crisis is I think because the last 5-6 years has made people complacent. Lastly, I think a lot of people have more risk than they can tolerate, and while that's been very nice for the last 5-6 years, YTD has made a lot of people aware of this.\n\nThe general idea is to have a clear view and a plan whether you are buying or selling.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Cool, thanks for the well-thought out response. I was just trying to understand where you're coming from and I completely agree. I just think there are people in specific circumstances such as retirement eligible investors who may be a bit more worried than the long-term investors. I don't think we can lump everyone into the same category, and agree that each person should have their own individual plan. Which brings me back to my original point that some people should be taking the 10% hit very seriously.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Which brings me back to my original point that some people should be taking the 10% hit very seriously.\n\nIf you're in retirement age, should you be in so much risk that you take a market-like decline during this period in the first place? What if it was worse? What if this year was a 20% decline? What if there was a crash like the morning last August when the market opened down a thousand points and it didn't come right back like it did that day. If you're in a situation where you are retired and/or need money for whatever reason, then you have to be well aware of your level of risk and maintain a very appropriate level of risk.\n\nA core philosophy of mine is that people have to know who they are, their goals, their strengths/weaknesses, etc and apply that to investing. You should not be compelled to take a lot of risk as a retiree because inevitably this kind of thing is going to happen. If someone's a great trader, great - the volatility is going to offer opportunities. If you're a long-term investor, be patient and wait for opportunities, don't try to swing at every pitch. If you realize that you've taken on too much risk after what's happened YTD and you weren't aware because everything seemed great the last 5-6 years, then okay, sell until you can sleep well at night, but don't just puke everything up. If you're going to sell, sell in a thoughtful/strategic fashion.\n\nAgain, I think the last 5-6 years of QEs and \"rising tide lifts all boats\" made people complacent and I think many took on more risk than they can handle. If someone is sitting there right now going, \"Holy Fuck\" after what's happened this year, then that's telling you you took on more risk than you are comfortable with and to adjust accordingly.

If you are in something that took a major hit YTD, then I have to question whether it falls under the definition of \"conservative and boring\". A retired person that has a lot in bonds - take Jeff Gundlach's Doubleline TR fund for example, which is +1% YTD - has had probably had that portion of their portfolio (which should be a lot of your portfolio if you're retired) hold up quite well in comparison to the equity market.\n\nThere are plenty of boring mutual funds that have stock exposure, there's long/short funds, there's alternatives. Some managed futures funds are +mid-to-high single digit %'s YTD. There's so many products, so many bonds, so many funds, so many whatevers for whatever your age and risk tolerance is.\n\nI still go back to the idea that if the market is down 10% and you a retired person and you are down 8-9-10+%, then you should realize that you have a problem with too much risk and to learn from that and adjust until you reach a level that is appropriate for your age.

All I'm saying is, don't panic and puke up everything because most people are inevitably going to puke up their holdings at the worst point like on a day like a few days ago when the market was down nearly 600 points and people were like \"F this\" and just got out...right before you got a rally. If you think it's 2008 again and you want to sell, that's absolutely fine but pick your spots - days like today are an opportunity, you may get more - and I hope you time getting back in perfectly. \n\n\"But we are also due for a much larger correction in the near future, which isn't a matter of \"if\" but \"when\". \"\n\nI don't know anything for sure. I do think that there could absolutely be a larger correction and I'd be happy because it would mean I can add here and there to things that I want to own for multiple years. The Fed could do full NIRP if things got bad enough. We could have more QE. The Sun could go supernova. Aliens could invade. Yellen might fart and the market will take that as a bad sign. Or we might just muddle along. \n\n\"But we also know we are currently sitting on a market bubble.\"\n\nThere are people who are so black or white about investing. I absolutely think that if one bothers to really look around, there are some very good values in this market if one has a longer-term time horizon. There are some very good opportunities - I mentioned the ridiculous panic selling in TREE recently. But if someone's just going to say, \"Well, everything's a bubble\", then you're not going to bother to look for opportunities as they appear. If someone's going to paint the market as \"a bubble\" across the board and just not bother to look around at all, then that's their choice.\n\nDo I think that years of ZIRP and QE are going to end well? Probably not, but I'm not so sure that the Fed won't go \"next level\" if it gets to that point and there are themes that I want to own longer-term and I'm not going to time. I don't know that the next crisis is going to look exactly like the last one - and that's something that I consider often. **I can say that I don't think the era of ZIRP and QE will end well or that everything in the economy is awesome, but at the same time think that there are some themes going on in the global economy that are tremendously compelling and that I want to be invested in.** \n\nI am not an optimist by nature and fall firmly in the realist camp. **I'm not the person that is sunshine and rainbows and telling everyone that everything in the economy is fucking wonderful.** Yet, I'm not going to sit here and panic, either and say that a 10% decline automatically means another 2008 is upon us. I will evaluate things as they happen in regards to the global economy. I will be.... sensible? Yeah, I think that's a good word for it.\n\nAs I've said above: do what you're going to do: if you're going to sell, sell.
