Banks wanted mortgages. Investors wanted mortgage backed securities (shares in a big bundle of mortgages). To fill the popular demand for mortgage backed securities, lenders handed out mortgages to people who werent making enough money to properly qualify for them, or at rates people couldnt realistically afford. Everyone got their houses, and the banks bundled the mortgages and sold them as investment deals to bigger banks. \n\nEventually, the unqualified people who couldnt make the payments on the houses they bought stopped paying at all. this meant that their mortgages were essentially worth zero money, but those mortgages had already been sold to investment banks. Think of it like buying an unopened box that you are told is full of money, then coming to the realization that it isnt. Now your goal is to get someone else to buy the box from you before they open it and realizing the money is gone. Wallstreet played a very fast game of hot potato with those boxes of (not) money, and the ones stuck finally opening the box had to admit they gave up all their money for an empty box. \n\nNow the best bit! Instead of letting those companies fail, the government stepped in and used taxpayer money to fill all the boxes back up. This is the part that tends to get glossed over or misrepresented the most. your tax money did not go to bail some poor guy out of a house he couldnt afford. that guy lost his house. your tax money went to bail a rich guy out of bad gambling debts (most stock market products are simply a fancy way of betting whether the value of something goes up or down). yet somehow, after all of this, only one person went to jail, and we have not changed any regulations to prevent this from happening again. \n", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Well wow, that sucks...

Other banks bought these crap mortgages, but they didn't do their research on what they were buying, and instead trusted the rating agencies.

The companies that sold the insurance priced it cheaply because they also believed the rating agencies without doing their homework. Everybody bought the insurance because it was cheap. Eventually too many mortgages defaulted. Everybody was stunned and went to collect the insurance, but the insurance company couldn't pay out everybody and went bankrupt. That left lots of companies holding crap mortgages with no recourse. Many of these companies who got shafted on the insurance either went bankrupt or came very close to it.
