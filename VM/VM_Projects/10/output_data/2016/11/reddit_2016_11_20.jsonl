For example, short 105 call & long 107 call.\n\nA different example, sell to open XYZ Dec 1125/1120 Put @ 1.40 credit. Since it's a credit spread, envision the iron condor again and remember the left side is a short put spread, so you're going to long the lower 1120 put & short the higher 1125 put.\n\nAnother example, sell to open XYZ Dec 35/36 Call @ 0.30 credit. So you know it's a credit spread, but how do you know which one is long and which is short?
