SNE is a cyclical play and they have a start of a new cycle called 4k ultra hd.  They could replace blue-ray.  SNE typically wins due to content and no one is competing on that forefront.  There will be increased sales due to a slow adoption to buying 4k televisions and movies.  What they need to successfully do is use their content in a strategic way to get people to adopt 4k.   \n\nMSFT has already appreciated its growth.  The only way for them to grow is to either focus on their niche PC content - which they have lacked and just copied apple.  They were smart to make PCs match their phones though.  I would hold MSFT for the next few months though.  They look like they are wanting to turn into a downtrend.  Right now I would hold the stock.  Their biggest issue right now is getting people to adopt their phones.  Main reason is that the games, movies, music are all on everyone's current phones and they could lose them if they switch.  Getting someone to switch now has become near difficult.  They need to offer credits to their windows store instead of offering price drops on their phones, tablets, and PCs.  If they drop the price, no one will still buy it.  If they market it as a way to get for example 100 dollars in credits to buy in the windows store, it will allow them to be able to market it as a way to buy the content that they would want to keep like their core music as well as their core apps.  They would also be able to explore their library.  Most people only care about a core amount of apps.  If they can get people to adopt their phones, then they could be successful and be in the runnings of above Apple valuation.  Apple's audio jack and samsung's note has provided an opportunity for them or pixel with google. I do not think they can do anything to get people to churn over to Microsoft's live tiles though.  They are a great dividend stock like JNJ is though.  I expect the dividend to increase 10 times what it is now.  Appreciation may stay the same or increase to be in line of about 6%.
