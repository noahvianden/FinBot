{"title": "Diversifying with low amount of money?", "selftext": "I have about $8000 worth of stocks, and I'm realizing that 75% of my stocks are in Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon.

That position could potentially get smaller and smaller as you add more different investments to your portfolio. It really depends on how much and how quickly you plan to add. \n\nA lot of people underestimate diversification. Look at what's going on with Bill Ackman and Valeant.
