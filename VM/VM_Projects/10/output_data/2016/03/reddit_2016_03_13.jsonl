{"title": "Lucrative investment idea for this week", "selftext": "**Summary**\nSo the other day I was reading up on sick equity strats, but then noticed [something peculiar](https://gyazo.com/8db62096457358f77174d2d4cc0f87cc).\n\n\nIndeed, Howard Marks was trying to tell me something.  In this industry, you got to know how to jack this shit and play it rough.  Green, get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all.\n\n\n**Screening Process**\nI took it as a sign to engage in a volatile, risk-on highly aggressive growth strategy and prompty ran an according screen.  I looked for companies with good growth potential, valuation, management, cash flow, balance sheet, competitive advantage, technicals, oh and trading at a steep discount to intrinsic value.\n\n\n**Company Overview**\nI came upon Puring Tarmaceuticals, a biopharmatech company that trades like a staples company, but the market is unaware that Puring Tarma is an energy-tech industrilumminications GICS sector-hybrid, which should warrant a higher multiple.\n\n\n**Financials**\nTrading at only .69 backward-looking inflation [adjusted](https://gyazo.com/8adbf771394caf7ad8bed244313332ff) ttm rolling forward TEV/EBITDARAXWSB, and with 13.37% QoY growth in their 3D-printed cloud security drone-delivered cocaine drug segment (Yttrium Osmium Lithium Oxide), it is clear the market values this company less than I value my time writing this retarded post.  And by that I mean this shit is cheap.\n\n\nThe company should see strong top line revenue growth due to spiking sizes in their end markets, particularly yacht owners (I predict this will occur due to higher discretionary income for the demographic due to an elephant bull pattern I have appropriately identified [here](https://gyazo.com/aacd6177fba203102d4ff5fe8570e63d)).\n\n\nAdditionally, the company was recently upgraded by [Wu Tang Financial](https://gyazo.com/bbee960f3e22f99bab453cdf378ce41e) (their research franchise is a powerhouse).\n\n\nI utilized a [discounted cash flow model](https://gyazo.com/9b8b75dbed5b9d0f26ec7bcc2e7e0146) and [other sophisticated valuation methodologies](https://gyazo.com/48cd4998f0dca5c7a70896ce3690d5e5) which showed this company is dirt cheap.
