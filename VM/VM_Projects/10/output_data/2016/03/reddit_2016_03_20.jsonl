{"title": "Yet Another MNKD Shitpost - Medical Edition", "selftext": "So MannKind corp is selling their inhaled insulin (Afreeza) beginning April 5th or so, after Sanofi or whoever terminated their agreement after poor sales. Many would argue that Sanofi mismanaged it at best or sabotaged it at worst. I honestly don't care, but as someone with Asthma and with family that works in asthma care, and with friends who are diabetic, I as curious as to a) the efficacy compared to subcutaneous insulin, b) the ease of use compared to subcutaneous insulin, and c) short/long term effects on pulmonary function.\n\nSince you're all retards I'll define some terms here:\n\nsubcutaneous - Below the skin. Typical insulin injections are not the same as your average vaccine or other shot, which are applied much deeper; insulin shots are applied directly under the skin and are thus much easier. There's already a number of automated systems for this.\n\nPulmonary function - lung function, as it relates to breathing and ability to cycle blood to the heart. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) are the primary way of testing for asthma, and hopefully any drug that involves inhaling powder would have similar testing done at least in the short term.\n\nSome studies for you to not read:\n\nMany of these relate to Exubera, Pfizer's failed inhaled insulin product, which was similar (albeit in a much larger form).\n\nPfizer's commissioned study about efficacy and ease of use of Exubera: http://www.sugarnancy.com/articles/ART0021.pdf\n\nRelevant to this is one paragraph in their conclusion:\n\n>In conclusion, the results from this 24-week study suggest that inhaled insulin is effective and well tolerated in patients with type 1 diabetes. Combined with a single nighttime injection of longacting insulin, preprandial inhaled insulin provided glycemic control comparable to that with a conventional subcutaneous insulin regimen with improved postprandial control. Thus, the use of inhaled insulin allowed the number of insulin injections to be minimized to just a single daily injection without compromising glycemic control, while adding increased flexibility of meal-related dosing. As a consequence, inhaled insulin was associated with improved patient satisfaction and quality of life\u2014this may have important implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing acceptance of intensive insulin regimens. Inhaled insulin may, therefore, be a valuable noninvasive component of therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\nSounds awesome. It apparently leads to a higher quality of life, and with just one nighttime injection, you have the same level of glycemic control as if you had been shooting up all day.\n\nEffect on pulmonary function on people with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of Afreeza's brand of inhaled insulin (rather than Exubera): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20804443\n\nThe conclusion of this is that there wasn't a short term effect, but that longer term studies were needed in order to actually draw some kind of conclusion. I couldn't find any.\n\nSo, why did it fail? Relevant article from the NIH: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769732/\n\nI encourage everyone long or short MNKD to give this a read,  as it portrays the lessons from the failures of Exubera from a number of perspectives. I'll summarize the important ones since none of you are going to read this:\n\nPatients: Wanted something that is discreet (as needles aren't), Exubera failed as it's pretty large. Pfizer should have had more targeted advertising (e.g. in elderly patients where dosing issues aren't as much of a problem, or obese type-2 diabetics where subcutaneous injections take longer to work). \n\nUntalked about here (as it had not been invented yet) was the automatic insulin pump, which attaches to your body and automatically injects insulin, which meets the discretion need at least. I'm not going to touch marketing as that's a tossup (and I don't know if it's more effective than injections for the markets discussed here).\n\nDiabetologists: Had concerns if this product was better than injections or just a \"toy\". Interesting point about the studies (e.g. the one previously linked) brought up as well:\n\n>While all these efforts helped fulfill the requirements of the approval procedure, many diabetologists were not happy with these studies. Without going too much into detail, the point was raised if the RCTs performed were adequate tools to evaluate the medical benefit of Exubera when it came to its usage in daily practice. For RCTs, patients are selected according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and such studies are usually performed by highly motivated and trained centers. Thereby, the patients recruited for RCTs quite often do not mirror the patients that are treated in daily practice. Attempts were made to set up adequately designed studies addressing these aspects in the format of so-called \u201creal world studies.\u201d However, it turned out to be difficult to design such studies in a manner that brought reality into the format of a clinical study while still fulfilling the expectations raised correctly by evidence-based medicine toward the data quality and robustness of the outcomes of such studies.\n\ntl;dr: The studies had a selection bias towards people who would not have issues complying with regimens, and therefore isn't the reality, and additionally studies that attempted to alleviate this were difficult to design.\n\nPharm industry: Cost was a big reason Exubera failed. In addition to R&D, the low bioavailability of inhaled insulin led to the need for roughly 5x more to be inhaled, which led to increased costs. I personally don't know if Afreeza's brand of insulin is better about this (and by how much), but I can't imagine it being as effective as shots, and therefore a similar issue may be lurking (and Sanofi may have seen this coming).\n\nPoliticians: Interesting note from the article\n\n>In view of the unbelievable amount of money that is spent for diabetes therapy each and every year worldwide\u2014currently it was reported that the costs for diabetes therapy were already drastically higher in the United States than anticipated until recently\u2014one should not only try to cut down the costs for diagnostic and therapeutic measures in a more reflex wise manner, but to analyze adequately which measures are the best to counteract the incredible economical burden. However, one should not be surprised if measures such as lifestyle interventions instead of a novel insulin formulation have a more positive outcome in such calculations.\n\ntl;dr: politicians care about costs (even moreso now than in 2008 when this was published), and though the cost of diabetic treatment is insanely high, lifestyle changes are much more cost effective and likely to get support vs. novel (and more expensive) drugs.\n\nThe article additionally in its conclusion discusses forward looking thoughts about what would become Afreeza, with hope about it's ability to act faster. This was eventually found to be true, and the major advantage over Exubera (it's also smaller, but I'd argue that's not a big deal).\n\nI've written a lot at this point, mostly because I'm bored and waiting for St. Joe's to play tonight, but my perspective is this: Exubera had a lot of issues for a lot of reasons, and I'm not convinced that MannKind has solved all of these problems. Additionally, since Exubera failed, there's been a lot of other developments in insulin application, and more backlash against higher cost treatments. \n\nWe don't know what Sanofi did for Afreeza, whether it failed to market it properly or even sandbagged it, that will come out in the coming months, and we don't know whether or not patients will like inhaled insulin better the second time around, or if Afreeza's marketing campaign will be better. \n\nThe company is worth just south of a billion with a finished product, and I'll let the finance nerds figure out what kind of revenues they'd need in order to be successful. I'm highly skeptical at this point, however, given what I've found researching this.", "id": "4b9ijg", "created_utc": 1458511317.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Disclaimer: No position in MNKD.
