{"title": "Earnings Season", "selftext": "Earnings \"season\" kicks off on Monday with Alcoa. Many notable names are banks (BAC, JPM, WFC) this week. The CBOE blog has a list every week.\n\nhttp://www.cboeoptionshub.com/\n\nThere are any number of strategies. Some go directional, some are delta neutral, some are long premium, some are short premium. Some try to play the ramp up in vol ahead of earnings and get out before the news. All of these are viable, and all can make or lose money.\n\nI often like to take a few small positions, but mostly watch the news roll out. Then trade off support and resistance on the chart, and tape action. Yes, there tends to be less premium after the news is out, but at that point the news is known.\n\nI often say there are cycles. That some cycles the premium sellers win, some they lose. It often cycles back and forth. \n\nSomeone at the local stock market meetup did an intensive powerpoint presentation on how deep he dug. He'd check the last eight earnings moves for that underlying, the chart, the institutional ownership, the direction of current earnings estimates, and more. Wow, puts me to shame. Mostly, I mark it on the calendar, check the chart, maybe look at one or two prior moves, and then maybe take a small position (usually selling premium). \n\nThere are any number of ways to make or lose money. I always suggest going in with eyes open. If you have a position, or are considering a position, find out when earnings are due out. Using Google will give the answer on the more active underlyings (search on AAPL earnings date, leads me to site that says 4/25/16).\n\nOkay, tell me what strategies you like to trade. Perhaps any tickers and dates you have already marked on your calendar. WFC is a stock I've traded before. Wells Fargo bank usually isn't a big mover, and premiums tend to be small, but it has made me money in the past. For WFC, I would tend to wait until earnings are out, unless premiums are big enough to sell some way out of the money premium.\n", "id": "4e2921", "created_utc": 1460224532.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "I bought two AAPL calls but will dump it before earnings report.
