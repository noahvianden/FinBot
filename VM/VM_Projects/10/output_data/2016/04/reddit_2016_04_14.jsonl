However, I do have concerns about them on two fronts. First, competition from other media producers who are looking for a piece of that streaming pie. \n\nSecond, media producers hate Netflix and have been less willing to sell streaming rights to Netflix on favourable terms. While Netflix is attempting to counteract this by producing their own content, this can only go so far.  Lately, we've seen the effects production companies can have on Netflix, as we've seen its catalogue grow smaller. Furthermore, these production companies are often owned by ISP and Cable companies who want to harm Netflix more than anything. \n\nFor these reasons, I believe Netflix is not a sure bet.

{"title": "Making a buy or sell order with a ridiculous limit", "selftext": "Just a theory: I wonder if a person could buy or sell a stock with a ridiculous limit on it, so that somebody else who just makes a market order would end up paying your limit.\n\nFor example, let's say I buy 10 shares of AAPL @ $100. Then I put in a sale order with a limit of $200. Assuming there are no other sale orders open, is it possible that somebody else might make a market purchase order and have the order fulfilled at my $200?\n\nPerhaps AAPL is a bad example because it would likely have to be a stock that is not very liquid at all.
