Plus hype?\n\n$AMTD or $TD - Depending on whether you think holdings or banks will do better, or both, TD Bank has a great business with good dividends and less risk than American banks. AMTD has increased +24.3% in the last 30 days due to market increase and thinkorswim innovations. The Scottrade acquisition will also provide more overall national exposure and revenue. Either company will see great returns next year.\n\n$WDC - Powerhouse company for data storage implementing new technologies in the coming years. With the latest acquisition of Sandisk, and the ever-growing computing sector, WDC stands to be a forerunner for the market share.\n\n$KTOS - After a few years of stalled performance, KTOS is finally acquiring new contracts with the military for drone operations. With the Trump presidency and Republican gov't, we will most likely see a more laxed policy in regards to defense and the usage of drones. KTOS also just released a secondary PO that, since its offering, has a 28.5% increase in value.\n\n$AKS - Pretty much the same deal as $KTOS. Lulled company that is going to break through new thresholds under a Trump presidency. Their recent ER was mixed with a better EPS than predicted, but less overall revenue. However, steel is going to be a great industry in the upcoming year, and I predict/hope price targets for AKS will go up.
