{"title": "Options noob looking for a quick answer to a couple questions", "selftext": "I want to know if it's possible to move $100,000+ in Spy call/put contracts intraday, and also how long execution time would be on the average trading day.\n\nAlso how liquid are options contracts on big name blue chips and other ETFs like BAC, PG, AAPL, AMZN, SPX, QQQQ etc....\n\nCould you move hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of options contracts in under a minute like you could shares of stock?\n\nCan you trade these options contracts and be in an out mid-market, intraday?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBackground Info:\n\nI'm looking to enter and exit positions within a strict 5 minute window(the entry is within 5 minutes and exit is within 5 minutes, I hold for anywhere from a half hour to several hours) using a new strategy I've come up with.\n\n(Also no...I'm not going to actually use $100k, this is all purely hypothetical) \n\nThanks for your help guys\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Edit:* \n\n*The whole trade isn't 5 minutes....it could be a half an hour to several hours(usually around 2 hours a trade). The options will increase/decrease in value quite a bit within that window as far as I can tell. (for instance the underlying ETF/Equity would be moving anywhere from 0.3-2% or so) Also options are known for moving substantially more than the underlying equities(Larger gains/losses per %).*\n\n*Unless options contracts don't change in price intraday???*\n\n*What I meant was my entry is within a 5 minute window and my exit is within a 5 minute window, and could I sell enough contracts, or buy enough contracts with my execution where I would be in within 5 minutes, and out within 5 minutes...with a span of anywhere from a half an hour to several hours in between.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Edit 2:*\n\n*Also do you lose money on time value throughout the day/intraday, or does this only take effect each day?*\n\n*Meaning if you are in and out on the same day is time not a factor in the underlying price of the option?*", "id": "5ij3re", "created_utc": 1481826007.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Option are not suitable for 5 minute trades, they won't move enough to realize gains.\n\nProbably aggressive futures scalping is what you are looking for.
