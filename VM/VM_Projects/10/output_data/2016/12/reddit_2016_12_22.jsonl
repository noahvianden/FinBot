{"title": "Why has DEO been such a disappointment for 3 years?", "selftext": "I've owned it for just about 4 and thought it would be a pretty stable holding but it's just been a stinker.   Even with dividend reinvestment it's not even flat, I'm down over 10% after 3 years.  I've lost more on other holdings before so I think my disappointment spurns from the type of company it is, their holdings, and my expectation that it wouldnt be a knock-out-of-the-park investment, but at least a stable one that I could count on to keep up with inflation. \n\nIt's probably less than 5% of my total holdings but I'm considering selling it and reinvesting it into the WSKY ETF (which 23% diageo) or something else entirely to grab something more diversified.   \n\nWhy has its performance been so lackluster compared to the rest of the market?", "id": "5jri0c", "created_utc": 1482424680.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "As someone who works in the industry, I would say the best stock to own would be STZ (Constellation) but they might be overpriced now.\n\nThe thing with DEO is that they are a very diversified alcohol company where as they have top brands in multiple categories.  I'll try to cover their portfolio a bit as I do have some data on specif brands:\n\n**Note:  All numbers as of the end of 2015- CAGR from 2011-2015.  I'll look to cover the most common SKU as they have the same brand at various different price points.  All of my data only covers USA.**\n\nJohnny Walker- Scotch Whiskey- Whiskeys tend to be very high margin items.\nBlack Label is the main SKU: 3% CARG vs 4.2% for the category- under performing\n\nSmirnoff-  -0.3% CAGR vs 5.8% for the category segment. Vodka- Vodka is very low margin due to the not being easily differentiated and the insane amount competition.  Smirnoff did grow 3.2% in 2015 but again still below the 9.8% growth for the category segment.\n\nKettle One-  1.1% CAGR vs -0.3 for the category segment.  Another Vodka but this one seems to be holding its own.\n\nCiroc- -0.6% vs. -1.3% for the category.  This is a brand that has been susviving on various flavor releases they've been pushing on distributors.  Important note: down -33% in 2015.\n\nCrown Royal- Main segment up 0.5% vs 1.7% for the category.  In a more premium segment, Crown Royal Apple has been absolutely killing it, up 1200% in 2015 to 1.6 million cases.  Personally, I don't see this sustaining as people will eventually get tired of it (look at fireball).  On a financial side, this costs almost nothing to make and it's being sold for about $25 a bottle, excellent margins.\n\nBulleit Bourbon- up 38% vs 10% for the category from 2011-2015.  Absolutely killing it and definitely a high margin product.\n\nDon Julio Tequila- Up 3.8% vs 5.3 in the segment.  Decent margins.\n\nIn summary I do think they have been under performing in their respective categories.  There are a few catalyst that I think can be huge for them: \n\nJohnny Walker-  They are reworking their marketing to focus more on the cocktail scene, they've been a bit behind other brands.\n\nDon Julio- Tequila continues to grow and they are in a good position to capitalize on it.\n\nTanqueray Gin-  Gin is a hot category these days and Tanqueray is very good.  The Gin market run a risk of getting over run by craft products but the impact would not be a big as it would in the Beer segment as it's tough to get products through the distributors.\n\nOverall they've definitely been under performing in most categories, this might be due to the fact that they are still on a bunch of brands that have hit their peak already and are just going into a decline (Ciroc, etc).  They are also the kind of company that has a lot cash so they can pretty much make something out of thin air.   believe they are focusing more on the Whiskeys (Irish, Bourbon and Scotch), these kinds of products would definitely be good for their margins, and you don't need to sell as much as you with vodka to make the same amount of profit.  \n\nThis turned out longer than expected but its almost Christmas and I'm pretty bored at my desk.
