Just buy garbage!", "selftext": "While it might make everyone laugh to see a terrible robinhood performance,  consider this new, **bold** investment strategy I just made up: It's a variation of the popular **inverse-wsb portfolio strategy**.\n\n1) Instead of buying companies that look to have a good future, like SUNEQ, MNKD, MSTX, buy companies that you think are a **bad idea** and have **no future**. Whenever you look at a company and are like 'wow, such a boring company, it has no future and is very overvalued', put your money into it. Stop looking for good deals, look for expensive garbage. Amazon maybe? Ford? SWHC?
