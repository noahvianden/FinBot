With individual stocks, it's a bit more hit or miss, but so far every time I buy up stocks when a whole sector gets hit, I have gotten a bounce.\n\nI've already taken my weekly 2% off of Tesla stock.

The point was more you are just jumping in to a sector without knowledge of said sector (even to a basic point of why it fell such a great deal today). Calling these companies \"huge\" is actually questionable. Only one would really be considered a large cap (M), and one barely counts as a mid cap (JCP). In no way am I saying you have to be concerned they will crash tomorrow, just you might want more knowledge when investing into an area. \n\nMight have something to do with \"Nordstrom management told JPMorgan analysts that brick-and-mortar traffic levels are the worst since 1972.\" ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are probably correct.

I am also not saying I hope you lose money (because I don't). \n\nIt has taken me awhile to generate a decent portfolio. A good part of that time was doing stupid things. Jumping into sectors I had no knowledge of, or trying to catch falling knives (cause the stock is already down it has to come back!!!!!). I know how long it has taken to get to this point, so the thought of reverting back to just randomly buying stocks on a whim is somewhat frightful. \n\nI do wish you the best. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This strategy has been working for me pretty well. I buy stocks when they have a sudden one day drop. If the stock just continues to fall, then I sell it quickly and eat a small loss. If the stock bounces, I make a quick profit and cash out. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's not like I plan to hold any of these stocks for more than a couple of weeks at most.\n\nI avoid stocks which have a small market cap or are wildly volatile. I look for better known growth stocks which suffer a fast one day drop. My experience is that, on average, there is usually a quick rebound within a week or two more often than not. Those that don't rebound I just sell right away.\n\nI've been extremely successful doing this for the past year. I limit my exposure because I don't hold anything long term. I frequently convert back to cash as soon as I make a few percent gain. \n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So, just a follow up.  First of all, I do not deny that I made a reckless, impulsive, and poorly researched series of trades.  Frankly, I treat daytrading stocks not dissimilar to any other form of gambling.\n\nSo, this morning, all five stocks which had a big drop on Friday have had a bounce.  So, I'm ahead on every stock, with enough profit to at least cover the cost of the trades with a few hundred dollars left over.  \n\nI have set up stop-limit orders on all five stocks, to make sure I don't lose any money, and once any of them get above about 5% gain, I will adjust those limit orders to harvest any quick profit; with the goal of reaping about a 4-6% return in a week or two time.\n\nAs of this moment.\n\n* The 600 shares of JC Penny Stock I bought are up $138.05 (3.72%)\n* The 100 shares of Kohl's stock is up $98.97 (1.93%)\n* The 100 shares of Nordstrom stock is up $63 (1.25%)\n* The 210 shares of Gap stock is up $51.28 (1.02%)\n* The 175 shares of Macy's stock is up $30.48 (0.46)\n\nSo, a total gain of $425.11 since Friday on my $26,925 bet.  Obviously, I will have to deduct the trade commission out of those gains, but still ahead, and I'm not selling any of them yet unless they turn the other direction.\n\nI'm not claiming that swing trading like this is a 'sure thing', just that, more often than not, a large drop across a sector tends to rebound the following trading day.  Not always, but more often than not, so that, on average, this strategy seems to reap quick returns.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6120843887329102}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5384443998336792}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29724058508872986}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0831199362874031}], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46831974387168884}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3020583987236023}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6115744709968567}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4238772392272949}], "tickers": []}
