But if the goal is, eg, an ATM or OTM married put, the analysis should include various ways to achieve the desired combination of delta and volatility exposure (eg, also considering selling stock plus a long call), which is a much broader scope discussion\n   * Ie, it doesn't make sense to optimize margin only at the expense of expected returns\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/membership/Margin\\_Manual.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/membership/Margin_Manual.pdf)", "id": "12gk07u", "created_utc": 1681048212.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "If you need to park cash (and collect interest on some of it) or you need to clean up an existing position where you may have short shares which add cash in your account that isn't usable without a margin loan nor paying you interest.

The fact that the CBOE margin calculation is extremely similar between \"alt A\" and \"alt B\" (the difference being that the 25% stock requirement no longer can apply) should intuitively indicate that the risk profile between these two alternatives can be very similar, so that means it is a good way to discuss the remaining difference -- the net long extrinsic value exposure.\n\nThank you for challenging that point and posing the overall question -- both were well-placed.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.027556372806429863}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02954181283712387}, {"body": "Title is misleading. This looks more like a maintenance margin optimization analysis on the underlying share position by using deep ITM puts.\n\nThere isn't a real savings for using ITM puts. You effectively just move the maintenance amount out of the loan and into the cost of the put itself. Since the put will gain value as the shares lose value, the maintenance requirement is discounted by the gain in value of the put.\n\nTo answer the literal title question, strike selection is effectively an insurance cost/benefit analysis. How much do you want to spend in insurance premium to protect how much value in the shares? Most people want to get leverage through their insurance premium, so puts are usually OTM to the current spot price of the shares. Which typically have appreciated in value over the initial cost. So the married put is to protect some amount of unrealized gains.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Your comment about the title is fair -- this analysis started somewhere else but deserved a home, so there's some context not reflected.  I will keep this point in mind.\n\n(Also, what follows are context/clarifications mainly for posterity -- obviously comment or clarify as you please, but don't feel obligated to be dragged into an endless discussion.)\n\nIt's probably unexpected to analyze ITM puts.  The main reason is actually to reduce the amount of speculation on future volatility pricing (by choosing contracts which have little or no extrinsic premium at position open).  Notice the substantial callouts in the OP about how extrinsic value should not be ignored just for margin calculations.\n\nYour point about demand for married puts seems intuitively correct.  However, there are more uses for a married put (as for most structures), for example you could:\n\n* neutralize the relative negative carry of a short position (maybe even before a dividend)\n* arbitrage carrying costs to gain convexity exposure\n   * eg, generate $1500 market-neutral credits from LMT, buy 15-strike married put in BOIL (currently trading at $3/sh).  You could potentially remain delta-neutral and profit simply with a buy-and hold approach even without a precipitous rise in BOIL stock or option extrinsics\n      * Of course, when convex gains do occur, they can be captured in familiar ways, eg, close position, sell shares, sell a call (...notice how liquidity characteristics should be unchanged or improved for all of these alternatives since position open...ie, you are also investing in primo choices for you to exit/fade)\n* collect interest on excess cash (eg, in an underlying you regularly trade anyway)\n   * but often times you need to sell a call to actually collect interest, otherwise you are just getting low-priced long vol exposure.\n   * ...But sometimes you should be able to get the put at slightly negative extrinsic (eg, from counterparties needing T+1 cash at a lower cost than provided by their broker, the treasury market, etc)\n* use the deep ITM married put as a \"savings plan\" insurance to protect against liquidity failures\n   * eg, when you need to raise cash but can't open or close other positions at reasonable cost (including selling a married put, at the same strike or different), you exercise the put to flush the account with cash\n\nThe big risk with OTM options is the relatively extreme and variable amount of extrinsic premium.  If you are badly trapped (due to losses and/or margin and/or liquidity) or believe the market is severely dislocated or are price insensitive (eg, too elated by your stock gains :-), sure, buy the OTM outright.  Participants that are largely unhedged may not notice this for...other reasons.\n\nI think most retail traders likely would not include a structure like this (ie, as an opening trade).  And I suspect most traders would not use this structure alone -- they would use it to transform an existing position (eg, neutralize negative carry) or as part of a short-term to manage capital to support or hedge for a more precision strike elsewhere in markets :-)\n\nThe discussion is mainly to look at some interesting pricing data, have conversations about margin, and branch out into other important topics which are often overlooked to the detriment of retail.
