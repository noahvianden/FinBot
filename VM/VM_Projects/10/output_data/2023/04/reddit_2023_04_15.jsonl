The average over the past three years has been between zero and 1%, with a few instances of 2%.\nThe Berkshire Hathaway (tickers: BRK. A BRK.A 0.00% , BRK. B BRK.B +0.46% ) A shares finished Friday at $496,000, a new high for 2023, while the Class B stock ended at $319.74. The A shares were up 1.1% in Friday\u2019s session while the Class B stock gained 0.5%\n\nTo calculate the 3.4% premium, Barron\u2019s compared the price of the A shares to the value of 1,500 Class B shares. Each B share is economically equivalent to 1/1,500th of an A share.\n\nGiven the outsize premium on the A stock, investors partial to Berkshire may want to purchase the cheaper Class B shares. CEO Warren Buffett has suggested that investors buy the Class B stock when the A-share premium is more than 1%. He has advised buying the A shares when the two classes are at parity, as they were at the start of 2023.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what has driven out the premium on the Class A shares. Berkshire stock has been on a roll in April, with the A shares up nearly 7%. It\u2019s possible that Buffett\u2019s widely covered trip to Japan last week has spurred buying by Asian investors, and that those buyers favored the A shares.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, like many other companies, has two classes of stock outstanding. The original stock is the Class A shares\u2014Buffett holds virtually all his roughly 15% economic stake in Berkshire through the A shares. The Class B stock was issued in 1996 and now is more liquid and widely owned than the A stock due to its lower share price and inclusion in the S&P 500 SPX \u20130.01% index.\n\n     Each A share can be converted into 1,500 Class B shares, but B shareholders can\u2019t convert their stock into A shares. This means the B shares should never trade at a premium to the A shares because of potential arbitrage activity. There is no limit on the premium on the Class A stock.\nThe Class B shares also have a lower vote. Their economic stake is 1/1,500th of a Class A share but they carry just 1/10,000th of a vote. This disparity has enabled Buffett to maintain a 31% voting stake with just a 15% economic interest.\n\nHere is what Buffett wrote about the A and B shares in a letter posted on Berkshire\u2019s website that was last updated in 2010:\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, most of the time, the demand for the B will be such that it will trade at about 1/1,500th of the price of the A. However, from time to time, a different supply- demand situation will prevail and the B will sell at some discount.  In my opinion, again, when the B is at a discount of more than say, 1%, it offers a better buy than the A. When the two are at parity, however, anyone wishing to buy 1,500 or more B should consider buying A instead,\u201d Buffett wrote.\n\nWrite to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05783712863922119}, {"body": "Last time I noticed the A-shares at a significant premium to the B-shares (it's ~3% right now) was a quarter when Buffett only did a small buyback but he overwhelmingly bought A-shares.\n\nWill be interesting to see the buyback numbers in a couple weeks.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Do you believe Berkshire is knowingly overpaying, buying A-shares at a premium, at a rate so high the market is being moved, producing a widening gap between between the A and the B?\n\nThis is 2 weeks of economically irrational buying, starting at the turn of the month.

Strike prices let you trade-off between 1) the amount you can possibly gain, 2) the cost or max loss of the trade, and 3) the likelihood of trade success.\n\nA long out-of-the-money (OTM) options have a low cost, compared to at-the-money (ATM) or in-the-money (ITM) strikes. If the underlying moves to the point where this strike is now in-the-money, the ROI will be higher than an ATM or ITM contract due to the lower initial cost. However, a trade-off with the low cost and high ROI potential is that the likelihood of trade success is also low. Long OTM will only have extrinsic value so time decay will have a greater proportional impact compared to ATM or ITM contracts.\n\nITM and ATM options have a higher cost but the likelihood of trade success is also higher. ITM and ATM options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value so the \u2018delta\u2019 for these contracts will be higher due to the intrinsic value. Delta is one of the option Greeks and this means that for every unit that the underlying\u2019s price moves, the option\u2019s price will change by the delta amount. So, an ATM and ITM contract will gain value quicker than an OTM contract when the underlying\u2019s price moves favorably.\n\nFor expiration: the further out the expiration, the more it will cost you. While nearer expiries will be cheaper, they will be more impacted by time / theta decay and you will have less time for the option to move favorably (if you are going long).", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.10464965552091599}, {"body": "Maybe ask whoever told you to buy amazon options?\n\nNot trying to be mean or dismissive, but nobody here knows anything about your goals, preferences, thesis on Amazon, etc. You haven't even said whether you are interested in calls or puts.

Being ITM will help the trade profit, but is not a guarantee.  What odds do you want to have that this trade is ITM when it expires?  A .90 delta call gives an approximate 90% probability of being ITM, but will be very costly and therefore has a lot more risk.\n\nAnother factor is that theta decay works against long options, so buying father out in time will help reduce this impact.  60+ days to expiration is when theta decay ramps up so going out past this may make sense to avoid that decay.  Some buy LEAPS that are 1+ years out.\n\nRegardless the stock will have to rise beyond the breakeven which will be the strike price and the debit paid.

{"title": "Week Ended April 14 - Recap and thoughts for next week- valuation model update", "selftext": "# Market-moving News\n\n***Inflation continues to moderate although core inflation is somewhat stubborn.*** Wednesday\u2019s CPI data came in slightly below expectation, however looking at breakdown, the biggest declines came from used car (-11%) and gasoline (-17%). Core CPI is still sticky, which mostly coming from shelter (+8%), but based on real time rent data from Apartment listing and Redfin, we might have past the peak.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/himqr7itr4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=48093d3f6c270d6dc4091add3f0f5f5866f935e3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ml7if8itr4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5e2099fb557a678fe65354d63d2cff8845b2a45\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nob0g9itr4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=3be05d60be7151994caf6be01c2d6ea06e39b45e\n\nPPI declined more than expected on Thursday. Biggest decline also came from energy. Core PPI increased 0.3%, unchanged MoM. The encouraging news came from service PPI which was -0.3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking ahead to April, we might see CPI and PPI bounce up again. Both used car price and gasoline moved higher in by the end of March and in April. Confirmed by both Inflation Expectation Median 1 Year Ahead Expected Inflation Rate (NYCNM1IR) Index (raised to 4.7%) and U Michigan 1 Year Inflation Expectations Survey (raised to 4.6%). But good news is import price and transportation cost - Freightos Baltic Index (FBX) are both still declining.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4no0jp4zr4ua1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe58caa2ab0aafbbea73114719f539bc3c34526\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hgbgp4zr4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80c46bc3580dd9aa98a41a1ef028bf3135de7dc\n\nAs a result, bond yields rose this week in response to a higher rate for longer possibility. 2024 year-end Fed rate estimation raised from 2.77% last Friday to 2.99% today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Earnings season started with a bang as 4 major US banks reported stellar results.*** \u00a0Financial sector jumped 0.7% on the good news, but rest of the sectors did not join the celebration. Earnings so far this quarter has been better than historical average. However, SP500 NTM forward earnings estimation continue to be slashed by analysts and now at $216 vs. $218 LTM. Now that CPI growth is higher than PPI growth (mostly likely will continue), corporate earnings might benefit from it as margins will expand.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d234tfp3s4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0be6b4ae1cee6e3aae4cb97ee550537c99bcb0f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3yn6hp3s4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=160f2545e6ecdfd2bc510b216f1d83c14c977484\n\n***Mixed results on the economy, but global liquidity is on the rise since the beginning of the year.*** WEI index which mostly tracks GDP seems bottomed out and tilted up in April. Same as Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow estimation. However, both wholesale (MoM 0.4% vs exp. 0.6% for the month of Feb) and retail sales (MoM -1% vs exp. -0.5% for the month of March) were lower than expected. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7t47oe58s4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8e43842f686048079563b7093f9027d378bc3e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4sx3g58s4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=02c2f6e51196ab05fc148e2222fbe0d1364f0b80\n\nMarch wage growth rebounded as well, adding more pressure to inflation. But a different outlook came from BoA\u2019s deposit data where salary and waged continue to decline yoy and is already well below inflation rate. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg991kjas4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fde841bd8a509743d5c2cb616ba73870509d826\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqaoxkjas4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=a523b82d86c1733cf303bc566ff0dd03d4e7ae38\n\nIf you are looking for reason that fueled this year\u2019s rally, look no further than central bank\u2019s liquidity level. Thanks to BOJ, PBOC (China credit impulse) and the Fed (due to bank crisis in March), global liquidity has been rising since the beginning of the year, correlated well with stock market rally. The liquidity injects from CBs might also stop ISM and LEI from further declining into recession levels. Definitely something we need to keep an eye on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ak6tjw5gs4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2962413407bde30093567e3055a376a85fdb200\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4df3x5gs4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5f6254a032dbbffb7393d41d67fe87c18b61ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wqxkx5gs4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac6b493f53428ebb57ad7115a975f84e3e557b26\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qj0m9x5gs4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=46144ce16b01071a552c6f89ed5e5a3c952276a9\n\n# My positions and predictions\n\n**US Equity**\n\nI changed my year-end valuation method from PE to forward PE. The results are similar.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn01kekjs4ua1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=22e7787623b3d835ef9fdb900b49d1a79486e185\n\n***Base case (orange):*** Assume 2023 SP500 earnings the same as 2022 ($218), and 2024 earnings up 10% yoy (history average 7.8% but since we are swinging back from a decline, I will assume double digit here). Inflation stabilized under 4% and continue to decline. Fed schedules 1-2 less cuts by the end of 2023 comparing to what\u2019s anticipated today.\n\n***Bull case (green):*** Assume 2023 SP500 earnings up 10% yoy (to $240 based on last week\u2019s bank earnings results), and 2024 earnings up 10% yoy again (to $264). Inflation stabilized under 4% and continue to decline. Fed scheduled the same number of cuts by the end of 2023 as anticipated today (Dovish).\n\n***Bear case (red):*** Assume we hit a mild recession with 5% earnings decline in 2023 but expect to swing back to $218 in 2024. Inflation well under control, but Fed still schedules 1-2 less cuts by the end of 2023 comparing to what\u2019s anticipated today (hawkish).\n\nStocks are definitely expensive right now. Light blue box is where we are today. NTM EPS estimate is at $216, but forward PE multiple sits at 19. If we assume history average of forward PE multiple (17), we should be at 3740. The mismatch mostly comes from the crazy valuations of big tech companies (SP500 Company Forward PE ratio below). If they don't beat their earning and guidance estimates big time (i seriously doubt given Samsung and TSM results and Apple mac order slump), it's gonna be sell sell sell!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3380j0zus4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=106c642a3df5964d5d7e4b213a85bf30fc17fde0\n\n*Processing img grolrmsxs4ua1...*\n\n**US Treasury Bond (TLT)**\n\nMy view on TLT remain the same. Unless inflation is out of control, Fed cuts will be gradually priced into TLT throughout the year. However, recent liquidity injection from the Fed artificially suppressed bond yield (TLT had a small rally).  I think as bank earnings calmed the market, and Fed continue to shrink its balance sheet, recent rally of TLT will not last, and TLT will be under pressure in the short term. I will continue to add while it\u2019s below $104.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5tm0wrdzs4ua1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a4dc648d810e734e8166eca2344352cddccde9\n\n**Current Positions (not changed):**\n\nQQQ May 19 2023 300 Put\n\nSPY May 19 2023 400 Put\n\nTLT leap call spread 110/115", "id": "12nn4uj", "created_utc": 1681601894.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "If only the tards understood just how good this DD is -  kudos good sir or mam!", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "You are too kind haha thank you!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1302472949028015}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14711466431617737}, {"body": "Good stuff.
