I know many would just tell me to buy the shares out right or buy a leap but I prefer having the shares back at that low average. Right now AMD is $89.37. The 5/5 $75 call is trading at $14.75. If i was to buy the contract than immediately exercise my loss should be only $38. Because the cost to do this would be $8975.

How about instead buying/exercising a call to purposely flush $38 down the toilet, why don't you send me the $38 instead and I will print up for you a hardcopy fancy certificate that certifies that the cost basis for your AMD shares is $75? Anytime you start to doubt that your basis is actually that low, you can just look at the certificate and feel better.\n\nBecause what you aim to do amounts to the same psychological mind game. Money is fungible. Keeping the $38 in your wallet is effectively a $38 profit that you obtain by not playing this trick on your mind, which you can then apply towards discounting the cost basis of the shares that will cost you $89.37.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Lol this is the response i needed.
