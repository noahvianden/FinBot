Around 200,000 in US and another 200-250k in the EU. Estimated revenues currently of around $5-7b. GSK takes an edge over pfizer with the fact that they face no imminent patent losses that would rock their revenues. Their major revenue drivers are solid until the mid to late 2020s and this new vaccine will be rolling out during flu/RSV season this fall.
