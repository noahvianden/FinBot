The big companies are *not* buying huge amounts of NVDA hardware for AI. They are actually building custom hardware to *replace* GPU for specific tasks such as Large Language Models. TPU and ASIC are 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient for Machine Learning. \\[Google Bard already runs on a custom TPU supercomputer. \\]\n\nCPU are already integrating ML hardware. They are much cheaper,  more energy efficient and far easier to program than a GPU.\n\nMany of the 'new' orders are replacements for EOL hardware. It is part of  the normal 5-10 year corporate upgrade cycle. In many cases multiple GPU will be replaced by one faster GPU resulting is lower overall sales.\n\nThe workstation GPU market is almost dead because integrated graphics are now good enough for many tasks and gaming cards now use the same 'professional' drivers.
