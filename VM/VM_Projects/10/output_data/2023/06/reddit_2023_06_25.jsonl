As we gear up for the week ahead I thought I'd take a moment to share some of the macroeconomics data releases I'm keeping my eyes on. \n\nGiven the \"renewed\" concerns over a potential global recession which sunk markets last week, I think Q1 GDP data from the US (next Thursday) and UK (next Friday) is going to be in the headlights - any miss could cause a big adverse reaction for investors.
