{"title": "Cavco (CVCO). A discount play on the housing shortage.", "selftext": "Cavco\r  \n\r  \nWho are they\r  \n\r  \nCavco Industries makes manufactured homes. They have numerous brands and levels of products. They make classic mobile homes, as well as modular construction and custom floor plans. They also have a mortgage origination arm and an insurance broker. \r  \n\r  \nBusiness overview\r  \n\r  \nCavco touts their homes as affordable alternatives to site built homes. They tout the average manufactured home price as $108,000 compared to $365,000 for a site built home. I have found several other figures, but this generally lines up with most analysis. This makes manufactured or modular homes an alternative to expensive entry level homes.\r  \n\r  \nCavco claims their target customers are first time homebuyers and senior citizens looking to downsize. Basically, people who want smaller, cheaper houses. \r  \n\r  \nThey can also make money by originating mortgages and selling insurance too. This makes them a one stop shop for homebuyers.\r  \n\r  \nCavco has a pristine balance sheet. They have virtually no debt, and enough cash to cover it if they wanted to. They use the cash to buy back shares and make acquisitions. The lack of debt gives them an advantage in downtimes over traditional home builders as they don't have interest payments to make. When times are good, the lack of debt gives them higher cash flows to grow the business.\r  \n\r  \nManagement\r  \n\r  \nThe CEO has been in his role since 2019 and with the company since 2008. He owns $7 million of stock. The company buys back stock and is shareholder friendly. They also have a history of good performance, steadily increasing ROIC and making strategic acquisitions to grow the company. Insiders own about 6% of the company.\r  \n\r  \nThe previous CEO resigned in 2019 after an alleged insider trader scandal, so there is a less than stellar history.\r  \n\r  \nBull cases\r  \n\r  \nThere is a shortage of affordable housing in the US. The US association of homebuilders claims there is no market in the US in which a new home can be built profitably at a price point average first time homeowners can afford. They are biased, but anecdotally, I agree. Cavco, and other manufactured home builders can offer a much more affordable product. This is a big tailwind.\r  \n\r  \nThe company claims that modular homes are generally manufactured less than 350 miles from its final location. This means that Cavco can expand by buying different regional operators. They have successfully done this in the past. They also have historically invested in improving their factories and workforce. I think good long term holds must reinvest into their business to remain competitive. Cavco does this.\r  \n\r  \nLastly, I think there will be a shortage of used homes going on the market. Many homeowners now have mortgages with rates below 3%. These people are rate locked into their homes and will be hesitant to sell. This will put increased demand into the new home marketplace, and the only way to do that affordably is through manufactured homes.\r  \n\r  \nThere is value in the sector. The largest modular home builder in the US is Clayton homes, which has been owned by Berkshire Hathaway since 2003. If Buffet thinks it is a solid sector, who am I to disagree?\r  \n\r  \nBear cases\r  \n\r  \nCavco\u2019s earnings increased greatly during covid. They did make acquisitions during that time, so some of the earnings increase is likely to be permanent. However, earnings are expected to fall this year by about 20%. This is similar to a lot of other home construction stocks.\r  \n\r  \nHigh interest rates could eat into their business. They do have an advantage in owning their own mortgage broker. This allows them to pay points to lower their customer\u2019s interest rates. That would cut into margins, but allow them to continue selling in mortgage rates dent the housing market. They could also suffer if the housing market as a whole slows down. I think this is less of a problem since there is a housing shortage, and they are one of the lowest cost producers of housing.\r  \n\r  \nThey could run out of acquisition targets. Manufactured homes have 3 large players and numerous small ones. Cavco is one of the big three. This would slow their growth. Personally, I think this is not an imminent thing, but possibly a long term issue.\r  \n\r  \nValuation\r  \n\r  \nAccording to Morningstar, CVCO has a 5 year average P/E of 21.17. It is currently trading around 13X forward earnings. Its closest comp, Skyline Champion (ticker SKY), is trading around 17x. This indicates the stock is potentially undervalued. Morningstar ranks it as 4 stars, and it is only a few dollars above a full 5 star rating (around $300). It might actually be below that by the time you read this.\r  \n\r  \nThe biggest question is how much will their earnings fall as the market normalizes. Before covid they made $8.25/share. If they go back to that figure, the stock would be trading at 37x earnings. That would be very overvalued. The company has made acquisitions and improved operations since then, so it is unlikely to fall that hard. The analyst average has earnings clocking in around $23.30/share next year (which ends in June). This would give the stock a 13x multiple as of now, cheap by historical standards. Because of the lack of analyst coverage, no estimates are available for further years. \r  \nI think there is a high likelihood of this stock being undervalued, or at the very worst, appropriately valued. Full disclosure, I took advantage of a drop in share price while writing this to purchase a few shares, so I am now an owner. I think the odds of earnings holding up is much higher than a pre-covid regression. I did a quick DCF and the market seems to be pricing about 7% growth, which is far below their historical growth rates.

{"title": "Market Recap - 5/10/23 - the grind continues", "selftext": "**The Fed**\n\nUS Apr Consumer Prices Increased 4.9% From Year Earlier; Core CPI Up 5.5%, largely as expected, but supercore CPI was lower than expected, and shelter essentially topped out, which pave the way to a steady decline going forward.  Yields tumbled, and stocks rallied in response. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/72trikoai2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=070d87541ab530c8187c0a66149fe0eaca40fbb0\n\nThe biggest contributor to CPI is still shelter costs, which have officially topped out: Shelter 8.11% down from 8.18% YoY; Rent 8.80% down from 8.81% YoY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/943v0n1mi2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=23e24029aa0c36d2950ebde2d6dc40b12418f7ad\n\nThe used car price posted the biggest MoM increase in all CPI components. This is expected to continue in May (retail prices are still climbing) but likely cool in June (whole sale prices declined in April).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti99sfifj2za1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=a631d45bc6416a6326b25a0b46fbf77919bbddb1\n\nLooking at supercore inflation (core ex rent and shelter), which is the Fed's favorite inflation parameter, comes in unexpectedly cool: just 0.1% MoM, 5.1% yoy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm1udleoi2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f87a09869143484ae4b9639618c2536499dcaa\n\nSupercore benefited from a steep drop in airline fares (-2.6% MoM) but this number can be volatile as we get closer to summer.\n\nAs a result, the June Fed hike probability went down to literally 0.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1i7hm3sk2za1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a4de20eb9336074d1de3cac3b4823883ef83694\n\nThat being said, the market is projecting at least 1 rate cut this year which might still be too optimistic. US interest-rate strategists at Goldman Sachs are advising customers that the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in cutting interest rates this year than markets are predicting, per Bloomberg.\n\nMore encouraging news around the globe in the war against inflation: Germany's inflation rate comes in at 7.2% below estimates of 7.3%. Mexico's headline inflation is also at its lowest level since Q4 2021. Global tightening may soon come to an end (except at the ECB, where some officials are starting to think a Sep rate hike may be needed).\n\nI am still closely watching China's liquidity injection. China has requested banks to reduce the interest rate caps on certain retail and corporate deposits, starting on May 15, in light of recent softness in the domestic economy and exports. While this measure does not constitute a direct liquidity expansion, it could potentially be implemented if the situation continues to deteriorate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsinbwnom2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed24e6b9c11127719c457a96efa10500572d7f73\n\nImportant Reminder: While evaluating the debt ceiling drama and considering both sides, it is crucial to acknowledge the following fact: While the Fed aims to combat inflation, the expenditure of the US government is escalating, experiencing a year-over-year increase of 13%.\n\n**The Economy**\n\nConsumer spending softened in April, per BoA data. Total card spending per household dropped to -1.2% compared with April 2022, the first negative YoY reading since Feb 2021. \n\n\"The aggregate labor market picture remains solid, but Bank of America data suggests some deterioration at the higher end of the income distribution. Unemployment is rising fastest amongst higher-income households, while their pay growth is weakest.\" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajrjmf5dn2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd86f308efafda5efa5b57c2cd9c1141f464e0b\n\nThe good news is that the savings cushion is still at high levels. BoA said household savings and checking balances remain more than 40% higher than the average in 2019 across all income groups. The grind will continue.\n\nRetail traffic confirmed consumers' soft demand for discretionary spending, and it is deteriorating. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kk2q2uzn2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f735941204ba51f74c03a4524bb775e53f51c9de\n\nThe National Truckload Index (NTI) also confirmed weak goods demand. This index is now lower than the lowest point in 2019 and is quickly approaching the pandemic low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1qxq5pdo2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f42b8f7c35ea6101cd64918c2d3d04997c422ced\n\nOcean container import markets are also tracking 2019 levels and is trending lower.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xmwnnyjo2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a15a8fe6bfd646ffb573748f8368e15a5705076\n\n**The Business**\n\nWhile consumers' cash cushion is still thick, corporate cash positions are quickly diminishing. S&P 500 cash balances have dropped by 13% in the last 12 months; The slowdown in cash spending has started with buybacks. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znad2m8xo2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8edabb6f1242d4d2e80a0b1695b44c05a3e96013\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzzfnndyo2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=297d2e8b8f80df37385961439145eca5b5cc5372\n\nAs I mentioned in the weekend post, we are currently at the peak of the Fed's hiking cycle. This makes small growth companies particularly intriguing, as they tend to thrive in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment. I will start to look into this sector and gradually add to my positions.\n\nAnother intriguing area to consider is real estate. The high interest rates have posed significant obstacles to the growth of this sector. However, given that we are now approaching the peak of interest rates, real estate, particularly residential properties where substantial demand has been suppressed, can emerge as another promising area worth exploring. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhpn2m0up2za1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b9c411f36792c90280e562ff82585c413683406\n\nMy positions have not changed.", "id": "13e47hy", "created_utc": 1683754897.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "Strange.
