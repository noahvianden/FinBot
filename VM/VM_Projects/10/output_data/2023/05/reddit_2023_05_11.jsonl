It's massive.\n\nRolling a breached spread out to another breached spread is probably only going to delay the inevitable.  You really want to get back to OTM.  What I would look at is how to accomplish that without extending the trade 3 weeks since that is going to slow your theta decay down quite a bit.  Since you have a 5.00 wide call spread,  you could add a 5.00 wide put spread without increasing risk.  The monthly expirations have better liquidity typically,  so possibly roll the call spread out and up to the 5/19 315/320 CCS and add the 5/19 310/305 PCS for maybe a small credit overall of .05-.10.

Let me copy/paste a write-up I made. [See my [Japan comment too](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/139i09y/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_may_06_2023/jj96or7/).]\n\nI'd like to discuss an excellent [paper from Cliff Asness et al. from AQR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/International-Diversification-Still-Not-Crazy-after-All-These-Years). \n\nHe partitions his case into 5 points, but the first two are obvious (diversification protects you from single-country risk and reduce standard deviation). As an 'active investor,' I'm more interested in the valuation cases.\n\n## Most US outperformance is simply valuations rising\n\nStocks rise for two reasons: earnings growth causes price to go up when valuation is held constant; valuation rises even without the requisite rise in earnings growth. The latter is what explains US dominance. [In graph form](https://i.imgur.com/O4EbcZt.png) and from the paper:\n\n> Since 1990, the vast majority of the US\u2019s outperformance versus the MSCI\nEAFE Index (currency hedged) of a whopping +4.6% per year, was due to changes\nin valuations. The culprit: In 1990, US equity valuations (using Shiller CAPE14) were\nabout half that of EAFE; at the end of 2022, they were 1.5 times EAFE. Once you\ncontrol for this tripling of relative valuations, the 4.6% return advantage falls to a\nstatistically insignificant 1.2%.\n\nWhy is it so unreasonable to expect this to continue? Because you're betting on a continuation on valuations becoming more expensive. Already the 0.5 to 1.5 relative CAPE ratio was a remarkable trend, do you expect it to triple again? If there was no valuation change and fundamentals grew as they actually did in the past, you'd not see much US outperformance anymore.\n\nCurrently US stocks are historically very expensive compared to ex-US stocks. Yes, stocks are cheap for a reason, but historically the reason buying cheaper stocks works is that the market tends to move in extremes: sectors become far cheaper than their fundamentals imply.\n\n## Factoooooor tilters can achieve greater diversification across countries\n\nI frequently talk about AVDV (ex-US developed markets small cap value). It's slicing and dicing some of the cheapest segments of the market. But what's the benefit? Asness points out that not only do factors lower your portfolio's correlation with the broader market, they have [relatively low correlations with each other across markets.](https://i.imgur.com/sUhjGtB.png) So a value tilt might outperform when the market is stagnant, but when say a value tilt is underperforming in the UK, it might outperform in the US. So factor strategies can improve your portfolio's diversification not only by reducing your correlation with the market but also by moving in independent ways across countries. And you can accomplish this without reducing your portfolio's expected return. Win/win.\n\n## The Psychological Case for Young Investors\n\nThis isn't one of Asness' points, but rather my own reflection on the topic. Asness points out that this US dominance has been a winning strategies for over 30 years, albeit with a few lost years (post-Dot Com). This is a time period that has spanned entire investing careers. \n\nAre you in your twenties and building up your portfolio for the long future, like me? Then we have an advantage: we missed out on the 30 years of suffering. If you were a betting person, would you rather bet that another 30 years of suffering occurs (through getting more expensive not really out-growing), or that the extremes of history revert to means? I don't think American stocks will triple in their relative valuation, and the extreme discounts of international stocks will drive a divergence in performance between US and ex-US stocks. The wind is at your back. And I bet it won't take *another* 30 years to arrive at your destination.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6122758388519287}], "tickers": ["recession"]}
