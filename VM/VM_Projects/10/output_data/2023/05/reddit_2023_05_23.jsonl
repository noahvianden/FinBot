{"title": "Another LEAPS Call Post: BAC", "selftext": "Back again everyone,\n\nI'm looking through some screeners of stocks that are down off their highs and have potential for some growth (or at least no decline!) in the next \\~1.5 years. Would get a DITM LEAPS Call and sell PMCC during to mitigate risk and lower cost basis.\n\nBAC seems to fit this mold relatively well. Or at least I think. Which is why I'm here...\n\nPros:\n\n* BAC has definitely been affected by the recent bank crisis and will likely spring back once the end of political theater of the debt ceiling and depositor calm washes over the land.\n* Relatively low IV (again I think, please correct me if I'm wrong) of \\~46 for a LEAPS call expiring in 2025\n* Rates likely to stall/fall in the next few years and very likely to do so before 2025, causing the economy to grow and bank lending to increase\n* Warren Buffet is largest owner of BofA and obviously has phenomenal track record (don't like using this as a pro, but when arguably the greatest investor of all time says he likes the stock, the stock is liked)\n* According to this ([Bank Of America Cash on Hand 2010-2023 | BAC | MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BAC/bank-of-america/cash-on-hand)) BofA has around 1T in cash as of March 31, 2023; likely more than enough to cover any bank runs (and if not the government would likely bail them out anyway or they would get acquired by JPM \ud83d\ude11)\n* Overall solid company with good track record\n* Down about 26% off the 52 week high\n\nCons:\n\n* We are in a turbulent financial situation. If debt ceiling isn't resolved, could lead to some massive hits, especially in the banking sector\n   * Mitigants: It's likely political theater, a LEAPS would likely give ample time for it to bounce back if it's not, sell covered calls during to mitigate any catastrophe in the meantime.\n* Potentially high IV could lead to an IV crush? Not 100% sure so please someone tell me if I'm dumb.\n* High recession risk.\n\nObviously wouldn't want to get it on a day like today where it's popping but wait for a drawback and see what happens.\n\nAgain, I am just some dude being a dude and looking to get into a LEAPS/PMCC...please tell me if this is a logical and well-thought-out plan or a recipe for disaster.", "id": "13pu5z5", "created_utc": 1684861024.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\rWhether or not BAC is a good investment at that time is your call. \n\nHowever, buying a high delta call leap when I V is reasonable is a good substitute for buying the stock.

{"title": "LONG VIX, Adding LONG SPY and LONG QQQ", "selftext": "With our illustrious leaders doing their usual song and dance about \"its fixed,\"  \"its not fixed,\" and so forth, I am reminded to trade what I see, not what I think.\n\nThe knuckleheads in DC never do the right thing until they are forced to do so.  Even then they often find a way to mess it up. However, the government has been here before and even shut down.  All of this is theater.\n\nSome context: since 2001, the debt ceiling has been raised 20 times.  But before you blame the current group of politicians, from 1960 - 2001, the debt ceiling has been raised 58 times.  \n\nSimple math says, let's see, carry the 5, divide by 4, add a banana: \n\nSince 2001 the debt ceiling has been raised every 10.90.  \n\nHowever, from 1960 - 2001 the debt ceiling was raised every 8.27 months.  So Boomers ARE in fact to blame for getting the ball rolling (and Nixon) - and Republicans btw (49 times) with Democrats (29) lagging.  However, since I have equal disdain for both, I DO count Obama's NON-Affordable Care Act as a HUGE increase in debt.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nLet's take a look at past debt ceiling dramas - I have taken each timeframe and looked at the high of the market and then the lowest point DURING the debate, not the month prior:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Timeframe|SP 500 performance (HIGH to LOW)|\n|:-|:-|\n|July 2011 - August 2011|\\-17%|\n|Sept 19, 2013 - October 9, 2013|\\-4.8%|\n|Sept 2 2021 - October 4 2021|\\-5.8%|\n\n2011 was sort of an outlier since Europe was in shambles then so that added fuel to the fire.\n\nNow lets look at the month FOLLOWING a deal; First the performance one month later and then the LOW to HIGH during the 30 months after; 2021 was a mess because of temporary measures etc, though,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Timeframe|One month after - LOW to +30d CLOSE|One month after LOW to HIGH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Aug 9, 2011 - Sept 9, 2011|\\+4.8%|\\+11.7%|\n|October 9 2013 - Nov 8 2913|\\+7.5%|\\+7.8%|\n|October 4 - November 5, 2021|\\+9.4%|\\+9.4%|\n\nSo, since I believe the debt ceiling will get \"fixed\" what matters after its done is more important than during.\n\nObviously I am LONG the VIX, but as I have shared, I have many other reasons why I am positioned as such.\n\nHowever, being the betting man I am, although this is a very small sample but it is correlative because it is during more \"modern\" market structure, I will be adding SPY and QQQ - maybe even 2xETFs Calls of each.\n\nYes, you read that right, I remain LONG VIX (Aug-Oct) and will get LONG SPY (AUG) and LONG QQQ (AUG).\n\nBefore you inundate me with how can I be long SPY and VIX?  Bc I believe the debt deal will get done sooner and I still believe the house of cards, or part of the house, will come crumbling down by AUG-OCT and I am prepared to roll.
