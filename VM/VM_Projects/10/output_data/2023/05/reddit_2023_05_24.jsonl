I have been studying options for few months now and finally landed on selling strategy.\n\nI have been selling spread options and iron condors for 2 months now and I have 90% success ratio. I am not sure if this is luck or I have found the option trading style that works for me. My positions carry around 20-30% risk. So for $5000 risk trade I keep $1000. I am using few options tools which show me percentage of profitability based on Black-Scholes-Merton model. These positions are normally around 90% chance.\n\nI am sure this will not last long and I am afraid one big swing in market will erase all my profit of 2 months.\n\nI have positions in SPY / GLD / NVDA / COST for this month. Lets say each position I am carrying $5000 risk so total $20,000 risk and I am making $4000 if they all expire worthless.\n\nIf the market drops like a hot potato then I may have to roll over my positions or take total loss.\n\nNote that I dont have stop order loss due to nature of volatile market, I like to keep a close eye on them.\n\nWhat do you guys suggest, how should I improve on this process ? Thanks for any suggestions, here to learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--- Update --- \n\nYup , luck ran out and blew up the account thanks to market melt up. Exactly this happened what I was afraid of, good thing is lots of knowledge acquired to fill the gap. My SPY short call was assigned early and I did not get a chance to roll out.

I still made a profit in 2022, but it was lower due to the market dropping.  \n\n2023 started out with SPY around $380 and has traded mostly sideway in a range between that and about $420 which is a fairly narrow $40 range.

Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:  \n\n\n* **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier. \n* **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.\n* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts. Recently started in the hobby but I have the impression that having Shimano component could make-or-break a sale. \n\nOther (not validated) ideas: OLED (as OLED technology it\u00b4s getting mainstream), CUERVO (Tequila industry), perhaps Herman Miller and Steelcase in the premium office chair segment?, Dolby (audio technology) and potentially Sonos in the future.

(a guy i follow loosely on here) took a huge loss last week on CSP and wiped our almost 2 months of profits... \n\nmy question is this... Is the safest strategy not opening /ES contracts and just selling CC like 2-4dte out for downside protection? \n\ni mean for one we are in a massive range here so likely theta eats and you win with CC anyways and if we take a huge dump roguely you have CC as protection...\n\nnow in a bull market i think CSP is the way to go but for the upside future contracts should easily outweigh the loss a CC would take (plus i doubt we are gonna get any wild 4-6% green weeks) and for the downside a CC protects your long futes. \n\nThe more i look at it the primary focus of the hyperwheel is being in CSP to gain that upside movment with the premium. however with us at 4100-4200 i have to say long term upside movement is capped... so the more i think about this i almost feel like my mind set is running a wheel with primary focus being in CC.   \n\n\nhowever, everything i read says that being in CC wont actually pay out enough to outweigh the loss your shares of futures contracts would take. \n\nSo i feel like i am kinda stuck in the stop of not wanting to do the wheel due to the current price of SPY and all the potential economic effects on SPY over the rest of 2023... but i also wanna see my money work. Its not that i expect to never take a loss either... its just that i dont wanna get into the same situation i did in spring 2022 where i basically started the wheel at the peak and took a massive hit\n\ni have considered possibly 7, 14 or 30dte CC/ CSP instead too. \n\nThoughts?", "id": "13qrvaa", "created_utc": 1684949255.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "Not sure how much I can help as I only trade stocks I like and would not mind holding (which I think is the key to the wheel) so don't trade /ES.
