Even if you time the expiration perfectly, which isn't often easy, you still might not get assigned.\n\nWhy not just buy shares and do a covered call instead? Then you are guaranteed to get the dividend AND benefit through the short call if the stock drops. This is also less sensitive to timing the expiration. Any expiration after the ex-div would work.\n\nA CC has the same P/L as a CSP.\n\nBTW, nothing about this scheme has anything to do with the Wheel strategy.

{"title": "I'm going to take Elon Musk down. Sell your shares. I'm Buying them NOW!", "selftext": "Based on my trade history these stocks are soon going down. \n\nStrategy: Buying Twitter and Tesla Stock\n\n1. The Twitter Challenge: It's no secret that Elon Musk is an avid Twitter CEO, and his tweets often impact the market. So, how can we hit him where it hurts? By selling up Twitter stock and having a say in its future! Let's take this opportunity to influence the platform that Elon uses to voice his thoughts and influence the market. Together, we can make a difference.\n2. Tesla Stock Dilemma: We've all seen how Tesla stock behaves. Elon's tweets often lead to wild fluctuations, making it hard for many to predict its next move. But, here's the twist: What if we unite and turn the tables? By selling up Tesla stock, we can counteract those unpredictable fluctuations and send a message that the WallStreetBets community means business.\n\nWhy This Plan Works:\n\n1. Strength in Numbers: When we act as a collective force, we have the power to make a significant impact. Imagine the sheer volume of shares we can null if we all sell Twitter and Tesla stock together. Our numbers can disrupt the market and put pressure on Elon Musk's ventures.\n2. Creating Volatility: Elon Musk's influence often leads to volatility in the stock market. By taking a stand and actively participating, we can challenge this volatility head-on. With enough selling power, we can push the stock prices in unexpected directions, forcing Elon Musk and the market to take notice.\n3. Making Our Presence Known: WallStreetBets is known for its audacious moves and ability to influence the market. By executing this plan, we can show the world that we're not just a community of meme traders. We're here to bring about change and have our voices heard.\n\nRemember, this plan is not without risks. Stock markets are inherently unpredictable, and individual actions may not guarantee specific outcomes. Additionally, please conduct your due diligence and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\nLet's band together, WSB! It's time to challenge the status quo and make a statement. Together, we can take on the titan that is Elon Musk.

Building permits -1.5%, falling short of the estimated 0% and improving from the previous month's -3%. As I mentioned yesterday housing data is considered a leading indicator of economic health. Today's market rally was largely fueled by this data.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnggqxjxeg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb900f15c1dc7f7a4e874ff1005ab7fd52ee1f5\n\n[Housing and vehicles appears to have bottomed out](https://preview.redd.it/pa9rjw58gg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9ca811eead0d3ee2107a76af5d1a31906a7f7e)\n\nAtlanta Fed up-revised GDPNow again today to 2.9% after strong housing starts report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/daqj1gr9fg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf937f772a5f4fedb49334199901f97f2497b6fd\n\nJPM is still projecting a mild recession.

Regardless of what the NBER .. decides, a period of very weak growth .. will likely continue through next year.\u201d\n\n**The Business**\n\nThe market seems to believe that the worst of economic concerns has passed. Confidence has been boosted by stabilizing housing data, retail sales, and industrial output (mostly auto). Many of the most beaten-up sectors experienced a rally today. Even companies like HD, TGT, which gave horrible guidance, saw significant gains (not to mention KRE). It appears that the market has shifted back to a risk-on mode.\n\nDepartment stores rallied despite retail traffic just reached a new low last month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfn577c6hg0b1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4defa10a2d60a31a581e7a021aac73fc5806ace\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihr20qbrhg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d7c71fc262c16b2aa93f3a77ecfd39a7f9224a\n\nAirline rallied despite consumer spending on travel declined further in April.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvkfm7c6hg0b1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=66be0bdfe5faf38f1d96fe88f13ac41a05309b0e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19qw3ijwhg0b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=030af269a8446e19a62832bffe360ebba3c9f1ea\n\nKRE rallied today without obvious headline news\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7k44uob6hg0b1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7c6d46a03847ef6e92f597590ba40837486cac\n\nI closed my puts today. Even though I still don't believe there is much upside, I am not sure whether we will have a big pull back soon either. Looks like sector rotation has started instead. IWM/SPY appears to have stabilized during the last couple of months.
