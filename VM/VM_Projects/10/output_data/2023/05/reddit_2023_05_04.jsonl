I think the question is what does it do for AMD's AI business over time?\n\na.  One time deal, like an R&D plus product infusion, like a supercomputer win (ex El Capitan)\n\nb.  License deal with recurring revenue, as in every time Msoft builds a chip, AMD gets a cut.\n\nc.  On going partner ship with IP transfers both directions and ongoing revenue benefit for AMD.\n\nOr d, something else?\n\nTeam Red investors I'm sure views it as C with lots of co-developed software and broad market enabling as a benefit.  I wouldn't go there too fast.\n\nI think Microsoft realizes they're on this AI hardware carousel, and they will need to invest  significantly in new computation capabilities with every process node shrink.   I think google sees that as a non-winning proposition, if anything it keeps them neutral, and Microsoft isn't long term in the chip business.  So what could be better than having two vendors fight it out?   There is a corollary here with xbox -- at one point Nvidia walked away and just handed the business to AMD when the margins were not interesting enough.   AMD has been slogging through that since.\n\nIf one reads through the article there is discussion about Msoft not moving away from Nvidia GPUs.\n\nAnd of course, Msoft isn't the only CSP in the world.  Maybe Nvidia enabling guys like Oracle caused some motivation?\n\nAnother other point here is that when Apple was really struggling in the late 1990s Microsoft threw them a lifeline.   Not that AMD needs a lifeline, but I do think Msoft would rather even out the hardware vendor deltas.\n\nWhere this could get very interesting is Msoft using AMD technology to architect data centers, this would of course be in opposition to what Nvidia will surely be doing with Grace+Hopper+Bluefield+NVlink\\_NVSwitch.\n\nI'm sure Nvidia felt a bit kicked in the nuts when they learned about this, and any IP sharing activities were shut down.\n\nI don't think Msoft aids AMD to the point all the sudden AMD's solutions are on par with Nvidias, like they're interchangeable.  That just isn't in the cards.\n\nI'm fairly certain Msoft's objective is plying vendors against each other, and if one needs to be propped up, well, that's just how it goes.   Their real leverage is in the software realm, so creating an alternative to CUDA with a neutral appearing Microsoft at the center is a longer term risk to Nvidia (but many years away imho).   Nvidia has been pretty comfortable being out front, so does this relationship pose an existential risk or are they too infused in the entire AI ecosystem to be easily levered out?   \n\nBut Microsoft is playing form behind here.   Technically Nvidia's API is ubiquitous, so Microsoft would have to show a real benefit to get folks to move over.  And there is so much work to bring a new API, compilers and tools to the table.   It's nothing like the Wintel era when they sat in the driver seat and dictated terms.    \n\nwill be interesting to see how it all plays out.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Stacy Rasgon thinks its d, a  [semicustom deal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=238&v=3WjRbFgvQXA&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title)  Similar to xbox", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Similar to xbox is not comforting because... you know, xbox eventually left nvidia altogether. This isn't going to help make amd rich, it just hurts everyone and benefits the customer. It makes it more obvious that nvidia needs to get to the consumer asap, and that means making their own gpt-4. I know you're big on relying on the ecosystem moat to protect the market but it's not going to happen. I think at in some thread you mentioned that GPUs keep ahead of ASICs because of flexibility, but I think for MS they will be fine with something more targeted toward running gpt in the short term. There should be no idea that they won't be able to come up with the software, they don't need the whole ecosystem, they can just duplicate the parts that they use.\n\nI'm worried but hoping that management is not thinking about avoiding their customer's turf and being careful not to step on anyone's toes. I really hope they get any notion of that out of their heads and fully compete. LLMs is a code-red for nvda as much as it is for google or any other major company/entity.

And how are you defining AGI?\n\nI had a lot more to say about your comment, but maybe we should start with those basic points.\n\n(side note:  Nvidia left xbox, not the other way around.

Sure an even larger model will be able to intuit better but to get \"smarter\" the next step is to build strong reasoning engines on top of LLMs not just cram more parameters in and hope for emergent consciousness to form.\n\nNo doubt computation will still improve within the next couple of years and that'll drive things forward but even if we're stuck on Hopper forever it'll still be enough IMO. GPT-3 and llama are already smarter than any individual person on I guess an instinctual level (maybe there's a better term), it just doesn't reason well.\n\n> perhaps orders of magnitude more complex than GPT4.\n\nIt'll be more complex but as a foundational model GPT-5 or equivalent will be enough assuming it has the advances I'm expecting, ie hyena or equivalent.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">the next step is to build strong reasoning engines on top of LLMs\n\nI don't believe that programming human or better than human level reasoning is in the scope of human understanding atm\n\n>not just cram more parameters in and hope for emergent consciousness to form.\n\nDon't know the path if this isn't the way.   Sam Altman talks about GPT4 unexpected behavior in an interview with Lex Friedman.  I believe he's shining the light there.  \n\n>No doubt computation will still improve within the next couple of years and that'll drive things forward\n\nagree on that\n\n>GPT-3 and llama are already smarter than any individual person on I guess an instinctual level (maybe there's a better term), it just doesn't reason well.\n\nThis has been informative, thanks.\n\nFrom decades of hardware experience I've always viewed the challenges in light of how much progress can actually be made in subsequent generations.   PC graphics for example, we're nothing close to realtime VR, the holy grail.    Min is a bottoms up perspective.  Another example are what Nvidia just released with their Siggraph papers and generative AI, the natural hair movement videos.   Or the earlier discussion on the Merlin API.  Progress just isn't as fast as we all imagine it will be.  It's incremental, not a step function.\n\nI get there is this view of an AI tipping point and that some believe we've reached it already.   I don't think that perspective comes from a place of technical understanding.   You are different in that you use this technology every day, so I appreciate your perspective, but I think there is a little bit of hope or faith infused in your views.  You clearly have more of a top down perspective than bottoms up.\n\nTo me, I want an AGI that is an assistant, help me with this task, or do it for me, or solve some/many bigger problems in my life.\n\nYears ago Jensen described vision and language as the two keys to human understanding, and that its going to work the same for computers (AGI).  Getting those two disciplines to work well together, to then add \\*reasoning\\* and then to get the output into a malleable and productive form that can play nicely with our existing tools and environment is a monumental task, imo.  We have text to image generative AI, but not image to text -- yet anyway.   This will be an incredible milestone, to understand a picture or video and its implications in a digital form.\n\nThis goes back to your earlier thought about Msoft can just build out the portion of the ecosystem they need for GPT4.   I don't think that will advance AI technology to the state you think it will (but obviously/admittedly I don't have your experience or understanding of the environment you see day to day).   I don't think GPT4 models will ever be able to understand an analog image for example.\n\nBut I get now where you're coming from on the more consumer application side.   I still think we are many many years from that killer app emerging.\n\nNvidia is going to do very well over the next 5-10 years supplying picks and shovels to the guys mining for the killer app.   Their strategy is to turn everyone into a miner.   But the entire programmable and adaptable platform has to evolve.  Freezing or branching it necessarily limits future direction.\n\nHow this field reaches a next amazing level is going to be through some kid with a bright idea who imagines solutions differently and builds a company around it.    The next Apple isn't going to grow out of our existing CSPs, or from Nvidia imho.   They will all be near term beneficiaries of any monetization that happens around AI though.\n\nOn a different topic, I hope I'm dead before any singularity event, I can't envision benefit to humankind there.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I understand your perspective on my perspective, lol (inaccurate but fair, I understand why you think that from my comments).

He's saying that GPT-4 has already reached some level of what would be agi, it's just being held back by some serious limitations in certain ways. Solving those limitations is what will get us to agi not 10xing the model size. If you follow the discussion around building next-gen models parameter size is already passe as a topic.\n\n> I don't believe that programming human or better than human level reasoning is in the scope of human understanding atm\n\nI think reasoning is far far far simpler than imagined, and that the cult of consciousness is a quasi-religious view centered around human supremacy. LLMs solved the language problem and for that matter [vision](https://medium.com/the-generator/midjourneys-crazy-new-describe-feature-a96cc09203cc) is [also solved](https://segment-anything.com/).

At a minimum, building smaller, faster, more efficient more portable devices is always work that can be done, and new techniques for more effective processing are being researched and implemented every day.  \n\nOn a broader level, I don't see nvidia slowing down any time soon.  GPU compute remains a precious commodity.   Nvidia are building a giant operation to support that demand and democratizing the technology by bringing their platform to new customers every day.   \n\nMy views on Nvidia's growth outlook will change when we see that demand go away.

{"title": "0.30 delta wheeling = catching a falling knife?", "selftext": "Hi guys!\n\nI have been learning a lot from this subreddit and have been attempting to wheel for the past 4 months. (It  works decently?)\n\nI mostly try to wheel a handpicked - relatively low volatile tech stocks with 2 weeks DTE: AAPL, MSFT, NFLX, AMD, NVDA, AMZN etc. These are the stocks I do not mind owning.\n\nBut I was wondering if the wheeling at 0.30 delta or less is always like catching a falling knife especially in a non bull - volatile market. Here's what I am trying to understand:\n\nduring CSP:\n\n* If XYZ keeps free falling due to any event, that means rolling is going to be hard and you get assigned to bag hold the stock at a much lower rate than the strike. (Further now CC on this will be tricky to handle too since low premiums and if the stock decides to rebound.)\n* If XYZ keeps increasing, that means you are losing on a gain (mostly larger than the premium).\n\nduring CC:\n\n* If XYZ keeps free falling due to any event that means no ones going to keep paying top dollar for the CC premium. Plus now next time the stock may rebound causing to an low premium assignment.\n* If XYZ keeps increasing suddenly then it's hard to avoid the CC assignment and you are losing a big gain for a few cents of premium. Plus now selling a CSP gets risky as at any point the stock reverses after the huge gain, CSP will be ITM and hard to roll.\n\nAll of this cause it really easy to sell low and buy high for a few cents of premium.\n\nThe only safe CSP or CC is when the stock trades flat, but realistically these good stock hardly do that over a period of time. Also in this case the premiums would be real low for a flat stock.\n\nSo it feels like wheeling is a strategy for collecting a few cents of premium in most cases against a potentially better ROI in the case of Buying a few shares of these nicer companies and religiously holding them for the long term.\n\nAm I just viewing this wrong?

The Wheel is effectively a long stock strategy. However rather than receive gain in the form of share appreciation (and possibly some dividends), you gain in the form of premium. The question becomes then, will your premium be higher than the share price increase? For good companies in the long term? **Almost** always no. However, given the fact that The Wheel writes contracts out of the money, there will be a decrease in the volatility of the account, which can be a worthwhile trade-off depending on your goals. Thus, rather than the jagged up and down for portfolios, an account utilizing The Wheel will have a much smoother march up, with the occasional large draw downs from severe bear markets.\n\nThe situation you described during CSP and CC phases of The Wheel is also correct, and is often the big risks associated with the strategy. If you take a closer look, the risk you described heavily overlaps with the risk that a person has when you buy good companies: they may have to hold them during painful times. The downside being that if you are utilizing The Wheel, if the company is managed well, survives, and rebounds through that painful time, the \"wheeler\" might miss out on the larger rebound. On top of this, during these painful times, the premium received is often quite low as you mentioned. As well as during bullish times, outsized upward movements will dwarf CSP premium.\n\nYour question is a great one because it effectively addresses the risks that often get overlooked. Just like people who held **$SPY** directly, people who were wheeling **$SPY** back in 2021/beginning of 2022, still have not recovered to their all-time high value (though some of this pain might have been mitigated if they fully closed out and accepted an early loss rather than held the shares through the entire drop).\n\nIn short, the decrease in the volatility that comes with The Wheel is a great benefit but does not come without considerations:\n\n* Will the stock explode upward leaving me behind? Am I ok with that? If not, you might want to consider going directly long on the stock.\n* Can I handle selling for pennies during heavy draw downs while I wait for the stock to appreciate enough to allow me to sell covered calls at a decent price?

AMZN after earnings. META yesterday on the FTC proposed ban.\n\n3) As earlier indicated, wheeling is more suited for folks that want to actively invest. Like someone once posted, you can beat SPY every year. Just buy SPY and sell a CC for 1c at a strike price way above the current price expiring every week. \n\n4) The whole point of wheeling is to try and juice you returns. \n\n5) Finally, think of extrinsic intangibles. Doing this now might make it easier to manage your account when retired. Imagine if you had a 3m account and just kept it in SPY not knowing what else you can do with it. I.e.

Selling a naked put, even if cash secured is risky. No, not as risky as just buying shares outright, BUT as someone mentioned the difference between a good trader and a great trader comes to risk management. People (whether they invest in real estate, stocks, or options) tend to only look at how much they can make. They never look at how much they can LOSE. This is the key to beating the index and what makes trading options worthwhile.\n\nSo what to do? Do a cash secured bull put spread. For example, TSLA was recently trading around 183, right before earnings. I wanted to play this. So what did I do? I sold a bull put spread expiring in a week, 180/175. I got 1.5 in credit. TSLA tanked after earnings, down to low 160s. No worries, I just sold my 175 put, took ownership of the stock, and got the break even down to 168.5. Selling calls on this becomes way easier.\n\nSame thing happened with CROX. I had a BPS at 123/118. I sold the 180 put this morning for 6.50, and it rebounded even more. My short put was at 123 but break even is now 115 and it closed at 114.48 today. Selling CCs then becomes way easier. \n\nThe only thing is this doesn\u2019t protect you if the stock drops further after you take assignment. But IMO I\u2019ve been averaging 20-40, sometimes even 50+% average annual return doing this. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me why wheelers do not advocate buying a put to reduce risk further.

Not much change, but jobless claim is a very lagging indicator of economic strength and won't rise significantly until we are well into a recession.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzn39ejrxvxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=d94ba9d9ac76ec49f9933b40371eb26192ea3492\n\nChallenger job cuts in April increased by 176% year-over-year, compared to the previous 319%. The report highlighted significant changes in the industries affected. The tech industry, which had been making headlines with massive job cuts since October 2022, saw a slowdown in April. Retail, on the other hand, took the lead. Consumer products, fintech, and real estate were also among the notable industries with significant job cuts. While the financial sector saw a decrease in job cut announcements (second only to tech), this may be a temporary phenomenon given bank shutdowns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zzr0pghmzvxa1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfba7d7cf105c360821223c185b3b5ccf2229d74\n\nThe GDPNow model for Q2 2023 from the Atlanta Fed has moved up to 2.7% (quarter-over-quarter annualized). Consumption's contribution has been boosted to +1.45%, housing remains relatively unchanged (-0.29%), and private inventories change is contributing +0.32%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yulzm0pxzvxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=17eae71aca50ea8955746ab7f27d27a5782451d4\n\nA lot of the GDP revision was from strong April auto sales. April new car sales were higher than last year, and CarGurus used car prices continued to rise in April as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hah06vtb0wxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=d22bba60eda73f5657dbd76abbb43c15eb7e827a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3j0ctdc0wxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3b73915015ba946abca4631d07a9fe808009246\n\nHowever, global supply chain pressures decreased again in April, with significant downward contributions from Euro Area delivery times, Euro Area stocks of purchases, and Korean delivery times. Demand continues to soften, but it looks like it's mostly from the EU.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryxqf005fwxa1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=64e0bd03a10df666a5a04930755565d87ec5fe1b\n\nIn the US, BAC data showed April total card spending down 0.7% year-over-year, but retail and food service remained unchanged, according to a different source. Some softness but doesn't seems to be significant.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yd200k9p0wxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=06132c8f0a8358d593dc8588dc4614444855dae4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrjcjiyp0wxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f407f9b1786c7136e1038009fdda01c38ee4bee\n\n**The Business**\n\nU.S. federal and state officials are assessing possible \"market manipulation\" regarding banking shares, according to Reuters citing a source. How could the banks, or God forbid, the Fed be wrong? If something happened, it must have been manipulated by investors, most likely retail investors, right?\n\nFerrari reported double beats, citing huge growth in America and China. The CEO stated that \"our order book already extends into 2025 with an award-winning product portfolio. We have decided to reopen orders for the Purosangue, suspended due to initial unprecedented demand, and launched the Roma Spider to further enrich our offer.\"\n\nBooking double beat, share price mostly unchanged; Gross travel bookings increased 44% from the prior-year quarter; Room nights booked increased 38%; Total revenues were $3.8 billion, an increase of 40%. Looking at these numbers, consumer demand in Q1 was indeed crazy. No guidance was given, but based on April occupancy data, the madness continues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzio5e682wxa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=513281881fbb4f357fbdab8625a0bd8bcb26dce6\n\nRedfin double beat, but guided lower; shares down 4%; looks like real estate won\u2019t peak up significantly in Q2 with high rates and home prices.\n\nApple beat both top and bottom lines with stronger than expected iPhone sales, increased dividends by 4%, and announced a $90B stock buyback. The stock is up 2% after hours. tbh, the earnings report was not great. Apple had two quarters of back-to-back decline in revenue. With the macroeconomic backdrop and the low guidance from Qualcomm and TSM, I just fail to see how things are going to get better for Apple and where the growth is going to be coming from. I hope the India story works out.\n\nMy positions have not changed from yesterday.", "id": "1382ae7", "created_utc": 1683239501.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Just want to say thanks for these posts.
