So if you are in a \"do it die\" mentality to wear either it wins or it loses, then you can do nothing and just wait until expiration and if it remains above 4480 then you will have your max loss, where your account will be debited $500 per contract, for a total of $4,000.\nYou subtract from this the credit that you received and then that will show you what your loss is for the trade.\n\nI took a quick look at the chart and on Monday SPX was hovering right around 4400, so you sold a narrow spread that was 75 points out of the money.\nBecause it is a narrow spread all SPX had to do was move 75 points and it would be ATM, with an 80-point move putting both legs ITM, which if it expires that way would be maximum loss.\n\nI would like to share with you what I have been doing to give you something to think about to compare against this position.\n\nI am using XSP, which is the mini SPX.  I sell spreads that are 15 to 20 points wide, and my typical entry is between 35 to 45 DTE.\n\nOne advantage of selling these wide spreads is how it gives me a much better opportunity to manage the position.  A good example is a current position that I entered a while back.  I sold a 440/455 call spread.  It was far OTM when I entered.  When XSP started moving above 435 I rolled it up to the 446/466 strikes.  Then I rolled that to the 452/468.  Today with SPX touching 452 I rolled it again up to 463/478.\nEach roll brought in more credit received, and each time I \"moved the goal post\" further away.\n\nThis relentless move on SPX/XSP has created the worst \"problem child\" position that I have had in a very long time. But, however, comma, there is a huge difference between this problem position and the problem positions that I had had before when like you I was selling narrow spreads. And that huge difference is at this time I do not have that flood of negative emotions causing me anxiety and worry. The biggest problem with a narrow spread is that an unusually large move blows past both legs and puts it into a near max loss situation very quickly. With this widespread it has not even gone anywhere near the maximum loss, and by being creative and adjusting the width of the spread or the number of contracts I can change the position to get it out of jeopardy and give it more time to do what it is supposed to do.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "This is such a detailed response, think I will definitely take this advice and move to a strategy more like this.

You already received the credit, so subtract that from the cost of closing the trade to calculate your loss. \n\nDo *not* roll only one side of the trade. In general, that doesn\u2019t make sense.

No offense. \n\nIn the future, keep in mind that you can only roll a spread for a credit when it is OTM (unless you go further ITM, which is usually a bad idea).
