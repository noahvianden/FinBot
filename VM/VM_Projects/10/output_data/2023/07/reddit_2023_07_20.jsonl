I know Tesla's talking about building a foundational model that in theory could achieve L4, but I strongly suspect that this is not the case and is *the* reason why they capitulated to allow the transference of FSD to the next vehicle. Because the foundational model requires a complete overhaul and that's going to take a significant chunk of time. Not as easy as flipping a switch.\n\nThey understand now how to solve the problem, but knowing how to solve the problem and solving the problem and having enough compute for it to be *safe* are three categorically *different* things.\n\nAs such, it's been my belief that Tesla, *internally*, with autonomy have been at:\n\nL2 w/ HW2. L3 with HW3, and L4 with the Cybertruck which is all HW4.\n\nHW4 upgrades the cameras from 1670x720 x8 to 2560x1920 x8. Independent of the total camera resolution aggregation, that's a 408% increase in per camera resolution. That's a 408% increase in the raw photon count. That's a 408% increase in geometric detail. Unfortunately, finding details on what the zoom depth of the image without zoom actuation on this is impossible, it would be safe to say that a 200% zoom at 5MP still delivers significantly more clarity than at 1.2MP.\n\nThis means that when having occupancy flow detection or even doing foundational world understanding, the safety margin is massive relative to preceding generation.\n\nIt also aligns to my suspected timeline for robotaxis. CT will reach full volume production in 2024. Highland will begin production end of 2024 and into 2025. Highland will upgrade tech and lower costs. It will likely share the hardware spec with the Gen3 platform, and take lessons learned and model/software optimization from CT and incorporate in. I suspect that HW4 will deliver L4 by 2025 and by 2026, they'll formally announce a robotaxis platform.\n\n2026 is also an important year, because the rate of the Las Vegas loop's expansion and scale of boring company's operation is such that by 2026, the entire loop should be nearing completion. Having L4 in the loop would be the *perfect* proving ground and opportunity to show regulators the general safety of the platform and to award them the certification.\n\nAnd then 2026-2030 they'll work towards L5.\n\nThe other reason why L/HW is tied, is because while Tesla is at a \"L3\" state, they insist on remaining at a L2 state because the liability issue at L3 is too significant. While the liability scope at L4 is not so significant and at L5 is insignificant. L3 carries the most reputational risk.

{"title": "Mergers & Thetagang - Activision ($ATVI) case study", "selftext": "Hello, all.  If you've seen some of my posts, I started trading the ATVI/MSFT merger opportunity around 3/31 of this year.  Here and there, I've listed some transactions when I had time, but I thought I'd do a longer post to explain the reasoning and thinking behind the positions I took and how they link to what was going on in the real world with the regulatory challenges.\n\nWhile I was aware of the merger, I didn't really do much with it for over a year, because I was betting that with a large complex deal with so many different countries antitrust authorities to approve it that it would take a while.\n\nI opened my first positions as naked short calls for 1/19/24 for 95 and 100 strikes.  This was around late March, early April when the stock was about $85 and the 95c's were trading from about $2.50 to $3.00 and the 100c's were around $1.80.  The logic behind this is that if the transaction were finalized, these calls would settle at zero, and if the merger failed the stock would fall probably about $20 a share which would collapse the value of the calls.\n\nThe risk of this trade is that the market could keep bidding up the calls, so I had to ensure I had spare buying power in my portfolio margin account so that I couldn't be forced into a margin call even if the calls tripled in value.  I sold short 75 contracts at this time.  The buying power reduction was relatively modest, about $50k from my memory, so easily accommodated by my portfolio margin account which had a NLV of about $180k at that time.\n\nOne temptation to avoid is selling puts as well and make it a strangle when there is still so much deal closure uncertainty, because there's essentially no buying power reduction.  But this is to be avoided because in case the merger is called off, the puts would lose value multiple times the credit collected.  The beauty of the naked short call at strikes above the acquisition price is that they would always become a winner unless a higher bid showed up (unlikely) or you were too low on unused buying power and got margin called (which is risk management)\n\nBy mid to late May, I had the chance to buy back all the options back for 50% or less of the original credit so I closed them.  That netted me about $9k.\n\nThe second phase I started trading Friday 7/7.  There was a little more risk on this play, because I was reading the court summaries about the FTC v. MSFT/ATVI case in front of Judge Corley.  It seemed to me that FTC's case for an injunction against MSFT was in terrible shape because they had failed in all key elements for a restraining order in an antitrust case including definition of market, showing harm to consumers, and proving that no other mitigations were available besides preventing the merger.   So I took the gamble that the injunction would not be granted, and I sold every 1/19/24 and 1/17/25 95c I could.  I was able to average about $2.50 for the 2024s and $4.20 for the 2025's, total of 77 contracts.  Similar to before, the risk was to not get margin called in case the market temporarily bid up these calls, so I had to keep buying power available to absorb a temporary MTM setback.\n\nThe news was announced on 7/11 that the FTC didn't get their injunction, and the calls collapsed.  I closed my 2024's between $0.60 and $1.05, and my 2025's between $0.95 and $1.30 (it was a wild day).  Locked in about $12.5k that day.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting.  Usually, at this point in a merger, I'd be done trading.  But after I did some research, it was clear to me that there was nothing stopping MSFT from closing the transaction, not even the UK (MSFT has the option to \"close over\" the UK, which basically means carving off the Activision UK business from the acquisition scope).  So to me, it was a matter of when, not if, the transaction would close.  So, I switched to selling ATM puts and/or buying stock and selling ATM calls (depending on which was better at put-call parity) for 7/21 expiration because I was confident that the price would not decline substantially as the market figured out it was just a timing issue.  I actually closed other positions to free up cash and buying power, so I was short the equivalent of 95 ATM contracts (Strikes from 90-92) and 27 OTM contracts (strikes 85 or below).  The ATM averaged a credit collected of about $2.20/share, and the OTM about $1.15 per share.  Why didn't I sell the 95 calls (unless covered)?  Well, there was the small risk that MSFT would negotiate a higher deal price in exchange for a delay and that was an unhedgable risk.  Well, those puts imploded in value today after MSFT and ATVI announced the terms of their extension, and I closed that tranche of trades for a profit of about $18k.\n\nSo, what's left?  I think most of the easy money has been squeezed out of this trade.  I've opened some much smaller positions of naked puts (8 contracts total) for 8/18 at 90 and 92.5 strikes, as I think the price is unlikely to fall below those levels as merger-arbitrage hedge funds will keep the price up for a while.   I was able to get those executed at an average credit of $2.01 today.  I also have 36 contracts of Jan24/Jan25 diagonals long the 2024 95c and short the 2025 100c, for an average credit of $0.15.  The idea here is that both contracts will converge to zero, but I'll admit, it's a poor quality trade from a risk-reward standpoint.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have done the diagonals.\n\nHere's a TLDR:\n\nPhase 1:  Sell naked 95 and 100c for Jan 2024 in March-April because the premium seemed high compared to buying power reduction, then close at 50% profit.\n\nPhase 2:  Sell naked calls for 95, 100 for Jan 2024 and Jan 2025 days before the court issued 7/11 ruling on FTC injunction.\n\nPhase 3:  Sell naked ATM and OTM puts for 7/21 expiration after the 7/11 ruling, but before terms of extension were announced based on belief that the merger was a question of when, not if anymore.\n\nPhase 4:  Sell a few naked 8/18 puts and (regrettably) a bunch of 2024/2025 95c/100c diagonals.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "154egk0", "created_utc": 1689820209.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "I have a question about the PM account, and the calls you sold.

{"title": "(07/20/2023) Tesla Daily News Brief", "selftext": "## 1. Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2023 Earnings Results: Expectations Beat Amid Record Quarter\n\nTesla posted its Q2 2023 earnings report, beating expectations. The company reported revenues of $24.93 billion, surpassing analysts' estimates of $24.32 billion. This represents a 47% year-over-year growth in revenue. Tesla's non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 2023 was $0.91, exceeding analysts' expectations of $0.79 per share. However, Tesla's operating income decreased slightly year-over-year to $2.4 billion in the second quarter, resulting in a 9.6% operating margin. Tesla's cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased sequentially by $700 million to $23.1 billion in Q2 2023, driven by free cash flow of $1 billion.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Q2 2023 Revenue: $24.93 billion\n- Q2 2023 Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share: $0.91\n- Q2 2023 Operating Income: $2.4 billion\n- Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments at the end of Q2 2023: $23.1 billion\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Q2 2023 earnings report is likely to have the most significant impact on Tesla's stock. The company's strong revenue growth and better-than-expected earnings could boost investor confidence and positively impact the stock price. However, the decrease in operating income could be a concern for investors as it indicates lower profitability. The strong cash position provides the company with financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, manage debt, and weather potential economic downturns.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tesla in Early Discussions to License Full Self-Driving to 'Major' Automaker\n\nTesla is in preliminary talks to license its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software to a major automaker. While the specific automaker has not been disclosed, it's noted that Ford and General Motors, who are developing their own self-driving efforts, were the first companies to adopt Tesla\u2019s NACS connector for their EVs.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Tesla is in early discussions to license its Full Self-Driving software to a major automaker.\n- Ford and General Motors were the first companies to adopt Tesla\u2019s NACS connector for their EVs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe licensing discussions could lead to further partnerships with other automakers, potentially expanding Tesla's influence in the EV market and positively impacting the stock price. If Tesla successfully licenses its FSD technology to other automakers, it could open up a new revenue stream for the company. However, it could also potentially strengthen Tesla's competitors in the long run, which could have a negative impact on the stock price.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tesla Requests Approval for Giga Berlin Expansion\n\nTesla has formally requested approval from local German authorities for Giga Berlin expansion and updates. The company plans to double its production capacity to 1 million cars per year and achieve 100-gigawatt hours of battery production at the plant.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Tesla plans to double its production capacity to 1 million cars per year.\n- The company aims to achieve 100-gigawatt hours of battery production at the plant.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nIf the expansion is approved and completed as planned, Tesla's production capacity will significantly increase. This could lead to a higher supply of Tesla vehicles, potentially increasing sales and revenue, which could positively impact the stock price. The proposed modifications suggest that Tesla is focusing on improving its operational efficiency. If these changes lead to cost savings and improved production efficiency, this could also positively impact the stock price.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tesla Cybertruck Designs Were in No Shortage as Musk Combatted 'Boring' Pickups\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck had numerous designs before the final version was unveiled. The Cybertruck has now reached initial production at Giga Texas, and deliveries are expected to begin soon.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- The Tesla Cybertruck had numerous designs before the final version was unveiled.\n- The Cybertruck has now reached initial production at Giga Texas.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe launch of the Cybertruck marks Tesla's entry into the pickup truck market, which could help the company reach a new customer base and increase its market share. This could also have a positive impact on the stock price. The start of Cybertruck production and the upcoming deliveries could be a positive signal to investors, indicating that Tesla is making progress in its product roadmap.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Tesla FSD Will Be Transferable for a Limited Time\n\nTesla has announced that it will allow owners to transfer Full Self-Driving (FSD) from one car to another starting in the third quarter of this year. This decision may translate into sales in the next quarter as many drivers have chosen not to upgrade their Tesla with newer models because of Full Self-Driving.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Tesla will allow owners to transfer Full Self-Driving (FSD) from one car to another starting in Q3 2023.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe decision to allow FSD transfers could lead to increased sales in the next quarter as it may encourage owners to upgrade their Tesla vehicles. This could positively impact the stock price. However, it could also potentially decrease the sales of FSD if owners choose to transfer their existing FSD purchase to a new vehicle instead of buying a new FSD package. The net impact on revenue and the stock price would depend on the balance between these two effects.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Tesla and Nissan Agree to NACS Compatibility in Most Recent Adoption\n\nTesla and Nissan have agreed that the Japanese automaker will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS), allowing Nissan's EV drivers to access Tesla's Supercharging Network starting next year. From Spring 2024 until 2025, Nissan's EV drivers will be able to access 12,000 of Tesla's Supercharging locations across the U.S and Canada with a supplied adapter.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Nissan will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS), allowing access to Tesla's Supercharging Network.\n- From Spring 2024 until 2025, Nissan's EV drivers will be able to access 12,000 of Tesla's Supercharging locations across the U.S and Canada with a supplied adapter.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe agreement with Nissan could lead to increased usage of Tesla's Supercharging network, potentially generating additional revenue for Tesla.
