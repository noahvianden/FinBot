{"title": "Fed no longer sees a recession, and other things we learned from Powell's press conference", "selftext": "https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/202307261107/fed-no-longer-sees-a-recession-and-other-things-we-learned-from-powells-press-conference\n\n'They're putting a soft landing back on the table,' one economist says\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 5.25%-5.5%. the highest level in 22 years in order to combat \"elevated\" inflation.\n\nWith financial markets and economists widely expecting the move, the focus was on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's one-hour session with reporters. Here are the four key takeaways from Powell's presser:\n\nFed staff is no longer forecasting a recession\n\nDuring the press conference, Powell made news by saying the Fed staff is now forecasting a \"noticeable slowdown\" rather than a recession. The reason for the shift, Powell said, is that the staff has seen the recent resiliency in the economic data.\n\nPowell said he also thinks the Fed can bring inflation down \"without the kind of really significant downturn.\"\n\nOrdinarily, we would have had to wait until Aug. 16, when the Fed releases a summary of its two-day meeting, to get a read on the staff's economic forecast.\n\n\"They're putting a soft landing back on the table,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group.\n\nBanks are not aggressively tightening lending standards\n\nEver since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, economists have been worried that other banks will pull back on lending and raise loan standards. So far, there has been a steady reduction in lending but no dramatic moves. The Fed keeps an eye on loan standards in quarterly surveys with bank officers.\n\nThe latest report is due next week, but Powell gave us a sneak preview, saying that lending conditions are tighter but not in an alarming fashion. \"I would just say it is broadly consistent with what you'd expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter,\" he said.\n\nPowell said credit conditions were a headwind facing the economy.\n\nSubadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe General, said her team thinks the Fed will not hike rates further, citing tighter lending starts and tighter credit standards as indicating they are done.\n\nWhy did Powell refuse to bite about 'one final hike' in September?\n\nIn June, the Fed forecast two more 25-basis-point rate hikes this year.\n\nWith one taken care of Wednesday, Powell was offered the opportunity to hint that the Fed was leaning toward a final rate hike in September. But he \"steadfastly refused to bite,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America Economist at Capital Economics.\n\nPowell also pushed back on the idea that the Fed is now on an \"every-other-meeting\" hiking schedule, which would imply a final hike at the start of November.\n\nVince Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer and now chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon, said he thought Powell is a chair \"behind his committee.\" While Powell wants to skip a hike in September, there are too many members of the Fed who are uncomfortable with such a signal, so Powell couldn't say it, he said.\n\n\"Powell is comfortable putting a policy-rate move off to November. Some people are less comfortable,\" Reinhart said.\n\nOn the other hand, Omair Sharif. the president of Inflation Insights, said it might have been hawkish that Powell never mentioned \"one more hike\" at all.\n\nSharif said this raised the possibility that there might be more than one hike before the Fed says it is done.\n\nAfter the meeting, traders in derivatives markets saw only a 40% chance of a rate hike by November.\n\nPowell suggests bar for another hike is high\n\nPowell did show his dovish colors a little bit when he said \"we've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.\"\n\nFed officials who are pressing for more rate hikes have said they do not expect many more \"effects\" on the economy from previous hikes.\n\n\"To the extent that the Fed views policy lags as relatively long, it suggests that they are going to be very careful in trying to avoid overtightening from here,\" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies.", "id": "15b2d5l", "created_utc": 1690465681.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Quite frankly, they didn't see the 2007 recession coming either, but in hindsight to us, it seems obvious.\n\nOn Oct 2007, 2 months before the recession began, the Fed saw upward surprise to consumer spending, nonfarm payroll was 170k, and Fed anticipated a soft landing.
