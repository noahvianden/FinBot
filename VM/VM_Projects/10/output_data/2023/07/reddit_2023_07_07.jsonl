{"title": "(7/7) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of the week. Here are your pre-market movers & news on this Friday, July the 7th, 2023-\n\n*****\n\n#[Stock futures are little changed as investors look toward Friday jobs report: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)\n\n*****\n> Stock futures were little changed Friday morning, as investors refocused their attention on the upcoming June jobs report and the implications for the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy stance.\n*****\n> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures were flat. Nasdaq-100 futures slipped by 0.2%. Levi Strauss shares tumbled 7% as the denim giant cut its profit outlook for the year.\n*****\n> This week\u2019s main event for economic data looms ahead: the Labor Department\u2019s June payrolls report, which is due Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate an increase of 240,000 positions, a cooldown from May\u2019s gain of 339,000 jobs.\n*****\n> Investors are on high alert for signs that the central bank will tighten policy even further. Traders now forecast a 91% chance the Fed will raise rates at its July meeting, according to the FedWatch tool from CME Group. Policymakers indicated at their June gathering that two more rate hikes could be ahead in 2023.\n*****\n> \u201cThe Fed is signaling a willingness to keep tightening, but markets aren\u2019t convinced it will happen as much as the Fed projects,\u201d Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, wrote in a bond market update. \u201cThe gap between the peak rate implied by the dot plot and market expectations has narrowed but hasn\u2019t closed.\u201d\n*****\n> The major averages slipped Thursday after data from ADP showed that private sector employers added 497,000 jobs in June. That figure far exceeded the 220,000 estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.\n*****\n> The ADP results spurred worries about the Fed\u2019s next steps. Bond yields spiked during regular trading Thursday, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury \u2014 which is most sensitive to the central bank\u2019s policy \u2014touching its highest level since 2007. Stocks also fell, as the 30-stock Dow shed more than 1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.8% each.\n*****\n> The three major averages are on their way to a losing week. The S&P 500 is off by about 0.9%, while the Nasdaq is on pace for a 0.8% decline. The Dow is the underperformer of the three, tracking for a 1.4% loss.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n# YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/g68YoMU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n# TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4n8AsU5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rh12XKR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OWX8zmj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/UTnac0r.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n(*N/A.*)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E8hCXx7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/iiPvbBK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rEYqUZw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jYgiHJb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/AoquS3Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tm1x6Dd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/i32OA6B.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com]()**)\n\n*****\n\n> **(TO BE POSTED LATER THIS MORNING.)** \u2014 (TO BE POSTED LATER THIS MORNING.).\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** (TO BE POSTED LATER THIS MORNING.)\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPY)**)\n\n*****\n\n#**DISCUSS!**\n\nWhat's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?\n\n*****\n\n# **I hope you all have an excellent final trading day of this week ahead today on this Friday, July 7th, 2023! :)**", "id": "14t4eh8", "created_utc": 1688728802.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "It's feeling like another red day to me", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "The bull in me wants to selectively buy a little in this Dip.

{"title": "Assigned naked puts and their meaning", "selftext": "Hey everyone! Semi-newbie here. \nBeen learning the stock market and how it works for the last 4 years, the last year of my learning was wholly dedicated to options, but there are some things I still don't fully understand. \n\nLet's say my account has a buying power of 100K$, and I just sold 5 naked puts for 175$ strike price of AAPL that expire in 4 weeks from now. \n\nNow let's assume the stock price went down to 174$ by expiration, and I got assigned. Will I necessarily get assigned on every option I sold, or it's possible for me to get assigned for 1 option, or 2/3? \n\nMy question in general is, does getting assigned mean that I'm assigned for every option I sell (5 in the case above), everytime, or that the full risk of me selling option is being assigned for a maximum of 5 options, and in reality I won't necessarily be assigned for all of the options I sold?", "id": "14tb10h", "created_utc": 1688745048.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "While assignment is random, it\u2019s also mostly automatic.
