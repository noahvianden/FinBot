I welcome your feedback of my opinions and hope to have a civil discussion.\n\nFor a far better insight into the company check out their annual letters here:\n\n[http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/static-files/bdd032a9-9b38-4847-b56d-40193536a5cb](http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/static-files/bdd032a9-9b38-4847-b56d-40193536a5cb)\n\n[http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/reports-financials-accept](http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/reports-financials-accept)\n\n\u00b7 **Lynch/Munger Test:**\n\no Is the company a hot stock in a hot industry or a boring stock in a boring industry?\n\n\u00a7 Boring\n\no Is the company going to be the next of something or an industry leader?\n\n\u00a7 Industry Leader\n\no Is the company seeking Diworsefication or focused on their core competencies?\n\n\u00a7 Focused\n\no Is the company run by a Mastermind or Idiot Proof\n\n\u00a7 Not a mastermind, not idiot proof\n\nIf there is >1 trait on the left side of the question, discard.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company\u2019s business model\n\n\u00a7 Credit Acceptance Corporation is the leading provider of sub-prime auto financing. They offer lending services to virtually anyone, even with poor credit or no credit.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue?\n\n\u00a7 This is fairly complicated. The TLDR is they make loans to subprime borrowers. The full answer is a little bit more complicated. CACC has two financing lines.\n\n\u00a7 The first is the portfolio program. In this arrangement, dealers pool multiple loans. The payments from those loans are first paid to CACC to reimburse collection costs. Second, they pay a \\~20% service to administer the loan. Third the payments cover the advances made to dealers and fourth to the dealer holdback.\n\n\u00a7 The second is the Purchase Program. Under this arrangement the car buyer provides the dealer with a down payment. CACC provided the dealer with a Cash Advance and then purchases the loan from the dealership. Roughly 35% of loans are under this program.\n\no Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or at a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. It is important to remember their sales come mostly from partnering with dealers directly. Therefore, it stands to reason that CACC comes into the picture anytime a dealer has a customer with sub-prime credit, which is fairly regularly.\n\n\u00a7 The auto financing market is highly cyclical. It does seem that we are in a downturn in auto. In management\u2019s 2021 annual report they remarked, \u201cWhile we expect vehicle availability and pricing to eventually return to normal, we do not expect that to occur within the coming months. Until it does, growing our business will be a challenge. Even when it does, the challenges that were present before the pandemic are likely to exist after it ends. There are no easy answers to these challenges, but we operate in a large market. There are still many dealers to enroll who would benefit from our program and we believe that we can make our product more valuable to the dealers enrolled in our program.\u201d\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, they are a subprime auto lender.\n\no Is their balance sheet well suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 This is mixed. Management indicated in their most recent 10-Q that expected cash flows are likely to be enough. CACC has $1.6, 1.3 and 1 billion of debt maturing in 23,24 and 25 respectively with trailing 12-month cash flows of $1 billion and they have been trending down of late. This means CACC must refinance their debt, should credit market seize this could make for an ugly scenario. Having said that, obtaining financing should be no issue for CACC. They have been GAAP profitable every year since 2002, grew GAAP profits every year during the financial crisis (2007 to 2010) and have GAAP margins between 25% to 55% over the past 3 years.\n\no Are there any large deviations in Operating Income and Operating Cash Flow and if so, why?\n\n\u00a7 While at times OI and OCF deviate, over the last 10 years they have more or less been the same.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. Cash Flow and Operating Income Margins have averaged over 65% during the past decade! FCF margins have been around the same and ROEs have maintained around 18 to 40%. The median over the past 5 years was 32.6%!\n\no Are there major company specific risks?\n\n\u00a7 Yes\n\n\u00a7 At the end of 2021 long term Chief Legal Officer and the CEO (2 different people) retired after starting with the company in the mid to early 90s.\n\n\u00a7 In my opinion its all but certain that we are in a recession. Given the nature of their low credit worthy borrowers, they may see cash flow diminished during an economic pinch.\n\n\u00b7 **Management Stake**\n\no What stake do the executives in the company have?\n\n\u00a7 CEO Kenneth Both has purchased $4 million of company stock and has an additional $45 million in options.\n\no How does the compensation plan for executive\u2019s work?\n\n\u00a7 Options are based on the stock Performance. Most granted when named CEO.\n\n\u00b7 **Can the company be replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Above 50% margins for a decade, high returns on equity despite an uncreditworthy customer base.\n\no Is technology likely to serve or harm the company?\n\n\u00a7 I believe that technology is likely to help the company. For example, in their 2021 letter to shareholders they indicated that they are embracing a remote work option to cut operating expenses.\n\n\u00a7 Having said that, technology may make it easier to offer sub-prime loans over times as alternative methods to evaluate risk are developed.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 It would definitely make a dent. Raising capital is typically not the issue with financial institutions, its allocating it. You would also need to convince dealers to leave them when they have established procedures and deals in motion. You would also need to get a large enough to gain the benefits of economies of scale and more predictable cash flows.\n\no Are there structural reasons why the supply of new competition is likely to be limited?\n\n\u00a7 Somewhat. Generally speaking, people don\u2019t like to enter subprime lending. It can have a bad stigma and has a reputation as a tough business. Think about repossessing a car. Its collateral that moves and can obviously anger and frustrate a person and their family.\n\no Are there structural reasons why customers are likely to stay with the company?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. CACC offers mission critical financing to their customers. Dealer\u2019s only get paid if cash comes in the door from a customer. Having said that, CACC acknowledges their high rates and expects much of their loans to be refinanced out of after their customers build their credit and obtain a lower cost loan. They are a lender of last resort for some.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 Scale. Given the vast number of loans, CACC is able to credibly predict collections. In the last 10 years the worst collection was 2.6% percentage points less than the expected collection rate. In 3 of the last 10 years they overestimated. They collected more than expected in 2020 and 2021. During the financial crisis (2007 to 2010), the collected less in only 1 year and by a margin of 2.7%. Generally, they collect 65 to 73% of loans written.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Car sales may move more from dealers to DTC. Given that CACC\u2019s customers are truly the dealers should this trend take further hold, they may need to uproot their go-to-market strategy.\n\n\u00a7 Some believe should we get sell driving vehicles, the total auto sales market will drop as more and more people opt to rent cars.\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 The advantage is that because CACC is willing to serve a mostly un-servable market. This allows them to get great terms on their loans. For example, the payments on loans written are required to reimburse them for costs first, then they share revenue with dealers in the portfolio program. Additionally, they charge a holdback to dealers when they have outstanding loans. This forces the dealers to maintain collateral in the event of non-payment.\n\n\u00a7 CACC also operates with a scale advantage. This allows them to have best in class stability and predictable financials in a very unpredictable market.\n\n\u00a7 Given the capital needs, banking execution needs, and cyclicality of the industry combined with a 19 year track record of average ROEs at 28.7%, this suggests the cemented nature of this business.\n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 90% might be generous given that we are coming off a booming auto market. Having said that net income has grown fairly reliability over time.\n\n\u00a7 CACC is pretty well entrenched in the subprime auto market. Historically, when a recession hits, competition among sub-prime lenders reduces as less lenders want to partake. Historically this has led to outsized growth in challenging times. From 2007 through 2011 (The Global Financial Crisis), GAAP Net Income increased by 6%, 22.7%, 113.9%, 22.7% and 24.7%. Of course, these growth rates are not likely but if you are fearful a recession will crush them for lending to junky creditors, it appears that has not been the case. It should be pointed out that car sales fell from \\~17 million to 9 million and then rose back to 14 million during that period. If we do get a recession, it will likely be less severe than 08-09 and therefore have a less pronounced effect. Additionally, since cars surged in price during covid, the value of the collateral may depreciate faster in a recession as prices return to normal. If this was not accounted for, losses may turn out to be wider than forecasted.\n\n\u00a7 Part of the reason why CACC benefited in earnings growth during the GFC was due to the fact many lenders pull out of subprime markets giving them more market share and a growing customer base.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, right around there in aggregate, far higher on a per share basis given their commitment to buybacks.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?\n\n\u00a7 I believe I do.\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 I believe it is.\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 As of their last 10-Q they had 12.9 million shares outstanding. They pay all excess capital out as share buybacks and over the last 3,5 and 7 years have reduced shares outstanding by 12%, 8% and 6.6% respectively. Its trading at an all-time high FCF yield of 20% but faces rough financials in the coming quarters. All in all, I expect shares will decrease by -8% to -4.5% over the next 3 years as higher rates will likely mean higher FCF yields and therefore more purchases per dollar of FCF.\n\n\u00a7 Analysts expect revenue to be $1.915 billion in 3 years, basically flat from 2022 levels as CACC comes off the covid sugar high in car sales. Given my expectations of a recession, I will model the bull case with a 15% premium to estimates and the bear case with a 30% discount to estimates for 2025.\n\n\u00a7 FCF Margins have historically ranged between 50 to 62.5% of 56.3%. Over the past 10 years, inflation was minimal, and recessions were short (covid). To that end, going forward, I will assume a 48% to 60% FCF Margin for a new midpoint of 54%.\n\n\u00a7 FCF Yields have hovered between 8.5% and 22% for a midpoint of 14.25%. Excluding COVID times, over the past 10 years, FCF Yields ranged between 7.5% to 13%. Given the higher rate environment and potential for more volatile collections, I feel a FCF yield of 9.5% to 15% for a midpoint of 12% is more appropriate for the period ending in 2025.\n\n\u00a7 Putting it all together we get an estimated value on 12/31/25 between $640 to $887 for a midpoint of $763.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 Currently CACC trades for $441 which at the estimated midpoint implies an 20% CAGR. Given the risks in this business, I would like to have the expectations of earning no less than 11% on an investment indicating the company is fairly valued to slightly undervalued.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:CACC](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:CACC)\n\nIR Page: [http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/](http://www.ir.creditacceptance.com/)\n\nAuthor is long CACC", "id": "10jt5r7", "created_utc": 1674522450.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Avoid CACC like the plague for at least 2 years", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25089192390441895}, {"body": "Incredible.

Okay, it's not 'bad', but it's overly complicated and makes assessing your true market cap weights difficult.\n\n\n\n**Portfolio 1**: This basically looks like US large cap, US large cap (but tech/growth biased), and US large cap (value biased). In totality, this portfolio is just (US large cap) x 3. If you just did 100% VOO, it would more or less be the same thing. This is like ordering a burger (but no cheese), then the top half of the burger (no cheese = small caps), followed by the bottom half of the burger (no cheese).\n\n**Portfolio 2:** You have US large cap, all of US stocks, and then the two biggest holdings in the US stock market. It's like ordering burger but missing the patty (small/mid caps), and then another burger. Why not just order the burger (VTI)? And then, you add on the two biggest ingredients of the burger as an additional side: a slice of cheese, and a piece of lettuce. You already have that in the burger, so just buy more of the burger.\n\n**Portfolio 3:** This is US large cap, then US large cap growth, and again the two biggest holdings. Calculate how much weight you put into MSFT. Does MSFT need to be such a massive portion of your portfolio?\n\n**Portfolio 4**: US large cap, then again US large cap with tech/growth bias, then international. Not as bad, but why not just go all in on US large cap and international at that point.\n\n**Critiques**:\n\n- A general critique of these is that you are skipping out on the most rewarding stock market segments there are: small cap value or mid caps, or .... Large cap growth stocks aren't the best performing stocks in the market! Why target all the trillion dollar companies only? By concentrating in SCHD/VOO/QQQ you are going mega-long on the biggest companies on the planet only. (And all in one country)\n\n- Needs more international! (Just a little more, say 20%)\n\n- Simplify simplify simplify. Just pick something like 80% VOO and 20% VXUS, or (in my opinion better), 80% VTI and 20% VXUS. Or 100% VT.

{"title": "Lithium Has No Competition: Chapter 2", "selftext": "As I  mentioned last week Lithium has no competition then I listed many battery companies including American Battery Technology Company.\n\n**The following was published today in the RENO GAZETTE JOURNAL**\n\nTesla will launch a new multi-billion-dollar advanced manufacturing project in Northern Nevada for its semi truck and batteries, the latest investment by the electric vehicle and technology company in the Silver State.\n\nThe project was confirmed by a White House spokesperson to the Reno Gazette Journal on Tuesday. Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo also mentioned the new facility in his recent state of the state address.\u00a0\n\nBoth provided different numbers for the cost of the project, which they say will top the $3 billion mark.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to joining Elon Musk and the team at Tesla tomorrow when they unveil plans to build a brand new $3.5 billion-dollar advanced manufacturing facility in Northern Nevada for the company\u2019s all-electric semi-trucks,\u201d Lombardo said in his speech.\n\nThe Tesla project is expected to create 3,000 jobs in Nevada, according to Mitch Landrieu, the Biden administration\u2019s infrastructure chief.\n\n\u201cThe manufacturing boom of President Biden\u2019s first two years continues today with Tesla\u2019s announcement that they will invest more than $3.6 billion in battery and electric semi-truck manufacturing in \u2026 Nevada,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cThis announcement is the latest in more than $300 billion in private sector investment in clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing announced since the President took office.\u201d\n\nNorthern Nevada is also the site of Tesla\u2019s first Gigafactory, which is located in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center just east of Reno-Sparks.\n\nThe new Tesla project will benefit from several incentives, said Haris Talwar, a White House spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get production tax credits and their vehicles \u2026 qualify for consumer tax credits from President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d Talwar said.\u00a0\n\nMoney from the infrastructure law that Biden signed in November will also be going to the Tesla project\u2019s suppliers, Talwar added.\n\nThe new Tesla facility is the latest of several Nevada-based projects to receive federal incentives as the Biden administration makes a push to shore up the domestic battery industry.\n\nEarlier this year, the Department of Energy made a commitment to lend $700 million to Ioneer LTD for its Rhyolite Ridge lithium project.  Last year, the federal government also awarded multiple grants to Nevada companies, including a $57.7 million grant to American Battery Technology Company as well as Lilac Solutions.", "id": "10kj5p0", "created_utc": 1674601447.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 days ago\n**Total Comments**|13|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Tesla is launching a new manufacturing project in Northern Nevada that will cost over $3 billion and create 3,000 jobs.
