Although CPI figures are favorable, inflation is going down, but it\u2019s still too high right now. 6.5% CPI YoY compare with the Fed\u2019s target 2% YoY. Additionally, there are still rate hikes in the future. Fed is looking for a terminal rate of 5% and expecting one year to stop rate hikes and bring the inflation down. Job market is still tight, unemployment is keeping low at 3.5% under this condition. I feel like last week is a rebound driven by sentiment, not rational thinking.

Nobody, certainly not Biden will even consider their suicidal blackmail.  It\u2019s just not how we are wired.  The higher rates would have eventually become a problem for the national debt, but with the debt ceiling, it\u2019s a self inflicted crisis.

{"title": "SLABS the CDO of student loans", "selftext": "In 2008, the housing market crash was centered around CDO's and synthetic CDO's. This created a bubble based on the idea of \"who doesn't pay their mortgage\" well shortly after the 2008 crash \"bespoke tranche opportunities\" became a huge part of every market. These allowed banks to sell securities in really any with a loan involved. One of the most dangerous BTO's is the SLABS or \"student loan asset-backed securities.\"\" \n\nThe main reason the 08 crash was kicked off is in the CDO securities balloon payments, adjustable interest rate loans, and a general down tick in the market all kicked in roughly around 07-08 on many subprime loans.   These home owners had horrible credit ratings and should have never been given a loan in the amounts or areas they wanted.  Well, now, with SLABS, you have millions of people who took out student loans with zero collateral and zero credit ratings. Each given thousands of dollars and no way to back out of the loan. These SLABS  are full of the same subprime individuals as the B,BB, and BBB bonds for housing. However, it is much worse. With covid preventing much of the market from spinning its gears, many people took advantage of the student loan payment freeze. Nearly every student loan payment has been stopped. The government is paying the interest rate to keep the securities afloat. \n\nThis could be much worse as BTO's also deal with auto loans and credit card debt of all the lldebt listed so far, Generation Z and millennials have the most of.  If the payments for student loans are unfroze and resumed, the default rate would insane. We will see markets collapse wholesale. This needs to stop. This has been happening for centuries, and every time, the market is bigger, and the crash is more complete.  Do you think it could be good to find out when President Biden will resume the payments, and before that short the position on SLABS and Auto/consumer credit BTO's?", "id": "10e4lqq", "created_utc": 1673935287.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 12, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: The 08 crash was caused by subprime loans, and the same thing is happening with student loans.

{"title": "Morning Briefing \ud83c\udf1e Jan 17th 2022 - Let's see if we're correct again", "selftext": "Welcome back from the holiday weekend. It\u2019s only been two weeks, but 2023 has been kind to stocks. The Dow is up 3.5%, the S&P 500 has jumped 4.2%, and the Nasdaq, which had the worst 2022 of the three indices, is up 5.9%. Even though the Federal Reserve has stuck with its plan to keep raising rates to bring inflation down, recent data show consumer prices cooling off, even as the job market remains robust. While investors await the Fed\u2019s next rate decision, on Feb. 1, in the meantime they will be processing the first wave of quarterly earnings reports. Several big banks reported Friday, as did Delta Air Lines. Tuesday brings more banks before the bell (see below) and United Airlines after the close. Procter and Gamble and Netflix report Thursday. Investment banking at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup didn\u2019t look pretty in the fourth quarter, so now Wall Street looks to Goldman Sachs for its take on that segment of the banking industry. Goldman, which reported earnings Tuesday morning, posted lower-than-expected profit and revenue for the quarter, and investment banking was a big culprit. \u201cOur clear, near term focus is realizing the benefits of our strategic realignment which will strengthen our core businesses, scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency,\u201d CEO David Solomon said in the earnings release. China\u2019s population fell last year for the first time since the 1960s. Mainland China\u2019s population declined by 850,000 to 1.41 billion, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported, factoring in 9.56 million births and 10.41 million deaths.\n\n**Overall Market Outlook:** \n\n**SPY:** Bullish candle close on the weekly TF. We have now reclaimed the 21Ema, 50WMA, and 200WMA on the weekly. And we have a Bullish Engulfing candle close on the daily TF. We also reclaimed the 200MA on the daily. And we are sitting right below the longterm downward trendline we have been rejecting for the last year. Above 398.50 we could see 399 then 399.40 and if we can reclaim that level and hold we can then see 399.80 and if that level can be reclaimed and hold we can see some more upside! Below 396.40 we could see 395.75 then 395.20 and if that level can't hold us up we will then see 394.75 and from there if no hold we will see 393.85 level. below there next we will see 393.50 then 392.80 level.\n\n**QQQ:** Bullish Marabuzo candle close on the weekly TF. We reclaimed the 8Ema, and 200MA on the weekly. And we started to squeeze as well on the weekly TF getting ready for a big move! And we have a Bullish Engulfing candle close on the daily TF. And we are in a rising wedge on the hourly TF. Above 280.80 we could see 281.20 then 281.50 and if we can reclaim that level and hold we can then see 282 then 282.75 level. And if we can hold above 283 we can make are way up to 284.40 and from there can see some more upside! Below 278.50 we could see 278 and if that level can't hold us up we will then see 277.20 then 276.80 and if those levels don't hold from there we can see 276 then 275.50 then 274.80 level again.\n\n**TSLA:** Bullish indecisive spinning top candle close on the weekly TF. And we have a Bullish Marabuzo candle close on the daily TF. We are squeezing setting up for a move on the 4Hr TF. And still in a symmetrical triangle on the 1Hr TF. Take 132c or 135c Calls above 127.40. Take 112p Puts below 117.10 BNH. Expected Move +/- $8.59\n\n**NVDA:** Bullish Marabuzo candle close on the weekly TF. We reclaimed the 8Ema, 21Ema, 50WMA, and 200WMA on the weekly TF. And we have a Bullish Marabuzo candle close on the daily TF. And we have now reclaimed the 200MA on the daily. And we have a rising wedge on the 4Hr and 1Hr TF. Take 180c Calls above 172.60 BNH. Take 160p Puts below 166.30 BNH or 165.85 safer entry.

{"title": "A Very Rad DD: Denison mines $DNN", "selftext": " \n\nHello and welcome to some Rad DD (See what I did there?). Welcome to some DD. Below I intend to discuss the company Denison Mining ticker DNN, what they do, why I like them, some of their risks, and why I'm long term bullish. As a warning this is a long play on a company I like, there is no squeeze play here. There is no 0DTE, weekly or even monthly play to be had. This is about a company that won't even be earning money until 2025 (Though the price should rise well before then). If you're looking for your next get rich quick YOLO, this isn't it. but if you want to learn about a good company that can make you some money feel free to read.  Now as always, I realize I\u2019m writing this for 3 people since it's not some YOLO quick cash grab, so I\u2019ll get right to this.\n\n**Denison What they do?**\n\nBefore we dive into a company, logically one would want to know what does this company even do. Well let me answer that for you simply, they dig up rocks. More specifically, they dig up green glowing rocks. Or at least that\u2019s what they want to do. See Denison is something in the mining world called a development company. What this means is they have a nice patch of land with the rock they want to dig up, in this case uranium. What they don\u2019t have is an actual mine up and running to do this. They\u2019re in the process of developing a mine (Hence development company). Now to be more specific, Denison has 2 patches of uranium in Canada they are hoping to turn into mining projects: Phoenix, their flagship project and Gryphon. Their plan as a company is to build mines at each site, pull uranium out of the ground and sell it for money. Pretty simple business model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Uranium? Waste of Time!**\n\nI already did a very long sector DD on uranium and why it isn't as dead as many people feel.  Feel free to check the link below if you want to read the full thing. For the sake of this I'll keep it simple. Nuclear energy is not being replaced in the next 5 years. It accounts for 18% of all US electrical generation and that's going to take a very long time to turn into wind or solar. I'm not saying nuclear power plants are the future or anything. I'm saying the US isn't going to just replace 18% of their electrical generation over night, and they can't allow it to just disappear, unless blackouts sound cool. But again, check the DD below if you want more info. I have enough to discuss here so I'm moving on.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z358vi/dd\\_uranium\\_sector\\_come\\_glow\\_with\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z358vi/dd_uranium_sector_come_glow_with_me/)\n\n**Athabasca Basin**\n\nI\u2019m going to go into specifics about the area Denison\u2019s projects are located, feel free to skip if this doesn\u2019t interest you. Denison\u2019s two projects are located in a specific area of Canada called the Athabasca Basin. [Here\u2019s a link if you want to learn about this sector of Canada for some reason](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/educational-resources/history-geological-survey-canada-175-objects/43-athabasca-basin-1888). And here's a photo for the visual folks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4995dxaj9oca1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=073b91bda1164d693b48225d60511b678261ee5d\n\nNow here\u2019s the think to know about this area, it is the place to find and mine uranium. You get the highest grades of anywhere on the planet here. Forget Africa digging up slightly enriched sand, Athabasca Basin pulls some crazy numbers. Kazakhstan has the cheapest uranium, but that's because they have very low environmental regulations keeping price down. Athabasca has by far the highest quality. [Here\u2019s an article talking about just how good Athabasca Basin is compared to other areas for those who want more reading](https://investorintel.com/energy-oil-gas-uranium/canadas-athabasca-basin-the-worlds-richest-uranium-play/). Now I don\u2019t want to spend hours boring you with geological surveys and other information. It will take too long to write up and let\u2019s be real, 99% of you will skip it anyway because it\u2019ll have no meaning to you. What I want to emphasize here is this, Denison is working on 2 projects in what is considered the premiere location for uranium mining. It has the highest grades, the best deposits and is a very mining friendly jurisdiction (Both the local government and first nation\u2019s people tend to permit mining projects so long as they follow guidelines). So big takeaway, projects in a mining friendly area that often has high quality projects. And that\u2019s exactly what Denison has found, quality projects in a quality area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ok Let\u2019s Talk Project.**\n\nAs stated before, Denison has two main projects, Phoenix and Griffin. These projects are located on a patch called Wheeler River. Here's another photo for the visual folks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oukm923aoca1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0f667ddc652defad459d5f528d46f7c87bd9d3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n And as stated Phoenix is the flagship project for them. So, let\u2019s break these two projects down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Gryphon:* This is Denison\u2019s \u201clesser\u201d project, though that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s worth dismissing. But if you want you can 100% skip this and go right to Phoenix since that\u2019s the project that will likely drive the company\u2019s price. Gryphon is located on Wheeler River, the site of Denison's two projects. Denison conducted a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) in 2018 for the entire Wheeler River location, which included both Gryphon and Phoenix. This study is designed to assess several things, but the most important ones are the economic merit (Is it worth the money being put in to make a mine) and the environmental impact. [You can find an overview of the entire projects and their results here,](https://denisonmines.com/projects/core-projects/wheeler-river-project/) but I\u2019ll sum it up for you. Gryphon is estimated to have 49.7M lbs of U3O8 (1,257,000 tonnes at 1.8% U3O8). [This 1.8% grade falls in line with similar projects in the Basin and well above sandstone projects that run between 0.05-0.4%. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_ore#Unconformity-related_deposits)Now there are better grades out there, Cameco\u2019s McArthur River has an average grade around 18%, but that\u2019s a very special project. Don\u2019t let that high number distract you into thinking Gryphon is graded low, it is a very good grade with medium graded projects falling at only 0.50%. The project is estimated to cost Denison $11.70 per pound in operation costs with an estimated initial capital investment of $465.1 million, an estimated 77% profit margin at $50/lb uranium and an all-in cost of $22.82. (The all-in cost is the most important pricing since it tells you how much per pound it costs when EVERYONE is paid, and equipment expenses covered. Always look at the all-in cost compared to the SPOT price when evaluating a mining project). In Denison's words \"The Gryphon deposit is designed as an underground mining operation, utilizing a conventional long hole mining approach with processing of mine production assumed at Denison\u2019s 22.5% owned McClean Lake mill.\" The mill is important as it will be used to process the ore coming out of Gryphon, and since Denison has a stake in it, they won\u2019t be looking for expensive milling agreements which can cost companies a large percentage of their ore to sign. Now as I said, this is not their premiere project, and Denison doesn\u2019t expect to have this running until 2030. But it is worth mentioning as a quality project the company owns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Phoenix:* Alright let\u2019s get to the big boy, Phoenix. The project that justifies owning this company. Phoenix is estimated to have a 10-year mine life, producing an average of 6 million pounds/year. The grade is super high at 59.7 million lbs U3O8 (141,000 tonnes at 19.1% U3O8) and yes that\u2019s an amazing 19% grade, which matches the top-level projects of even Cameco. An average operating cost of $3.33 per pound, $241 million initial capital cost, 89% profitable at $29 per pound uranium and has an all-in cost of $8.90, which is insanely cheap. I want to be clear, if pulled off, Phoenix would become one of the highest grade and lowest cost projects on the entire planet. They\u2019re 89% profitable at $29 uranium and [RIGHT NOW uranium is trading at $49 per pound](https://twitter.com/numerco) and is projected to go UP in price. In fact, the global all-in sustaining costs to meet yearly demand is around $65-70, that\u2019s double the price Phoenix needs to hit 89% profitability. Phoenix is projected to be online by early 2025.\n\n**More About Phoenix**\n\nSo as established above, Phoenix has the potential to be a top project globally. So, the question becomes, why isn\u2019t everyone buying this company if the project is so good? Well, here\u2019s the thing, the reason Phoenix is projected to be so profitable is twofold, the first is the high grade, but the second is the mining method. See Phoenix has a problem, it\u2019s deep in the ground and while it's high quality the patch isn't large enough to justify a conventional mine like Gryphon. And that\u2019s the type of mine used in the Basin, a conventional mine. But it\u2019s not the only mine. I\u2019m not going to get into every mine type, but I will bring up the one that matters In Situ Recovery (ISR). [Now if you want a big in depth read, look here.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/in-situ-leach-mining-of-uranium.aspx#:~:text=In%20situ%20leaching%20(ISL)%2C,the%20minerals%20can%20be%20recovered.) But if you\u2019d rather I tell you, listen up. In Situ Recovery is a mining method used by about 50% of all uranium mines on the planet. It\u2019s rather simple. You make a well in the ground where uranium is, you fill it with an acidic solution (think soda water), you let the solution dissolve the uranium, you suck up the solution with the dissolved uranium, you do a lot of processes to evaporate the solution leaving behind powdered uranium, you put the powder in barrels, and you sell it. That\u2019s the super basics of it, feel free to read the link above to find out more. Now here\u2019s the thing about ISR in the Basin, they can\u2019t do it. The soil doesn\u2019t allow ISR mining, it\u2019s too porous and the solution will leach out. So, nobody does it. They\u2019ve tried, they\u2019ve failed, they\u2019ve given up. There is no ISR mining in the Basin at all.\n\n**Denison\u2019s Freeze Wall**\n\nNow you might be thinking \u201cBut Rad you said Denison needs ISR but can\u2019t do it, what\u2019s up?\u201d Well, here\u2019s the thing. Denison is working on a brand-new mining method they\u2019re calling a freeze wall. What is a freeze wall? Well, It\u2019s simple (not really but whatever). Denison plans to build a wall of ice around their wells in order to prevent the solution from escaping. See the image below as an example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vplrt00wboca1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b900d4cdfc3123bdd5655e59a83fad8aa0741a\n\nHere\u2019s their exact explanation of this project \u201cAt Wheeler, in order to contain the solution within the uranium deposit and maximize recovery as well as prevent interaction of the mining solution with surrounding groundwater, Denison will create an isolated mining chamber using conventional ground freezing technology. Ground freezing will establish an impermeable barrier above and on all sides of the mining chamber, with the existing impermeable basement rock acting as a bottom barrier. The approximate dimensions of the mining chamber are 100 m wide x 30 m high x 1,300 m long, and it will be located approximately 400 m below the surface.\u201d\n\nThis is the key to their entire company. Either they pull off this freeze wall and become a top global project making massive returns or it fails, and this project is done. A very binary bet. But one I think is worth making. See Denison has done several field tests on their ISR project, and to date, they have been able to t successfully contain any leaking, recover the solution AND recover uranium in their testing. [You can read here about their most recent successful field test published on December 12th of 2022. ](https://denisonmines.com/news/denison-announces-successful-completion-of-neutral-122782/)The long story short, it was a full-on success and while the process isn\u2019t fully proven, it\u2019s a major step to derisking and proving out this new mining method.\n\n**ISR in the Basin Offers More**\n\nSo, I\u2019ve mentioned how this process would open up a major mine for Denison and how ALL field tests have been positive so far. But there\u2019s another major upside here. If they prove this tech out, it opens major avenues for Denison. Frist, Denison now can turn to any nearby project that was deemed unfeasible due to being too deep for a conventional mine and buy it up. They now have a method to mine previously thought dead projects, projects with millions of exploration already done and PFS\u2019s already put out. So, they\u2019ll have the data AND be the only ones who can actually mine that patch. It opens massive growth for them. But there\u2019s even more. Not only does it open Denison to purchasing projects, but it also makes them a massive target for a buyout. Cameco (the biggest uranium miner in Canadas) will be desperate for Denison\u2019s ISR technology. I would not be shocked at all if after ISR is proven out Cameco comes in with a massive check to buy them and their ISR technology out. Because that\u2019s going to be proprietary technology, and EVERYONE is going to want it. So, either Denison becomes a major player and I make bank on shares, or they receive a massive buyout and I again make bank on shares. Not a bad result.\n\n**Are there risks?**\n\nHave you read anything I wrote? Yes. ISR can fail. There is a lot of skeptics of this project with at least one former mine developer of Cameco flat out saying there is no chance Denison can ever pull this off.  It is a massive gamble because anything goes wrong, the project is done. Not delayed, not more expensive, if they can't do ISR there is no Phoenix mine, period. Not to mention they can have the permits for ISR denied by the Canadian government for all sorts of reasons. And if that happens this company is going to see a near 70% drop almost immediately on that news. The risks are MASSIVE, but so is the upside, and isn\u2019t that what we just love. Major risks with major upside.\n\n**Financials**\n\nI\u2019m going to do a little financials here but it\u2019s not a focus of this DD, mostly because this company really hinges on the Phoenix site and their ISR project. Also, because they\u2019re not mining, they\u2019re building a mine so any type of net cash flow, P/E or what not is not going to tell a good story. But we can look at their cash reserves. They have a cash reserve of $41 million USD. Additionally, they bought 2.5 million pounds of U3O8 at a weighted average price of $29.66 per pound and a total cost of approximately $74.15 million. With uranium currently trading at around $50/lb, Denison's holdings are worth about $125m, or about 12.5% of the company's current billion-dollar valuation. So, their combined assets are about $160 million. Denison has stated the pounds of uranium they hold will be used to help secure initial contracts as reassurance to utilities they have supply on hand they can deliver should delays happen while the mine is being built. Now you might say \u201cBut Rad, don\u2019t they need $240 million to build their mine at Phoenix.\u201d Why yes, they do. So, what does that mean? It means Denison will likely have to raise money before they get their Phoenix project online. So that means dilution at some point between now and 2025. But why would I ever bring up a company that will need to dilute shares? Well, here\u2019s why. First, if they get to the point of raising the cash it means ISR was proven so the company should have already done a MASSIVE move up. Second, because if you find this company interesting, and you know they\u2019ll have to raise cash, you can put money to the side and be ready to buy some shares when that dilution is announced. I\u2019m giving you a chance to plan ahead here.\n\n**Ok So What Do I Do?**\n\nAh the most important and most difficult part. Do you YOLO every penny into Denison? Well let me make that simple, NO. Do you buy some now? NO. I don\u2019t like the price now, it\u2019s too high. I wouldn\u2019t want to add anywhere above $1.07 personally and might be greedy and wait for it to hit $1.03. Currently it\u2019s trading at $1.29, nowhere near where I\u2019d buy in. But Rad, why tell us all this about a company and end with don\u2019t buy yet. Well, because I want you to make money. I want you to be successful. So, I want you to WAIT for a good entry point. I could easily say \"Buy now YOLO go go go.\" But why do that when it's over bought in my eyes. A better price will come. And I fully expect, come July Denison will give you that price, because uranium is amazing at selling off over the summer. That\u2019s right, Rad is telling you in January to set money to the side to buy shares in July at a much lower cost. Talk about a kind dude. I\u2019m giving you almost 5 months to prepare, a good entry target and a full DD. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n**TLDR:** Nope, I'm not doing a TLDR for an entire company. How could anyone condense a company into 2 sentences? What I'm gonna say DNN to the moon and post a rocket? Forget it.

{"title": "Is it time to sell CROX after 165% rally?", "selftext": " \n\n**Overview**\n\nCROX sell footwear under 2 brands, CROX, and the recent acquisition HEYDUDE. Their distribution channel consists of wholesalers (selling bulk to retailers) and directs to consumers According to Piper Sandler's teen survey and The NPD Group\u2019s Retail Tracking Service CROX brand is respectively 5th favorite for teens+mens and 4th favorite for kids. Also with the acquisition of HEYDUDE, they own the 7th favorite brand in Piper Sandler's teen survey.\n\n**Income Breakdown**\n\nWhen you think of CROX you think of clogs which accounted for just over half of $985 million and the CROX brand operating margin of 27.9% in Q3. HEYDUDE had $269 million on a 28% operating margin. Guidance: Originally expectations of HEYDUDE were 1 billion by 2024 but management says \"it's sort of pretty obvious that we will achieve that next year. So \\[we\u2019ve\\] achieved that kind of billion dollar mark by 2023\" showing the rapid growth of HEYDUDE CROX are guiding for long-term operating margin to be 27%. After expecting to finish 2022 with 53% revenue growth CROX has guided for 10-13% $3.9B-$4.0B from 2022 expected revenue of $3.55B.\n\n**How concerned should we be with a net debt position of $3.77 billion?**\n\nI am not concerned but it is a hurdle for management. CROX took a $2 billion loan that matures in 2029 amassing the LTD to $2.6 billion. Using my estimates we end with $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the next 5 years which will be enough to cover the loan in 6 years. Management has already seen the debt and has reduced borrowing by $300 million in the 4th quarter and $500 million since the acquisition of HEYDUDE.\n\n**Competition** **(**[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-J89yKxMGiJtDdF6xAPB2bMkj32j0jpvpeT3O70Azc/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-J89yKxMGiJtDdF6xAPB2bMkj32j0jpvpeT3O70Azc/edit?usp=sharing)**)**\n\nCROX have been able to churn profits and reinvest its capital better than competitors. Are these numbers relatively high for CROX? No, I don't believe that the mentioned margins are too high as CROX has built a brand name for their products and continues to expand on them which will lead to margin expansion. They have expanded using Jibbitz contributing to 6% of revenue, Jibbitz are placed in the holes of clogs and customizable to each shoe. Management said they will have jibbitz on HEYDUDES. I'd like to mention margins have been hit already since the COVID surge.\n\n**Threats**\n\n1. Established companies with a significant presence in the footwear industry, such as Under Armor, Adidas, and Nike, pose a serious threat to CROX.\n2. Footwear is cyclical and trendy meaning consumers may be unfavorable for Crox as we have seen in the past, consumers may start to favor alternative shoe designs, which would reduce the market for CROX goods. They have branched into different shoe designs with the acquisition of HEYDUDE\n3. Consumer spending will be significantly impacted by the impending recession, which would lower CROX sales. The business had to lay off 2,000 employees and close hundreds of locations throughout the world in the 2008 recession.\n\n**After all research explain evaluation + valuation of the company (**[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-J89yKxMGiJtDdF6xAPB2bMkj32j0jpvpeT3O70Azc/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-J89yKxMGiJtDdF6xAPB2bMkj32j0jpvpeT3O70Azc/edit?usp=sharing)**)**\n\nNow to the question of the title. If you have held CROX so far congratulations, you've made a nice profit but you should start to sell if you haven\u2019t, it never hurts to realize gains and start the year off positive. CROX has proven to be volatile and host a beta of 1.8. I personally don\u2019t have a large enough account to sell puts but if I did I would be selling them for around $100 with whatever date you deem a good risk/reward. Now what I will do is I will put a trigger price at $105 and come back to this post to see if my thesis changed.\n\nI haven't done an analysis like this and didn't go as in-depth as I had hoped. You may be interested in the company's buyback history and go in-depth with the management. I would appreciate feedback and may not respond quickly as I still have high school classes.", "id": "10epnih", "created_utc": 1673994460.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10epnih/is_it_time_to_sell_crox_after_165_rally/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Sell CROX if you haven't already (not financial advice)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "PUT YOUR HANDS UP VisualMod!!!
