{"title": "Fed officials see higher rates for \u2018some time\u2019 ahead", "selftext": "Federal Reserve officials are committed to fighting inflation and expect higher interest rates to remain in place until more progress is made, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank\u2019s December meeting.\n\nAt a meeting where policymakers raised their key interest rate another half a percentage point, they expressed the importance of keeping restrictive policy in place while inflation holds unacceptably high.\n\n\u201cParticipants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time,\u201d the meeting summary stated. \u201cIn view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.\u201d\n\nThe increase ended a streak of four consecutive three-quarter point rate hikes, while taking the target range for the benchmark fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.\n\nOfficials also said they would focus on data as they move forward and see \u201cthe need to retain flexibility and optionality\u201d regarding policy.\n\nOfficials further cautioned that the public shouldn\u2019t read too much into the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s move to step down the pace of increases.\n\n\u201cA number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee\u2019s resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path,\u201d the minutes said.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while there has been some progress made in the battle against inflation, he saw only halting signs and expects rates to hold at higher levels even after the increases cease.\n\nThe minutes reflected those sentiments, noting that no FOMC members expect rate cuts in 2023, despite market pricing.\n\nMarkets currently are pricing in the likelihood of rate increases totaling 0.5-0.75 percentage point before pausing to evaluate the impact the increases are having on the economy. Traders expect the central bank to approve a quarter-point increase at the next meeting, which concludes Feb. 1, according to CME Group data.\n\nCurrent pricing also indicates the possibility of a small reduction in rates by the end of the year, with the funds rate landing around a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Fed officials, however, have expressed doubt repeatedly about any loosening of policy in 2023.\n\nThe minutes noted that officials are wrestling with two-pronged policy risks: One, that the Fed doesn\u2019t keep rates high long enough and allows inflation to fester, similar to the experience in the 1970s; and two, that the Fed keeps restrictive policy in place too long and slows the economy too much, \u201cpotentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population.\u201d\n\nHowever, members said they see the risks more weighted to easing too soon and allowing inflation to run rampant.\n\n\u201cParticipants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the outlook for policy,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cParticipants generally observed that maintaining a restrictive policy stance for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective.\u201d\n\nAlong with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested. In a program started in early June, the Fed has seen its balance sheet contract by $364 billion to $8.6 trillion.\n\nWhile some of the recent inflation metrics have shown progress, the labor market, a critical target of the rate increases, has been resilient. Nonfarm payroll growth has exceeded expectations for most of the past year, and data earlier Wednesday showed that there the number of job openings is still nearly twice the pool of available workers.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy, was at 4.7% annually in November, down from its 5.4% peak in February 2022 but still well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nEconomists, meanwhile, largely expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming months, the result of the Fed\u2019s tightening and an economy dealing with inflation still running near 40-year highs. However, fourth-quarter GDP for 2022 is tracking at a solid 3.9% rate, easily the best of a year that started out with consecutive negative readings, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday, in a post for the district\u2019s web site, that he sees the funds rate rising to 5.4% and possibly higher if inflation doesn\u2019t trend down.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/04/fed-minutes-december-2022-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/04/fed-minutes-december-2022-.html)\n\nFed Minutes PDF document: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20221214.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20221214.pdf)", "id": "103c0d8", "created_utc": 1672859376.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 8, "comments": [{"body": "Prediction: markets will \u2018bottom\u2019 Q3. \n\nRough year ahead.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33897480368614197}, {"body": "Just a couple of years ago, many were saying we would be in a low interest rate environment for a while.

{"title": "Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) Stock Review 01/04/2023", "selftext": "  \n\nAs always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advice. Always do you own due diligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions and hope to have a civil discussion.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company\u2019s business model\n\n\u00a7 Salesforce is the leading provider of Customer Relationship Management Software. Most of their software runs through their Customer 360 platform which serves as a single source of truth across an array of applications.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 Salesforce receives cash for cloud services and software licenses. Often time contracts are paid in advance and costs to service those contracts are amortized over time. This results in receiving cash up. As a result, salesforce typically has strong positive cash flows while their business overall operates at near breakeven levels. Since the positive inflows are sustainable, I view this as a positive dynamic.\n\n\u00a7 The nature of their services results in highly recurring revenue.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 Not really. They have $0.24 of debt for every $1 of equity on the balance sheet. Additionally, they have 6.3 billion of operating cash flow compared with interest expenses of only $297 million over the last 12 months ended 09/30/22.\n\no Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Salesforce has highly recurring and sticky revenue which should help to insulate their balance sheet in a downturn. As of last 09/30/22 they have nearly $12 billion in cash, $4.3 billion in receivables and a $3 billion line of credit if need be. If anything, they have too much cash on hand given their very negative Cash Conversion Cycle.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Salesforce has consistently turned 20% of revenues into free cash flow while growing revenue per share in nearly every quarter over the past decade. Having said that in recent Cash returns on invested capital have fallen from \\~20% to \\~9%. I do expect this to move back up toward 20% over the coming years as Salesforce removes excess capital on its balance sheet though a $10 billion buyback. Additionally, management has guided to 30-40% FCF margins over time up from their trending average of 20%. I feel this is likely achievable as the sales growth pace will likely slow in the coming year from 20% to the teens. Slower growth is typically met with wider margins. Additionally as I write salesforce announced a 10% layoff to staff furthering the case for higher margins.\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 The competitive advantage of salesforce is they are the hub of much of their customer needs. Salesforce has developed an iPhone like Appstore to allow third parties to integrate into their products. Additionally, many of their products are highly customized to allow for workflows and automation for their users. The exit costs for leaving salesforce are likely to be steep for their major revenue generators as this means migration costs, development costs of new customizations and integrations on a new CRM provider and retraining costs for staff. All of this to leave the number 1 provider of CRMs for over 20 years seems like a difficult decision to leave them.\n\no Are their major company specific risks?\n\n\u00a7 Salesforce is losing their Co-CEO Bret Taylor at the end of January this year leaving founder Marc Benioff to run the firm. While this is great short term as Benioff has overseen a great rise in Salesforce, it may indicate some transition issues over time.\n\n\u00b7 **Can the company be replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Salesforce has been the leading provider of CRMs basically since its inception as measured by revenue. Additionally, through their acquisition of Slack, they now have all the pieces to operate their business anywhere at any time.\n\no Is technology likely to serve or harm the company? \n\n\u00a7 When you\u2019re in tech, changes can be a problem. It is not clear that changes in technology will benefit them.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 No, Salesforce operates in too many businesses across the CRM spectrum for $10 billion to make a massive dent. In addition, since salesforce is the hub of so many companies\u2019 operations, many software engineers have specialized in CRM services. This would be difficult for a smaller player to re-create as it generates a small network effect.\n\no Are there structural reasons why the supply of new competition is likely to be limited?\n\n\u00a7 No. Despite my above comments, thanks to cloud-based servers, access to computing is becoming cheaper and more abundant and thanks to advancements in coding, building applications is becoming faster. This creates a recipe for lower barriers of entry for competition.\n\no Are there structural reasons why customers are likely to stay with the company?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. Despite an environment that is likely to increase competition, customers are likely to be sticky giving the switching costs involved with leaving them.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 The brand, which is that of an industry leader.\n\n\u00a7 The network of third-party support and engineers that are proficient in rolling out their software packages. It takes users for engineers to want to get trained in a new software and takes engineers to roll it out. A startup may struggle to gain traction given the maturity in the market of Salesforce, Microsoft and Cisco.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Nonapparent other than what is listed above. Having said that, I speculate if Apple will enter the market. Many people every day use their mail, calendar, contact, and messaging app daily. Throw on an admin page and charge a subscription and you have a CRM already installed on most employee devices that they are comfortable using with engineers who are trained on their software. Wouldn\u2019t be a silver bullet but may be a concern.\n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, mid teen revenue growth rates with guidance of margin expansion for a firm that has grown revenue per share in 38 of the last 40 quarters suggest a good trend.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, longer than 3 years out, salesforce will still likely be growing low double digits.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? \n\n\u00a7 I feel I do\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 Given their massive customer based and ability for customers to add-on higher value services, salesforce seems poised for growth going forward.\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 Shares outstanding have been growing by nearly 2% per year over the past 1.5 years. This period represents the post Slack acquisition dilution. Management has announced a $10 billion buyback and has begun executing on it. All in all, I still expect shares will increase over time despite the buyback. To that end, I will forecast shares increasing by 1 to 2.5% per year\n\n\u00a7 In terms of revenue, my analyst data from Finbox estimates revenues to grow to $44.475 billion over the next 3 years which implies a CAGR of \\~13% per year. 3 years after that analysts expect revenue to grow at roughly the same rate. Salesforce has extremely sticky and consistent revenues. To that end, for the 3-year projection, I will assume 12.5% premium and discount to revenue estimates for my bear and bull case.\n\n\u00a7 Free cash flow margins have stubbornly stayed flat for much of the last 5 years and averaged around 20%. In their recent investor day presentation, they announced they plan to get Non-GAAP operating Margins up to 25%. This is a crude measure of FCF. I will forecast a 18% to 24% FCF margin for a midpoint of 21%, up slightly from the longer term average. They are a show me story for now, so I have not paid much mind to their more aggressive guidance.\n\n\u00a7 Putting the above together I get 3-year FCF per share estimates of $6.32 to $11.78 for the bull and bear scenarios.\n\n\u00a7 Historically, Salesforce traded at far lower FCF yields, but I feel those days are over as this company is in transitions from 20%+ growth to a more moderate level. As a result, higher valuations are likely a thing of the past. Historically FCF yield have hovered around 1.2 to 3.0%. Currently they stand at 4.0% and for the forecast I will assume FCF yields are between 2.75% to 5.75% at the end of the 3-year period for a midpoint of 4.25%\n\n\u00a7 Using the forecasted FCF yields and FCF per share I get a 3-year valuation between $204 to $229 per share. This implies a \\~15% rate of return from these levels at the midpoint.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 For me, Salesforce represents an established company with a strong brand with maybe a slightly bit higher than average risk given the uncertainty around management transitions and bloat that has occurred over the last few years. To that end, I would want to earn about 11% return on an investment in Salesforce. Given the midpoint offers a 15% ROI at these levels, Salesforce might be attractive. This valuation implies salesforce would yield 11% or more from price level purchased under $158.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/FINBOX:CRM](https://finbox.com/FINBOX:CRM) \n\nCompany Data: [https://investor.salesforce.com/overview/default.aspx](https://investor.salesforce.com/overview/default.aspx)   \n\n\nAuthor is long at the time of the writing", "id": "103afut", "created_utc": 1672855761.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "As someone who uses Salesforce daily in the role of webdev/marketing ops, I have a lot of conflicting personal feelings mixed with deeper insight on the competitive advantagious and uniqueness.\n\nI oversaw the transition from Hubspot to Salesforce after a merger and know the ends and outs of both fairly well.\n\nHubspot is largely agreed to be better by all the ops people I've worked with in our other branches.

This gives them positive cash flow despite operating at near breakeven profitability For example:\n\nIf you collect $100 and owe $100 immediately you have no cash flow\n\nIf you collect $100 per quarter and owe $25 per quarter you have positive cashflow. \n\nIf you run the math over 4 quarters you end up collecting $400 ($100 per quarter) but paying out only $250 ($100 for 4 quarters, $75 for 3, $50 for 2 and $25 for 1)\n\nSince the dynamic persists that Salesforce receives cash up front but pays expenses over time, this cast last in perpetuity.\n\nThis is also why cash flow is more important than earnings. This dynamic is why salesforce in particular trades on cash flow, more specifically Free cash flow yield.

{"title": "Ivanhoe mines a company for long term returns", "selftext": "**Summary**\n\nThis is my research on ivanhoe mines and the copper play. report did get a bit longer then i expected. english is my second language and i do have dyslexia so there are probably a lot of spellings errors.\n\ni do hold a stake before i wrote this up so there might be biased and you should do your own research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics**\n\nevery market has a few special ways to value the industry these are some basic  for mining companys.\n\na big mistake is to value the pure reserves. not all mining companys do explore the entire region they own and leave the mine so called open ended. this means that on 1 or all sides the reserves keep going and that there is at least a bit more resoureces there. a company that holds an open ended mine would therefore come out a lot lower then a company that has their full landpackage in check. this could be done to safe money. they have the data to build the mine and dont want to spend a lot of money and time on something they can do after the mine is build.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmine life is an imporant metric it tells you how long the mine will operate a mine company that has less then 10 years has a problem. less then 20 years (before operatiing ) isnt a real investable mine. building a new mine from scratch could take up to a decade if you are lucky. 20 years+ at least before you make an investment ensures that you dont have to worry about short term price swings. the resell value of the mine is also high.\n\nmine grade is a % of how much is copper and how much is waste. the higher the grade the lower the cost of operating (most times) and the cleaner the mine is. a 1%+ is seen as high grade for copper but it is different for every metal.  lower then 0,5 you dont want to put any money on higher then 2% is realy good.\n\nRoi or IRR is the preferd metric to value investments. since mining can require high investments  the amouth of assets dont matter. a 10 billion mine could produce less copper then a 5 billion one and the 5 billion one could also make more profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnpv matters a lot too but a company can present many NPV the most recent one will apply the best but if a mine ends open ended like some you should take in account that it could be upgraded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Copper Market**\n\nivanhoe mines mostly operate in the copper industry which is a market set for growth. for EV's they need 4x the amouth of copper and most electrifications needs a lot more copper.\n\nthe market needs to grow from 24.000ktpa to 40.000ktpa in 2040 to make the EV revolution happen and hit net zero. the chance of hitting 40.000ktpa is low since a mine development can take a long time. there needs to be around 16.000kpta of new production.\n\nFor the world to reach net zero a lot of new copper production is needed to come online and except africa i dont believe any continent has the potential to do what it takes.\n\nper continent based production\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**South america**\n\nSout america is the largest producer of copper with chile en peru alone producing  35%+ of world supply.\n\nsouth america runs in to massive issues with the production they have already. as the biggest producer they are going to have a hard time maintaing these numbers.\n\nsouth america has an a lot of socialist leadership comming up which isnt bad but it those regimes mostly focus on getting in the most taxes for the goverment insted of growing production.\n\nit is a lot harder to attract new investmenst with higher profit taxes and other new forms of taxations.\n\nThe new issues that do seem to be forming in the continent like droughts, protest and environmental issues. (copper mines do have a massive impact on the local enviroment)\n\nThe underdeveloped places in south america are mostly the amazon rainforrest and some other places with rare animales or protected area's.\n\nlos andes is a mining area with a large resources body with almost 30 years of mine life which cannot be developed since a endangerd animal lifes there. (the company owning this mine does want to develop it but it is noted at an high discount for it stage in development)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Africa**\n\nafrica holds the answer to a major part of the new supply but it has a major issue\n\nthe biggest recently build mine Kamoa kakula needed 25 years to get from  exploration to production and it is still partly under development for another 7 years.  just building these huge mines takes a decade by it self.\n\nsince africa is large and underdeveloped it takes a longer time to build a mine. these mines are build in the middle of no where and the most basic resources like energy and workers lack. companys often need to educate lokals build their own energy companys and sometimes build towns.\n\nThe african envirment makes either discovery or production hard. since heavy rainfall makes it hard to do drill work and other exploration work and since the dry parts of africa lack water infrastructure they would need to find a safe supply since mining costs a lot of water.\n\nAfrica can solve the issue but it requires a lot of time and within 18 years i dont see the continent make up the entire shortfall but a good amouth of it is possible if companys would invest a lot.\n\nit is kind of logical that most countries in africa are going to try and get most of the revenue possible from these mines insted of worrying about the production numbers which is what the west needs.\n\nin africa there is a uprising in a new way of doing business where countrys dont export any raw materials anymore and want the refinery's to come to africa. it is a good way for africa to get a lot of jobs to come over and it does make africa a lot more intressting for investments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**North america-Europa**\n\nnorth america isnt yet a large producer but does have the potential to be\n\nthere have been some major discovery's in america but america seem to have an issue with the not in my backjard mentality. a major discovery and mine project on sacred lands of the natives is in a regulatory limbo right now. the mine should have produced 400ktpa but it might or might not go through. it is approved but the natives are protesting it heavly.\n\namerica holds major potenial for developemnt and will probably grow to become a larger player but to fill in the demand gap is unlikley since every mine is going to get a decent amouth of drawback.\n\narizona and utah especialy have had some big discovery's but not yet a large enough to make a dent in the issue.\n\ncanada does hold a lot of potential to get a rich mining industry in copper but it doenst yet excist. most canadian company's discover copper else where. there are some very rich mines in canada with high grades.\n\nto fill the gap of copper demand north america would be the best place to look for since it already has most of the needed infrastructure but we havent yet seen the push for it.\n\nEuropa does have the not in my backjard mentality except for spain who has a rich and long histroy but it doenst have the capacity or the abilty to make it a massive  impact on the supply side of copper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Asia**\n\nAsia has a very complicated copper market.\n\nchina does have some production of copper but the mines are hard to verify a lot of demand comes from china and chinees company are aggressively investing oversees in africa especialy.\n\nrussia has the potential for an large industry but sanctions make it hard to develop discovery's or develop mines or even continue to run them. a company that focusses on the russian copper and gold industry has a hard time with export and insted want to go for kazachistan\n\niran runs in to the same issue with sanctions and there largest mine has to be run with a lot of miltary force and there is a lot of potenial yet no company is willing to take these risks. a mine there recently claimed to have twice the amouth of ores for example.\n\nthe middel east has the potential for great copper discovery's but there hasnt been a lot of exploration yet. so unsure when or if we see large development. saudi arabia has started to do some license sales for litium seeminly wanting to build an non oil industry with resources and they do have the money to start this up.\n\nindonesia does have a rich mining complex with 2 large mines but those are in hard to excess places and took decades to just develop but they have the abilty to operated for decades.\n\nindia and kazachistan also have some decent production but there arent any intressting discovery's or development underway.\n\nasia could see a decrease in production or an increase but i dont believe the abilty to take up a large portion of the supply gap is there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**oceania.**\n\naustrialia is doing pretty good with an active mining industry being ready to grow. most of the miners do have the exploration packages and capital to grow (goverment support is also avalable).\n\naustralia doesnt realy have an large mine in its country and most of the mining industry are smaller and low mine life mines which doesnt make it a resiliant industry if prices get realy low.\n\naustralia doesnt realy have a lot of the luxury's that other continents have. reserves are a lot lower then in mines in other country's and the grades are low. they do have a great federal policy to help new mining companys start up and give large mining permits.\n\nthe resources base of australia isnt good enough to help the world out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pricing**\n\nWe have seen a price spike in litium. litium is also an ev metal but has 2 huge negatives that copper doesnt and why a price spike in copper would be more sustainble.\n\n1. litium isnt rare at all and there is more then enough of it\n2. litium can be replaced by other metals.\n\neven with these 2 huge flaws litium is standing at record prices and almost every project can get a 100% return if it can be brought online.\n\nsome mines are already running at a loss or close to a loss so the financial incentive to get online a bunch of copper is still abcent which makes a future high price highly likely.\n\nGoldman sachs did send out a target for 7,5$ copper price spike which would make ever copper miner an amzing investment but a specific target cant be made for certain.\n\nA 5$ copper price would make the market highly profitble and i do believe we are going to so see that price before the end of the decade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo hit 16.000ktpa there would need to be a lot of development in africa and america which arent likley to build a lot of mines fast for both their own reasons.\n\nit is unlikley that within a short time frame we are able to hit  these target without a extreem incentive to do so which would be a very likley chance to get a copper bull run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ivanhoe mines**\n\nIvanhoe mines is a mining company  in africa. The company holds 1 operating mine 2 in development and 2 intressting exploration plays. all the assets of the company are world class mines. strong management and a strong long term vision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The assets.**\n\nIvanhoe's 2 biggest mines are kamoa kakula and platreef they are the main value drivers of the company. they hold to exploration patches next to these mines. the third mine is kipushi which is more a redevelopment and will be mostly past over to the congolese govement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Kamoa kakula.**\n\nThe mine is operating right now but it is still in development. it produces 400ktpa but after development it should produce around 800ktpa. there are already developemnts to increase production further. for example a debottle necking progamme would increase production from 400ktpa to 450ktpa.  the roi of the mine is around 50%.\n\nthe mine operates at 5% grade which is an extreem high grade for a mine. with escondida (the largest copper mine in the world) producing around 0,6-0,7%. this comes with the advantage that even when cost have gone up they still produce for around 1,45 per pound (copper price around 3,80). it also makes them able to produce with almost no emmisions.  the mine can also run until the end of the 2050's  and the plan ends with the company still producing 3% which makes it likely that production can be prolonged. since there is a significant amouth of undiscoverd land right next to the north part of kamoa and also around half of the land remained untested. also on many parts of the mine the ore body ends open so they havent found the end of the complex.\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5080/kakula-2.jpg](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5080/kakula-2.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe low break even prices will make sure that the mine will preform well when the price is low. they do have a progamme to lower cost even further. in a few ways.\n\nThe biggest of them is their own refinery. most of their cost is shipping and smelting. shipping cost would be cut in half and the refinery would reduce other company profit margins since congo has lower labour and energy prices. the refinery is also high qualty refinery and is going to be one of the biggest in congo.\n\nthe refinery can save the company around 18-28 cents since shipping cost realy came down it could be a lot less. but at the peak the investment would save 308.000.000  (120 mil for ivanhoe) in shipping cost alone. refinery's profit margins also peaked recently so it would save a bit there 2 but shipping would save the most.\n\nthe company is also busy with building bigger roads since the mine is so big it created a miles long traffic stop and test the infrastructure of hte congo. which isnt bad if congo forced to build more roads it will be good for the entire country.\n\nthe kamoa- kakula mining complex is worth around 14 billion after tax on 3,5 copper price. excluding further exploration of the land and the 2023 production increase. (8% discounted).\n\nivanhoe mines owns 40% of the complex. 5,6 billion would be the value for ivanhoe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Platreef**\n\nthe platreef complex is still in development and should start production in 2024. the complex holds many different metals like platium palladium, copper, gold, nickel and rhodium. the mine is located in south africa.\n\nthe plans gives the mine a lifetime of 20 years but there is enough ore to make the mine being operated for around a century with a large portion of the land not yet being discoverd makes further development possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/1906/image008-20160511070520.638x0-is-pid1510.png](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/1906/image008-20160511070520.638x0-is-pid1510.png)\n\nthe mine still has a lot of land to test and there is a good chance that there are better ores in the south as you can see why on later pictures.\n\nthe roi is around 20% which is a lot lower then kamoa-kakula but still above average for other mines. (the prices taken to get the 20% are lower then prices are right now so roi could be a bit higher depending on how much inflation takes a number on costs)\n\nthere arent yet plans to develop the open area but after 2024 there will be a lot of cashflow left over since the biggest investments have been and every assets is producing.\n\nthe best part of the mining complex is south of the mine i will later share an image that would explain why. this part is excluded from the NPV.\n\nthe value of platreef mining project change a lot based on prices but the spot prices of today would make the mine worth 4,1 billion dollar\n\nivanhoe mines owns 64% of this mine or 2,6 billion.  that doenst look like a lot but the a large portion of the complex is excluded from this so high chance that it would look a lot better in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Kipishu**\n\nkipishu is an old mining complex in the congo. the mine will get redeveloped and then ivanhoe mines will pass over stakes in the mine to the congolese goverment untill the they hold a stake of 20%. it is still one of the highest grade mines in the world especialy in zinc.\n\nthe transfer of stakes is partly based on time and then the amouth of ores mined.\n\nProduction should start in 2024 q1.\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/3593/worlds\\_top\\_20\\_zinc\\_projects-\\_by\\_contained\\_zinc.602x0-is-pid1514.png](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/3593/worlds_top_20_zinc_projects-_by_contained_zinc.602x0-is-pid1514.png)\n\nthe mine is a very high grade mine and the resources got an upgrade recently making the project a lot more intresting. the mine will produce high grade zinc.\n\nthe mine is going to produce a bunch of metals. the complex hold zinc, copper silver and germanium. Ivanhoe doesnt hold any exploration rights next to kipishu so there wont be any growth for a new mine.\n\nthe mine is expected to run for 14 years which sounds short but there hasnt been done a lot of exploration and this is also around the time ivanhoe only holds 20% stake in kipishu.  The roi and irr are extreemly high since the investments that have to be made are low because there is already a mine there.  I couldnt find an updated irr but based on 20% lower zinc prices and a lot lower production it is around 40%. the production cost is around 0,65.\n\nivanhoe is aloud to mine 12 million tons of zinc (other metals excluded) before passing the mine up.\n\nthe NPV is very hard to find since it is only based on zinc. but at these prices but that alone would be 2,64 billion  (excluding the other metals there)\n\nivanhoe hold 68%. which is worth around 1,8 billion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe npv's combined makes 10 billion but like i said these are discounted. on resources, production and price already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exploration**\n\nIvanhoe mines also has 2 large and high qualty exploration plays with the chance to out prefom one of their already developed mines being reasonably high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Platreef**\n\nivanhoe recently aquired the \u00e8xploration permits next to platreef\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5667/1.801x0-is.png](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5667/1.801x0-is.png)\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5667/2.638x0-is.png](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5667/2.638x0-is.png)\n\nlike i said earlier this is why the soutern part of platreef mine is a lot more intresting. that area has remained untested aswell. the new part is also better then platreef mine (possibly) which makes a very intressting bet.\n\nthe new area is also a lot larger then the already aquired mine section. there is a good chance that there are resources here and that they are a lot better then the mine underdevelopment.\n\ni would speculate that ivanhoe mines waited with testing the south part of the already aquired area until they would recieve the new rights. since it would draw a lot of eyes on the project and competition for this permit.\n\nsince ivanhoe now holds 100% of the new area a large discovery would be a lot more benfitial to ivanhoe mines then platreef already.\n\nthis is speculation and until tested nothing is sure but the potential remians great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Westernforeland**\n\naround Kamoa-kakula ivanhoe holds 2400km2 of land with already 2 discovery. which might be as good or better then kamoa. ivanhoe hold around 90-100% of these land rights. depending on the specific permit.\n\nkamoa kakula is around 400km2 which shows how large this area is i cant find a full picture of it but this would do.\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5080/kakula-2.jpg](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/5080/kakula-2.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmost of the land cant fit on the picture but it is 6x the size of the kamoa kakula. ivanhoe has decided to focus on drilling in 2020. since the kamoa mine has been online ivanhoe has done a lot of drilling and we can expect relatively soon some results. (maybe next year). a mine here would make ivanhoe mines a large player like freeport.\n\nivanhoe is almost finished with the entire airial exploration of the land package which makes drilling a lot more attractive.\n\nwe are already aware that there are small packages of copper right on the border of western foreland.\n\n1 kamoa-kakula mine on the western foreland package would Dubbel ivanhoe's NPV and hopefully marketcap aswell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is the most recent drilling\n\n[https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/4165/2019-03-14-western-foreland4.jpg](https://ivanhoemines.com/site/assets/files/4165/2019-03-14-western-foreland4.jpg)\n\nit shows an 4,5-1,5 km (6,75km2) copper find of high grade copper. the kamoa kakula mining is around 77km2. this is still open ended that means that at no side the end of the copper body has been found and it keeps going. right now a lot of drilling is taken place but for sure you can only say 6,75km2 is found.\n\nkamoa kakula ends in 1,73% grade of copper and makoko ends  (openended they are drilling the edge's right now ) at 4,88% the chance that this goes on is very high and a high qualty mine could be constructed here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Balance sheet.**\n\nIvanhoe hold 649million in debt and did get approved for a new loan recently for the platreef mine.\n\nIvanhoe has 663 million of cash so the company has a net cash reserve at this point.\n\nThe operting cashflow is around 364 YTD from the kamoa kakula venture. anullized the operating cashflow is 19x market cap. which isnt cheap but next year a 12,5% production growth should be reached and the company already grow production  90% this year (Q1vsQ3)\n\nso operating cashflow doesnt represent the company well at this point.\n\nIvanhoe needs a strong balance sheet in the short term since they want to grow production and invest in the company.\n\nIn the past ivanhoe had to give up stakes of their projects to get the mines underdevelopment. since they're profitble they can develop them themselfs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why ivanhoe mines?**\n\nSince i talked about the copper play in general and the company why would you pick ivanhoe mines over other company's.\n\nsince demand for copper is going to grow over a long time and prices are not predicitble in the short term you would want a company that can wait around for prices to rise. ivanhoe has with their long mine life the best potential.\n\ncongo and south africa deal in general with higher mine life better quality reserves and a higher ROI and ivanhoe hold the most intressting exploration permits and mines in the country which makes them an already intressting play.\n\nivanhoe has operated in congo over 2,5 decades without any major issues . developing in an underdeveloped country like the congo and build a mine out of no where is already an amazing  accomplishment. this gives a lot of trust for them do to it again.\n\nThe exploration permits might not sound that good but any company that aquires permits next to an amazing mine with the same data they have already would be noted for a premium of what they payed for it. It is realy one of the best exploration assets you could get i am not realy able to word it in a way that makes it as good as it is and be realistic about the chance of there not being a mine there in the future which is possible.\n\nAn amazing high qualty resources base, low cost mines, a good balance sheet, strong management, High roi/IRR and a strong exploration package. make the company set for growth and high profits for a long time.\n\nthe company is slightly undervalued since NPV come at 10billion and the market cap sits at 9,6billion which is a 4% discount. (they already were discounted on reserves of kamoa kakula kipishu and platreef, kamoa kakula production, the entire part of non zinc kipishu , the price of copper and the entire exploration package). this makes the company cheap.\n\nIvanhoe hold what is an wonderfull company for a fair price.\n\nEven though it is heavly discounted the price is still fair since other mining company are probably cheaper if you give up on quality. I rather decrease my risk as much as possible and the company offers a lot of upside for relatively no risk (excluding the geopolitcal risk).\n\na wonderfull company means to me that the company has amazing assets, good balance sheet, good management and a clear strategy for growth. there is no other company that has the quality that ivanhoe has.  so you do own one of the best mining company's in the industry. almost no company can produce as cheap as ivanhoe can with the same long term minelife and size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The strategy**\n\nThe strategy of Ivanhoe mines is different then other mines who look at short term demand or fast paybacks. focus is mostly on returing capital to shareholders.\n\nIvanhoe's focus is on the most intressting ore bodys and exploration permits. this could cause a geopoltical issue since the best places seem to get  a lot of political issues.\n\nthe mines need to have a long mine life ,high ore grade and a low break even price. ivanhoe wants to supply the long term demand and want to reinvest profits in to new mines. ESG is also an important factor\n\nThe high mine life mines dont seem like a big thing for too many investors in the copper market but if you look at the largest players. BHP rio tinto and Freeport they all hold stakes in mines with 70 year+ mine lifes. the large players all have been build of the backs of 1 or 2 long mine life mines.\n\n**The journalist articel.**\n\nrecently there has been an articel placed on ivanhoe about corruption in the congo. The articel made the stock price take a hit.\n\nthe articel has been largely debunked. it is about a corrupt goverment offical and ivanhoe mines doing a deal about an exploration package. the deal hasnt been signed by the corrupt polition and ivanhoe is i still trying to acquire that land package through the goverment without the officail gaining a stake since the permit is still a high quality landpackage.\n\nthere has been a suggestion of a payment but after a year there hasnt been any evidence yet and the office already got raided last year without any results.\n\nthere isnt yet a good aligation and not yet any legal trubble but share price did take a significant hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CMMC**\n\nI think that every time i look at an investment it is great to keep track of a loser of the industry a company that either failed or went bankrupt that could be used as a case to learn from.\n\nCMMC is that company.\n\nthey have a operating mine in canada but the break even price went far above the copper price it even went above the ATH of copper.\n\nthe company has sold their most intressting aspect their exploration.\n\ntheir exploration package was realy good with an discovery on it for a large mine and a still undiscoverd package right next to it. it wasnt a realy high qualty package like ivanhoe has but still decent for their market cap.\n\nthe exploration and their project got sold for 230 mil if i am not mistaken. which would come down to about 1 year of profit after the first mine was build.\n\nit wanst sold realy cheap but they are an empty shell of what the company used to be and their isnt a good reason to invest in them right now since there isnt any possible short term growth or mid term growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI do believe this company to be high qualty and i am very intressted in this business myself. I got the company recommended to check out by someone inside the industry and been in love with the business ever since.\n\ni would advice you to check the business out yourself and do some research or in the copper market it self.

{"title": "Morning Briefing \ud83c\udf1e Jan 4th 2022 - Confused about what to do with Tesla? Check it out", "selftext": "Hey, I'm not new to WSB but I literally never post. This is a great community, so I wanted to add my own contribution in some way. I'll be posting daily morning briefings here.\n\nStocks started the year with a stumble after the long holiday weekend. The Dow and the S&P closed down slightly, while the Nasdaq, hit by declines in Apple and Tesla stock, fell 0.8%. New economic data from Europe, including a decline in France\u2019s consumer price index, could help brighten investors\u2019 spirits Wednesday, as market watchers seek signs that inflation is easing. Investors will also digest the latest job openings, or JOLTS, report Wednesday morning, ahead of Friday\u2019s big monthly jobs number. Federal regulators were already wary about cryptocurrency, but now they\u2019re warning banks to be super extra careful following the swift collapse of FTX and the sweeping indictment of the exchange\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint statement Tuesday, telling banks that involvement in crypto could expose them to \u201cfraud and scams among crypto-asset sector participants\u201d as well as \u201ccontagion risk within the crypto-asset sector resulting from interconnections among certain crypto-asset participants.\u201d Interest rates shot up again at the end of 2022, which weighed on mortgage demand. Overall, mortgage demand fell 13% last week from two weeks earlier. Drilling down, applications to buy a home slipped 12%, while refinancing applications, which are more sensitive to rate changes, declined 16%.\n\nOverall Market Outlook: \n\n**SPY** - Dark Cloud Cover candle pattern close on the daily TF. We broke out the symmetrical triangle PM but sold off and closed back inside it. (Technicals cut short and no levels posted for now since they don't really matter cause we have FOMC tomorrow!) Expected Move +/- $4.14\n\n**QQQ** - Dark Cloud Cover candle pattern close on the daily TF. We are still inside a broadening wedge on the 4Hr TF. (No levels posted for now. Lets see what FOMC has in store for us tomorrow!) Expected Move +/- $3.65\n\nWatchlist -\n\n**MUFG** - Just broke above a crucial level around $6.80 which should lead to more upside for this outperforming stock.\n\n**QCOM** - Just moved higher off of that $107 level once again. This should lead to more upside for this stock over the coming weeks.\n\n**TSLA** - Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We have a possible double bottom here on the daily. And we have a Bear H pattern on the 1Hr TF. We released from the squeeze on the hourly and made that nice move down! Take Calls above 111.85 BNH. Take the 115c or 120c, Expected Move +/- $8.63\n\n**NVDA** - Bearish Engulfing candle close on the daily TF. We are in a bearish pennant on the daily as well. And we are in a bearish pennant on the hourly TF. Getting 150c or 152.5c Calls above 145.80, getting 135p Puts below 140. Expected Move +/- $7.13\n\nIf you guys want more of this every morning, let me know.", "id": "1034d6d", "created_utc": 1672840836.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|29|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: -The market is down slightly today after a long holiday weekend.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42180103063583374}, {"body": ">\tHey, I\u2019m not new to WSB\n\n\u201cFirst seen in WSB 4 weeks ago.\u201d", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Definite an ancient in here!\n\nIn any case i am a bagholder of Nvidia Puts!!\n\nLet's ride the short", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "My first account: u/AveenoFresh", "score": -2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2573893666267395}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2371208369731903}, {"body": "New astrology readings just dropped let\u2019s goooo", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "My calls are retrograde, what does that mean?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20042823255062103}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4813086688518524}, {"body": "\"this is a great community\"\n\nWhat the fuck gave you that idea sir?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah this is not a great community.

{"title": "Insider Trading Weekly Update #020: Sales From $PENN CEO & $COIN CFO, Largest Trades + Sector and Market Cap Overviews From The Past Week", "selftext": "GM WSB,\n\nFirst, the Form Fore beta is now closed. Contact me to join the waitlist.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Large drop in insider trading this week, with most buy action stemming from block stakeholders (10%+ ownership). An already low participation count from companies and insiders dropped further this week, which I expect is partly driven by holidays.\n\nBelow are notable buys from block stakeholders:\n\n* Q-Grv Vii Investment Partners increased their position in Chargepoint Holdings, inc ($CHPT / Industrials) by $11.9M on Dec. 27th (+6.16%)\n* Broadwood Partners purchased an additional \\~$9M in Staar Surgical Co ($STAA / Health Care) on Dec. 27th, increasing their stake by 2.22%\n* Hill Path Capital Partners purchased an additional $7.5M in Dave & Busters ($PLAY / Consumer Discretionary) on Dec. 28th\n\nIn addition, here are a few notable buys from other insiders:\n\n* **Roxanne Austin**, a Director at Crowdstrike Holdings ($CRWD / Information Technology), increased their position by 61.85% with a $2.49MM purchase on Dec. 27th\n* **Thomson Leighton**, the CEO of Akami Technologies ($AKAM / Information Technology), increased their position by 27.94% with a $75K purchase on Dec. 28th. Thomson also bought $25K in shares on Dec. 27th\n\nAnd some notable sales from insiders:\n\n* **Denise Johnson**, the Group President of Caterpillar Inc ($CAT / Industrials), unloaded 73.39% of her stake with a $5.7M sale on Dec. 27th. Johnson now owns 8,605 shares.\n* **Andres Gluski**, the President and CEO of Aes Corp ($AES / Utilities) sold 36.8% of his position for $21.3M on Dec. 28th\n* **Jay Snowden**, the President and CEO of Penn Entertainment ($PENN / Consumer Discretionary) decreased his stake by 21.29% with a $4.9M sale on Dec. 27th\n* **Alesia Haas**, the CFO of Coinbase ($COIN / Financials) sold 32.69% of their position with a $3.18M sale on Dec. 27th\n\nIt is understandably less clear why an insider decreases their position size. However, using Coinbase as an example, if the company CFO is unloading nearly a third of their shares\u2026 I would consider that a red flag.\n\nBy monitoring insider trading, you will become more informed about the incentives of company executives and consequently make more educated decisions when it comes to your personal investment decisions. \n\nThere is no question that alternative data traditionally has a high price point. That was a key motivation for me to produce these reports and start Form Fore - to level the playing field. I find alternative data to be flat-out interesting and want to put a spotlight on the suits.\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases decreased from $974M to $35.6M (-96%)\n* Sales decreased from $869M to $186.8M (-79%)\n* Transactions decreased from 391 to 201 (-49%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 214 to 128 (-40%)\n   * Net buyers decreased from 27 to 22 (-19%)\n   * Net sellers decreased from 187 to 106 (-43%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 332 to 174 (-48%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 30 to 36 (+20%)\n   * Net sellers decreased from 302 to 138 (-54%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **December 26th - December 30th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.\n2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.\n3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 19th - December 23rd.**\n4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).\n5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.\n\n# Further Context\n\n1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\\*if\\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.\n3.
