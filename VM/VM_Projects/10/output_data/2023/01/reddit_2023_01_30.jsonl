{"title": "SPY Option Market Overview for this Week (pre FOMC Meeting)", "selftext": "The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting this week, and Jerome Powell will give a press conference about their next moves with respect to interest rates. 2023 has been overwhelmingly bullish so this will be the first test to a market that is wanting to turn back on.  \n\nThis is what we can see as the general feel from the options markets:\n\n* SPY has been on a bullish tide since the beginning of the year. Almost a 5% jump in the last couple of weeks. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5giw2p80o6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=483f032ca65edb811e0677b2ce09fe89fcfbfb3b\n\n* The price momentum of SPY looks manageable, even though we have been on a tare for some weeks, the momentum is still ways away from reaching the 80th percentile in terms of previous momentum observations. This would lead us to believe that there is still some room to breathe.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65qpcdy1o6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de66f5c15eae78a6aa110236be93730aaa36902e\n\n* In the option markets expiring this Friday Feb 3, SPY has seen an overwhelming bearish sentiment. More than 2 out of every three SPY option contracts opened are PUTS. There seems to be the conviction that this bullish market can't go any further, or is it that traders are still too shellshocked from 2022 and cannot fathom a rally happening. There is also the added fact that we might get bad news from the Fed which would in fact cool down the market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8bfu134o6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f84647483b7420bc3eadee6c54315914912f1141\n\n* For SPY option contracts expiring Feb 3, we can see a very clear resistance level forming at strike $410. There are currently over 31K open contracts at this point. The reason why this can be a resistance level is that, in general, market makers are at the other side of any opened trade. Since most traders are long traders (i.e. buyers of options) , it is reasonable to assume that at the other side of the 30K contracts are market makers. The game theory would lead us to see that the MMs will try to avoid printing 30K contracts (equal to 3M units of SPY) if they can somehow suppress the price enough.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3b9q3x5o6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f2e962f961067cd0bc05d60a4451cf5531a324a\n\n* For SPY option contracts expiring Feb 3, we can see that there are two relatively significant support levels at $395  and $390. The reasoning for calling it a support level follows a similar logic as with the resistance level, except that we use PUTS instead of CALLS to make this assesment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s96qhn08o6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d6bf8aaf55d6088bdb3f57aa7aeb4503535101f\n\n* Next we evaluate what we refer to as a Delta Dam, which simply tell us how much money is required by market makers in order to fully hedge all the positions up to a specific strike. Remember that market makers do something called dynamic hedging, which means that they are constantly evaluating their positions and increasing or reducing the size of their hedges depending on market conditions. In the specific case for SPY options expiring on Feb 3, we can see that there is a jump of more than $1B between strikes $409 and $410. If the strike is contested enough, what we expect to see is that market makers will suppress the price of SPY instead of hedging it because the act of hedging calls itself pushes the price of the stock higher.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lo50txp9o6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34d36f859d2f7020785e4feb7b85ae9c9a452c55\n\n* For SPY CALL contracts expiring on Feb 3, we can see that market makers are currently hedging the $410 strike  with more than 1.1M units of SPY. This is important because if the price of SPY starts to drop and isn't anywhere near $410 by Friday, then a lot of contracts for this strike will be closed, which will lead MMs to wind off their hedges which will further depress the price of SPY.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0jvaksao6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5c412859d4b9db4207c73165f229bc1f31d1354\n\n* For SPY CALL contracts expiring on Feb 3, we can see that market makers are hedging strike $395 with 550k units of SPY shorted. Similar to the point we made about calls, if the price of SPY doesn't fall close enough to $395 by Friday, we can expect these contracts to be closed, which will lead market makers to close their short position hedges by buying the stock, which in turn pushes the price of SPY upwards.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30xhqw5co6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4088e93371374834d76fdb2c207b2be9008a0725\n\n* From what we have seen, there is a bit of breathing room for SPY however, the downward pressure is high. If we add the high expectations for Wednesday's press conference by JPowell then we find ourselves in  a situation where a (slight) price drop in SPY has a relatively high probability ( around 70%)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ae91p3do6fa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2e7221da609eb3a1040842e71b2481beb10e7cc", "id": "10p3pgf", "created_utc": 1675088379.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "This week is going to be wild!", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Indeed, pop corn time with cash on the side.

They also mean a contraction in the period through March would still produce a recession in the euro area\u2019s largest economy. \n\nSeveral indicators in recent weeks have pointed to growing confidence in Germany after a mild winter and well-filled natural gas storages all but eliminated the risk of shortages during the heating period. Wholesale prices for the commodity have fallen from record highs, nurturing hopes that inflation will cool sooner than previously thought.\n\nDemand is weighed down as surging prices continue to filter through to consumers. That trend was also visible in Sweden, whose economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter, separate data earlier Monday showed.\n\nManufacturers, which play an outsized role for Germany, are seeing orders fall, though production is supported by a large backlog and an easing of supply bottlenecks. \n\nThe government in Berlin last week forecast growth of 0.2% for 2023, compared with an earlier prediction for a 0.4% contraction. Economy minister Robert Habeck still warned of a possible recession, and that the crisis Russia sparked with its invasion of Ukraine isn\u2019t over.\n\nThe outlook remains uncertain. Inflation could prove stubborn amid growing demands for higher wages. Postal workers have gone on strike to push for a 15% pay hike, and public-sector employees are also seeking a double-digit raise. \n\nThe European Central Bank is determined to tackle surging prices with restrictive monetary policy. It\u2019s set to lift interest rates by another 50 basis points this week, adding to what\u2019s already the most aggressive tightening campaign in its history. The full impact of those measures has yet to be felt.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-30/germany-may-still-see-recession-after-fourth-quarter-contraction?srnd=premium-europe&utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=mobile_web_share", "id": "10oxqey", "created_utc": 1675070779.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "For context, Germany Q1 was 0.8%, Q2 was 0.1%, Q3 was 0.5% (revised), and Q4 is now estimated at -0.2% (all real figures and annualized quarter over quarter).
