{"title": "Calibration of a Short Volatility Position for NFLX Earnings", "selftext": "This week I am looking at NFLX as a possible play for their earnings releasing Thursday after market close.\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/10dmymt/implied_move_vs_average_past_move_for_this_week/) of past moves vs implied show that NFLX is in borderline territory with an implied move close to the past average. Let's investigate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Past Earnings Moves\n\nLet's start with the main numbers:\n\n>***Average post move***: ***+/-11.5%***  \n>  \n>***std deviation***: ***9,2%***\n\nStandard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of values.\n\nA quick approximation is that most values are as low as average minus this, and as high as average plus this.\n\n**\u21d2 NFLX moves between +/-2% and +/-20% on its earnings**\n\nWe can refine these numbers by looking at the [breakdown of these past moves](https://app.earnings-watcher.com/#/moves?symbol=ORCL):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctthvw2mqoca1.png?width=2014&format=png&auto=webp&s=5372f0d3e73bc80b80b8f2e180f761a6c69795d0\n\nEvery line is a past earnings of NFLX showing data about that release date. We see the average and standard deviation calculated on those date.\n\n>**\u21d2 We can assess that 11% average and 9% std dev grew over the last two years where the average was around \\~9%, still close.**\n\nFor every date we have the pre-release / day-of-release / post-release actual moves, this time not absolute. Pre / Post moves are highest recorded move leading to / after the release by one day.\n\nHighlighted rows are dates where the move on day of release exceeded the past average value.\n\n>**\u21d2 We see since 2018, the biggest move recorded was \\~39.6% on 2022-04-19, which was the second consecutive heavy drop of NFLX at earnings after -25% on 2022-01-20.**\n\nWe see that NFLX is overall a very volatile stock around earnings, so we will need our position to be as wide as possible .\n\nA good way of investigating this is looking at histograms charts:\n\nThis a distribution of the past moves we were looking at. The x axis is the value of the move and the y axis is how many it occurred, *so spikes correspond to the highest occurrences*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ers7ad6hroca1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=79afb7eff8d68aa42e5e98a8266c7627e1bbdc00\n\n>**\u21d2 Most historic moves are concentrated between -9 and +11, however with occurrences of a peaks above -25% and the famous heavy drops at more than -20%**\n\nOne thing to always keep in mind is the IV crush: implied volatility rises in the days leading to the earnings release which makes holding options positions through earnings risky where I.V drops significantly right after the release, inflicting a high loss on long options positions if the stock price does not exceed the implied move.\n\nwe can start looking at possible plays to harvest the earnings IV with e a very wide break-even that's safe compared to past moves range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Calibrating a Short Volatility Trade\n\nLet's compare how both combinations will react to earnings. One of the most important things to look at is the break even, the amount of stock move needed for the position to be worth its initial price.

{"title": "ATVI play - Seeling Puts, Buying LEAPS", "selftext": "So, as was amply announced, Microsoft is going to buy ATVI for $95 / share. ATVI has been trading between $70-$80 since the deal was announced, awaiting for the approval of the relevant authorities. \n\nHere's a possible play: Sell short dated puts; and maybe buy OTM LEAPS (Jan 2024 or after sounds good).\n\nOn the put seeling side, there's the (small, the general opinion seems to think) risk that the deal doesn't go through and ATVI price falls; but if Microsoft thinks $95 per share is a fair price, how low can the stock go, and how long can it stay there? It IS a profitable company, which is a crucial factor in the pricing of the stock.\n\nOn the call buying side, if just one of the puts sold is profitable, you can buy a $95 call for 2024 for nothing or almost nothing. If the deal goes through, there's a possibility of multiplying the money. I'd mention selling calls, too (PMCC), but then you may risk not being able to sell it for a good price. \n\nMaybe PMCC could be viable if the deal doesn't go through or if there are more delays in the process. I saw $95 March calls being sold for $0.10 (which would yield almost 10% of the price of the LEAPS). But, again, you'd have to hope the price doesn't shoot up there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something? Is it too risky?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I sold ATVI - FEB $67.5 P for $1.35\n\nStill thinking about buying LEAPS\n\nRisk = $6750\n\nReward: $135 or undefined if I buy LEAPS", "id": "10fjoue", "created_utc": 1674079237.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"body": "I would advise you to learn more before actually doing anything.\n\nTakeover price being 95 your plan to buy 95 calls is one of, if not, one of the dumbest things you could do.

Alternatively, when a deal falls through the target gives back it's abnormal returns. ( which was around 66 a share but that's before interest rates have gone up so who knows what it would be today)\n\nLastly the difference in price you see is the market pricing in the likely hood of a deal going through. 95-75=20 to be gained if the deal goes through, but FTC, msft competitors and EU are opposing this deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo conclude I did sell a put, not saying its a good play or not, there is no free money, so be careful or atleast do it as small as possible", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "If the deal is announced your $95 calls are worth exactly zero dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s what you\u2019re missing.

Suggesting the price upward is due to higher bid prices being presented. I wonder if the sell off at the end of the year was people taking profits so at least they\u2019d have some profits for all the available tax harvesting potential lots of traders accrued in 2022.\n\nThere still needs to be $35 million in stock purchases at +40% before Feb 17th and as long as things are trending upward, PRVB management has no incentive to pull the trigger. Either way, the high priced bids and trading volume will drive $PRVB higher.\n\n**TL;DR**\"Large\" volume of $PRVB will be purchased at a premium sometime in the next month. Thesis is that this will drive up price.\n\nPositions: $12.5C 2/17, $12.5C 4/20... might add some $10C 2/17 now that the price has dipped.  \n\n\nEdit: Formatting", "id": "10fhgkb", "created_utc": 1674072965.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3695222735404968}, {"body": "Good shit, they popped off today.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17507171630859375}, {"body": "They aren\u2019t purchasing those shares on the open market.
