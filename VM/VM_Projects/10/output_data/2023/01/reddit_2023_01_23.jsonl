Stock investments soon became a mass phenomenon, even Karl Marx traded passionately on the London Stock Exchange, bragging to his uncle Lion Phillips in a letter from June 1864:\n\nI have, you will be a little surprised, speculated, partly in American funds but especially in English stocks, which are springing up like mushrooms here this year (for all possible and impossible stock ventures) and are driven to a quite unreasonable height and then usually burst. In this way, I have gained over \u00a3400, and will now, once the entanglement of political conditions affords greater scope, start anew.
