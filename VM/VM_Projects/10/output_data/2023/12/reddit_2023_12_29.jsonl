{"title": "Long-term outlook", "selftext": "Been invested in Tesla since 2017 and have held through thick and thin. Just a long summary of my thoughts about the future.\n\n**Investors Day Mar 2023 -** On 3/1/2023 the investor day event was held. A lot of stuff was talked about, including the upcoming next-gen vehicle, but what stuck out to me the most was Master Plan part 3. The vision for moving to an electrified world and the costs involved really stood out. The takeaway, for me, was that it is achievable and it will save trillions in investment over the years. On top of that, moving to electric will improve health (less local pollution from burning fossil fuels) which has massive value to society. Importantly, in terms of an investment, it should be obvious that moving to electric brings massive economic benefits (i.e. makes society wealthier) and that is something investors in Tesla can benefit from, if Tesla can capitalize on all this. This is a big deal I think and not something many seem to comprehend. Not unlike how the industrial revolution allowed for massive economic growth and opportunities to profit.\n\n**Battery Day Sep 2020 -** In Sep 2020, Tesla laid out a vision for their 4680 battery. At the time, I estimated between 2-5 years for most of the improvements to be realized. The tabless part is done. The improvement in the size of the factory is a function of the rest of the parts and is moving along. The dry electrode process is working but needs further improvements to get to needed volume levels. The structural changes to the cars is done. Making a silicon anode... well they dope with silicon and I think moving to their silicon anode is perhaps a while out still. Also, extraction of nickel using first principles I suspect is years out still. With the lithium, seems they are on the path to improving extraction, but not sure. In any case, the improvements they have made headway on (even if they need further work) should help them get to (per their projections... take with a grain of salt) should help them get to 40% cost reduction at the \"battery pack level\" and some decent range increase. Figure another 2 years to these improvements are fully realized and they can move to mass production, but this is very positive for the future. Of course increasing production of 4680's will help translate to a massive energy business on top of the auto business.\n\n**AI -** Every day we are seeing incredible advances in AI. Tesla's key work on AI has revolved around FSD. Basically a system that is being optimized to with a relatively low-powered computing system to be able to rapidly identify the real-world environment and how things around it will interact in order to be able to plan a path to get from A to B. To train this system, you need an uber-expensive, super-duper high-powered and highly optimized computer with its programming along with extensive training data to have a chance at solving this problem. Obviously FSD itself, if and when it works out, is a massive value proposition. Beyond that this AI super-computer has potential to train Optimus, which perhaps is an even bigger value proposition... but why assume things stop there. The AI supercomputers that Tesla is building, can, to the extent Tesla does not need to use the compute capacity themselves, be rented out to others for AI projects. Very simply... If you need a billion dollar computing system to solve a problem quickly, you can either spend a billion dollars, hire the people and spend the time to build such a system or you can go to Tesla and pay them, say, $500 million for a week of compute. You save a half a billion and get compute right away, and Tesla is making $26 billion revenue a year on that computer that cost them $1 billion to build. Obviously real numbers will be based on competition. Before anyone thinks that this is going to be an industry with heavy competition, realize that there are going to be few companies able to build such systems and who have the people to write the best software for them. Each company that does this will be optimized for different uses, meaning that depending on your objective you may go to Google, Tesla, OpenAI, or someone else for the computer you need.\n\n**Next-Gen Vehicle -** This is really the culmination of all the advances in manufacturing vehicles that Tesla undertook. Hard to appreciate at the time but Tesla having trouble finding partners early on to work with and having to make the journey to building more parts themselves has led them to what is going to be the biggest change in how an auto is built (beyond just moving to battery power). Moving to 48V and ethernet, allows for modular construction as you can finish parts and just leave a wire or two hanging out to plug and play to the next module. With traditional manufacturing with 12V and every part needing to be wired to the control system you pretty much need the structure of the vehicle built before you put in the wiring harnesses. Modular construction will allow for much more robotic assembly as you simplify the movements needed to construct a module. Things like a structural battery back also enable this as it allows you mor flexibility in putting your seats on before you attach that to the car (my understanding is if the part is not structural, then building it up before attaching to the structure will result in all sorts of warping making assembly after too difficult. Structural parts should not warp when built as modules). Perhaps the sheet metal skin, as used in the Cybertruck, will allow the structure of the next-gen vehicle to be distributed through modules that are themselves structurally sound before being attached to the other parts of the car. All these underlying technologies are what will help enable the new production process and keep costs well below anything the rest of the industry is close to. I would also note that I really think that EV's are causing the iPhoning of the car world. Meaning, that the perception that people really care about the design of their car and hence choose one model over another, is really a false perception driven by all the choices being sub-par. Offer a car that ticks off all the things you want on a practical level and people will care much less about being unique (in other words, everyone will be fine driving the exact same car, the same way everyone has the exact same looking phone).\n\n**Concluding thoughts** \\- In all these things, I really don't see anyone out there who is really competing or posing a competitive threat to Tesla. Yes, the Chinese automakers, like BYD, are great at mass producing cars and making their LFP batteries, but I don't see these things as actually being very competitive with what Tesla is doing. And even if they are, it will be splitting a massive pie that Tesla will be doing just fine with. Placing a value on all these things is impossible but the potential value here, especially down the line, is trillions. I think the potential value of the energy and auto side of the business without the AI is alone a few trillion. In any case, for those who look at the short-term, I understand it can at times be discouraging as you are not seeing the promised land just yet, but if you focus on what is being done here and how they are building the future it is hard not to be excited. Of course exactly what the future will be and the extent these things work out is unknown, but I am confident with this investment and plan to hold as long as I can.\n\nFYI, I did not bother going into Supercharging, insurance or other things here as many of those things are ancillary or small parts of enabling the bigger things here, but they are big things as well by themselves.\n\nHappy New Year to All!", "id": "18tv3x8", "created_utc": 1703877901.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Nice , thanks for sharing, I agree with you.
