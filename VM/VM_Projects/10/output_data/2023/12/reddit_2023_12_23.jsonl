For example, if side test occurs early in the cycle (e.g., I've got 40 DTE left), I'm more likely to sell call against then and there.  If it's late in the cycle (e.g., I'm right at 21 DTE), I'm more like to roll out the short put \"as is\" and then sell call against.\n\nSince side test generally will be ATM (50 delta), this generally ends up being a -25 delta short call.  This converts the naked short put into a short strangle, which I then manage from the point forward, keeping track of total credits received.  It also reduces the directionality of the play by cutting net delta in half and improves downside break even by the credit received for the short call.  You generally look to roll the short strangle as a unit, collecting credits along the way, adjusting sides as necessary to reduce directionality and cost basis.  I generally look to scratch these trades out, since they're basically \"broken\" and inconsistent with my original assumption and/or what I was trying to do.  You can still make money on them, but it may require rolls over a number of cycles, which not everyone likes doing.  That being said, I feel remiss if I don't take a run at it for a couple of cycles to see if I can get it to \"work out.\"  It is, after all, the losers in this game that kill you.  (No one gets killed by winners, last time I checked).  Managing f'd up short strangles (which is what that is) is probably a separate post in itself, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nCash Secured: You can take the same approach in a cash secured environment (sell call against), but not all brokers allow the naked short call, so you generally have to do something like sell a spread against with the short call leg at about half the delta of the short put and buy something stupid like a .05 long call as a workaround.\n\nIn both cases (margin and cash secured), I generally evaluate \"what's best\" at 21 DTE.  Can I strike improve?  How much will I get paid in credit for that? Does going longer duration with my roll help?  Will I get better cost basis reduction if I just take assignment and sell call against? You kind of have to look at everything you could do and then pick the one that makes the most sense from a BP efficiency and cost basis reduction standpoint.  I do not consider rolling for a debit \"an option.\"  Part of this game is reducing cost basis, not increasing it.\n\nProfit Taking.\n\nI'm big on taking profit at 50% max.  If the underlying remains sexy from an IVR/IV standpoint, I can consider getting back in, but all too frequently, market conditions change and the juice is now somewhere else to be taken advantage of.  \n\nThat being said, I will occasionally do \"window dressing\" rolls to lock in realized gains (generally when the setup is at 50% max), I will roll down and out to a strike that pays me a small credit so that at least I can say \"I made money/realized a gain,\" but I remain in the play at a lower strike (and therefore lower risk and BP effect) to milk the second half of premium out of it.\n\nHandling Assignment\n\nTo be honest, I'm assigned ***rarely*** unless that is an outcome I intended, and it usually involves my selling an in-the-money put with a break even right at where the underlying is currently trading.  For everything else, that's part of the game, and you need to be set up to take on shares from a buying power standpoint.  If you aren't (and this has been known to occur), early random assignment basically ends the trade (because you don't have the BP for it or taking on shares radically impairs your ability to continue to do what you've been doing because of that one \"poo pile\" that is hogging an inordinate amount of your BP).  You generally end up closing out the position pretty immediately either because it is now impairing your ability to continue to trade or (gasps), you've been margin called.\n\nOn a side note, one of the reasons for the 21 DTE roll rule has to do with exactly this: early, random assignment on ITM short options where there is minimal extrinsic left in the option (which naturally occurs near the end of the cycle).  If you wait toward the very end of the cycle (<10 DTE), the risk of random assignment increases as the remaining weenie extrinsic bleeds out of the option contract.  Naturally, this isn't a biggie if you're comfortable with taking assignment; if your account can't handle it or it would substantially impair your ability to continue to get into trades effectively, that's another matter.  \n\nIVR/IV\n\nThere are \"ideal\" IVR/IV metrics and there are ones you just have to \"make do with.\"  For single name, the \"ideal\" metrics are >70 IVR/>50 IV; ETF's: >50 IVR, >35 IV.  IVR can be somewhat misleading if we've had a fairly high volatility environment in the past 52-weeks, making it appear that we're relatively low in the range at any given moment, so I take IVR with a grain of salt, opting primarily to focus on IV metrics. If you wait all the time for the \"ideal,\" you probably won't be playing this game a ton for lengthy periods of time or you'll be waiting a lot for an expansion of IV, put on a bunch of trades in that moment, and then sit on your hands the rest of the time.  (It does actually tend to go that way; I ramp up in higher IV environments; ramp down when IV contracts.  This just kind of happens \"organically.\"  In a broad market high IV environment, there are generally more underlyings with favorable IV metrics to play.)\n\nFor this reason, I'm rarely \"maximally deployed\" in the market, particularly here where IV pretty much across the board kind of blows chunks.\n\nDiversification\n\nI am frankly not all that attentive to being diversified except to the extent that I want to avoid a bunch of premium plays in the same space.  Piling into all crypto-based premium-selling plays here (where the juice is temporarily) is generally a bad idea.  Pick one with the best IV metrics and leave it at that.\n\nThis is an IV-based strategy generally, so I go where the premium is.  That being said, there are single names that for long periods of time have been \"juicy\" (TSLA, AMD, NVDA come to mind), ETF's that have it going on (XBI, SMH, EWZ), and futures options that are constantly \"frisky\" relative to the rest of the market (/CL). \n\nMarket Conditions and Delta and/or Strategy Selection\n\nI generally sell the same delta and duration ... ***every time***.  That being said, I am not reluctant to sell longer duration where I don't feel shorter duration is paying me enough or I'm trying to disperse risk over expiries rather than aggregating all my risk at one strike in one expiry.  My minimum expectation is that I get paid 1% of the strike price in credit for strikes that are at 20 delta or below at 45 DTE.  (***Compare*** TSLA Feb 16th 18 delta 215 short put, 5.20 credit, 2.42% of the strike price ***with*** SPY Feb 16th 20 delta 453 short put, 2.91 credit, .64% of the strike price (ugh; weak sauce)).\n\nIn low vol environments where I literally can't find anything to play (or more likely, am already in everything that I find \"sexy\" from a premium-selling standpoint), there are two setups I resort to: SPX put calendars (RUT works okay, too; NDX is shit illiquid, unfortunately) and broad market (SPY, IWM, QQQ) double diagonals.  The former is a long Vega play (i.e., is a bet on an IV expansion) with a cost basis reduction element in the event you don't get the needed move immediately.  The latter is managed in such a way as to take advantage of movement either way in the underlying with a cost basis reduction element.  I don't deploy them with frequency, generally opting to sell longer duration to get paid over just sitting on my hands waiting for \"the next one.\"", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your thorough answer. Here are some more questions to clarify your strategy:\n\n1.\tLaddering Approach: Could you detail how you implement laddering with trades that have the same 25 delta and 45 DTE? How do you manage the timing and sequencing of these staggered trades?\n\n2.\tStrangle Management: For strangles that evolve from side tests, what is your approach to adjustments and overall management, particularly in balancing risk?\n\n3.\tCriteria for Window Dressing Rolls: What criteria do you use to decide when to engage in \u201cwindow dressing\u201d rolls?\n\n4.   Trade duration: On average, when do you usually close your 45 DTE options?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Laddering: There are two approaches to laddering.  (1) All at once; and (2) At intervals.  Most of the time, I ladder out at intervals (e.g., each week, add a rung).  However, there were slopportunities (e.g., the massive dip in Oct) when I laddered a bunch out at once, going out several months. I generally pay attention to what I've got on in the ladder and want to add at better strikes than what I currently have if the opportunity presents itself.  Otherwise, I generally just wait for all the rungs to play out and start the cycle over again.\n\nBroken Strangle Management:  The general rule with these is to roll at 21 DTE, rolling the tested side \"as is,\" and the untested to the delta that is about half of what the tested side is, keeping track of total credits collected along the way.  Intraexpiry, you'll want to monitor side delta and roll in the untested side in toward current price of the underlying to keep the setup from getting too directional and to reduce cost basis and side break evens.  The general rule is to roll the untested side to about half the delta of tested one within the same expiry (not out in time).\n\n***Under no circumstances do you want to roll out a short leg to an expiry that is different from the other leg.***  This will dramatically change the BPE of the setup.  If you happen to fat finger a roll in this way (hey, I've done it; oops), remedy the situation immediately by rolling the \"unmatched\" short leg out to the same expiry as the other one.  \n\nOn occasion, you will have to invert the short strangle (i.e., short call at a lower strike than the short put), but it's important not to invert the short strangle such that the width of the inversion is greater than the total credits collected, since you aren't able to scratch out an inverted short strangle in that state. The other reason you want to keep track of total credits received: at some point, you may want to uninvert the short strangle or recenter it, paying a debit to do so.  I'm fine with doing that ... ***as long as the debit paid is less than the total credits received to date.***  I generally only uninvert for a debit where price has whipped way the fuck back into my set up and now the short call is monied. (Ever work a covered put?  Let's just say: \"I'd rather not.\")\n\nIn any event, the goal with brokens is to shoot for a scratch, but I don't hesitate to take a loss where that loss is less than were you to have wrung your hands, watched the underlying implode, and did nothing.  I mean, if it's 5.00 underwater and suddenly, it's only 1.00, I'm probably just going to take that bitch off for a loss and call it a day.\n\nThe alternative way of looking at selling call against your tested short put is this: I am going to take assignment; the short call is just giving me a \"head start\" on reducing cost basis or keeps my cost basis in range of a strike that I can sell for something decent.  Consequently, some like to sell call against a tested short put, keep track of their cost basis, take assignment, and then carry on with working a covered call with a better cost basis than if they just stood there and did nothing with their tested short put.  Personally, I'm fine with working this type of broken setup (monied short put, short call) for as long as it takes me to get to a cost basis that I'm comfortable with such that I'm happier taking assignment of shares at that point.\n\nWindow Dressing Rolls: This is really just a subjective thing I do from time to time and there aren't really any specific mechanics associated with it beyond my being able to roll down and (usually) slightly out for a weenie credit.\n\nTrade Duration: The general rule is to take profit at 50% max; look at rolling (as well as any other options) at 21 DTE if it hasn't hit for 45 DTE setups.  Rolling isn't always your best option, necessarily, which is why I say \"look at.\"  On margin, you generally want to stay in the options contract as long as possible due to BP efficiency; cash secured, not as much (although staying in the options contract in a cash secured environment might afford you some more strategic flexibility than just allowing assignment to occur; among other things, you can't \"strike improve\" stock).  \n\nI'm not overtly religious about the 21 DTE thing.  \n\nIf it's an OTM short put, I may wait another week.  If it's ITM, I'll roll at 21.\n\nIf it's an ITM covered call, I leave it alone.  I'll roll the short call aspect of a covered call at any time in the cycle if: (a) price traverses my short call at any point in the cycle ***and*** the short call is in profit; (b) my break even/cost basis is tested and the short call is in profit (that's usually the case); (c) when it's at 50 max (and therefore in profit).  I generally like to maintain short call delta at between -30 and -40, so I may also roll to maintain this metric, assuming it's locking in a realized gain that's \"decent\" (e.g., .50; I'm not rolling to lock in something stupid like .10, in other words).\n\nIf it's a messed up, broken ass short strangle or straddle that I can't scratch out, I roll at 21 DTE.\n\nIron condor/fly/double double trade management is a whole separate topic, as are some of the more exotic setups you can do with options (calendars, butterflies, backspreads, diagonals, yada yada).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I truly appreciate you taking time to write down the detailed answers. \n\n1.\tRolling Options: Could you explain the strategic benefit of rolling options, given that it involves closing the current position (realizing a loss or gain) and opening a new one?\n I have personally come to the conclusion that simply closing the position and reopening a new one is more straightforward and less confusing compared to rolling.

(Cost basis 7)\n\nIf I roll out to March 15 215, you are correct that I will collect 3.27 premium but I will also realize a whopping $5.41 loss per contract (current put price 12.41 - cost basis of 7 = 5.47). This loss doesn\u2019t seem to be considered in your math. \n\nSo the total premium of 15.17 I will receive (per your math) is actually 9.7 and even if everything goes in my favor and I close it at 50%, I will pocket 4.85.

That will occur regardless of whether I close it out or chose to roll it, which I will do in the vast majority of cases, since I'm not taking a >5.00 loss on anything without at least making an attempt to reduce the size of the loss or ideally, scratch it out.\n\nThe realized loss is part of the setup on roll.  If you look at what the 215/245 is marking at, it is 20.52 at the mid versus your scratch point (total credits collected) of 15.17 (i.e., it's under water by 20.52 - 15.17 or 5.35.  If you immediately felt \"roller's remorse\" and closed out the short strangle right away, your realized loss would be -- in the end -- approximately the same as though you just shut the whole thing down and didn't roll at all.\n\nIf price continues to move against the short put, I generally roll the short call down further (within the same expiry and again to a strike that is about 1/2 the delta of the tested side).  In some cases, I will even roll past the tested side, resulting in an inverted setup.  Under no circumstances, however, do I roll to an inverted width greater than total credits collected (e.g., if you've collected 15.00 in credits, the widest inversion you'd want to do is 215P/200C).\n\nIf I do get an opportunity to uninvert the short strangle for a debit that is ***less than*** the total credits I've collected to date, then I go ahead and do that if I can recenter my risk (e.g., uninvert to a 35 delta short strangle with the call and put sides now both OTM -- which is the preferred state of affairs for a short strangle).\n\nIf I can't scratch out the rolled setup at the \"new\" 21 DTE, I go ahead and roll it again -- the tested side \"as is,\" the untested to a strike that is half the tested's delta.  Naturally, if at 21 DTE my loss is only .50 versus the 5.00 I would have experienced were I to have done nothing, well, I'm probably going to take that bitch off for a .50 net loser, since that's beaucoup better than a 5.00 loss.  \n\nMe personally, I will roll for just about as long as it takes to scratch out, particularly in a market like this, where it isn't exactly a kid in a candy store IV all over the place such that I'm missing out on premium-selling opportunities elsewhere by tying up BP in this POS I'm stuck in, waiting for extrinsic to piss out.

Losers tend to be outsized relative to winners in this game and to not at least make an attempt to reduce the size of the loss over time with cost basis reduction strategies (which is what rolling for duration and a credit does for you) aren't going to be particularly successful or will be unimpressed with their ROC if they're insistent on doing things that way all the time.\n\nNaturally, there are rare cases where the setup can't be saved (there are a number of names in the Cannabis sector that come to mind) where neither side is paying sufficiently to reduce cost basis with any sort of efficiency because the underlying has imploded to such a price where the premium isn't sufficient in dollars and cents terms to do much to save the setup.\n\nI'd probably roll out ***before*** earnings.

(It's AH, so that's showing a wide bid/ask, and it's unlikely you'd get that).  To improve to 205 and get a credit, you'd have to roll out to July.  To 200, out to Sept.\n\nMe personally, if were to do that here, I'd still sell call against, since all of those strikes would be \"too directional\" for my tastes, relative to where my assumption was at the start of the setup (i.e., neutral to 25 delta bullish): the May 210 would be at the 70; the June 205, at the 61; and the Sept 200 at the 54 delta, respectively.\n\nOne of the reasons you don't really want to wait to roll is assignment risk, which would dramatically alter the BPE of the position relative to where you'd be if you just stayed in the option position.  At the moment, there is very little extrinsic left in the 215 (\\~.40), and as you get closer to expiry, the risk of a random assignment increases without that much additional theta decay to show for it.  (If you want to be \"religiously mechanical,\" the generally accepted rule-of-thumb for rolling is at 21 DTE, assuming a 45 DTE wheelhouse.)\n\nSure, it might bounce, but it could also get worse, so I generally don't bet on the market doing the work for me; I stay mechanical, reduce directionality, and let the extrinsic I've collected work over time.

You can't buy a \"cheap long\" (a relative term) here without potentially having a wing that is wider than the BPE of the naked.  (Compare, e.g., SPY March 15th 473 short put, 83.07 BPE with SPY March 15th 416/473, 54.25 BPE, paying .50 for the 416 to bring in BPE by 35%).\n\nI generally only do this \"after the fact\" for really cheap (we're talking .05-.10), usually because the position is hogging BP, and I'd like to do something else with that BP while the safety taped position is doing its thing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you want to look at things probabilistically, the options market is saying that 215 has about an 10% POT (Probability of Touch) for the Feb 16th contract given Friday's closing price.

However, even if natural gas stock prices were tied perfectly to the price of natural gas (they\u2019re not), a quick perusal of historical prices reveals that natural gas prices have little correlation with how cold it is outside:\n\n[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdW.htm](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdW.htm)\n\nFor our purposes here (or at least the purpose of furthering my argument) this is a *good* thing; as natural gas is a commodity, we are not completely in the dark as to what the price will be in January:\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ngf24](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ngf24)\n\nAs the spot price history shows, there are seasons where we see natural gas prices increase as winter approaches/progresses...and there are seasons where we don't. So wtf is going on here? How should I fucking know? All I know is that these turds tend to rise to rise in price from around like, well, early November to now-ish, into January, sometimes February, sometimes even March. Afterward, late March - April or so, they tend to fall, as we will see. \n\nIn addition to the lack of correlation between natural gas price and stock price, the severity of the season also does not appear to have (much of) an impact. Winters of 17-18 and 18-19 were colder than normal in North American per wiki, but we generally saw less ng stock price movement (see below). Winter 20-21 was colder than either of those (the phrase \"polar vortex\" presented itself repeatedly in my research) and there was a lot of upward movement that season...but the entire market was still in recovery from covid lows, so I am not certain it can be entirely  (or even mostly) because of the weather. Plus, the movements were often larger in 21-22 and 22-23, both of which were mild winters.\n\nTherefore, I have talked myself into believing that we can use this, er, call it a \"tendency,\" to our advantage. I seek either validation, or reasons why \"this has been tried a million times before and it never works and wtf are you wasting my time with this crap?\"\n\nAnyhow, below are a few of the tickers I\u2019ve looked at:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Antero Resources (AR) \u2013 last close 22.76, 52-wk rg 34.66 - 19.91\n\n\\-at 43.69%. it is the highest IV stock I looked at, HV 47.35% (100D), 23% IV percentile, 28.73% IV rank\n\n\\-based on 3 month squiggly lines if TA is your thing: RSI about 42; MACD recent crossed above signal line; current price is slightly above 10-day MA, but around $4 below 50-day MA\n\n\\-no dividend\n\n\\-next ER due 2/14\n\n\\-chart with moves annotated (sorry for how shitty this one is, the others are slightly less shitty):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/25obx009ty7c1.jpg?width=1754&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1bb8235084dd1babce85b051fe4d781fed0c7a2\n\n\\-if you hate charts or just prefer tables, you can get historical weekly prices here, click the link then click \"historical data\" then enter the dates above (I used weekly frequency):\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AR?p=AR&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AR?p=AR&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\nI found this one interesting for a few reasons. 1) The high(er) IV should give us the best option prices initially if we are shorting; 2) AR has one of the better buy/hold/sell ratings that I saw of all of them, from the ones listed on Yahoo to Barchart to Merrill/RH, though Fidelity's cited analysts aren't as excited; 3) it isn\u2019t far from its 52-week low, so the optimist in me thinks it has room to run, and 4) they are a NATURAL GAS company, so theoretically not susceptible to oil price swings fucking up our mojo (more on that below).\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn't follow the \"tendency\" as reliably as some of the others. It followed least in the covid meltdown year and recovery year after. That might be forgivable considering the circumstances, but there were others that DID follow the pattern even then, though it\u2019s arguable that this was coincidence as the market bottom happened to hit in March.\n\n2. Matador Resources (MTDR) \u2013 last close 57.64, 52-wk rg 42.04 \u2013 56.94\n\n\\-second-highest IV I looked at, 39.76%, HV 35.52% (100D), IV percentile 30%, IV rank 29.5%\n\n\\-assorted TA shit: 100-day RSI 50.43%, MACD recently crossed above signal line, just above 20-day but below 5 and 50-day MAs, whatever\n\n\\-pays a quarterly dividend, 1.4% annual, last ex-date 11/09/23, last pay date 12/01/23\n\n\\-next ER due 2/20\n\n\\-no weekly options\n\n\\-chart with annotated moves (this one sucks less):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ap6cj14x4z7c1.jpg?width=1175&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=025c7616a8fb1d856a8170de09de051794a5213b\n\n\\-Yahoo link if you prefer tables:\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MTDR?p=MTDR&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MTDR?p=MTDR&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\nLike AR, MTDR is company that deals with natural gas, not oil or other commodities (again, more below). It has good buy/hold/sell recs from multiple sources (I didn\u2019t see any sells) so it might be a good play independent of this trend. The best part is that it follows the trend every winter since 2017. The movements were not as big (i.e. profitable) in 17-19, but from then on, forget about it (with the above caveats about the covid crash and recovery).\n\nPossible downsides include the dividend, which could be a false sell signal, the fact that there are no weekly options, making it more difficult to roll positions if needed (though OI does not appear to be an issue), and the possibility that I am simply full of shit.\n\n3. Coterra Energy (CTRA) \u2013 last close 25.74, 52-wk rg 22.25 \u2013 29.89\n\n\\-IV 23.85%, HV 22.27% (100D), IV percentile 13%, IV rank 9.79%\n\n\\-TA again: 100-day RSI 48.91%, 25.46 5-day, 25.48 20-day, 26.86 50-day, MACD recently crossed signal line except the wrong way; I know you\u2019re skipping this part\n\n\\-dividend of 3.17% paid quarterly, last ex-date 11/15/23, last pay date 11/30/23\n\n\\-next ER expected 022/23/24\n\n\\-chart with annotated moves:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2swsltcty7c1.jpg?width=1181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e76be3f495141104b2824583d0f8d10d3e71f903\n\n\\-link to Yahoo page for historical prices or whatever else\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CTRA?p=CTRA&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CTRA?p=CTRA&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\nHonestly, I was mainly attracted to this one because of the bargain level options premiums but, as you can see for yourself, that may not mean much. If I am to believe that this is a cyclical, HISTORICAL trend, I can\u2019t handwave the 100D HV away, and it\u2019s shit. So is the 52-wk range, suggesting this one does not have far to move and it may be range-bound. That said, we can see by the chart that it\u2019s at least capable of not being a deadass, and again calls are kind of cheap, so I threw it into the mix.\n\n4. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) \u2013 last close 84.73, 52-wk rg 75.36 \u2013 93.69\n\n\\-IV 21.37%, HV (100D) 30.82%, IV Percentile 14%, IV rank 14.57%\n\n\\-What\u2019s the point?: 14-day RSI: 52.81%, 84.56 5D, 83.73 20D, 85.29 50D; MACD above signal line blah blah\n\n\\-3.59 distribution yield paid quarterly, last pay date 12/21/23, .10 expense ratio, no cap gain\n\n\\-chart with annotated moves:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2j3m5nhty7c1.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=619f4b133a9efe3e8470776cdc1d20d9c02ecbd2\n\n\\-Yahoo\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLE?p=XLE&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLE?p=XLE&.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\nSo XLE, you would think, wouldn\u2019t work, right? This EFT only has 26 holdings, and only a handful of them are natural-gas-only companies. Nearly 40% of it is comprised of only two of these, XOM and CVX, two companies known mainly for oil. In fact, if you compare the XLE chart to the XOM chart over the same time period, they look quite similar. So why put this one on here?\n\nWell, XLE is one of the tickers most faithful to the winter trend of them all. This suggests that, despite the assumption that this would be overly-sensitive to changes in crude prices, that does not appear to be the case (again with the qualifier this is not just a figment of my imagination). Plus, oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are major producers of natural gas, producing 14% of all US natural gas in 2022 [https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60902](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60902). Furthermore, despite the low IV numbers, there is plenty of movement between winter and spring; more than enough to justify its inclusion and a possible play. That there are no earnings to deal with is an added bonus.\n\nI looked at other tickers as well, but this post is already too long and those charts were tedious as hell to create. I will list them here if you would like to take a look yourselves. Some are better than others, of course:\n\nAPA\n\nEQT\n\nXOM\n\nDVN\n\nCHK\n\nRRC\n\nSWN\n\nWMB\n\nFeel free to peruse the charts of these or any other natural gas-adjacent stocks and see if anything catches your fancy, via Barchart or Yahoo or RH or anywhere you get your podcasts.\n\nWith the lowish IV, CSPs are out (plus we know it will go down if the \"tendency\" holds), which leaves maybe vertical spreads. But I'm thinking instead something more simple: buy calls now, sell calls when it \"peaks\" (or when we think it's peaked), then buy puts to cash on the expected decline. The problem, as always, will be figuring out when the \"peak\" has hit. But even if we are wrong in our timing, we might be able to just keep rolling until the expected move(s) happen. Or they could just not happen at all, which would obviously suck.\n\nI have already bought a (small, very small) handful of calls on a few of these, all with 1/19 expiry except for XLE which is 2/16, most of which are already red thanks to Wednesday's bullshit. I just want to know if I (we?) should shove all in on this play, or if I should stop staring at charts so much.", "id": "18oy9fx", "created_utc": 1703308051.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "stfu bruv", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Words of encouragement", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10381484031677246}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0305548757314682}, {"body": "Whether your right or wrong this was a good read, thankyou for taking the time to write this.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08837296068668365}, {"body": "lol, those have been priced in and are overpriced anyways.
