{"title": "Could Apple be working with Blackberry ?", "selftext": "BlackBerry IVY as we know is designed to analyze vehicle sensor data in real-time. Its integration with Apple CarPlay could provide Apple with an efficient and comprehensive way to access a wide range of vehicle data without the need for separate agreements and development with each car manufacturer and OEM.

Access to data such as engine performance, fuel efficiency, temperature controls, and more, could significantly enhance the user experience, making CarPlay a central hub for both infotainment and vehicle monitoring.
