I have heard some guys saying that low vix is actually good for option sellers due to low moves. But i dont think low vix generally makes sense due to the dirt cheap premiums, Just to get a consensius estimate, what's your take on low vix vs high vix for us as option sellers. Expecting vix to go above 18 in the year 2024.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/18jll9c)", "id": "18jll9c", "created_utc": 1702709939.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Let me break it down for you in the simplest way possible.\n\nWhen IV is low, you sell ITM calls against an underlying you already own. \n\nWhen IV is high, you sell OTM calls on newly purchased underlying. \n\nif you are into selling spreads/naked, you want to be looking at calendar/diagonal spreads (maybe even a double diagonal).\n\n0 DTEs are directional plays because you are cheap and or chicken.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply, sir.
