{"title": "Alaska Airlines agrees to buy Hawaiian Airlines in $1.9 billion deal", "selftext": "Alaska Air Group\n has agreed to buy rival Hawaiian Airlines\n in a $1.9 billion deal, setting up another potential regulatory battle in the second proposed airline merger in less than two years.\n\nAlaska would pay $18 a share for Hawaiian and would take on $900 million of its debt, the companies said Sunday. Shares of Hawaiian Airlines closed on Friday at $4.86, giving the company a market cap of about $250 million. They\u2019re down nearly 53% this year.\n\n\nThe airline has struggled with challenges including the Maui wildfires, increased competition from Southwest, which has ramped up service in Hawaii in recent years, and a lagging recovery of travel to and from Asia after the pandemic. Hawaiian has posted net losses in all but one quarter since the start of 2020, while Alaska and other carriers have returned to more solid financial footing as the pandemic waned.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw here was a unique opportunity in time at the valuation that we saw Hawaiian at,\u201d said Shane Tackett, Alaska Airlines\u2019 CFO, in an interview. He said the deal would also enable the combined companies to become a \u201cmarket leader\u201d in the premium-travel Hawaii market.\n\nCarriers have faced strong opposition from President Joe Biden\u2019s Justice Department in their efforts to combine to better compete with larger rivals. Earlier this year, the DOJ won a lawsuit to break up a regional partnership in the Northeast between JetBlue Airways\n and American Airlines\n.\n\nThe Justice Departments also sued to block JetBlue Airways\n\u2019 proposed acquisition of discount carrier Spirit Airlines\n. A trial is expected to wrap up in the coming days.\n\nFour airlines \u2014 American, United\n, Delta\n and Southwest\n \u2014 control about 80% of the U.S. market. Hawaiian and Alaska said they expect the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months, subject to approval by regulators and Hawaiian\u2019s shareholders.\n\nOn a call with analysts on Sunday evening, Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci expressed confidence in the deal getting approved, citing 12 overlapping markets, a combined 1,400 daily flights and a larger network that he said would allow the airline to compete with the four largest carriers.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that it will be seen in a positive light,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents cabin crews at both airlines said it would evaluate the deal.\n\n\u201cOur first priority is to determine whether this merger will improve conditions for Flight Attendants just like the benefits the companies have described for shareholders and consumers,\u201d the AFA said in a statement. \u201cOur support of the merger will depend on this.\u201d\n\nThe combined company will be based in Seattle, where Alaska Airlines is headquartered, and be led by Minicucci.\n\n\u201cGiven the transaction dollars we paid we feel this is strategically a step-change for us to accelerate not only our financial performance but the growth of our network,\u201d he said said on the call.\n\nThe two airlines said they will keep each carrier\u2019s brand but operate under a single platform, combining into a 365-airplane fleet covering 138 destinations.\n\nPrior to pursuing Hawaiian, Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America for $2.6 billion in 2016.\n\nThe Hawaiian deal is a major shift for Alaska. It operates Boeing\n 737s and it spent years whittling down Virgin\u2019s fleet of Airbus planes to streamline its fleet. Purchasing Hawaiian would bring a complex mix of Boeing and Airbus jets, both narrow-body and wide-body planes, under Alaska\u2019s roof.\n\n\u201cThe Hawaiian brand will remain an important part of our home state with Honolulu becoming a strategic hub for the combined company and expanded service for Hawaii residents,\u201d Hawaiian CEO Peter Ingram said on the call Sunday.\n\nThe combination will allow Alaska Airlines to triple nonstop or one-stop flights from the Hawaiian islands to destinations throughout North America. It will also bring Hawaiian\u2019s long-haul flying to and from Asia under Alaska\u2019s umbrella. Hawaiian last year struck a deal to fly converted-cargo planes for Amazon\n.\n\nAlaska Airlines said the deal should bolster earnings within the next two years with at least $235 million of \u201crun-rate synergies.\u201d", "id": "18aht0g", "created_utc": 1701687456.0, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Cementing non-continential America airlines!", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Last time I checked, Alaska was solidly on the continent.
