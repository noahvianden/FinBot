A crude assumption of a linear revenue ramp would show about $1B annual revenue now increasing to $3B+ by 2030.  It would be nice to assume that more auto customers will come on board soon too.\n\n- Unlike AI datacenter chips, there's lots of strong competition from Mobileye, Google, Tesla, Qualcomm, and a bunch of Chinese companies.  Qualcomm has said their order pipeline is $30B+.\n\n- Will the Chinese AI chip ban affect Orin/Thor sales?  Will it limit datacenter chip sales for virtual self-driving training?\n\n- A big unknown - Cruise was using Orin chips while working on designing their own chips.  With the recent implosion of Cruise, does that push carmakers away from making their own and towards companies like Nvidia?  Or does Nvidia get some blame for Cruise's failure that could hurt future sales?\n\nhttps://techhq.com/2022/09/expensive-chips-pushed-gms-cruise-to-build-its-own-to-power-its-self-driving-vehicles/#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20GM's%20Cruise%20is,its%20Origin%20vehicle%20were%20given.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I think they will be able to surpass $3 billion by 2030 if they get more software deals like the one with Mercedes. That's where the money is. Thor will also have better margins because it's going to be a more expensive chip than orin. Qualcomm is probably the biggest competitor for ADAS, but nothing they have for autonomous driving comes close to the TOPS of thor. Not that tops is all that matters, but you definitely want the most powerful on board chip for autonomous driving.\n\nYes, i would say the biggest risk for their auto business would be an orin or thor ban in china.\n\nIn regards to cruise, I think most legacy auto companies are going to be forced to use Nvidia or Qualcomm. A legacy car company doesn't have the expertise for the development of an in house asic for autonomous driving. At least not one that is competitive. The software stack is also always garbage with the legacy auto companies. \n\nNvidia seems to be doing very well in China with their auto segment. Almost all the big chinese ev companies have adopted orin and the hyperion platform. Once Nvidia writes the software stack for the partnership it's probably tough to switch to a competitor, so mercedes is probably stuck with Nvidia.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "It's been a little inconsistent to this point.
