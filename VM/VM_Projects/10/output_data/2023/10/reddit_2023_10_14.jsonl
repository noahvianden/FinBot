The monthly dividends are [pretty inconsistent](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/tsly/dividend-history) and being a newer fund, along with their other variants on the other tech tickers, I just didn't have the conviction that their special sauce was so special.  Their expense ratio is also on the higher side.\n\nAs more info is analyzed perhaps it will become more clear if they are more gifted than average.  Their yield right now is 51% which feels pretty high.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "All of these yield max things look to be just like some rich guy doing his trading fund as an etf to save taxes. I'm not saying it's good or bad.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Lol. That was my first thought.

Looks like they don't have as much flexibility in timing when it comes to closing/rolling their short calls. They mention having to buy to close at a loss if underlining goes above their short calls should rolling not be an option. So I'm guessing their \"conviction\" in holding the trades is really not accurate since they're required to hold til expiration.
