Or that humans, expert humans, are still required in the process to complete a SOTA chip design?\n\nObviously, there's not enough information to say as I explained previously. We don't know how advanced OpenAI's AI is. Just from a startup perspective, it seems crazy to me that OpenAI would pursue a chip when there is still so much to be done in software. Unless you think they're stupid, they must have belief in some kind of advantage.\n\nMy feeling is that the answer to the question is no, but unless I have more clarity into what's going on exactly within OpenAI I can't be sure how close we are to it. Remember that GPT-4 was trained on A100s, and the H100s are NINE times faster in training and OpenAI now has more of them, plus probably much better data at higher context limits now too. An updated version trained on H100s would be unbelievably more powerful, and rumors seem to indicate that's true.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that Nvidia is not yet pursuing AGI and that ChatGPT was not a wake-up call, either that or they're very good at being clandestine about it. It would really suck if they led the field every step of the way towards AI but loses the leadership in vision at the last step.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "&#x200B;\n\n>it seems crazy to me that OpenAI would pursue a chip when there is still so much to be done in software. \n\nagree\n\n>Unless you think they're stupid, they must have belief in some kind of advantage.\n\nThe advantage conjecture seems a bit of maybe an over trusting conclusion.  OpenAI building a chip could just be a rumor.   I see a bit of Elon in Sam,  a need to feed the ego and retain the spotlight.  It's way more in MSFT's interest than OpenAI imo. \n\n>My feeling is that the answer to the question is no,\n\nagree\n\n> but unless I have more clarity into what's going on exactly within OpenAI I can't be sure how close we are to it. \n\n \"how close we are to it\"?    to what AGI?

It's almost certainly to receive a boost like NVDA already did.\n\nBut I think in the long term NVDA will stay the winner, AMD has no chance of becoming a \"magnificent 7\"-tier company.

But I would definitely sell the launch news.  I don't know if AMD is going to finally get their shit together in DC GPUs or not.   They will make some traction with DC customers just due to overwhelming unsatisfied demand.   Whether that impact affects Nvidia's business in the next 12 mos is maybe a 10% chance.   Nvidia's share price however will probably see some knee jerk reactions from the market.\n\nAMD will be doing well if they can sell $1-2B in MI300s next year (in comparison to H100's $60B).  Major CSPs have a very long qual cycle, so AMD may get most traction from 2nd/3rd tier and enterprise.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Thanks for the information!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15069259703159332}], "tickers": ["nvda", "amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30347079038619995}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40015119314193726}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5030204653739929}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.004080420359969139}], "tickers": ["msft"]}
