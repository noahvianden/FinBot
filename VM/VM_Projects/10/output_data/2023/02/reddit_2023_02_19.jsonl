{"title": "We got a leg down on deck folks!", "selftext": " \n\nSince ya'll loved my last post so much I'm here to indulge you once more\n\nWe ended up having a complete range week this past week and were close to forming an inside bar on the weekly chart. Undercutting the prior week's low by not even a dollar on the SPY and closing just below last week's closing print. So I suppose yes I was right, last week was indeed a red week\n\n***I am officially 1/1 on my weekly predictions\u2026***\n\nHowever! I do hope you paid attention to the levels outlined in last week's post as the levels mentioned were on point.\n\n>It is possible that we base here for a few days and make a shot at a move higher. If that\u2019s the case, watch closely how price reacts in the 410-415 area. If toppy and is clearly selling this would be a great area to get a short position.\n\nThis was the trade of the week here in the markets last week.\n\nMonday we saw a rally all day with a bid holding into the CPI announcement. CPI came in greater than expected and was initially bought than sold. We saw a retest of our 410 line in the sand and hold with a relatively flat close on the day.\n\nWednesday another hold of 410 off of the open, trading back towards that 414 liquidity mentioned in last week's post with a failure to hold.\n\nThursday\u2019s Premarket session put an end to the grinding action which we had the first half of the week undercutting our higher lows set at 408 & 409.5, opening the market with the biggest gap of the week. We saw an all day rally yet again Thursday grinding into the close with the last hour of action giving it all back and closing at new lows.\n\nFriday we saw this continued action with another gap down in the markets. We traded to the new 404 demand zone noted in last week's post and more or less held that range the entire day before pushing into the close.\n\nThere was plenty of action last week to be had! We don\u2019t need a huge directional move in the markets each week to make money. Having levels drawn out and understanding the general narrative of the markets at any given time can help you capitalize on the volatility.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kormfgmr26ja1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e3a57c5a0033e4d964b551bbbe0123efeff870\n\nTop Down Analysis\n\nMoving on to our coming week's Top Down Analysis!\n\nOverall my macro thesis is still intact. If you didn\u2019t read last week's post then I\u2019ll fill us in quickly. Longer term for the year 2023 I am indeed bullish and believe we end the year higher. However, on a week to week basis which direction we trade in is up for grabs and I\u2019m simply making an educated guess based on technicals and upcoming economical data.\n\nOur weekly chart is still intact. We have fresh swing lows on the weekly chart which have been built out. More recently in the last month, we took out that 410 pivot high which was our first higher high in the past year.\n\nYou can see we\u2019re still holding above the past year's macro downtrend line as well as holding above the 200 daily moving average.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sktzxdts26ja1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4970a944c38bd037d01189463041f4d3c61aa3\n\nThe main thing I\u2019d like to see here from a macro view is any future swing low set above 380. I do think it\u2019s possible we pull back below this 400 level as well as the 200 daily moving average etc. Any swing low set over 380 however keeps the bull thesis intact and keeps us moving in the right direction.\n\nZooming In\n\nTaking a look at our daily chart. We see that we may possibly be getting some topping action coming into play once again at this 410 level. We\u2019ve had three prior failed breakouts of this 410 level and this current attempt does not look like it\u2019s breaking that trend at the moment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqtol2xt26ja1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=7363bf493e43c8bde5e4ce1a18bde566344dda2e\n\nWe have not yet lost the 20 daily moving average but we were close to it on Friday. The prior three failed breakouts at 410 were confirmed by a close under the 20 daily moving average and will be my signal to be risk off any long swings until we reclaim.\n\nTaking an even closer look we can see that we\u2019re currently in a trading range between 404 and 415ish. The demand created on the up move two weeks ago to break above our prior swing high of 410 started from 404. This level has now been held twice in the last two weeks.\n\nThis coming week the real tell will be if we can continue to hold above this 404 level and make a move through the supply at 410-415. I have a bit of an overall bias to the downside before we see any type of significant move up. As said above I don\u2019t think we see armageddon but a move to undercut these lows down to 390 -395 would be very constructive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3sq943xu26ja1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=621baaa01f8deb6812dffb700837a115eddd0e15\n\nSome key levels for you to keep an eye on this coming week would be 404 current demand as well as any move back into 410-415. Overall we are setting lower highs with several failed attempts to hold over 415. We\u2019ve found good support here at 404 but as time goes on and the inability to hold higher this support level will indeed weaken.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6326i12w26ja1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=1faabd1858ea75c709c1e5c10339cbbc8fdfa1f3\n\nThese are levels as well as the narrative to which I am paying attention too and I am happy to share them.

Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy uses a patient's own immune cells to attack cancer. TIL cells are extracted from a patient's own tumor tissue, expanded through a proprietary process, and infused back into the patient. Upon infusion, TIL reach tumor tissue, where they attack cancer cells. The company has completed dosing in pivotal programs in patients with metastatic melanoma and cervical cancer. In addition, the company's TIL therapy is being investigated in a registration-supporting study for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical studies are also underway to evaluate TIL in earlier stage cancers in combination with currently approved treatments, and to investigate Iovance peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) T cell therapy for blood cancers.\n\nWhat is calling my attention is that BlackRock and other funds came back on the name.

I am by no means an expert, but probably more well-versed in the subject than most.   \nThere are two major obstacles with the Iovance pipeline as far as I can tell. I speak purely from my professional knowledge in the field, as I am new to investing: \n\n1. Using T-cells and cultivating them ex-vivo is expensive and has yet to be generally adopted in any field. Immunotherapy as a whole has seen limited adoption in solid tumor treatment (malignant melanoma and to a certain extent lung cancer being the exception). \n2. They need access to the primary tumor to isolate and cultivate the TILs. This is difficult for sick patients where invasive treatment, in order to give a systemic treatment, is suboptimal. Another issue is that metastatic lesions might have a completely different subset of infiltrating lymphocytes. In which case the treatment would likely not work. \n\nAll in all, I just do not like a platform that requires the isolation of tumor tissue and cultivation ex vivo. It is expensive and it takes too long. Combination therapy in vivo (in the patient) is much simpler and on the whole a better solution. Finally, it seems from their most recently published paper: [https://jitc.bmj.com/content/10/12/e005755](https://jitc.bmj.com/content/10/12/e005755), that they only reached a response rate of 36 %.
