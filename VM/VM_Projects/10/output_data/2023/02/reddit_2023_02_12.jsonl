{"title": "SPY Strangle 3/17/23", "selftext": "This week I purchased a long 418/408 3/17/2023 strangle.  This is a strategy that I have utilized when my read is that the bond and stock markets are predicting significant, differing outcomes.  Below are my thoughts for entering the trade:\n\n\\- Don't fight the Fed - A divergence exists between the bond market indicators believing in a higher terminal rate for fed funds and the stock market that appears to want to push higher.\n\n\\- I believe the bond market is correct and stocks will pull back, however markets do what they want, not what I want or when I want.\n\n\\- Catalyst - This Tuesday's CPI may be the data point to move the bond and stock markets towards alignment, maybe not.  The 408/418 was chosen as these looked to be the short term support and resistance earlier in the week.  Based on Friday's low I did not readjust the strangle, but may do so tomorrow.\n\n\\- Theta risk - The 3/17/23 expiration may be a bit short for the strategy to play out and I will look to extend to the April expiration after Monday depending on conditions.\n\n\\- IV risk - Certainly could be significant if the market rockets and where SPY sits right now relative to my strangle.\n\n\\- Given my current assessment, the strangle plays into my risk tolerance as I am comfortable with it moving between a small loss and gain until the conditions I look for to determine my next move are met.\n\n\\- Cost of the trade was $14.50 per strangle.  B/E at expiration with no management is SPY $393.50  / $432.50 by 3/17/2023.\n\n\\- I entered into the position on 2/7/23 and am currently at a 2.18% unrealized profit.\n\nLooking for feedback / thoughts.  This has been a profitable strategy for me for many years, but there is always room to optimize and improve.

{"title": "Tesla summarized news for the week [Feb 12]", "selftext": " Ross Gerber running for a seat at Tesla BOD. This and tons more news from this week on Tesla covered below. Tesla (TSLA) investors closed off the week with the stock closing **+2.05%** the last 5 days, which means it sits at\u00a0**+82.14%**\u00a0YTD. Here's this weeks news summary [(full article here)](https://news.thecompounder.co/tesla-news-feb-12-2023)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. ALL MODEL Y QUALIFY** It's official - all Model Y models in the US now qualify for the $7,500 EV rebate! As a result, Tesla has increased prices on some variants slightly - the Y Long Range increased by $1,500 and Y Performance went up $1,000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. HERTZ FALLING SHORT** Hertz planned to purchase 100,000 Tesla's by now, but have only done 50,000 purchases. According to Bloomberg, Tesla only accounts for 11% of Hertz's current fleet, and they are well behind their goal (which was to have more than double this by end of 2022!).\n\nThis appears to just be a slower adoption (perhaps due to supply constraints from Tesla or perhaps due to Hertz's financial position), but they are still focused on hitting that goal of 100,000 Tesla's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. COPS LOVE THE MODEL Y** The RCMP in Canada have added the Model Y to their cruiser fleet! The Westshore RCMP department is running a pilot program and this is the first (of hopefully) many Model Y's to join.\n\nMeanwhile on the other side of the border, the Somerset police department released a Facebook post outlining their reasoning for getting a Model Y. The bottom line is that they expect cost savings of $84,000 over the span of 10 years - hard to say no to those kind of savings!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. #2 IN DENMARK AND #1 IN CALIFORNIA** Tesla is slowly taking over Europe - the Model Y is the #2 best selling car in January 2023.\n\nSales in Denmark increased 10.7% YoY, with 481 units. sold. Denmark is one of the more forward countries for EV adoption - with a whopping 21% of all sales being EV in January, and Tesla is capturing a huge part of this opportunity.\n\nOn the other side of the pond, Tesla's Model Y took the #1 spot in California, and the Model 3 took the #2 spot!\u00a0Very strong start to the year for Tesla, worldwide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. EUROPE - GET READY!** Tesla appears to be gearing up for launching their Insurance program in Europe.\u00a0\n\nAccording to a job posting from Tesla, they are looking for positions in the Insurance Europe department, This is a positive sign that their program will expand to the continent soon.\n\nInsurance can be a very lucrative segment for Tesla as they have full insight as to how each driver performs - and they can optimize premiums based on habits (thus reducing their risk and increasing their profits).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. MASTER PLAN 3** Elon tweeted that their upcoming Investor Day (March 1st) will reveal their Master Plan 3.\n\nGiga Texas also is titled in this image posted by Elon, implying that Gigafactory's\u00a0development (and announcements) are all but certain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. SEMI FOR SUPERBOWL** Twitter user munybrr tweeted some pictures of a newly wrapped Tesla Semi that will be featured in the Superbowl this weekend.\n\nThe bright colours and sleek design of the Semi is sure to create some buzz with consumers - which is excellent marketing and awareness for Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8. MEXICO CONFIRMS** Tesla is rumoured to be announcing a Giga Mexico factory soon, and we got confirmation from the President of Mexico that there's one of two locations that could be selected in Mexico - Neuvo Leon or Hidalgo.\n\nThis indirectly confirms plans for a Gigafactory!\n\nNo word on Tesla yet on this, however it's expected to be announced on their upcoming Investor Day in a few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. AUTOPILOT OFF THE HOOK** The NTSB has cleared Tesla's Autopilot of any fault in a fatal crash in Texas in 2021.\n\nThe determination of the crash was due to excessive speed and the driver losing control of the car - nothing to do with Autopilot.\n\nThis is a huge relief for Tesla as this brings it one step closer to getting full approval in the US eventually once FSD is fully released.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. OPEN THE SUPERCHARGERS** Tesla may need to open their Supercharging network to 3rd parties in the US if it wants to be eligible for the $7.5B Department of Transportation subsidy.  \n\nThis plan is aimed at improving EV charging infrastructure across the country and although not finalized, it appears Tesla may have to open the chargers or risk being left out of this essential \"free money\".\n\nTesla has been piloting opening their Supercharging network in other countries (Europe and Australia) so the US is likely coming soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. V4 COMING** Tesla's V4 Hardware got approval to be sold in Europe for Model S/X.\n\nThe V4 is suppose to be 4x better than V3 for FSD however details are still not finalized at this time (but coming soon!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12. ROSS GERBER BOD** Ross Gerber has announced he wants to join Tesla's Board of Directors (BOD).\n\nThis move is in an effort to steer Tesla in the right direction (in his eyes) and have influence over future business decisions Tesla makes. He is well known in the Tesla community and has built up a reputation of going a big Tesla supporter over the years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13. NEW LAWYER** Tesla has hired a new lawyer to join the team as they continue to work to strengthen their Legal department. Brandon Ehrhart (from Dish Network) is the newest member of the team.\n\nTesla has been facing constant legal issues around the world with regulations, approvals, etc., and Musk likely foresees this to only get worse over the years, so the focus is to make sure the right people are in place to help Tesla move forward with their mission and win legal battles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**14. GIGA BERLIN HALTED** Tesla has been ordered to halt production on Solar Panels at Giga Berlin.\u00a0\n\nThe government of Germany claims that Tesla did not have approval to put down concrete stakes to get these panels installed. This is yet another bump in the road but Tesla will now work to get an approval here to move forward with their efforts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**15. ANALYST CHANGES** 2 Analyst changes this week - Wedbush with $225PT and RBC Capital with $223PT - both with an Outperform rating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it for this weeks TSLA news!\n\nWould love your feedback on what other information I can include in these weekly summaries.
