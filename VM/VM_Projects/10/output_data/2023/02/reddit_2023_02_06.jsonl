{"title": "Few thoughts on how to position yourself if this turns out to be another bear rally", "selftext": "So right now you have a lot of smart money talking about getting into bonds or getting into precious metals. \n\nRecently you've seen that move play out, but here's the obvious risk. If indeed the fed plans to take us to that 5-5.25% area, then you will see bonds sell off again as well as precious metals.\n\nNow some folks speculate that if inflation gets hot, they may hike even higher and I would argue to say that it may not be as likely that they hike higher, but rather they hold longer.\n\nEventually we will see those rate cuts and that is the move you want to focus on. Bonds here are not necessarily bad if you get the shorter dated notes and intend to hold to maturity. Bond etfs like TLT however, i would argue are not as great rightnow. They've had quite a run since October and I would prefer something like that cool off before getting in. \n\nSilver I think will perform amazingly when the rate cuts do happen. Keep in mind that if you try to get into equities when rate cuts happen you have to worry about earnings deterioration. You don't have to worry about that with silver. You would just hope that the dollar plummets and demand for silver goes up. \n\nNow high dividend solid cash flow plays are great as well. If there is some sort of rug pull on market expectations with when rate cuts happen or how high rates go, I think you position yourself in dividend play that at least gives around 4%ish yield. Obviously higher is better, but don't sacrifice higher yield for lower quality. When rates get cut rapidly, investors will be looking for places to park cash while earning passive income in relatively insolated companies. Rate cuts won't always equate to stocks going up because you can see serious deterioration in revenues and earnings and valuations come into question and then you get doomers and gloomers talking about bear markets for next decade.

{"title": "Bear Market Buy Why Boeing Stock Looks Attractive", "selftext": "Despite continuing to face supply chain challenges in 2023, Boeing's stock looks like a good value merely on executing on its plans.\n\nAnother quarter and another quietly positive earnings report have come from the aerospace giant. Boeing (BA -1.59%) certainly has challenges to work through this year. Still, under CEO Dave Calhoun, Boeing is quietly regaining the trust of investors, and merely executing its medium-term plans could lead to substantive share price appreciation. Here's how Boeing is becoming investable again. \n\nBoeing's game plan\n\nManagement lauded its return to free cash flow (FCF) generation in 2022, with $2.3 billion generated, compared to an outflow of $4 billion in 2021 and a whopping $20 billion outflow in 2020.It's a good result in the context of the company's plan to generate $10 billion in FCF at some point between 2025 & 2026.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9cgsfk9asjga1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0811f275b7b4fdd8ccc86e8c4605eb79f5d6af4\n\nThe company's CFO, Brian West, put it succinctly on the recent earnings call, saying that \"the overall plan continues to be, deliver airplanes, generate cash, pay down debt.\" It's not hard to see why. Due to the combination of the well-documented grounding of the 737 MAX, followed by the imposition of travel restrictions globally, Boeing's earnings and cash flow slumped while its debt ballooned. \n\nAs such, its long-term debt now stands at $57 billion, with $17.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Paying down debt is not only essential to improving Boeing's balance sheet, but the company also needs cash and liquidity to fund new airplane development programs. The subject matter came up at the investor day conference in November. Calhoun's comments at the event implied there wouldn't be a new airplane (possibly a mid-market plane) until the middle of the next decade; it takes years and billions of dollars to develop a new airplane. That's particularly the case if Boeing follows Calhoun's aim of ultimately introducing a place that differentiates itself from the airplanes preceding it.\n\nThe bottom line is that Boeing needs to generate cash flow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjay57kbsjga1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9553dfd286c4daeb2ac67f4986d15012cf1e254\n\nBoeing makes progress\n\nTo generate cash flow, Boeing needs earnings, and to generate earnings, Boeing needs revenue from airplane deliveries. It's not just about revenue; production ramps are also a significant part of how Boeing expands its profit margin. Boeing also needs to avoid more multibillion cost overruns on its defense projects, notably the high-profile fixed-price projects like Air Force One, the T-7 (pilot training plane), and the KC-46 (air refueling tanker) that have caused problems. \n\nFrankly, any quarter with no bad news from Boeing Defense, Space & Security is good news as it marches toward de-risking these programs by 2025.\n\nAs for Boeing Commercial Airplanes and deliveries, the news is mixed. Its fourth-quarter deliveries were better than expected, but Calhoun served to temper any enthusiasm that Boeing could improve on its current schedule. In a nutshell, he said supply chain issues were still a major issue, but Boeing was sticking with its guidance for 400 to 450 deliveries of Boeing 737 aircraft in 2023. \n\nCalhoun noted, \"we continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines\" and \"while they are coming down, \\[stoppages\\] are not where they need to be as we think about stable rates going forward.\" In other words, Boeing is still suffering from supply chain issues that limit its production line to work optimally.  As such, investors can expect Boeing's delivery data to be choppy from month to month -- you have been told.\n\nWhat Boeing's suppliers are saying\n\nIn his opening remarks on the earnings call, Calhoun said he wouldn't \"highlight any one supplier within the supply chain.\" Still, it's hard to avoid any tangential discussion of General Electric (GE -2.36%) when its aerospace business has a joint venture, CFM International, that's the sole engine manufacturer for the Boeing 737 MAX. Calhoun, a man who spent more than two decades at GE, including a stint heading up GE aircraft engines,  says he's \"really happy\" with the \"transparency with which we are planning for rates with our engine suppliers, and you know who they are and predominantly one.\"\n\nIt's also worth noting that GE expects LEAP engines (supplied on the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 neo) deliveries to ramp by 50% in 2023 and told investors to get ready for margin compression in 2023 due to the negative margin mix from producing them. Similarly, another major aerospace supplier, Raytheon Technologies' (RTX -0.49%) CEO Greg Hayes, recently told investors, \"But we don't see anything in our supply chain today that would prevent us from delivering either at Boeing or Airbus to the rates that they need.\" However, he also took a cautious stance on the supply chain issues that have troubled the sector.\n\nWhat it means for Boeing investors\n\nHaving seen supply chain issues extend far longer than many expected in 2022, it's understandable that aerospace CEOs are being temperate on guidance in 2023. That's fair enough, and it makes sense to take what they say at face value. Still, even on merely hitting its cash flow targets, Boeing looks a good value, and the lack of any new news at defense is a plus. As such, Boeing's stock remains attractive.\n\nThank you for your support, follow us for more stock analysis which will be provided soon.

{"title": "Stock Market Today (as of Feb 6, 2023)", "selftext": "On Feb 3, the three major indices closed lower. At the close, the Dow was down 0.38%, the Nasdaq was down 1.59%, and the S&P 500 was down 1.04%. The 10-year US Treasury yield rose 3.681% to 3.521%, compared with a yield spread of -77 bps over the two-year note. VIX was down 2.14%. Brent crude closed down 3%. Spot gold closed down 2.46% at $1,855.7 an ounce. The dollar index was up 1.22%, closing at 103.\n\n.\n\nU.S. non-farm payrolls rose 517,000 in January, the largest increase since July 2022. The U.S. unemployment rate hit a 53-year low of 3.4% in January. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, January's job gains were broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and health care. Government employment also rose partly, reflecting the return of striking workers.\n\n.\n\nThe probability of a quarter-point hike in March rose to 94.5% after the nonfarm release, from 82.7% before the data, according to CME FedWatch. Fed swaps reduced bets on a Fed rate cut in 2023, with the Fed's policy rate expected to peak at 5% in June.

It is reported that preliminary data from the China Passenger Federation showed that Tesla sold 66,051 domestic cars in January, a month-on-month growth of 18.38%. It is worth noting that Tesla announced big price cuts on 5 models in China on January 6 this year.\n\n[C3.ai (AI)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-AI/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i32ld8inikga1.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=288cc8d8f4a2fe5b0558619f7472d7af088db0aa\n\nShares of C3.ai were surging 18.07% as the company got another analyst upgrade, and investors continued to bid AI stocks higher. On Thursday night, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria raised his rating on the AI-focused software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock to \"buy,\" saying C3.ai is \"a truly scarce asset in a critical software arena,\" and that the generative AI could be a \"killer app\" for artificial intelligence. He gave the stock a price target of $30, implying a 37% upside from its closing price last night.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nMarket rises after the Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25%, as was widely expected on Wednesday.\n\n.\n\nUnder these circumstances, investors should be looking for stocks with the growth and reasonable valuations.

It is a statistical impossibility that 375 out of 500 sample population intended to purchase a Tesla, and less than 15% of the general population actually did. You can count the atoms in the solar system before this happens by chance.\n\nIt seems they either did not conduct a rigorous unbiased survey, or that  there were important qualifiers they failed to mention. Like they surveyed those who are only looking to spend 230k-300k CNY. Or the sample population had shown interest in Tesla before and hasn't pulled the trigger. Or the survey was worded to lead the answers toward Yes. Or the survey was in English and in a West-centric blog. It would take multiple qualifiers to move the needle close enough to 75% to be statistically possible.\n\nTesla demand might be picking up. We don't have enough data yet.
