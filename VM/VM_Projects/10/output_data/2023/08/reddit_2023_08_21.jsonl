So a $4 strike for 100 shares would cost $400 pre-split. If the 100 shares becomes 10 shares, that means the per-share price has to go up to $40, so that once against the cost to exercise is $400 post-split.\n\nYou should be fine, barring APE reversion shenanigans that, again, are too complicated for me to figure out.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Alright thank you so much!

However, I'm a bit apprehensive that these leg orders might not get filled when I try to buy or close the spread, potentially leading to significant issues.In the past, I used to trade SPY spreads and ran into a bad margin call last month due to early assignments.

The margin call was triggered by SPY early exercises which pushed my balance into the negative by over 120K+( although I resolved it in the correct way). It was quite unsettling for me. Hence, I am currently taking a very conservative approach.   I normally use OptionStrat to mock the XSP/SPX options before placing an official order in Etrade. In OptionStrat( i paid it monthly), I consistently receive low-volume warnings against one or two legs created by butterfly or iron condor, which is why I'm seeking clarification on these questions.\n\nBtw, I also found All or none check box does not support spx/xsp symbols when placing an order. the answer from Etrade support is due to low liquidity for both as well.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "u/MidwayTrades, Based on your message, could you please confirm whether you've never experienced a margin call while trading SPX? thank you", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5576326847076416}, {"body": "If what triggered your margin call was an early exercise, you won\u2019t have that with SPX because that can\u2018t happen.  It\u2019s a raw index, not an ETF like SPY so there are no shares, everything is cash settled.  That is why it\u2019s European style vs American style, which means that there is no early exercise.  \n\nAs far as a low margin warning, that sounds like something your broker may have to alert you.  I use TOS and have never seen that but I also don\u2019t allocate nearly all of my account at one time as a matter of account safety.  I also don\u2019t sell naked so since everything is covered I know the maximum possible loss even if I let everything go to expiration as that risk is defined.  A classic butterfly or iron condor should have the same characteristics.  \n\nAs far as liquidity, like I said, I can\u2019t recall having issues.  Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m filled at any price I want, but it does mean I tend to get filled within .10-.15 of the mid.  Keep in mind that there is no true exact mid, I rather think of it as a range as it\u2019s a live market.   But I don\u2019t recall being unable to get out at all.  The market would have to be really moving for that to be an issue.  And then it\u2019s probably not liquidity, per se, but rather it\u2019s tough to establish a price if things are moving like crazy.  That\u2019s just how markets work and you have to be prepared for that and there are ways to do that of needed.  e.g. Usually, this happens on a crazy down move.  Worst case there I grab a put with the deltas I need and just hang on.  In a crash, puts tend to be easier to get than anything else.  Thankfully, I haven\u2019t had to do that in quite a while.  \n\nTrading that close to expiration certainly has its own risks and it\u2019s not my cup of tea to be sure, but as long as you aren\u2019t far away from the money I would expect you to get filled, maybe not at the price you think you should get on a spread, especially a 4-legged spread.  But there\u2019s a price out there that the market maker bots will take.\n\nTo your other question, I have never had a margin call with SPX.

With that in mind, I believe the safest approach is to avoid placing orders with any low-volume legs. I prefer to adjust leg prices until there are no warning signals.

That, at least on my platform means if I have an order in for 3 spreads, it will only fill if it can do 3 spreads.  Without that it\u2019s possible to get partial fills but only in units of spreads (say 1 or 2 spreads, but always with all components of the spread).  I do get partial fills sometimes but it\u2019s rarely an issue.  Most of the time the rest fill very quickly.  A few times a year they don\u2019t but I still always have covered positions on.

Unless you are deep in the financial industry, like a lead PM at a hedge fund, you are not going to have full visibility as to *why exactly puts vs. calls are being traded on XYZ*. The \"why\" is the part that is inferred. How many puts vs. calls are bought or sold is public information, but *why* the puts vs. calls were traded is another matter. If order flow says the big uptick in put volume indicates bearish sentiment, that's an *guess* that the net effect of those puts are *long put trades*.

Many instructional sources have plenty to say about trade mgmt and take profit targets for verticals, but I don\u2019t see much guidance available for calendars. I should mention that I\u2019m a writer of contracts, always collecting credits not debits. Well, that is, until I started in with calendars.\n\nWhat is a typical take profit target for the type of calendars I\u2019m doing (sell front, buy back)?

What is a good loss threshold per trade (risk/reward ratio)? Do these targets change for double calendars?\n\nThere may be a reason why it's harder to find how-to explainers about calendars. There might not be a handy rule-of-thumb type of play that makes for an easy explainer, because of the way a calendar works. If you think of different option trading structures as tools in a toolbox, verticals might be like screwdrivers and straddles might be like wrenches, lots of different variations and uses for each. But a calendar may be more like a miter box. It has one very specialized application.\n\nThough all option trades are volatility plays, calendars are *mostly* volatility plays. So the how-to has to be discussed in the context of some kind of volatility forecast. If your observed vol is X and your forecast is Y and X > Y within this range of time, use so-and-so type of calendar to exploit this opportunity, or something like that.\n\nHere's a case study of exactly that kind of use of a calendar.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/138t2jg/kre_is_it_crashing_yet_calendar_trade_analysis/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Real money trading.\n\nIm calendar trading to take advantage of rising volatility 14-45 days prior to earnings.

But let's use your premise as a hypothetical. What would it take for options to move the needle on underlying price? All of these things have to align for share price to be pushed up by option activity (you can do a similar exercise for pushed down):\n\n* Expiring contracts only. That's a fraction of the total option trading volume in a day, but expiration is important because shares have to be delivered for exercised contracts, so that would force demand on shares to increase.\n\n* An imbalance in deliveries vs. receivables. The put/call volume has to be skewed towards long calls (for example), because exercising a call creates demand on shares. If puts and calls were in balance, just as many shares would be received as would be delivered, so the net impact to demand would be zero.\n\n* A cornering of the market on shares. Some kind of limit of the supply of shares has to be created so that the increased demand drives up price. If supply was more than sufficient to cover increased demand, price need not be pushed up.\n\n* Alternatively to a supply shortage, the volume of exercised shares has to be more than 1000x above normal. This would make the option exercise volume be larger than the total available shares (a situation which is prohibited by the SEC, but we'll pretend it can happen).\n\nEach of those items is increasingly unlikely, if not laughably farfetched, to happen in real life. That is not to say that they never happened, but they are so rare that each instance makes the history books.\n\nFor more reading on this hypothetical situation and historical instances, read:\n\nhttps://www.schwab.com/learn/story/whats-short-squeeze-and-why-does-it-happen\n\nhttps://www.tradingsim.com/blog/gamma-squeezes-explained\n\nhttps://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/a-brief-history-of-short-squeezes-before-gamestop-11611916187973.html", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks - really appreciate the info.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.028438597917556763}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8208269476890564}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41214674711227417}, {"body": "How can one find stocks with Volatility skews?
