I had an open IBKR account, where I tried to conduct my experiments with options, in a quiet environment, and without unnecessary observers. The minimum amount of 25K was enough for me for these tasks, and I did not want to pump my personal account with large sums of money for investments. I reasoned that if something does not work on one lot, it is unlikely that it will work on 1000 lots. In general, I did not want to deposit more funds into the account than the amount I had initially allocated.As it became apparent to me that if you plan to steadily increase a small account, the main problem is the dispersion of the result. My initial strategy at that time was based on trading on my forecasts for short and medium term trends in stocks. And accordingly the dispersion reduction had to be done through diversification or, in other words, I had to simultaneously bet on a lot of securities in different directions and at the same time equalize the amount relative to the most expensive purchase. To put it mildly, the account amount of 25 000 dollars is not enough for such a game.\n\nSo I figured that with my small account it would be better for me to control the dispersion through a large number of consecutive attempts for a small amount of entry.It is quite natural that I came to the necessity to try to trade options on QQQ, because in this instrument the expiry occurs every working day, and at the same time each of my entries is easily equalized by the amount of the bet.\n\nIn the long run I could get the opportunity to make 200+ trades per year. That suited and inspired me.\n\nSo I started researching.\n\n**The trading algorithm.**To begin with, I made a simple trading algorithm, which could be tested on past data and which could be easily reproduced in real trades.\n\nIts essence is as follows.\n\nAt the close of the current trading day T0 in QQQ, I decide to buy a CALL or PUT option with expiration on the next day T1 or 1DTE ATM.\n\nIn the tests I take the calculated strike which is equal to the closing price of T0 (it is not difficult to transfer it to trades using the real closest to the calculated strike ATM).\n\nThe next day I have to place an order, which is in the system for the whole trading day T1.\n\nI control the fact of order execution by internal cost.\n\nWith this approach I have only 3 options to close my open trade.\n\n\\-The order is executed at the price I set and I make a profit.\n\n\\- My order is not executed and the value of the option at the end of the trading day becomes equal to 0 and I get a loss = option premium paid by me.\n\n\\-The order is not executed but the value of the option at the close of trading is different from zero and I get some money back. At the same time, I do not know whether I close the trade in plus or minus, because it will depend on the point at which tomorrow's market closes on day T1.I checked the reproducibility of the test algorithm in real trades while I had such an opportunity.\n\nAnd thus I need to find the answer to two questions\n\n1-Call or PUT\n\n2- At what price to place a Take-profit order.\n\n**Direction Indicator.**For tests, I made an indicator, the direction of which I was going to predict. Of course, I could try to guess the direction of the closing price on the day T1, but I wanted to leave myself some room to optimize the Take-profit order in advance.\n\nI called this indicator Vol+-, which is equal to the largest absolute value of the extremum of the current trading day, from the closing price of the previous day, expressed as a percentage and taken with its own + or - sign. According to the value of this indicator I can determine the maximum possible profit for 1 day on the purchased option.\n\nhere's the formula.Vol + - \\_t1 = IF abs (High\\_t1 - Close\\_t0)> abs(Low\\_t1- Close\\_t0) then (High\\_t1 - Close\\_t0)/ Close\\_t0\\*100 else (Low\\_t1- Close\\_t0)/Close\\_to\\* 100.\n\n**Calculating 1DTE ATM option price**\n\nAlso for the tests I need to know the price of the QQQ option 1DTE ATM for the calculated strike.\n\nHere I made a rough assumption.\n\nif the price as a percentage of the value of the underlying asset for the central Call SPY 1DTE ATM = Vix\\*vega\n\nThen for QQQ I have experimentally found that Call QQQ 1DTE ATM = 1.5 \\* Vix \\* vega or 1.5 \\*0.0209 \\* Vix and this as a percentage of the underlying asset price.\n\n*Again. I realize that the statement that Central IV QQQ = 1.5\\*Vix is a very rough assumption, but it is not a fatal error affecting the results of my research.*\n\n**A period of collecting statistics and waiting for revenue.**\n\nI took the time period from January 2, 2020 to February 2, 2023 to research and gather statistics. There are a total of 778 trading days.\n\nThe VIX range for this period was from 12.2 to 82.7.\n\nI immediately looked at what would happen in the case of 100% guessing the direction of my indicator.\n\nThe result, is given as a fraction of the option value. The graph of profit with the cumulative total of 778 points for me turned out as follows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2beo0gyy7qfb1.jpg?width=879&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bfb856330b7dd60e0bfb45583cc35789f57f270\n\nThe Vol +- result is the absolute maximum, the Close result implies that there is no Take-profit order in the trades, and all I get is the result at the closing price on the day T1.\n\nFrom these positions I was satisfied with everything. Even at the Close price the result was quite acceptable, and there was still a good window for Take-profit optimization.\n\nSo I started searching for a way to predict the priority direction of tomorrow.\n\n**Direction Prediction.**\n\nThere is a stable opinion that daily deviations on the market are distributed randomly.\n\nDuring the test period of 778 trading days the number of closures greater than 0 amounted to 430 or 55.3%.  348 days or 47.7% closed in the red zone.\n\nI have decided right away that I will look for a solution only in the market statistics. It is unlikely that trend analysis, technical or fundamental analysis will help me in predicting 1 day ahead.\n\nIn order to narrow down the infinite range of market data, I first thought about what tomorrow's priority direction is. And I really liked the analogy that I would have to predict the MOOD of tomorrow's market at the close of today's trading day.\n\nAnd somehow right away I decided on my search categories.\n\n1- Seasonality. Mood obviously depends on the day of the week, and the mood on Wednesday will of course be significantly different from the mood on Friday. I collected statistics depending on the day of the week (at some point in my research, I also used the quarter number as seasonality).\n\n2- Past. Well just like seasonality obviously mood is influenced by the not-too-distant past. Which means I need to consider the statistics of the previous few days of trading for the underlying asset.\n\n3-External news background or external information at the close of the current day. Here I am a supporter of the postulate of technical analysis that all news background is embedded in prices. This means that I need to include in the analysis several instruments traded on the market (it is not clear yet which ones) that provide information about the market background.\n\n4-Information that comes to the market from the closing of the current day to the opening of the next day. It is a random value and it is absolutely impossible to predict it.\n\nThus, I have formed an image of the desired search result.\n\nIf we take into account that the first three points 100% determine the market mood, and the 4th point is overlaid with an additional layer has 50% probability to confirm or deny the forecast, and closes no more than 50% of all trading days. For me, it means that a well-tuned system should give at least 75% of hits, otherwise I will always doubt it.\n\n**Predicting a \"Random\" Value.**\n\nSince I was only interested in direction, I converted the entire parameter array at closing time T0 and the predicted output parameter Vol+ -\\_T1 into the format +1 and -1, where\n\n\\+1 upward movement\n\n\\-1 downward movement.\n\nI took the day of the week as a sequence from 1 to 5 (Monday through Friday),\n\nQuarter, respectively, from 1 to 4.\n\nCollecting statistics for the 778 points was also easy, I simply counted the number of +1 and -1 for the output parameter for different combinations of input parameters.\n\nInitially I worked with a 778\\*34 massif, and tried to set the influence of each input parameter separately.\n\nAnd of course I got nothing. That is, as described above, I was unable to find any statistically significant patterns. In this data representation everything really looks like a random sequence.\n\nIt probably doesn't matter now how exactly I came to this decision and how long it took.\n\nBut it was physics and playing roulette in a casino that put me on the right track).\n\nPhysics helped me in that I realized that sometimes non-random quantities can masquerade as random quantities.\n\nA prime example is the establishment of the wave nature of the electron (Thompson's 1927 experiment). Diffraction of an electron beam on a suitable lattice.\n\nAfter all, if you shoot bullets from a machine gun onto a lattice with one slit and shoot a beam of electrons, the distribution behind the slit will be Gaussian and the same for both experiments.\n\nBut if we add a second slit, then only the machine gun will keep the Gaussian distribution behind the lattice, and the electron will show its wave nature.\n\nAll that remains is to attach the second slit to the +1 and -1 directions for QQQ.)))\n\nThis is where the casino came to my rescue, namely a roulette game with Red and Black bets.\n\nTechnically, coming to the casino, you can make such a bet not in two ways - red or black, but in four ways Red, Black, Same as last time, Opposite of what happened last time. In the case of the casino, our probability is not changed by such manipulations. The question is, what changes for QQQ?\n\nI've moved on from the data presentation format\n\n\\+1 up\n\n\\-1 down\n\nto a format\n\n\\+1 up after down\n\n\\+2 up after up\n\n\\-2 down after up\n\n\\-1 down after down\n\nSince when processing statistics I count the number of outcomes, the indexing can be any, including letter indexes, I did it the way it was convenient for me.\n\nThe result exceeded all my expectations. If earlier in the period of statistics processing of 778 trading days absolutely nothing worked for me, now absolutely everything worked for me))). For the sake of experiment I even checked the influence of solar activity and also got some regularities in the period of statistics collection.\n\nAt that moment I tried to determine the influence of each parameter separately on the QQQ direction and used double seasonality - day of the week and number of the quarter.\n\nI checked the collected statistics on a test period starting from the trading date of February 3, 2023.\n\nAnd then I made two conclusions. (identified two problems)\n\n1-I get a lot of false patterns (the incoming parameter, which in the period of statistics collection gives me the required 75% probability, in the test period turns into 50/50).\n\n2- even those patterns that I can identify as true do not give me a continuous forecasting process. That is, I get a very discrete set of predictions, and I cannot make a prediction for every day.\n\nHow I solved these problems is quite difficult to put into words.\n\nFirst, I will share my preliminary thoughts, and then I will tell you exactly what I did.\n\nSo, when deciding to enter a trade, we all look at a monitor that shows us the same numbers and values, but each of us only sees a unique combination of those numbers. The answer to the question of where the market will go depends on the superposition of all the views of the participants. Accordingly, in order to make a forecast, I must understand how this superposition is distributed, and making my own prediction is unnecessary and even harmful. That is, I must make a forecast without making a prediction.\n\nIn a competition between farmers to determine the weight of a steer at a glance, the same person invariably won. And the winner was not the most experienced farmer, but the secretary of the competition, who simply bookmarked the predictions of all the participants and calculated the average value. It is possible that this person could not distinguish a bull from a cow, but his forecast was always the most accurate, and he invariably won the contest.\n\n*The way I see it, this is what Nassim Nicholas Taleb is talking about in his lengthy arguments about just buying options, and if you find a reason to buy an option, the result is instantly spoiled.*\n\n**A Machine Learning algorithm based on statistical data, with two-stage validation and feature engineering.**Well yes that is exactly the correct name for what I ended up doing.\n\nI put together a data set of 13 incoming parameters that are categorized:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uq2s7f28qfb1.jpg?width=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6359e0beaaf3021d1c7998ad7f43150706d1ef\n\nall data are in the format +1\\_+2\\_-2\\_-1\n\nTotal of 13 input parameters, from which I have collected a matrix of combinations by the degree of parameter use. Accordingly, in the beginning I took a combination when none of the parameters is used and ended with a combination when I use all the parameters. *In other words, I am not trying to establish exactly how UST5 affects the direction of QQQ, but I am investigating the effect of all combinations that contain UST5, and of course the effect of those combinations that do not contain UST5.*\n\nIt is not difficult to calculate that I got 8192 unique combinations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y6hrkwk8qfb1.jpg?width=766&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16096436b60af748c458bb30c56b1fec23de82c6\n\nin the table the sign 0 - if the parameter is used, 1 - if the parameter is not used\n\nThen everything is simple, (especially if you invented it yourself).\n\nFor the first time validation period for each trading day, all 8192 combinations are run, each of which separately forms a signal based on the period of collecting statistics on 778 trading days (learning period), in the learning period for each unique combination forms a final signal based on 75% probability. This run took me 6.5 hours of machine time.\n\nAnd every time I thank myself that I did not decide to analyze the influence of S&P 500 components and limited myself to only 13 input parameters, because each new added input parameter increases all previously spent calculation time on the first validation period exactly in 2 times)). Keep this in mind when conducting your own tests on your home laptop.\n\nHaving obtained statistics for each of the 8192 combinations at the first validation period, I performed some clever manipulations (I left those combinations that gave a result for the first validation period greater than 75% and threw out those that gave exactly 100%). Here I had to eliminate false patterns. These logical manipulations in a language I don't speak are properly called feature engineering. In the end, I was left with 358 combinations, which I checked simultaneously on the first and second validation period. The final signal was formed as a superposition of signals for each trading day from the 358 combinations I found, which individually form a signal according to the same 778 points of statistics collection with the same criterion of 75%. As a result of all the actions performed, the probabilities of hitting on two validation periods coincided.\n\nAnd voila I have a predictive system that gives a hit probability of predicting the direction of tomorrow no worse than 75%.\n\nWell, now it is clear where AI creators for the stock market should dig and what kind of shovel they should choose.\n\nWithout thinking much about optimization I made a trading pencil test where the starting account was 10,000, limit per trade $1000. And the account profile for 120 trading days looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u29w9vg8qfb1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c691d8fbe75a54d9ea20e61eb27800231a6ed52\n\nand this despite the fact that in these calculations I closed my open deals at the worst variant - at the closing price of the next day.\n\nI have always been of the opinion that if you start to invent something, you should immediately try to make money in real trading. It is possible to learn all the secrets of the universe in parallel with the fascinating process of making profit.\n\nIf I had not been disconnected from options trading at the time of my discovery, I would have indulged in pleasant thoughts about the advantages and disadvantages of buying a vertical spread before buying a simple ATM option, followed by a Take-profit order. And then I would briefly ponder, at what point I realize that my system has failed and it's time for me to return some of the money spent on the option premium through a Stop-Loss order.In any case, I liked this chart very much.\n\nIt's no problem for me to write a technical task, order a trading robot, so that sitting in the evenings in a beach bar, once a month to check the status of your option account in a mobile phone application, realizing that you have organized a decent pension and passive income for only $10,000 at the risk of losing only $1,000 a day. And i do all this while the rest of us continue to watch the trades in real time.\n\nI probably wouldn't even be writing these posts.\n\nBut life has taken a different course. Bidding on my own account was closed to me. So I took the first step.\n\nI ran my model through Kelly Criterion.\n\nI can't even imagine what kind of games John Larry Kelly Jr. played. So that the mathematical expectation is positive, and the probability is known, and the exact payoff in case of success is known.\n\nBut I got one thing right.\n\nKelly criterion allows you to determine how well your game strategy is assembled. To do this, you need to assume that you bet a percentage of your own account every time.\n\nIf everything is OK, your income profile starts to resemble a geometric progression function (many people call it an exponent).\n\nI didn't get trifled with and in the test calculations I left the starting amount of $10,000, removed the limit on one bet, and set the bet level as a percentage of the account at 25% of the account.\n\nResult:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtpuw3s48qfb1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d63a911b2bdf85e89649d2e9ee1d6a41804c859\n\nWell, this chart does not look like an \"exponential\". This means that it is time for me to comprehend the mysteries of the universe and finally solve the riddle of the time traveler's trading strategy from 1997.\n\nTo be continued...  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15obczq/a\\_time\\_travelers\\_strategy\\_final\\_reinvestment\\_of/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15obczq/a_time_travelers_strategy_final_reinvestment_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "id": "15gew6o", "created_utc": 1690996895.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "tl;dr\n\na.

This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2023-08-04.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.\n\n- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have \"weeklies\", the underlying is \"too cheap\", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.", "id": "15gcexn", "created_utc": 1690991262.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 10, "comments": [{"body": "You sure?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re not?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well you never post any positions", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you want to follow a furu\u2019s trades or do you want DD?
