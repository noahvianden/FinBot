{"title": "My New Perspective on NVDA", "selftext": "I was wrong about NVDA. \n\nLast year, I decided to go with AMD as my top position during the bear market. In hindsight this was a soft mistake, not only because NVDA stock has outperformed AMD stock, but also because my fundamental analysis was wrong.\n\nThe reason I opted for AMD instead of NVDA was my fear of NVDA\u2019s dependence on crypto revenue and secular slowing data center sales. My reasoning was that AMD still had the embedded segment to drive growth, whereas Nvidia would experience long-term contraction in gaming and data center sales. Well, turns out Nvidia does not need crypto and A.I. has arrived much sooner to boost data center than I had expected, and Nvidia likely has growth for at least the rest of this decade.\n\nAMD is still a great company, but Nvidia has a wider runway for a few reasons. AMD is a hardware focused semiconductor company, whereas Nvidia is a full stack computing company. \n\nI know it seems like selling A.I. GPUs is the only thing they have going for them now, but I\u2019ve thought about it deeper, and I believe selling A.I. data center GPUs is just the tip of the iceberg, being this business cycle\u2019s focus for them. Next business cycle after selling their enterprise customers GPUs, they will be selling them Omniverse software and self-driving software to automakers. The margins on their software solution sales could be even higher than their GPU sales due to the nature of lower cost of goods sold on software products.\n\nWe all know now that Nvidia is a great company and can make money, but the biggest argument I hear is always about the valuation. At current prices, I will admit it is not cheap, but also probably not as expensive as people make it out to be. Assuming on the low end a $7 EPS for this year, NVDA is sitting at around a 60 P/E right now. Assuming on the high end a $9 EPS, NVDA is sitting at around a 50 P/E right now. Definitely not cheap, but not an unwarranted valuation due to the long growth runway I already laid out. My expectation for the short-term is to be mentally prepared for sideways consolidation, but long-term Nvidia is likely to exceed all our expectations. \n\nIn summary, Nvidia is moving away from a hardware focus, and it is no longer appropriate to view Nvidia just as a semiconductor company. Nvidia is a full stack computing company, meaning it is just as much software focused as hardware focused. People looking at the valuation saying NVDA is overvalued are assuming it is a semiconductor company, but it is not just that anymore. It is entirely different than any other semiconductor company.\n\nThanks for taking the time to hear me out.
