Investing has more to do with psychology than almost anything else. \n\nWhen everyone was screaming sell during covid, I emptied my savings buying, and then borrowed from my credit card. I don't necessarily recommend this approach, but the point I'm making is buy during fearful moments in the market. My thoughts were if we didn't bounce back from covid, we'd likely have bigger problems. \n\nMany people give Cramer allot of flak, but that's only because they hang on every word.
