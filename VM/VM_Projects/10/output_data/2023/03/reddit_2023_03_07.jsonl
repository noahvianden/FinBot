Knowledgeable and experienced advisors need to spend time and gather a lot of information about your circumstances before making recommendations, and that\u2019s something you just can\u2019t get online\u2026\n\nTo that end, I agree with the comment on reading. Investing can sometimes be complex but can also be simple, there are a lot of different ways to approach it from building a quantitative global macro fund to just picking an index ETF and forgetting about it. The real differentiator is psychology, and learning from great investors, from interviews, lectures, and books gives a truly special type of knowledge.\n\nA couple things to be aware of: portfolio construction, security picking, and active asset allocation are all different skill and knowledge sets that are worth knowing about. When you have an idea of what you\u2019re trying to do for yourself, it\u2019s useful to learn about what goes into \npicking the investments, what balance to buy them in, and when to buy them as all important elements. Learning from books written by investors as well as general educational materials is an incredible idea, and there\u2019s a lot out there.\n\nA few books by investors I like are \u201cOne Up on Wall Street,\u201d by Peter Lynch,  \u201cMargin of Safety,\u201d by Seth Klarman (as someone else mentioned in the comments, there\u2019s a reason why people get the pdf of that one,) \u201cStocks for the Long Run,\u201d by Jeremy Siegel, \u201cYou can be a Stock Market Genius,\u201d by Joel Greenblatt, and \u201cAlchemy of Finance,\u201d by George Soros are all ones I love and cover different aspects of investing from some of the most knowledgeable people in the world.\n\nFor educational material, depending on how far you want to go, you could start anywhere from reading Investopedia articles to watching or reading CFA material. There\u2019s a huge range for whatever level you\u2019d like to get into. I can add some in the reply as well if there\u2019s anything in particular you\u2019d like to learn about.\n\nA few other things: there are many different approaches that an investor can take. Some major ones are using all funds/ ETFs and aiming to get good performance by the balance of them and choosing the best funds. This can be done passively or actively. When picking individual stocks, there the philosophy gets even more broad. There are top- down approaches where securities are picked based on analyzing macroeconomic trends first (which more often applies to fund picking,) then bottom up where you dig into each company to see what you like. This sounds the most like what you were describing. To that end I would add that learning the premise behind analysis of multiples, financial models is useful (discounted cash flows or return in equity models,) reading financial statements, as well as learning from good stock picking investors about the less quantitative side, what it is in a company\u2019s story, mission, people, product, and/or environment that makes it special. Philosophies vary widely. Some people follow trends, some try to study market psychology, some look at the raw business fundamentals and look for what\u2019s undervalued, and some people just draw shapes and lines on graphs, so, learning the philosophies behind different strategies is also very useful.\n\nLastly, and I will first say that I personally run the core of my investments as bottom- up value investing with some alts and global macro around the edges, so, I probably have listened/ read more people in that area, but I try to diversify the ideas I learn about as much as possible\u2026 These are some investors I think are very worth learning about.\n\nWarren Buffet (value investing)\nSeth Klarman (value investing)\nGeorge Soros (global macro)\nPeter Lynch (value-ish bottom- up)\nHoward Marks (fixed income/ global)\nJim Simons (quant, math genius)\nStanley Druckenmiller (global macro)\nJesse Livermore (1910\u2019s day trading)\nJoel Greenblatt (value investing)\nGerry Tsai (momentum trading)\nPaul Tudor Jones (value investing)\nSam Zell (real estate)\nCarl Ichan (80\u2019s style corporate raiding)\nJim Chanos (short selling)\nRay Dalio (global macro/ hybrid)\nBill Gross (\u201cthe bond king\u201d)\n\nI\u2019m sure the stories of at least one of these guys will catch your interest and be a great path into learning from what they have learned.\n\nLast thing I\u2019ll add is that following the markets, economy, and news are fantastically key for anyone who invests actively, and more then that, there\u2019s a lot of interesting stuff to learn out there. I\u2019m addition to general market data and financial new stories, there is incredible data easily accessible from central banks and government agencies around the world.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.055571652948856354}, {"body": "Ive never heard anyone mention arbys stock in my entire life lol.

{"title": "The Fed\u2019s Powell Speaks to Congress Today. Inflation and the Debt Ceiling Are in Focus.", "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will make his semiannual visit to Capitol Hill this week, testifying before both the Senate and the House of Representatives as the central bank battles inflation and navigates the most aggressive pace of monetary-policy tightening in decades.\n\nPowell\u2019s back-to-back congressional appearances Tuesday and Wednesday follow the bank\u2019s release last week of its Monetary Policy Report, which it submits to Congress twice a year.\n\nWhile the hearings are nominally focused on the path forward for monetary policy, lawmakers are likely to question Powell on a broad range of subjects, from the rate-hike path and the economic outlook to debt-ceiling matters, regulatory issues, and the idea of a central-bank digital currency.\n\nGiven current economic volatility, and concerns about a potential recession, Powell is likely to be asked by both Republicans and Democrats how the Fed will navigate its dual mandate, which requires it to balance price stability with full employment. Steven Pavlick, head of policy with Renaissance Macro, says he sees an \u201cimportant debate\u201d playing out about the two during the hearing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have Republicans pushing for Powell to emphasize the price stability \\[side\\] to still get inflation down to its 2% target,\u201d Pavlick said on his firm\u2019s podcast on Monday. \u201cThe Democrats we see emphasizing more of the employment side of the mandate and looking to maybe politically pressure Powell to slow the pace of further increases.\u201d\n\nThe hearings come at a pivotal time for monetary policy. The Fed raised interest rates eight times over the past year, and is on track to continue tightening policy at its next meeting in two weeks. So far, its actions have had less of an impact on inflation than most economists expected: The consumer price index is up 6.4% year-over-year, and unemployment is at a remarkably low 3.4%.\n\nThe question now is whether and when the Fed should pause its tightening efforts. Some economists and lawmakers are growing concerned that the cumulative impact of the Fed\u2019s actions has yet to fully trickle down through the economy, and that further rate hikes could go too far, thereby causing a recession. Stopping too soon, however, could allow inflation to become more entrenched in the economy and therefore harder to bring down.\n\nPowell is also likely to face questions about the Congressional debate over lifting the government\u2019s debt ceiling. The U.S. reached its borrowing limit in January, meaning Congress will be forced to act to raise the country\u2019s debt limit\u2014a move akin to raising the spending limit on a consumer credit card\u2014before this summer, or risk a government default.\n\nIn the past, Powell has sought to keep the Fed out of the highly political debate over the debt ceiling while warning that failing to act would carry dire economic consequences.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due,\u201d Powell said in February, adding that \u201cany deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-chair-powell-congress-testimony-speech-e33b696](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-chair-powell-congress-testimony-speech-e33b696)", "id": "11l151f", "created_utc": 1678200137.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Powell will be asked about the rate-hike path and the economic outlook to debt-ceiling matters, regulatory issues, and the idea of a central-bank digital currency.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7666252851486206}, {"body": ">I think it's safe to say that Jerome Powell will be grilled by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle this week.

Disinflationary trends have partially reversed in the recent months.\n2. PCE Core services ex housing shows no disinflation at all.\n3. Rents will show disinflation in the following months.\n4. Stronger than expected economic data most likely will cause higher than expected rates.\n5. Continued goal to reaching 2% inflation (not 3% due to some whispers)\n\nFull text:\n\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report.\n\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation is causing significant hardship, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Our policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.\n\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook The data from January on employment, consumer spending, manufacturing production, and `inflation have partly reversed the softening trends that we had seen in the data just a month ago`. Some of this reversal likely reflects the unseasonably warm weather in January in much of the country. Still, the breadth of the reversal along with revisions to the previous quarter suggests that `inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.`\n\nFrom a broader perspective, inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year but remains well above the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent. The 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices has slowed from its peak of 7 percent in June to 5.4 percent in January as energy prices have declined and supply chain bottlenecks have eased.\n\nOver the past 12 months, core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was 4.7 percent. As supply chain bottlenecks have eased and tighter policy has restrained demand, inflation in the core goods sector has fallen. `And while housing services inflation remains too high, the flattening out in rents evident in recently signed leases points to a deceleration in this component of inflation over the year ahead.`\n\nThat said, there is `little sign of disinflation thus far in the category of core services excluding housing`, which accounts for more than half of core consumer expenditures. To restore price stability, we will need to see lower inflation in this sector, and there will very likely be some softening in labor market conditions. Although nominal wage gains have slowed somewhat in recent months, they remain above what is consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity. Strong wage growth is good for workers but only if it is not eroded by inflation.\n\nTurning to growth, the U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real gross domestic product rising at a below-trend pace of 0.9 percent. Although consumer spending appears to be expanding at a solid pace this quarter, other recent indicators point to subdued growth of spending and production. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\n\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight. The unemployment rate was 3.4 percent in January, its lowest level since 1969. Job gains remained very strong in January, while the supply of labor has continued to lag.1 As of the end of December, there were 1.9 job openings for each unemployed individual, close to the all-time peak recorded last March, while unemployment insurance claims have remained near historical lows.\n\nMonetary Policy With inflation well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent and with the labor market remaining extremely tight, the FOMC has continued to tighten the stance of monetary policy, raising interest rates by 4-1/2 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.2\n\nWe are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the Committee slowed the pace of interest rate increases over its past two meetings. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.\n\n`Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. As I mentioned, the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.` If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time.\n\nOur overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.\n\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n\nThank you. I am happy to take your questions.\n\n1. A box in our latest Monetary Policy Report, \"Why Has the Labor Force Recovery Been So Slow?\" discusses the factors that have been holding back labor supply.
