{"title": "Overview of SPY for the week of March 27-31", "selftext": "What a week! Banks have been falling left and right, with fears of contagion ever greater. Janet Yellen being sneaky about support for the overall banking system and JPow  being relentless about his intent of smacking inflation into submission at all costs.\n\nThis is what the options market looks like to SPY for contracts expiring on March 31st\n\n* The long (50 day) Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) keeps treading the short (5 day) one. We have been on this downtrend since the beginning of February.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7t4r6ott9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=148daeb44ece56d985e47149f5f520bc5c4a21a3\n\n* The price momentum of SPY has been wildly negative in the past weeks. Since Feb 21st we have fallen below the 20percentile momentum twice. Not surprising though with the awful news we have gotten since then. The momentum is calculated by subtracting the short DEMA minus the long DEMA. At the moment it seems that we are  at home in negative momentum, characterised by a drops in price with slight momentary upticks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khoa040yt9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8817c08150f4033ce558aec2a8611cc103a6b292\n\n* The 50 day annualised volatility has been steady below the 20th percentile since the end of January. Statistically, the tendency of the volatility will be to move up above the first purple line (20percentile line). We may be gearing up towards a higher volatility with a downward pressure if more banks begin to collapse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dew0uakju9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de7e23e533aa0ec59cc2493b9b0bd11eb9c423da\n\n* In the option markets expiring this Friday March 31, SPY continues being overwhelmingly bearish in sentiment. There is just too much put open interest right now, protective and speculative puts are in for the kill this week like in previous weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/trsrxky6v9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f04b7dd3d9a68b9356b0f9d495af93f938c1a3b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzl8z3r7v9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bc5287e0ad0fee8aff91ac7b8a664ef8afb13cd\n\n* For SPY option contracts expiring March 31, we can see a very clear resistance level forming at strike $410. There are currently almost 51K open contracts at this point. The reason why this can be a resistance level is that, in general, market makers are at the other side of any opened trade. Since most traders are long traders (i.e. buyers of options) , it is reasonable to assume that at the other side of the 51K contracts are market makers. The game theory would lead us to see that the MMs will try to avoid printing 51K contracts (equal to 5.1M units of SPY) if they can somehow suppress the price enough. This is a subjective method to identify resistance levels and should be used with discretion. The reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se209iniv9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce4f60d3c2281b31bf139d72f703ad871b116e4f\n\n* For SPY option contracts expiring March 31, we can see that there is a massive support level at $380 with over 105K put contracts open at each strike. The reasoning for calling it a support level follows a similar logic as with the resistance level, except that we use PUTS instead of CALLS to make this assessment. This is a subjective method to identify support levels and should be used with discretion. The reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ks4eflisv9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4e87f80753dbdc665b163b1f0a98fb8dbc068d1\n\n* The statistical forecast indicates that this week is also going to be a somewhat flatly down trend, with the higher probability to land prices on Friday between $390 and $400. The statistical method uses transformers to consolidate signals from all the components in SPY and run it through a montecarlo machine to come up with the ranges. This method is highly mathematical but doesn't fully account for more than 2 sigma events (a.k.a highly unlikely events)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqctkr5jw9qa1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e31a2c917ad0eb743a88c515d3ad4f96a8410b9", "id": "123lam1", "created_utc": 1679919412.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 14, "comments": [{"body": "Lol lotta charts. \n\nJust say \u201cgonna be some fuckery\u201d", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "i would have said that, but I was trying to not sound too technical", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20236018300056458}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14712736010551453}, {"body": "Thank you for this detailed analysis.

{"title": "Activision: Proving doubters wrong", "selftext": "Posted this a month ago as a reply to a fellow redditor asking about the ATVI deal.\n\n*But here are some points. You can easily find out more info online as it\u2019s widely available data and info.*\n\n* *upside case obviously is a 24ish % at current prices, and best part is you get it all back in cold hard cash, not MSFT shares. That is big upside considering the market environment and recessionary fears impacting sentiment this year*\n* *downside case is a failure of the deal to go through, but then MSFT has to pay ATVI a breakup fee of 2-3bn in cash, which ATVI can use to buyback shares or conduct a special dividend.*\n\n*Of course most people would be concerned w the question: how far will ATVI fall if the deal falls through?*\n\n* *assuming that ATVI would return to trading at the multiples of its closest peers (Nintendo, Sony, EA, take two), a reasonable estimate would be \\~$65-69 range EXCLUDING the impact of the break up fee, which is just about its price range before the acquisition announcement.*\n* *if (AND A BIG IF) you include the cash breakup fee and assume that ATVI decides to return part of that to shareholders, one could see an additional $0.50 to $2 per share added on top of the range above.*\n* *So actually the downside doesn\u2019t seem all too bad, at around \\~15% (assuming it really does fall to $65). This puts risk-reward ratio at 1.6 (24%/15%), which ain\u2019t too bad at all. Morgan Stanley has also done it\u2019s own downside analysis as well and predicted a price floor of $65 as well, and currently rates it a buy.*\n* *to top it off it\u2019s a fundamentally strong company as well, with game IPs and brands that are globally recognised and successful. It generates good cash flow and still has decent growth runway at least for the next 5 years, given that the gaming industry is still considered \u201cmid to high growth\u201d. Active user base continues to grow in the single digits and even the pandemic did not slow the business down as much as others.*\n* *It\u2019s latest call of duty release was it\u2019s most successful ever as the company continues to be able to execute strongly on how to capture more gamers yet retain its existing one and monetise them well. It has a proven track record of developing, marketing and maintaining triple AAA titles. Balance sheet is healthy and there really aren\u2019t much complaints with its fundamentals other than some controversies here and there.*\n* *there are really only 3 regulators the deal needs to clear, FTC, EU and UK CMA. All 3 are seemingly on the side of not letting this pass. FTC has alr filed a lawsuit against ATVI, while both EU and UK CMA have raised concerns and papers of their own. Perhaps they are all playing the waiting game - if one regulator opposes it as the first mover, its much easier to \u201crationalize\u201d opposing it as well, but the question is who would want to be that first mover? On the flip side, If one regulator approves it first, the chances of the deal going through would jump significantly as the others might just follow suit. Perhaps if you don\u2019t like the uncertainty now, you could wait for some positive news (like a first major approval) and sacrifice some upside potential for more certainty. Prices could easily jump up to 83-86 by then.*\n\n*Personally I hold q a significant amount of ATVI (\\~12% of my pf), because I hold conviction that MSFT has the right people in place to recognise how impt this deal is to them and to negotiate a concession agreement that makes everyone happy. MSFT has never failed an acquisition in its entire history and it lends some confidence that it has the right people, strategy and relationships in place to see this out. It\u2019s unlikely the deal will settle so soon, a more realistic timeline would be Q3 or even early Q4 due to complexity and size of this deal and the amount of stakeholders involved.*\n\n*Interestingly enough, as the price has been so flat since the announcement of the acquisition I had the extra benefit of this position buffering my portfolio from some of the market downside (reducing volatility) and actually I somehow (luckily) outperformed many indexes last year. The price action is lowly correlated to the market at this point but rather to developments on the deal.*\n\n*People saying that \u201cthis deal is too big to fail\u201d know nothing, don\u2019t listen to them. Any deal, no matter the size, can fail still, so do still manage how risk adverse you are.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week the UK regulator basically made a u turn on its provisional findings:\n\n*After reviewing what it called \u201cnew evidence\u201d, the Competition and Markets Authority said on Friday that it no longer thought there would be a \u201csubstantial lessening of competition\u201d in the console market if the Xbox maker takes over the publisher of the bestselling game franchise.*\n\nPrice gapped up to \\~$84 as of Friday close, and now the spread to deal price is about 12%. Although the risk reward may not seem as favorable as it once was when it was hovering around the 75-77 range the past 6-months, I still think there is opportunity present for those looking for a short term tactical trade idea (3-6 months)\n\n* Just like in the EU regulator, the focus for UK is now exclusively on cloud gaming and anti competitive effects; which is a major win for the deal\n* MSFT has boosted its efforts in soothing regulators nerves within cloud on top of consoles - most recently 2 10 year deals with boosteroid and ubitus (cloud gaming providers) on top of mega partnerships with Nvidia and nintendo\n* As of now, 4 jurisdictions have cleared the deal (Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Serbia, Chile)\n* The tone of the narrative in the markets surrounding this deal has clearly shifted - it has changed from criticism of the anti competitiveness of the deal towards a finding solution set that makes all parties happy\n* The next 2 months will be especially closely watched -  Decision dateline for CMA end april, decision dateline NZ end april, decision dateline for EU end may, FTC expert reports start may.\n* Citi has upgraded its probability of the deal closing from 50% to 70% last Friday\n* MSFT has won dismissal of a private consumer antitrust lawsuit (first sued in late december 22)\n* It now looks likely that EU and UK will both clear the deal - Though uncertain, a continued push by the US FTC to challenge the deal becomes increasingly complex in the face of its 2 peers, a wise move would be to align itself with the EC and CMA in recognizing that there is no console related anti competitive effects. When that happens, we all know where the deal is finally heading towards.\n\n*As always, past performance is not indicative of future performance.

S&P 500 futures were up 0.7%, while Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.4%.\n*****\n> Regional banks rose broadly, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbing more than 3.8% in the premarket. First Republic was the best-performing stock in the fund, surging more than 28.9%. PacWest also gained more than 11%.\n*****\n> The moves come after Wall Street capped off a winning week despite volatility related to the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate hike and the ongoing bank crisis. The Nasdaq Composite led the major indexes upward with a 1.7% advance. The S&P 500 finished the week up 1.4%, while the Dow added 1.2%.\n*****\n> The central bank announced a quarter percentage point interest rate hike \u2014 which was largely in line with Wall Street expectations \u2014 while hinting that an end to interest rate increases could be on the horizon.\n*****\n> \u201cAll told, this was about as dovish a rate increase as you can get. On the whole, that seemed to leave markets feeling if not good, then at least not bad,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cAlthough markets were okay with the Fed, it was the second thing \u2014 the ongoing turmoil in the banking system \u2014 that mattered even more.\u201d\n*****\n> The health of the U.S. banking system also weighed on investors over the course of the week, with a particular focus on First Republic, PacWest and other regional financial institutions. CNBC reported over the weekend that the deposit outflow from small banks to industry giants like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo has slowed in recent days.\n*****\n> Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that U.S. authorities were considering expanding an emergency lending program for banks, which could give First Republic more time to shore up its liquidity. First Republic ended last week down 46.3% as investors contemplated if the plan from a group of banks to deposit $30 billion would be enough to bolster its balance sheet.\n*****\n> First Citizens Bank also agreed to buy large parts of Silicon Valley Bank, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said overnight. The deal includes the purchase of approximately $72 billion of SVB assets at a discount of $16.5 billion, but around $90 billion in securities and other assets will remain \u201cin receivership for disposition by the FDIC.\u201d\n*****\n> Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen aimed to assure investors that the U.S. banking system remained stable and supported in commentary delivered over the course of the week.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LO3iGPO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/0BkV8eI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/J98quak.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mpEpIJn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vjTHyV5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/YuogcFh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/reHx54W.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-pins-fcnca-cat.html?&qsearchterm=stocks%20making)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Pinterest** \u2014 Pinterest gained 4.3% after UBS upgraded the social media stock to buy and said shares could pop more than 25% as the company improves its advertising strategy.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** PINS\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=PINS&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PINS)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **First Citizens BancShares** \u2014 Shares popped 40% on news that First Citizens will buy around $72 billion of Silicon Valley Bank assets at a discount of $16.5 billion.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** FCNCA\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=FCNCA&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/FCNCA)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **First Republic, PacWest** \u2014 Regional bank stocks were moving higher on Monday following a report from Bloomberg News that U.S. authorities were considering expanding government support for banks to provide additional liquidity.

{"title": "Coming soon to a theater near you \u2014 the \u201cBox Office Wars\u201d", "selftext": "CNK (Cinemark) is about to drop a $600M quarter (total revenue) in Q1 compared to $460M same period last year. That\u2019s pretty damn good. And that\u2019s with very poor results for both Shazam and 65 \u2014 which could have made the quarter great. The overall box office (domestic) is trending 30% above YoY total gross for the year so we are looking at a $9.2-$9.5B year. This would put the domestic box office just 15% shy of 2019\u2019s pre-pandemic total. \n\nIn my opinion, it may take the market another 6 months to figure that CNK is a $18-$20 stock, but how long did it take for the market to realize CNK wasn\u2019t a $9 stock either back in January?\n\nBut here\u2019s a bigger question \u2014 where\u2019s is this stock going to be in 1-2 years? $20-25? What about 2-3 years? What happens when there is a whole new steady stream of content from the \u201cstreamers\u201d (Amazon, Apple, Netflix) now that they too are realizing the value of the theatrical release? It\u2019s quite possible that instead of streamers replacing theaters like everyone thought they would during COVID \u2014 the greatest irony of all is the streamers may ultimately kick off a whole new golden age of \u201cBox Office Wars\u201d where Netflix/Amazon/Apple and other streamers are competing with traditional studios for the (dare I say it) coveted and exclusive theatrical window. And who would stand to gain the most from all this new competition and big money spent on new content to spur on the \u201cBox Office Wars\u201d?  That would be your boring old well run movie theater companies like CNK \u2014 who\u2019s up 60% YTD and STILL trading 60% below pre-pandemic price.

Also Q1' 2019 was the worst of the 12 quarters in 2017-2019 so not really a great mark to compare to.\n\nFor the YOY calculation, using Q1 as a base for the calculation is problematic as there is little reason to assume the increase you noted for Q1 will apply to the rest of the year. For one, as noted already Q1' 2022 was unusually bad, perhaps it lacked any worthwhile movie releases. Second, looking at 2017 and 2018, Q1 results were in-line with the average for the year so there is no trend to assume later quarters will be better. Continuing that thought, Q1' 2023 should be about 1.760B in revenues which if it will be average for the year would be only about 7B in revenue for the year, which would be a disaster.\n\nThere is a reason most analysts assume box office revenues will be substantially off pre-pandemic levels (not 15% like you say, but much more) and will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024 or 2025 (assuming they ever do return).\n\nIn my opinion I don't think the market will look favorably at CNK anytime soon.

The current market skepticism on the stock seems to be coming from three sources:\n\n1. Majority of investors currently believe that streaming will kill theaters. despite the fact that Amazon and Apple are now going to spend $1b per year on movies that will go to the theater first. Also ignored are numerous movies recently moved from direct to streaming to a 45 day theater exclusive. Including, Smile, Evil Dead Rise, and Stephen King's The Boogeyman. Smile was for Paramount +, Evil Dead is HBO Max (Warner Bros.) and Boogeyman is Hulu.\n\nIt will take time, but investors will eventually figure this out.\n\n2) A significant amount of debt is coming due over the next 5 years. Most investors don't currently believe that CNK will meet these obligations. But, just last week the company called $100M of 8.75% debt due in 2025. As the box office recovers and cash flow generation improves, this issue will be put to bed.  Over the 1Q and 2Q of 2023 CNK will generate EBITDA in the range of $250M. Pre Pandemic EBITDA margins were in the low 20% range. 1Q 2023 is looking to be about 10% and 2Q should be back to the high teens to low 20's.\n\nAs their ability to reduce debt becomes clear, this issue will go away.\n\n3) Audiences need to return to the Theater. The biggest Q in 2019 saw 80M tickets sold by CNK. Last year in Q2 they did 52M tickets sold thanks to Top Gun and Jurassic World. 1Q of this year looks like 41M up form 33M in 1Q of last year. They need to get to 50M + per Q to get over their fixed costs and start leveraging earnings to the bottom line.\n\nAs the volume of movies recovers, and if there are enough quality offerings......audience counts should recover.\n\nAs for target price, over the 10 year prior to the pandemic CNK traded in the range of 14 to 18x forward earnings 67% of the time. Using a conservative 14x multiple and the assumption that earnings can recover to the $2 range by the end of 2024 the stock could go to $28.  If movies from the Streaming companies really roll in as you suggest......the stock could go a lot higher than that.\n\nThis process will take 2 to 3 years, so this is a get rich slow scheme as it is not a meme stock like AMC. But, with 22% of the shares outstanding held short there could be some fireworks from time to time.\n\nBuy your tickets now so you can get the best seat in the house!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "By the way \u2014 there is only one part of your response I would challenge. You called CNK a \u201cget rich slow\u201d play.   That I don\u2019t agree with.  Investing in Microsoft or Amazon or the S&P is a get rich slow trade.  Based on your own conservative estimates, this stock could be trading at $28 in 2-3 years.   That\u2019s just shy of a 100% return based on current stock price, averaging 30-50%+ return a year.   There isn\u2019t an investor in the world (including everyone on WSB that\u2019s been burned by meme stocks just like myself) that wouldn\u2019t take those returns \u2014 especially given our current market dynamics where the broader markets might be lucky hitting single digits.
