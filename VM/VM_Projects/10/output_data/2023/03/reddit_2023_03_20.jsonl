{"title": "Credit Spread strategy feedback", "selftext": "I've been lurking around here and I didn't see anyone doing what I'm doing so I decided to post and see if anyone has feedback or caution for me. I've been doing credit spreads off and on in a small Robinhood account. I am refocusing more on it now going forward after once again confirming to myself that I am NOT a scalper or buyer by draining another cash account.  \n\n\nHere's what I am doing. I have 3 day trades a week under PDT and about $120 in my account. So I'm starting from the bottom bottom. I am taking 8 trades a week. 3 high probability day trades and 5 swings. I am only trading SPY and QQQ. I take my day trades on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  \n\n\nI will be picking my strikes using a calculation based on the VIX rule of 16.  \n(VIX Price)/16 = N --- (SPY price) x N = Expected move --- (SPY price) + EM = CCS short strike --- (SPY Price) - EM = PCS short strike. This typically ends up being -2/+2 SD from price  \n\n\nDirection is determined by a read of the 30m 10 and 50 simple moving averages on SPY - If above, bullish, below bearish, and between, look for which direction the moving averages point.\n\nI will do the calculation and take the trade at the last 30m of each day to swing into the following day, and at the open of every day I will day trade in order to determine optimal entries for the strategy as well as where to take profit on the swing(I will set a limit order to close for 0.02 at the open on the swings and on the day trades and adjust as necessary.)\n\nAll swing trades are 1DTE to maximize the effect of overnight theta, and all day trades are 0DTE for the same reason. No trade will be allowed to expire worthless\n\nIf this strategy is successful, I will move it to my E\\*Trade account, enable margin, and begin to do it on SPX.
