{"title": "Regression Analysis -- Anyone using it?", "selftext": "It probably doesn't sound good when I tell you it's been two years doing this but until I see stronger results, trades I do are almost always straddles on earnings season which, for the past two years, have yielded great results. That and selling covered calls on GME in 2021 and straddles on CPI/fed rate hikes for 2022. Until earning next quarter, the only trades I do are paper money via ToS until I am able to pump out strong regression models. Trades made from my regression models are for one direction. \n\nMy returns have been mixed since I started and I know I have a lot of work to do. Thankfully though, I have finally seen positive, consistent returns over the past six months however, I require better before I start using real money. This change happened because of a handful of variables I left out. Hopefully, as I move along, I can make this better but until then, paper money it is.\n\nIs anyone else out there does something similar with regression analysis? Are you using R or excel? What are your returns like doing this? Do you see any limitations with regression analysis over anything else? How do you approach human emotion?\n\n# TLDR:\n\nI have a lot of success trading options. I have been using the most basic strategy to get the returns I have today and on the side, have grinded away learning regression analysis to help forecast direction. It's been a rough road to take on since consistency is what I'm looking for and that hasn't been seen until this past six months.
