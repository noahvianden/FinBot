{"title": "Insider Trading Weekly Update #029: Oracle of Omaha Buys More Oil, Breaking Down Antara Capital's Activity With $AMC | Insider Trading Recap", "selftext": "GM, \n\n**TL;DR** \\- *Huge* surge in purchases this week, primarily driven by insider buying in the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry. Despite a $354M purchase of $OXY, Buffet + Berkshire only increased their position by 3%, while Riverstone Holdings established a new position in $EVA. There was a spike in overall transaction activity, with 1,266 insiders submitting Form 4 filings.\n\nGiven the love for $AMC here, let's discuss the specifics of Antara Capital\u2019s round of purchases. It\u2019s \\*not\\* that straightforward - they do not simply buy common stock:\n\n* February 27th: \n   * Sold 195K Put Options for $319K\n   * Bought 6M Total Return Swaps for $45.7M\n* March 2nd: Bought 500K Total Return Swaps for $3M\n* March 3rd: \n   * Bought 4M Total Return Swaps, for $26.1M, but \\*lowered their\\* swap position\n   * Bought \\~$2.5M of Class A Common Stock, but \\*decreased\\* their position to 0\n   * Sold $15.6K of Call Options, bringing their shares owned to 0\n\nWould love to get the WSB-approved POV on their trading history. Let me know what you think.\n\nBelow are some notable sales from insiders:\n\n* Mondelez International, Inc decreased its stake in Keurig ($KPD / Beverages) by 39.7% with a $1B sale on Feb 27th\n* Walgreens Boots Alliance, a 10% Owner of Option Care Health, Inc ($OPCH / Health Care) decreased its stake by 58.96% with a $468M sale on March 1st\n* Ccmp Capital LLp, a 10% Owner of Hillman Solutions Group ($HLMN / Machinery), decreased its stake by 77.52% with a $230M sale on March 3rd\n* DigitalBridge Group, a 10% Owner of Brightspire Capital ($BRSP / Mortgage REITs), decreased its stake by 99.7% with a $209M sale on March 1st\n* Randy Ban, the Chief Commercial Officer of Inspire Medical Systems ($INSP / Health Care), decreased their stake by 97.05% with an $83.5M sale on March 1st\n* Sea Vii Management, a 10% Owner of Definitive Healthcare ($DH / Health Care Technology), decreased its stake by 59.68% with a $33M sale on Feb 27th\n* CEOs of Roblox Corp, Duolingo, and Freshworks all sold \\~100% of their current shares:\n   * David Baszucki, $RBLX: $20.9M sale on March 2nd\n   * Luis Von Ahn, $DUOL: $18.1M sale on March 3rd\n   * Rathnagirish Mathrubootham, $FRSH: $14.8M sale on March 1st\n\nAnd some notable buys from insiders:\n\n* Warren Buffet + Berkshire Hathaway increased their stake in Occidental Petroleum ($OXY / Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels) by 3% with a $354M purchase on March 3rd\n* Riverstone Holdings made a $150M investment into Enviva Inc ($EVA / Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels) on March 1st\n* James Defranco, a Director at Dish Network ($DISH / Media), increased his stake by 68.47% with a $15.7M purchase on March 2nd\n* Thomas Mcconnon, a Director at Goosehead Insurance ($GSHD / Insurance), increased his stake by 43.05% with a $7M purchase on Feb 27th\n* Mark Vergnano, a Director at Waters Corp ($WAT / Life Sciences Tools & Services) bought another 3,185 shares for $998K, increasing his stake by 856%\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases soared from $64.7M to $625.6M (+867%)\n* Sales increased from $1.3B to $4.6B (+241%)\n* Transactions increased from 758 to 1,455 (+92%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 356 to 663 (+86%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 39 to 56 (+44%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 317 to 607 (+91%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 647 to 1,266 (+96%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 48 to 85 (+77%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 599 to 1,181 (+97%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **February 27th - March 3rd.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.\n2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.\n3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **February 20th - February 24th.**\n4. **No companies without a ticker**\n5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.\n\n# Further Context\n\n1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\\*if\\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.\n3.
