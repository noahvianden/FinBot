They have the same risk profile.  You can create an equivalent risk profile by selling puts to have the same risk profile as owning 100 shares of AMZN and doing a CC. For example, let's say you bought 100 shares of AMZN at 93.  I will use round up current prices.  That will cost you $9,300 and this is your risk in case AMZN goes to zero. Then you sell one 21 April 2023 105 call for a credit of 1.00 or $100.  Fast forward to April 21 and AMZN is now at 110.  How did you do? You are up 17 points on your stock or $1700 profit. However, the calls you sold are now in the money and worth $5. You sold it for $1.00 but now you have to buy it back for $5 so that is a loss of $4.00.  So $17 profit minus $4.00 is $13.00 profit or $1,300.\n\nThe equivalent cash based put writing goes like this.  You sell one 21 April 2023 105 Put for a credit of 13.00 or $1,300 (actual price).  You will need $10,500 but you are taking in as credit of $1,300 so you are risking $9,200 in case AMZN goes to zero.  How did this trade do on expiration with AMZN trading at 110?  The puts expire worthless and you keep the whole premium of 13.00 or $1,300.  \n\nConversely, when you sell OTM puts, it is equivalent to selling ITM covered calls.  For example, selling 21 April 2023 85 put OTM (most common strategy here) is equivalent to selling a 21 April 2023 ITM 85 covered call.  It will have an equivalent risk profile.
