{"title": "My NVDA Earnings Play: Neutral Stance with a Focus on IV Drop", "selftext": "I'm expecting a strong report from NVDA. Under such circumstances I usually open ratio calls, especially when the stock is at highs, but this time I chose not to take that risk.\n\nInstead, I've opened a relatively neutral position, but with strong negative vega, anticipating a drop in IV post-earnings report:\n\n* Bought 3 Dec15 Puts at $500\n* Sold 12 Dec15 Puts at $450\n* Bought 6 Nov24 Puts at $465\n* Bought 1 Dec15 Call at $540\n* Sold 1 Nov24 Call at $560\n* Debit: $2567. Collateral: $30000.\n\nAfter a positive earnings report, I'm expecting a drop below $500 and aim to profit from the Dec15 $500 Puts. Still, just in case, I bought the Dec15 $540 Call as a hedge against a surprisingly strong report. I'll decide what to do with the short $560 call based on market reaction.\n\nAs a safety measure, I also bought 6 Nov24 $465 Puts. While I don\u2019t strongly anticipate an unpleasant surprise, the significant rise in November could still lead to severe disappointments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfu1gm8irq1c1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47f61343dbd042759f522bca4e01a921891bfb1c\n\nUPD1: My expectations for a strong NVIDIA (NVDA) report were mostly met, but I anticipated the market's downturn to happen a bit later. Nevertheless, it's not a big issue. As expected, the implied volatility (IV) in December options plummeted, and my position is holding up well. However, I can't boast about profits yet because the Nov24 puts I had as a hedge against any sudden negative surprises also became worthless.\n\nJust before yesterday's report, I decided to hedge a bit against a minor decline by buying a Dec15 Straddle at $540, selling 2 Dec15 Puts at $460, and 3 Dec15 Calls at $630, costing me an additional $3828.\n\nSo, in total, the position's debit stands at $6395.\n\nI'm not a fan of such situations, but I'm banking on the stock correcting itself in the next 2-3 weeks, along with the broader market \u2013 I'm still holding some\u00a0SOXS\u00a0and\u00a0SQQQ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k86v0y6jby1c1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dda234e908c80ee24f954caf7202d7aaa570f65d\n\nUPD2: I've closed my position in NVDA's Dec15 options. Some of the bought puts expired OTM on Nov 24th, but this didn't prevent me from achieving a credit of $8367 upon closing yesterday. In total, that's a profit of $1972 minus a commission of $81.64.\n\nI was asked why I opened such a 'complex' position when my main aim was the IV crush? Wouldn't it have been simpler to sell a strangle? For instance, the same Dec15 Puts 450 and Dec15 Calls 540?\n\nYes, it would have been simpler. And it might even have been more profitable. However, the profitability is debatable.\n\nI wouldn't have dared to sell that volume of puts without at least partial insurance. And selling naked calls on NVDA before the earnings report, I consider downright reckless.\n\nWith my approach I was prepared for any scenario, and I was likely to secure my $1.5-2k profit regardless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9ox84qbnc3c1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c60a2f22f45a7ddf45df56fdc86d82ec7592285b", "id": "180nbel", "created_utc": 1700590200.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "So insanely complicated and honestly not sure why.

I didn't dare to do that.\n\nYes, I still have three uncovered puts. But for me to face serious losses on a decline, the stock would have had to plummet by 25% post-report. While possible, it's unlikely. I'm willing to take that risk.\n\nNow, one might say simply selling volatility was the right move. But I still plan to reap my profits.

{"title": "Playing NVDA Earnings With Minimal IV Crush", "selftext": "*PS: I know this sub is more about selling options rather than buying, and moreover volatility is more of a vega play than theta - but I still think this analysis and calibration can be useful for any option trader especially folks familiar with volatility events like earnings.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week I looked at NVDA as a possible play for their earnings releasing today after close. My usual approach is to start by comparing the stock move on past earnings versus current expected move then look at some positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nvidia\u2019s recent strides in AI and its positive guidance have set the stage for an intriguing earnings release. ](https://preview.redd.it/cd3v43egdr1c1.png?width=3006&format=png&auto=webp&s=236ba5823a7ba1835c646bd3d4daf276d4597850)\n\n# Historical Moves and Recent Trend\n\nExamining its historical context, the company experienced a paradigm shift in its stock behaviour post-2020. In the recent years, notably from 2021 onwards, we regularly see realised moves consistently exceeding historical averages. \n\nWe notice its highest ever earnings move that happened on 05-24 after a big raise in guidance due to unexpectedly higher AI demand.\n\n[NVDA past moves recap](https://preview.redd.it/qe6gw489dr1c1.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=303201675ecaaae8068c590ae6f63be4a9df0365)\n\nThe current implied move of around +/-7% is very close to the average historic move on earnings over 10 years, as we can see in this weekly graph:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jz926luaer1c1.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&s=011fa09f4b0bdbb994de834d930c54b72b9520e1\n\n**Given Nvidia\u2019s recent dynamic performance and the alignment of its implied move with historical averages, there\u2019s potential for a long volatility opportunity.**\n\n# Closest Expiration Straddle\n\nWe start by comparing classic positions such as the straddle and strangles. The straddle for the closest expiration is our reference point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7s2fse89dr1c1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=c960f92c0e06fbcc3beb6d710885636aab6cda1f\n\nWe see its price point at around $37 per contact, and a favorable implied move of +/-6.9%.\n\nSee how as we go with wider strangles, their prices decreases (given that out-of-the-money options are less expensive than at-the-money) but also see their breakeven widen, making them riskier.\n\nLet's look at the full position breakdown to analyse its projected pnl through the week. \n\nWe notice a **substantial loss on Wednesday (earnings day) due to the implied volatility crush**, despite being an at the money position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n31lb89dr1c1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd7c3497c26f6376e70e371b3c75945104278e0\n\nThe position would lose around 46% if NVDA doesn\u2019t move at all on earnings \u2014 which is highly unlikely as we\u2019ve seen on the moves recap. Nonetheless, we should prepare for such a scenario and be comfortable with this loss if it occurs.\n\n**Let\u2019s see if we can lower this potential maximum loss.**\n\n# Using Next Expiration Date\n\nTo manage the impact of the crush, we explore a position with a December 1st expiration, keeping the strikes the same.\n\n**Next expirations options are less affected by IV crush, but they come with a reduced risk reward profile as well.**\n\nOpening up the list of straddles and strangles, we see that the same straddle with the December 1st expiration costs now a bit more, around $45 per contract \u2014 expected as longer expirations are more expensive to account for the additional time decay. \n\nHowever, we see that its breakeven stayed pretty much the same if not lower, around +-6%, making it a still favorable long volatility position when comparing to the past moves.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uonvf889dr1c1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=726067521d714874c8d7c6c9670855a8074b8cbe\n\nLet's look at its projected PnL through the week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dw9y5589dr1c1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=720f50353a7d64537447a29dd22fd20ed4ba77bf\n\n**The max loss now is nearly half, around 17%.** \n\nSo even in worst case scenarios, this position would still be exit-able with a reasonable loss on Wednesday, and we see that if the no move scenario persists until the end of the week, the position would only be a 26% loss.\n\n# Recap\n\nWhen dealing with earnings or any trade, two key factors matter: **the chance of success** and **the risk-reward profile**.\n\nFor earnings, we gauge success probability by comparing our position's breakeven to past earnings moves. This historical view helps set realistic expectations and calibrate positions, considering extreme past moves. In the case of NVDA, the +/-7% implied move seems lower than recent moves, and its historical moves show outlier events.\n\nThe risk profile is about potential profit and loss exposure. Even with a high success chance, a lopsided profile (e.g., 80% loss to 20% gain) isn't worth it. Realistic returns come from past moves, helping establish a range for potential gains and losses. In our NVDA analysis, we took a conservative approach by considering the worst-case scenario, factoring in NVDA's typical +/-2% move on earnings day.\n\nThis [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6WEh-VKH8) discusses this analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this is helpful, let me know if you have any questions!", "id": "180qvpw", "created_utc": 1700599310.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Haha, well here it's more like $6.5 instead of $13!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12839341163635254}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07440147548913956}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07440147548913956}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01878691092133522}, {"body": "What's the point of posting this 20 minutes before the markt closes man, lol.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "sorry about that, it can still be useful for other earnings!", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I sent to my friend and 100% helped them close their position before NVDA earnings today.

Similarly, on the evening of July 3, the stock prices for several tech stocks, including Amazon.com and Alphabet, all magically went to $123.47, implying a significant drop in their prices. However, no trades were made at those prices and their correct values were soon back on display. These instances were essentially glitches that were brief and almost immediately corrected. \n\nMoreover, there have been attempts to manipulate the stock market. For example, in 2013, hackers gained access to the Associated Press's Twitter account and tweeted a false news story about explosions in the White House. This caused the Dow Jones industrial average to shed 150 points instantly, although the losses were regained quickly as the hoax was unraveled. But in that short period of time, equities lost over $130 billion in market value. \n\nDespite these incidents, the stock market has serious protections in place to prevent any sort of \"hack\" or fraud-based fiasco brought on by hostile actors. For instance, when there is an irregularity, the exchange is simply shut down. This has happened multiple times and it does not cause a panic. The exchange is reopened when everyone is calmed down. \n\nMoreover, major stock market exchanges run on their own offline networks, which renders one of the most ubiquitous and effective scamming techniques, phishing, completely impotent. \n\nIn conclusion, while the stock market has not been directly hacked to alter stock prices, there have been incidents that have disrupted trading and caused significant panic.
