{"title": "The Bad Economics Of The Audio Streaming Industry (Spotify Example)", "selftext": "Hey everyone, before I share with you my thoughts on Spotify, I thought it might be a good idea to share a famous quote from Warren Buffett, which I think applies to the audio streaming market: *'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact'.*\n\nThis posts breaks down:\n\n* Overview of Spotify\n* Economics of the Audio Streaming Business\n* Why I think its bad economics for investors\n\n# Spotify Overview: \n\nSpotify is one of the world\u2019s most popular audio streaming subscription service giving access to over 100 million tracks and 5 million podcasts to millions of members. Spotify is the leader in the audio streaming market with a market share of 30.5% and Spotify has been growing their premium subscribers every year with no signs of slowing down.\n\n*Premium Subscribers (In Millions)*\n\n|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|**2023 (2Qs)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|92|154|244|341|445|567|675|770|*430\\**|\n\nIn 2022, the global audio streaming market was around $34 billion. The audio streaming market is expected to grow to over $100 billion by 2030 according to research and markets. Despite Spotify's growth and the growth of the industry at large, the economics of Spotify and other businesses in this market doesn't appear to be looking good at all and in my opinion I don't see signs of improvement. I will explain the economics of the industry a little below but I will first present revenue and profitability in years 2015 & 2022:\n\n*Revenue (In Millions)*\n\n|**2015**|**2022**|\n|:-|:-|\n|$1,940|$11,727|\n\n*Profitability (In Millions)*\n\n|**2015**|**2022**|\n|:-|:-|\n|($235)|($689)|\n\nAlthough I only present these two years, operating losses for this company has been consistent in all years between this period. Someone has to cover the cost of the money losing operations of Spotify and it looks as if shareholders has been footing the bill. Shares outstanding has been increasing.\n\nShares outstanding:\n\n|**2015**|**2022**|\n|:-|:-|\n|141,946,000|195,846,362|\n\nI believe Spotify can continue to grow revenue but I think the path to profitability is no where near in sight. Looking more closely into the economics of the audio streaming business, it appears that Spotify **doesn't have a moat** and I don't think any competitor can gain an advantage in this industry.\n\n# Economics of the Audio Streaming Business \n\nThere are certain rules in this industry that prevent any company from gaining any real advantage from another. The audio streaming business is subject to a \u2018most favored nation clause\u2019, which sounds complicated but it essentially means that audio streaming providers such as Spotify is in some ways restricted from negotiating exclusive deals with artists. Let\u2019s say Spotify has agreed to a deal with a music publisher at $10,000, and this deal contains a most favoured nation clause, if another publisher comes in and agrees to a $15,000 deal with Spotify, then Spotify will have to pay the same amount to first publisher. For example, let\u2019s say Spotify signed an agreement that gives it permission to stream **The Weeknd** ***(which is the most listened artist on Spotify)*** on its platform. And this agreement contains a MFN clause. The way this works is that Spotify will need to pay royalties to the Universal Music Group, which is the Weeknd\u2019s publisher, every time a song is played on its platform. The Royalty rates are set by the Copyright Royalty Board which establishes the minimum rate a streaming service has to pay their artists. If Spotify signs a new agreement with **Rihanna,** and Spotify pays Rihanna's publisher (Sony/ATV) a higher amount to stream her songs on the platform, then Spotify will have to pay the difference to the Weekend Publisher because of the clause agreement. This applies to other audio streaming services such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, etc.\n\n# Why this is bad economics for Spotify investors  \n\n**Reason 1:** Since it is in the best interests of music artists to go after those MFN agreements; this really prevents any audio streaming service from signing exclusive deals with music artists that prevent from being streamed on other platforms. It is also the goal of a music artist to promote their music as far and as wide as possible and be to paid the maximum amount, and to do that, any major artist, or any artist in general will also have similar agreements with other streaming platforms, giving none of these platforms any competitive advantage. ***This is very different from video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, who has their own production studio and exclusive rights to TV shows and movies.***\n\n**Reason 2:** As someone who likes listening to music, it really doesn\u2019t bother me what platform I use, as long I can listen to the music I like. So I really struggle to find any competitive advantage Spotify has and because of that, I\u2019m not really sure if Spotify can maintain its position in the market without spending an excessive amount. And from what we have already seen, Spotify is already struggling to keep its costs down so achieving a sustainable level of profits in the future is very hard to predict.\n\n**Reason 3:** Competition. Since the audio streaming market is huge and is expected to grow, this will attract new competitors into the market. Without a competitive advantage (other than a well-known brand - not very durable) Spotify will likely need to increase their costs further in the future to maintain and protect its market share of 30.5%. If more competitors enter the market, then Spotify will need to increase marketing costs to attract new consumers, this expense may increase by a lot. Since Spotify is a technology company, research and development costs will need to continually increase, since old and new competitors will be investing to improve their audio streaming service so they take market share from Spotify. Another problem is pricing. Let\u2019s imagine a new competitor enters the market and sells their streaming service at a lower price than Spotify. Spotify will then need to reduce its subscription costs to prevent their members from cancelling their membership and signing up with a competitor.\n\nThose are my thoughts on Spotify and the economics of the audio streaming business. As a consumer and a lover of music, we gain the benefit of competition. However, I think the consumer benefit will continue to come at the expense of shareholders. Of course, I could be wrong.

{"title": "Nasdaq $ZG (Zillow) EPS not accurate?", "selftext": "Does anyone here know the reporting/input process for the 10Q data that\u2019s distributed to all the broker/analyst tools that we use?\n\nWhere in the process of filing the 10Q does the EPS get read or entered as \u201cofficial\u201d for API  distribution to all the platforms?\n\nWhy, you might ask? These questions sent me into my very own DD investigation that very well may turn me into an activist investor. \n\nYesterday, $ZG \u201cbeat\u201d analyst estimates\u2026 in the minutes that passed from the earnings release, every published data source I have, was reporting their EPS as .33 diluted, and .36 basic. RH had .33 eps, TDA had .33, Bloomberg Terminal had .33 on the ticker research tab AND the news wire.\n\nIm in real estate. I know ZG\u2019s situation is worse than the public knows. Every real estate business is currently worse than advertised. Almost 30% of realtors have left the business in the last 9 months. (Mostly, agents that spend with Zillow are the first to fail, new, naive etc absent outliers)\n\nI opened their 10Q and accompanying 8K, and briefly scanned both. Quickly uncovered a couple *key* issues.\n\nFirst, they include an EPS measure based on EBITDA, which is non-GAAP compliant - (they disclose this), but their including it in their earnings report (likely intentionally) causes unnecessary misinterpretations of their financial situation. Proof being? It was erroneously reported as the net EPS being circulated yesterday. \n\nThey actually booked a net loss of (.12) EPS and  now today, all the data sources have their EPS (.12)\n\n- but, even (.12) is not accurate or in-line with what ASC 260 requires to be reflected when reporting earnings. \n\n Conveniently, they separate a (.02) net loss from \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d and report on this excluded loss, in a third supplemental section. (\u201cDiscontinued operations\u201d this time, is from winding down the iBuyer program)\n\nReal GAAP reportable EPS is (.14) net loss.\n\nNow, that got me digging. .02 is nearly 17% of .12. How often do they exclude almost 20% of their net loss from being reported - and promote EBITDA EPS for the press?\n\nWell, Every time.\n\nIt seems, every quarterly report they file includes a PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED, supplementary EBITDA EPS, that becomes the number initially published to platforms, then the distributed EPS data is changed by the following morning to the GAAP reportable, ASC 260 required EPS. And then, it STILL omits an often HUGE portion of actual loss, every time.\n\nTheir historical pricing action on earnings day AH, and the day after, will substantiate the \u201cchange\u201d accusation in reported eps data. (Bait and switch?)\n\nAs mentioned about inaccurately reporting losses. A significant accusation\u2026 I believe they  *\u201cpivot on purpose\u201d*, all by itself, as an accounting strategy. If true, it means their underlying business, isn\u2019t a business\u2026 It\u2019s a slush fund.\n\nZillow is infamous for shifting business direction, pursuing new business models, abandoning long-term plans etc\u2026 Not necessarily a bad thing. Fire fast etc. \n\nWhen they change business direction, for accounting/reporting purposes, they classify the business unit being shuttered as \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d. Good, right?\n\nWell, by doing this perpetually, they are able to (and they do) segregate losses that stem from the old flavor of the week business that\u2019s now considered \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d, always allowing them to exclude that loss from reported net EPS, and always allowing them to report a juiced eps or padded net loss, without its inclusion.\n\nI believe they start up and \u201cwind down\u201d business units solely and intentionally to shift losses from their reportable balance sheet to a supplemental reporting section that\u2019s not included in distributed net EPS.  \n\nI have more $ZG DD bangers to release later, but thought I\u2019d quickly post some of my findings around their EPS shenanigans.\n\nUp next: They just contracted to buy the CRM FollowUpBoss (FUB) for $400M cash + $100M earnout. FUB advertises 19k users. \n\nThat\u2019s $26k+ per user. $20k if they don\u2019t get the earnout. \n\nFUB\u2019s most expensive plan nets about $100/mo recurring per user.
