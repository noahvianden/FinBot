As people invest into boomer stocks with dividends and P/Es below 50, the question arises: \"how do we use to opportunity to make the stonk market give us free money?\"\n\nMy answer is \"pair trading\". I realize that utilizing a sophisticated trading strategy I heard about earlier today and then going to WSB for feedback is a recipe for me sucking off your wife's boyfriend behind a Wendy's dumpster by the end of the week but, here goes. \n\nThe concentration and lack of diversity in SPY has been increasing and particularly so for the last year and these handful of stocks have carried the market to near all time highs. This must run out of steam at some point as some the charts are looking exhausted on the back of such a moon-shot. For reference, since Jan 1st:\n\n* AAPL +54.26%\n* MSFT +61.23%\n* GOOG +54.07%\n* TSLA +133.18%\n* NVDA +250.25%\n* META +192.10%\n* AMZN +78.27%\n* SPY +20.60%\n* RSP +4.92%\n\nYes they were undervalued at the start of the year but the divergence is now massive between these stocks and the rest of the market. I posit that one of two things will happen:\n\n1. The bull market takes hold and we head to new all time highs with investment coming out of the magnificent 7 as profits are booked and flowing into the rest of the market leading to a closing of the SPY-RSP spread.\n2. We enter a recession at some point next year and safety is sought in defensive stocks as funds move from the magnificent 7 into utilities, healthcare etc. which will narrow the SPY-RSP spread.\n\nIf there were a trade that would profit from either scenario it literally cannot go tits up. This is where pair trading comes in: we short the SPY and buy the RSP based on the thesis that this spread will close. By going long and short we are not gay bears betting against America and we should be able achieve Bill Hwang levels of leverage without being margin called as the one position hedges the other (famous last words). \n\nThis is a low risk trade and may not satisfy the risk appetite of WSB regulars but I'm looking to enter the position in the next week or so with an equal weighted approach (same amount in each instrument and same amount short and long). I think around 25% of my account should suffice for the moment.\n\nKeep it real bitches.", "id": "181gfuk", "created_utc": 1700678695.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|86|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11b1wlt/ecpg_encore_capital/) \n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Short SPY and buy RSP to make bank on the rotation out of the magnificent 7 into the rest of the S&P500.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6011754274368286}, {"body": "This is a good strategy and one I've also considered.
