In a recent chat with Jim Cramer, Vasu Jakkal spilled the beans on how AI is shaping their defense strategy.

She warns of \"unprecedented threat landscape,\" with cybercriminals getting more advanced. Microsoft faces a whopping 4,000 password attacks per second. Are we witnessing a game-changer in the cybersecurity landscape or just another piece of the tech puzzle?\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/microsoft-security-executive-calls-generative-ai-a-super-power.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/microsoft-security-executive-calls-generative-ai-a-super-power.html)", "id": "185kwla", "created_utc": 1701137684.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"body": "Generative AI may help the security analyst but it wont do jack all to help protect anything.  \nNarrow precision AI (aka machine learning) is already part of MSFTs products and it terrible. In the latest Mitre ATT&CK Endpoint Evalutaion Microsoft once again showed how bad they are compared to other players.  \n\n\nChat GPT can help but it wont revolutionize IT security.  \n\n\nAGI  (General AI) might be a different beast but at the moment its fiction and when or if it comes to market we will see the impact is has.  \n\n\nOne thinge we have definately seen is, that any new technology is nearly instantly adapted by the attackers while  the organisations trying to defend are playing catch up.   \n\n\nMicrosoft will have to significantly improve their security offerings otherwise the cyclical nature of security means they will start losing any gained market share starting in 3 years.  \nThey are behind in every catergory of solution compared to competing vendors. Many vendors protect more environments than Microsoft. Some even have more protections for Microsoft environments than Microsoft supports...  \n\n\nNow lets talk \"the autonomous SOC\". The SOC or CDC is the command center where data is analysed for threats and incidents and once discovered responses are coordinated and issued. Threats  are analysed and secruity gaps that are identified then closed. Microsoft currently has many tools that are being used in such a SOC environment. the average SOC uses somewhere between 20-30 different tools for their work. World Class SOC have been observed using 50-100 different tools to do the job.  \n\n\nHere tool consolidation is the game as well as automating as much as possible before a human needs to review. But Microsoft has 9 tools where companies like Palo Alto Networks has issued a product that can do it all in 1, some customers have reportelty 90-95% of automation achieved already.  \nMicrosoft and App-Logic can automate basic tasks but its very labour intensive and only moves the work but does not reduce it. Switching and maintining multiple tool is also a reason manual workloads are high and moreover gaps for security increase with compelxity and many tools deployed/maintained.   \nFurther other Hyperscalers like Google Chronicle are also catching up on a single platform automation first solution, quicker than Microsoft appears to be innovating.  \n\n\nI would not underestimate the ability of Microsoft but I think the sentiment currently is to significanly overestimate their capabilities.   \n\n\nLike a collegue said.

{"title": "CRWD Earnings Alert: Everything you need to know \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25", "selftext": "Yo guys, cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike (CRWD) is scheduled to announce its fiscal third-quarter earnings today, after the market closes. Analysts expect the company\u2019s revenue and EPS for the third quarter (ended July 2023) to increase 33.8% and 84.9% year-over-year to $777.38 million and $0.74, respectively. Moreover, CrowdStrike reported better-than-expected financial results in the last reported quarter. And get this: last time around, these cyber gurus smashed the estimates with a killer Q2, bagging $731.63M in revenue. That's beating the guesswork of $724.44M from the analysts. Straight up crushing last year's $506.20M in Q2 2023. Buckle up, boys, we might see some fireworks! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udcb8\n\nCRWD\u2019s annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 37% year-over-year and reached $2.93 billion as of July 31, 2023, of which $196.20 million was net new ARR added during the quarter.\n\nThe cloud company further reported an adjusted EPS of $0.74. That's not just smashing the street's guess of $0.56, but also up a massive 105.6% from last year's quarter. Talk about leveling up! During the second quarter, these cyber kings raked in a record $245M in cash flow ops and a whopping $189M in free cash. That's what we call making it rain!\n\nBut hold up, it gets better. Importantly, CRWD has an impressive history of delivering strong quarterly performances. The company beat analysts\u2019 earnings expectations for 15 consecutive quarters (fuckin' legendary win streak\ud83d\ude80), signaling they might blast past estimates yet again. Wall Street is very upbeat about the demand backdrop for CrowdStrike, especially with cyberattacks going nuts. Sounds like the cyber world is CRWD's playground, and they're just scoring one win after another. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc40\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike delivered strong growth at scale, exceeding our guidance across both top and bottom line metrics in the second quarter,\u201d said George Kurtz, CRWD\u2019s President, CEO, and Co-Founder.\n\n\u201cThe AI-powered Falcon platform\u2019s native capabilities across our cloud, identity, and next-gen SIEM businesses are unique in the market, in aggregate contributing well over half a billion dollars in ending ARR. Our platform strategy sets us apart from the competition, resulting in high win rates as customers rapidly embrace Falcon to consolidate vendors, lower TCO and achieve better security outcomes,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter earnings topped estimates, CRWD raised its outlook for the full fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company expects revenue to be between $775.40 million and $778 million. Non-GAAP income from operations and net income attributable to CrowdStrike are expected to be $154.40-156.30 million and $179.80-$181.80 million, respectively.\n\nFurther, the cybersecurity company expects non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike common stockholders to be $0.74.\n\nFor the full year 2024, CRWD anticipates its revenue and non-GAAP income from operations to be $3.03-$3.04 billion and $601.30-$610.50 million, respectively. Also, non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike is expected to be $680.50-$689.70 million and $2.80-$2.84 per share, respectively.\n\nShares of CRWD have gained 15.6% over the past month and 41.2% over the past six months to close the last trading session at $210.66. The stock has surged 104% year-to-date.\n\nOkay, but that's all in the past. Here\u2019s what could influence CRWD\u2019s performance in the upcoming months:\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD\u2019s products in the fiscal third quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.\n\nSubscription revenue? Dude, stellar growth that's juicing up the top line big time. Plus, the crew at CRWD's been busy pulling in fresh subscribers like there's no tomorrow, giving their earnings a sweet boost.\n\nAnd get this: CrowdStrike's bromance with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is paying off big. Their products chilling on the AWS platform? Genius move. We're seeing more deals pop off in AWS Marketplace, co-selling shenanigans with the AWS sales gang, and mad love for AWS service integrations. All this is set to turbocharge CRWD's earnings in the quarter we're all eyeing. \ud83d\udcbb\n\n**Positive Recent Developments**\n\nOn November 22, CRWD announced that its AI-powered cybersecurity offering for small and medium businesses (SMBs), CrowdStrike Falcon Go, is officially available on Amazon Business. This marks the first CrowdStrike offering on Amazon\u2019s business-to-business (B2B) store and the broadest dedicated distribution channel for CRWD\u2019s growing SMB offerings to date.\n\nMoreover, this game-changing CRWD offering, CrowdStrike Falcon Go, was launched on November 15. With a few simple clicks, SMBs can quickly and easily deploy industry-leading protection to stop the modern cyberattacks that ineffective antivirus products may miss.\n\n**Robust Financials** \n\nCRWD\u2019s revenue increased 36.7% year-over-year to $731.60 million for the fiscal 2024 second quarter ended July 31, 2023. Its non-GAAP income from operations grew 78.4% from the year-ago value to $155.70 million. Also, non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was $180 million, compared to $85.90 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nFurthermore, non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike per share was $0.74, an increase of 105.6% year-over-year. Net cash generated from operations was $244.80 million, compared to $209.90 in the previous year\u2019s period. Its free cash flow came in at $188.70 million, up 39% year-over-year.\n\n**Favorable Analyst Estimates**\n\nAnalysts are placing their bets high on CRWD, expecting a monster 35.6% year-over-year growth in revenue, hitting $3.04B for the fiscal year ending Jan 2024. And that's not all \u2013 they're predicting EPS to rocket up 83.8% to $2.83. Talk about printing money! Plus, these cyber wizards have been beating the street's guesses on revenue and EPS for the last four quarters straight. They're not just playing the game; they're owning it!\n\nBut wait, there's more! For fiscal 2025, the forecast is looking juicy with revenue and EPS expected to balloon by 28.6% and 24.6% to a whopping $3.91B and $3.53, respectively. CRWD isn't just shooting for the moon; they're on a one-way trip to Mars with these growth numbers! \ud83c\udf0c\n\n**Elevated Valuation**\n\nGet a load of this: CRWD is trading with a forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 74.45x, which is a whopping 224.5% higher than the industry's average of 22.94x. That's not just a lead, that's dominating the whole game! It's up to you to decide if you think this is a good thing or a bad thing. \n\nBut hold up, it gets crazier. CRWD's forward EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA are sitting at a sky-high 15.78x and 65.85x. Compare that to the industry's measly 2.63x and 14.63x, and it's like CRWD's playing chess while everyone else is stuck on checkers.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough to make your head spin, peep this: CRWD's forward Price/Sales and Price/Cash Flow are at 16.55 and 47.27. That's 529.7% and 119.8% higher than the industry averages of 2.63 and 21.51. CRWD isn't just ahead, they're in a whole different league! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Mixed Profitability**\n\ud83d\udd0d Dive into these numbers, folks: CRWD\u2019s trailing-12-month gross profit margin is a juicy 74.04%, crushing the industry average of 48.67% by a massive 52.1%. They're not just playing the game; they're rewriting the rules.\n\nBut wait, there's more: their levered FCF margin over the past 13 months? A whopping 33.44%, which is a mind-blowing 307.8% higher than the industry's 8.20%. CRWD is basically printing cash compared to the rest of the pack.\n\nNow, not all sunshine and rainbows: CRWD's trailing-12-month EBIT margin is in the red at -5.78%, lagging behind the industry's 4.69%. Same story with their net income margin at -3.54%, which is lower than the industry's 1.77%. And when it comes to ROCE, ROTC, and ROTA? They're sitting at -6.10%, -4.08%, and -1.69%, not exactly shining compared to industry averages of 0.80%, 2.60%, and 0.07%.\n\nSo yeah, CRWD is killing it in some areas, but they've still got some homework to do in others. \ud83d\udcda\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nCRWD has moved an average of 8% with earnings. It seems reasonable to grab a CRWD 12/1 220c @ 3.90. You'd need the stock to hit ~224 by Friday to break even, which is about a 5.5% gain. Easy, right? Well, that's what I'm grabbin. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. We have SNOW, OKTA, and DELL this week.

{"title": "The Hot Dog Effect: Unraveling the Global Economic Recession Triggered by CostCo's Price Hike", "selftext": "In the annals of economic history, there are few events as seemingly inconsequential as the rise in the price of a humble hot dog. Yet, in the not-so-distant past, the world found itself plunged into a financial maelstrom as retail giant CostCo decided to increase the cost of its iconic hot dog from $1.49 to $1.99. What transpired was a chain reaction of economic consequences that sent shockwaves across nations, leading to what is now known as \"The Wiener Recession.\"\n\nCostCo, renowned for its reputation as a bastion of affordability and bulk savings, had long been a favorite among consumers. The food court, in particular, was a haven for budget-conscious shoppers, with the $1.49 hot dog holding a special place in the hearts and wallets of millions. However, in an unexpected turn of events, CostCo announced a 50-cent increase in the price of their beloved hot dogs, setting off a series of events that would shape the global economic landscape.\n\nThe impact of the hot dog price hike was swift and profound. Families, once able to enjoy a cost-effective meal, found themselves reassessing their budgets. The streets of towns and cities echoed with the lamentations of consumers who felt the pinch of the extra 50 cents. As the news reverberated globally, financial markets began to react, with stock values plummeting and investor confidence waning. The world had inadvertently become embroiled in an economic crisis, all because of a seemingly trivial increase in the price of a hot dog.\n\nWorld leaders convened emergency meetings to address the burgeoning crisis. Diplomats, economists, and financial experts scratched their heads, attempting to fathom the intricacies of an economic downturn triggered by a hot dog. Analysts debated the potential long-term effects, and nations braced themselves for the impact of what was quickly becoming known as \"The Bun Effect.\" Trade alliances were strained, and international relations became fraught with uncertainty.\n\nIn the midst of this economic turmoil, a grassroots movement emerged. Ordinary citizens, united by a love for affordable hot dogs and an aversion to economic hardship, took to the streets. Social media platforms became battlegrounds for hashtags such as #HotDogRevolt and #SausageSolidarity. Celebrities and influencers lent their voices to the cause, sharing stories of their own hot dog experiences and calling for a return to the days of the $1.49 hot dog.\n\nUnder immense public pressure, CostCo eventually succumbed to the demands of the people. In a dramatic turn of events, the company announced a rollback of the hot dog price to its original $1.49. The world collectively sighed in relief as economies stabilized, stock markets recovered, and the global recession began to recede.\n\nThe hot dog, once a symbol of affordability and simplicity, became an unexpected catalyst for a worldwide economic recession. The events that unfolded highlighted the interconnectedness of global economies and the sometimes surprising triggers that can set them into motion. As nations recovered from \"The Wiener Recession,\" the world learned a valuable lesson about the delicate balance between the cost of living and the stability of economies.", "id": "18693ap", "created_utc": 1701211105.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 11, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|6 years ago\n**Total Comments**|340|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n75ynm/beware_the_index_reconstitution_process/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p86arc/lumn_the_technicals_and_fundamentals_align/) \n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The world was plunged into an economic recession after retail giant CostCo increased the price of its iconic hot dog from $1.49 to $1.99.
