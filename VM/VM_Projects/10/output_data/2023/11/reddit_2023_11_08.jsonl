As other replies tried to explain, you can only be sure of a vertical spread's value vs. the underlying price at expiration. Before expiration, a gain, break-even, or a loss are all possible, for that move. Very, very unlikely to have anything other than a gain, but not impossible. However, if the max profit on the spread is $25, you might only gain $5 on that move, if you are far from expiration. Big moves tend to produce smaller gains the further you are from expiration.\n\nYou can't value a spread by looking at individual leg prices pre-expiration. The spread as a whole has its own market value that can differ from the leg prices somewhat (not too far afield, but a few cents on the dollar is not unusual).\n\nSo basically your premise that vertical spreads are the no-brainer way to exploit an expected move is mostly false. A vertical debit spread's primary use case is when you want to *limit your upfront cost* on an directional move vs. the cost of a single long call or long put. The cost of making the trade cheaper is that you cap your max gain, whereas the single-legged put or call is uncappped.
