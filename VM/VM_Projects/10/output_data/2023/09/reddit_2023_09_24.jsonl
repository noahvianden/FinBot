Collections come. And a lot of this CC debt is on like Macy\u2019s cards or Target cards. Over the summer during the Macy\u2019s earnings call they mentioned how they baked in delinquencies to their budget, but it ended up being way more than they thought. So they had to go to their bank and get the funds to help cover. Maybe that\u2019s nothing, I don\u2019t know. But if it continues, Macy\u2019s ($6bn in debt) might have to really get rid of workers and locations to figure shit out.

With so many people seemingly just opting out of life\u2026 think about all these camps around the country (not even the migrant ones) and hotels filled with homeless and I think even national parks are starting to have permanent residents, not just campers\u2026 is it possible that we\u2019re really not counting the number of unemployed people because they are not counting themselves. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sort of asking. I have a vague recollection of hearing that unemployment numbers only count people for 12 months, after that they are considered non-participants and then not counted.
