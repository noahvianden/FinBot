You can't tell any real results in one month. It could be up 10% a month or down 20% another. Doesn't make you a good or bad investor.  \n\n\n2. If you are \" buying and holding\", why the hell would you sell AMD? Just because it was going down in price? That's buying high and selling low my friend. You'll lose money in the long run. \n\n\n3. You need to know what you're buying, esp with individual stocks. Investing in some company because you \" seen great returns\" is stupid because past results don't determine the future. Understand the earnings, cashflow, revenue, ROIC and most about the company before putting cash in IF you are really about investing and holding. \n\n\n4. If you can't or don't have time to do 3, most would just recommend you to buy the s&p500 ETF or a global ETF, because over LONG PERIODS OF TIME, it usually goes up as seen over decades. That said, it might not go up, because past results don't determine the future. However, because it is spread across 500 companies that have the biggest market cap in the USA market, the risk is quite well spread across diff companies and sectors. \n\n\n5. Lastly, $500 is really not much. Even a 50% drop is like $250. That's the cost of a pretty nice meal. Take the time to learn or just invest in an ETF.\n\nCheers and all the best.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "\"1 month\" does not a \"buy and hold\" period make.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "My intent is to hold on to these.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Then why you sell lol", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "There was insider selling of stocks and some management shakeups.
