{"title": "Are any of these stocks I just bought yesterday good swing trades for the holiday season coming?", "selftext": "I went and looked for a few hundred ticker symbols of mega, large and mid cap - also a few small caps. Saw a few that are either retail or in a space that should do good as the holiday season approaches. Here are a few of them with why I bought: \n\nTGT \\[Target\\] = Target has its problems such as organized theft like most chain stores do. Target also has its base of customers that want to shop there and nowhere else. Looking the last 10 years over it usually performs well between September and January, about 70% of the time (some of its best runs came from fall - late winter). \n\nW \\[Wayfair\\] = Wayfair has its base of customers that are loyal to it. Although it had a boom and bust cycle from 2020 until now due to COVID restrictions going from being a thing to not anymore - I see this stock as a good play for the next 6 months. People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc. \n\nORCL \\[Oralce\\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product. Seems oversold (for those who know about charts - it has a double top). [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d) \n\nNG \\[Novagold Resources Inc.\\] = The price of gold the last few weeks has plummeted 5%, and it has for no reason. A company that I like is NG and they report earnings next week. They have a multiple bottom in their charts for chart people. [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NG&ty=c&p=d&b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NG&ty=c&p=d&b=1) \n\nAMZN \\[Amazon\\] = No explanation needed, it's amazon.
