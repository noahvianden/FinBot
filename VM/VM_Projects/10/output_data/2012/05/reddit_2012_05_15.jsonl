When the housing bubble burst and people were horribly underwater with payments they couldn't meet, they were able to short-sell, default, declare bankruptcy, or just walk away.\n\nYou can't do *any* of that with student loans. You can't default. Period. They are with you forever. If you can't afford to pay your loans, you can literally go down to paying $0 per month, depending on how low your income is because of the flexible repayment options through the federal government. Student loans are designed with the intent of being (relatively) easy to pay for the purpose of not being defaulted on.\n\n\nI don't think the student loan bubble will burst because I don't think it can burst. But I do think that it will cause serious negative ramifications for our country as students have to pay down loans instead of making purchases.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Tell that to Sallie Mae.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34045809507369995}], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Research APOL, DV, STRA, COCO & ITT.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "this.
