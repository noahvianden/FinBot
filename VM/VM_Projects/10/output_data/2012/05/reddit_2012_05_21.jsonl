Wikipedia's explanation isn't quite clear.\nAnd finally, why does VIX seem to be centered around 20-25? Does that value have any intrinsic worth?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "From wikipedia (A common interpretation): \n> The VIX is quoted in percentage points and translates, roughly, to the expected movement in the S&P 500 index over the next 30-day period, which is then annualized. For example, if the VIX is 15, this represents an expected annualized change of 15% over the next 30 days; thus one can infer that the index option markets expect the S&P 500 to move up or down 15%/\u221a12 = 4.33% over the next 30-day period.\n\nIf by trending, you mean, see a steady continuous move in one direction or other then it does occur, but only over short or medium term. Because VIX is the expected annualized change percentage determined by the market, and the market continuously updates itself as it absorbs new information you can start to understand why VIX is somewhat mean reverting. For example, if the market takes a beating for a year (2008-2009) then eventually people start to enter and push prices up.  This is probably why you don't see trending in the long term.\n\nThe VIX does spike (again, look at 2008-2009), but since it is a percentage it cannot go beyond the 100 mark. A key feature of the financial markets is that prices fall much more rapidly than they rise because of panic selling etc. Because of this asymmetry there is higher uncertainty in the markets during sell-offs and this should reflect in the value of VIX.\n\nThe VIX is centered around 20-25 probably because that is what the market believes the annualized returns for S&P 500 is during normal business cycles. When you begin to see recessions, change in business and market sentiment the VIX will go up or down based on it.\n", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Thanks for super information :)", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05656902492046356}, {"body": "Thanks!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05125221610069275}, {"body": "Good stuff, man ", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13767997920513153}, {"body": "Nice explanation.

At this point, you can either cover your short and take the loss or put up more margin and wait for it to eventually converge back to its long-term mean (20).
