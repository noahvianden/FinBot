Should have sold though.  Best thing to do is not even worry about it because the past is the past and you can't let the past influence future decisions.\n\nLook at the average volume for the past two-three years.  The stock simply isn't traded much.  The price now is what the market has determined it as being and it will stay there until something unexpected (to us now) happens again.  Just be ready to pull the trigger to sell when that happens.\n\nIn the future do some research on setting up stop losses so you avoid these types of situations going forward.\n\nAgain, don't even worry about it now though, it's just a waste of time and emotions.
