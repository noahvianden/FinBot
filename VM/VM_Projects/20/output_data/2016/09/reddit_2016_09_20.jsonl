You bought those weeklies on Monday, and the market crashes 5% this week to $202.749. Taking out all time premium since its a faggot's delight (unless market crashes Tuesday, but for the sake of this example fuck time premium cause ITS A FAGGOTS DELIGHT), those contracts are now worth:\n________________________________\n$205 (Our put contracts strike) - $202.749 (Market price of spy) = **$2.251**\n\n$2.251 X 100 (contract = 100 shares) = **$225** per contract\n\n$225 per contract X 18 (contracts you can buy with $200) = \n\n**$4,050** from the $200 BET or,\n**$2,025** from the $100 BET\n________________________________\nJust a few weeks ago, a 5% move from the closing price was around .01 per contract, or a dollar per contract. but now the market is spooked because of hawkish talk so put contracts went up in price.\n\nTo get those .01 contracts you gotta buy the faggot delights on Thursday at the close IF the markets don't move a lot (volatility = options are more valuable), but then your hoping for a 5% movement on Friday (which is extremely rare, statistically)\n\nWhy a 5% movement in 1 week? If you have the gut feeling that the economic world is coming to an end (many doomsayers recently) then a 5% movement in 1 week after the black swan event is very likely.\n \nWe did have a large 1 day movement recently, I think 2 Fridays ago actually. 2.5%?\n\nThat made people betting like this 10x+ baggers.
