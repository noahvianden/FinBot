When something keeps ramping higher and you want it and you can't take it anymore and buy, sometimes you luck out and it keeps going. Often times though, when you get to that point, that's often around when the pullback happens.  It's the opposite of a bad market and you can't take it anymore and just puke up your stocks at the \"point of maximum fuck this I'm out\", which is often not far from a bounce and better opportunity to sell into.

{"title": "It's time to let my DD go out into the world. $AQMS will moon or she will die-lute.", "selftext": "The company is a total game changer for the lead acid battery market, which as you know is in every vehicle and very effective for power banks. AquaMetals developed lead refining technology that uses electricity rather than smelting, cutting the breakeven plant load in half or better, on top of reducing the regulatory permitting costs. Simply put, this technology will be putting smelters out of business, and it will make America great again. Smelters pollute *a lot* and obviously US plants that care to follow the law can't stay in business when certain Asian companies just shit on their peasants. \n\nIt's useful to point out that lead is 99% recycled. It's actually cheaper to recycle than mining ore. When your car battery dies it gets crushed and refined to make new batteries. Lithium can't say the same. \n\nAquaMetals is an American company based in California, and they're **nearing production start** at a brand new refinery out in the desert near the Tesla Gigafactory. Directly across the street from their new refinery is a warehouse full of batteries ready for recycling from one of their business partners. AquaMetals claims their final lead product is actually superior to smelting, and aim to charge a premium for their quality ingots and partner specified alloys. \n\nThe best part, their partners. Ever heard of Interstate Batteries? They're do huge volume, and they own a big stake in AquaMetals. They have warrants for $AQMS at $9 and I believe $7 as well. The warrants at $9 were the reason for the fall from it's ATH. As you can see, it's been floating around $9 but is currently at a \"discount.\" As for \"target\" price, I honestly think if any one of the following catalysts occur, this could easily break ATH within the next two quarters. At this point beyond that is speculation, but they're aiming for a small but significant portion of a multi billion dollar market lead market. I think it's fair to say the sky is the limit with current market cap at $135M. \n\n**The Catalysts:** The first catalyst is anything on [this timeline.](https://i.sli.mg/kdSOUh.png) Production is to begin in early October, and by year end 80 tons lead... I believe that's per day but I'll double check that. The second catalyst is even better than the best part. Companies across the world are lining up to buy AquaMetals refining modules. They intend to protect their IP in making deals with international partners, which literally could be announced at any time and mean buku bucks. The third catalyst of course is they're already planning to use non-diluting financing for a second facility in the US, the location could be announced at any time. \n\nOther stuff: CEO sounds British and is definitely smarter than you. They specifically said they are not interested in further dilution of shares. Company has been hiring like crazy for all the production shifts. For more DD just look up user Cranboor08 on stocktwats and read the articles he's shared I shit you not there's good stuff on stocktwats too. The Sylva capital interview with the CEO is really informative, probably the best DD. There's good articles on seeking alpha as well. I own [this many.](https://i.sli.mg/G5lnCh.png). If this makes hssa money he owes me a pizza. The reason this is down today is obviously because this is a company that will MAGA, so the debate performance is weighing it down to a major technical decision point. Up or down, yolo to find out. At this price, I'm strongly considering picking up a few more. \n\nedit: Bought 23 shares at 8.60 but it's in my RH churn account so I won't hold them very long. The 958 isn't going anywhere.
