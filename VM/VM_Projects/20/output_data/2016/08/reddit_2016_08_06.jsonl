When material news is released, bids and asks can change drastically before any new trades take place causing a large spike or drop in price on very little volume and with no opportunity to get in/out between the last price and the new bid/ask. This can happen any time during the day, but it is much more common in after hours/premarket because most market makers are offline.** \n\nThe easiest way to understand this is to understand how the market works at its core. Really, it's a buy/sell AUCTION. When you place a limit order to buy or sell, what you're doing is placing a bid to buy or an offer to sell, at some price, for some amount of shares. Market makers collect all the bids and offers from throughout the market and match them up taking cuts and playing for their own accounts here and there so that they can make something for their trouble/time. They \"make the market\" in that they handle finding a buyer for the shares you want to sell and a seller for the shares you want to buy.\n\nThat said, when you place a limit order, it will show up on what's called **level 2**. A level 2 screen looks like **[this](http://www.trade2win.com/boards/attachments/technical-analysis/401d1004042517-what-nasdaq-level-2-screen-should-look-like-brcd2.gif)**. In the screen you can see bids on the left and offers on the right at various prices and for various amounts of shares (number next to the price times 100 is the size). The difference between the best bid (in this case $25.49) and the best offer (in this case $25.51) is called the spread. So here the spread is two cents. The thing is, those bids/offers are not yet executed. They can be cancelled, changed to different prices, moved to different market makers, be adjusted to show different sizes, etc. \n\nDuring the trading day (09:30 -16:00 ET) there are hundreds of market makers online showing bids and offers, so there is a lot of liquidity for trading to take place. After 16:00 ET, most market makers shut their systems down and people go home for the evening. Only a few market makers and exchanges stay online during the premarket and aftermarket sessions (4am to 9:30am, and 4pm to 8pm ET respectively, depending on the exchange/MM). Because there are fewer market makers showing bids/offers, the spreads widen. In this case where you see prices at $25.49, $25.46, .44, .43, .41, etc down the bid side, you might see only 100 shares at $25.49 and then 100 more at $24.50. Simultaneously the offers dry up and so the number of shares available on each side at each price is drastically reduced. \n\nNow, enter the earnings news: Because companies usually release earnings and significant corporate news in the pre/post market sessions, the liquidity is very low. People watching the news who may be bidding in this case $25.49, might all of a sudden cancel their bid and move it to $20.00. Then, before any trades take place, the person selling at $25.51 may see the news and the lower bid and think SHIT, I NEED TO GET OUT and drop their offer to $21.00. The bidder at $20.00 then sees this and says I bet I can get it lower, and drops his bid to $17.00, which the seller follows down and places his best offer at $17.50. All of this can happen before any trades take place. Then, when one person finally caves and decides to sell at the best bid, the price will drop from where it last was (say $25.50 in this case) to $17.00 in a single tick. That will cause a panic, and so the chain reaction begins. \n\nBut, to your point: on that first tick down, you're right, there may be ZERO liquidity in between the last price and the new best bid. After the news comes out, if it's bad the best bid might all of a sudden be 30% or 40% lower than the last price executed before the news came out, so when that bid gets hit the price drops 30-40% in a single tick. This is why trading on news is so risky...even though you look at the chart and see the price spike up 50% and think man I could have bought that and made a ton, that will most likely be impossible because the bids/asks change drastically before any trades take place after significant news comes out. This can happen during the day too, though it's not as common since there are more market makers online. This is also the reason that companies will elect to halt trading in their stock temporarily if they need to release material news during the regular hours ... it gives readers of the news time to process it and make intelligent decisions as to what their bids/asks should be rather than panicking without really reading the news which can cause large overreactions in price. \n\nHopefully that clears it up.
