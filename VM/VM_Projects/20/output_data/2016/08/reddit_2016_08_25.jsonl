There are some interesting bets to be made here if you assume the deal will go through:\n\n$22.27 / 0.11 is $202.45, so buying SCTY here is effectively buying TSLA at $202.45, an 8.4% discount.\n\nIf you buy x SCTY shares and short 0.11x TSLA shares then when the deal goes through these positions will cancel each other out and you keep the 8.4% difference.\n\nThe only risk is if the deal doesn't go through or the terms change. Deal's supposed to close in Q4, within 4 months.\n\nIf there are holes in this strategy that I'm not thinking of, I'd love to hear.\n\nNote: The \"if you assume the deal will go through\" is a super important if.
