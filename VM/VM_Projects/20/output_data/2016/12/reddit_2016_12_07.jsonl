By appropriately diversifying their portfolios, investors can reduce risk without reducing their expected return. In that sense, diversification is a \u201cfree lunch\u201d that\nall investors should take advantage of. Despite this benefit, there is much evidence that individual investors fail to diversify\ntheir portfolios adequately. Evidence from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances shows that, for households that held stocks, the median number of stocks held by investors in 2001 was four, and 90% of investors held fewer than ten different stocks.5 Moreover, these investments are often concentrated in stocks of companies that are in the same industry or are geographically close, further limiting the degree of diversification attained. A related\nfinding comes from studying how individuals allocate their retirement savings accounts (401K plans). A study of large plans found that employees invested close to a third of their\nassets in their employer\u2019s own stock.6 These underdiversification results are not unique to U.S. investors: A comprehensive study of Swedish investors documents that approximately one-half of the volatility in investors\u2019 portfolios is due to firm-specific risk.7\nThere are a number of potential explanations for this behavior. One is that investors suffer from a familiarity bias, so that they favor investments in companies they are familiar with.8 Another is that investors have relative wealth concerns and care most about the\nperformance of their portfolio relative to that of their peers. This desire to \u201ckeep up with the Joneses\u201d can lead investors to choose undiversified portfolios that match those of their colleagues or neighbors.9 In any case, this underdiversification is one important piece of evidence that individual investors may choose sub-optimal portfolios.\n\n\n\nSource MBA Corporate Finance book", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "3 weeks trading on Robin Hood $745 in down .11%.
