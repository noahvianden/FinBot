{"title": "Is now the time to get back into Nokia?", "selftext": "Nokia has had an incredible fall from grace over the last 5-10 years. After selling off their smartphone division to Microsoft in 2014, they were unable to re-enter that market until the end of 2016.\n\nAs of late, the stock has dropped to around $4 which is a 52 week low. This is mostly secondary to their reporting expected in their networks business in 2017 due to contraction of the market.\n\nHowever, there are some bright spots on the horizon. They plan to re-enter the smart phone market in 2017 with 2 devices. Although as well all know, competition in that market is ridiculous.\nhttp://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_smartphones_are_coming_in_2017_the_company_confirms-news-21713.php\n\nAlso, their recent purchase of Alcatel-Lucent has them working on the next 5G network.\n\nThey are down and things may get worse in the short term but 2017 could be an upswing for them and this $4 price point looks like an ideal entry.\n\nThoughts on $NOK?", "id": "5dstha", "created_utc": 1479568039.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Nokia actually isn't re-entering smartphones, they just license their brand to HMD Global.
