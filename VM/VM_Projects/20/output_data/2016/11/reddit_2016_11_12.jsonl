Not significantly different from your hypothetical $1150 from an option.\n\nIt's just that you have to put up 739 x 100 = $73,900 for 100 shares of Amazon\n\nversus $350 for an option contract.

If you own a $50 stock, and the price drops $10, you only lose 20%. If you own $49 calls on that stock, you lost 100%. The risks are even more substantial if you're writing naked options. \n\nIt's risky to look at options the way you are. It's not more practical, in that theres a risk of losing your entire investment if you trade them like stocks. Theres far more potential for profit, but also losses. It's worth understanding spreads (essentially buying/selling multiple options) to limit your risk.\n\nA better way to use options is to *limit* your risk. You think stock XYZ is about to go up, but you dont want to buy and watch it fall. You want it anyway for dividends or long term growth or whatever, so you buy calls. If it goes up, you can exercise the calls and get the good price locked in.

I forget the exact number, but I believe that over 90% of options expire worthless or are called back (repurchased by contract writers to remove risk from their premium after the time value of the option has decayed exponentially). \n\nThe other thing that you're missing is that options are used to sell debt.  Very few people get this, but you'll be hard pressed to find a broker that won't tried to push you into a margin account for options.  In fact, margin debt is what gives options more leverage (which is that thing you're pointing out that makes options attractive).  When you assume debt via an margined options purchase, you on-board margin call risk.  You can and will be washed out of your trade well before time decay has a chance to trounce your option's possibility of being in the money.\n\nWhen you combine debt/leverage with the limited time nature of options, you realize very quickly that \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\" and options are no different.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5894213914871216}, {"body": "Basically, you're talking about leverage.
