Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are joint books. An investor call is slated for today at 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nProceeds are for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe new notes will extend the company's cash curve beyond the 5.75% notes due 2024, and 5.875% notes due 2025, which closed on Friday at 110.5, yielding 4.08%, and 112, yielding 4.1%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe 2025s, along with 5.5% notes due 2022, were issued in February and mark the company's last visit to market.\n\nTerms on the B+/B1 transaction were finalized at the middle of guidance after a net $500 million upsizing. The ratings were assigned after a downgrade on the credit by S&P Global Ratings to B+, from BB\u2013, due to an expectation that \"Netflix will incur significant discretionary cash flow deficits over the next several years and that debt leverage will be high during that time.\"\nNetflix is an online provider of films and television programs. The company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker NFLX, with a market capitalization of roughly $54.6 billion. That is almost twice as high a market cap as when it came to market in February. Indeed, its share price rocketed almost 30% in the last month thanks to solid third-quarter results. \u2014 ~~[REDACTED]~~\n\n----\n\nFrom the wire, I'm just a messenger.

This tells me that everyone is expecting huuuge iPhone sales numbers and the Samsung thing is already baked into the price.\n\nI expect AAPL to release good sales numbers but no where near what people are expecting.  Anything less than stellar numbers and this goes down, even if they beat expectations.  I think the type of person that would buy a Note phone would not consider Apple when looking for a replacement.  The iPhone and the Note are two completely different animals.  On the flip side I think people are stupid.  They hear Samsung and exploding phones and run to Apple not understanding that it's just one of Samsung's many models that has issues.\n\nMy point is I don't expect the Note user to buy an iPhone, but I do expect some Samsung users to switch to iPhone out of fear.  I think because of this the iPhone sales numbers won't be as good as everyone thinks.
