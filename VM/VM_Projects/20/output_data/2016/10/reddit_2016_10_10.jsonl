The main focus for this week will be the development between the DOJ and Deutsche Bank, the informal OPEC & non-OPEC meeting in Istanbul, US political developments, and US earnings season. Yellen is also scheduled to speak Friday; although a move in the November meeting is largely off the table, markets are anticipating her thoughts on recent NFP numbers. \n\n**Deutsche Bank pared earlier pre-market losses.** The stock fell 3% in pre-market trading on the report that no settlement was struck between the DOJ and Deutsche Bank executives. It is now at Friday\u2019s close in pre-market trading.\n\n**Russia has signaled willingness to freeze in cooperation with OPEC countries.** Still, there is much to work out between OPEC itself before non-OPEC members agree definitively to a freeze/cut. Iraq\u2019s oil minister Al-Luaibi has called for increasing oil and natural gas production over the weekend, and there are concerns over Libya\u2019s intention to expand production that may undo much of the cuts agreed upon in Algiers.\n\n**Mexican peso is about 1.4% stronger since the weekend**, reflecting the leaked Trump comments and the second presidential debate.

Most expect Q3 to be the sixth consecutive quarter that EPS will fall on a YoY basis. Note that many companies have lowered guidance; history suggests that they lower it more than necessary to later beat expectations.\n\n**TWTR shares down 13% pre-market**, as institutional investors of Salesforce are strongly against the proposed deal to buy Twitter for cash and stock.
