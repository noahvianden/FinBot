{"title": "Twitter DD, or \"why Twitter is a flaming ball of trash and nobody sane will buy them\"", "selftext": "Recently there was a lot of furor surrounding Twitter, which has been attempting to sell itself for quite some time. The most recent bidding round / attempt was earlier this month and did not end well. I have been short the company since the IPO roughly 3 years ago, and have had very bearish expectations on its growth / ability to reach profitability since then as well. \n\nDD link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2lfk5k3-1zNEV1LWd0SXdyVkk\n\nSalesforce was the bidder that stayed in the process the longest, and the one that probably was the most serious about purchasing Twitter, compared to the other guys who basically did it on a whim (Disney lol). Ever since they lost LinkedIn to Microsoft they have been like a crack addict looking for a high in the form of M&A, and really are willing to buy just about anything, except for Twitter apparently. \n\nI used pretty generous assumptions for the model, assuming that Twitter's costs would stay roughly constant and its revenue would grow at a clip of 12%, which is close to street consensus. I used street consensus numbers for Salesforce as well. I don't think at this time Twitter is capable of cutting R&D, G&A, and other expenses to below roughly 70% of revenue within a 2 year period - it sits at a little over 80% right now and Twitter seems to be focused on its user retention issues more than anything else, which I am not sure is actually addressing the problems the company has with making money effectively. I also projected 10% cost synergies given that there is a reasonable overlap of workforce with lots of excess fat to cut, and servers can be cross-used between the two services. Used basically all the cash & equivalents on both sheets except for a very small portion ($400mn pro forma). Using this or leaving it doesn't significantly change the resultant dilution.\n\nSpeaking of dilution, the deal is *highly* dilutive - something like 25% in 2016 and 20% in 2017. This isn't because Salesforce is actually diluting their equity that much, but it's just because Twitter's losing money so fast that any potential synergies can't really make up for its failure as a company. In theory, the deal could be accretive in 2017 if Twitter cut costs considerably (for instance, try changing F71 - F73 in the Twitter tab to 25%, 35%, and 10% from 30%, 40% and 12%), but I don't think this scenario is likely as the company hasn't been able to do this in the past and shows no initiative to cut costs in the present.\n\nMore generally, in tech M&A you are acquiring one of two things: intellectual property (software rights, patents and the like), or data on individuals which you can use to cross-sell. It's unclear if Twitter has either one of these, as the data its collecting is not particularly relevant nor useful for an enterprise software company. I have faith that in the long-term the company will continue to crumble under the weight of its bad business model. \n\nAlso, I don't think earnings later this month will be pretty given the first half of the year but definitely could be wrong on this one as I don't play the earnings that much.
