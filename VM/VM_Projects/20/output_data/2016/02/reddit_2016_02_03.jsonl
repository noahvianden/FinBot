{"title": "Can anyone tell me why Apple isn't a good investment ?", "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI am relatively new to stocks.\n\nI know apple is said to have peaked because their only horse is the iPhone with lower to no growth expected, but I don't really get that as the only argument.\n\nThe stock was at 128 last year and is now at about 87. Still Apple just released record earnings (even if small) and I expect a new high at the end of the year and next year, because:\n\n- a major redesign of iPhones always makes for a more attractive buy for the general public, much more sales than 6s (?)\n- watch has huge potential imo \n- Apple Music performing better than predicted \n\nAlso Apple is said to have a lot of \"war money\" to buy up another company.\n\nSo shouldn't the stock (if all of this hypothetically happens) jump up to at least the amount it was last year ? That would be an insanely good investment.\nShould I wait few months and buy it ?\n\nOr why it is not so likely to rise again ?", "id": "43x6ly", "created_utc": 1454458786.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "**Apple (AAPL)**\n\nCurrent price: $94.48.\n\nOver the past week, AAPL is &#x25BC;-5.51%.\n\nOver the past month, AAPL is &#x25BC;-10.24%.\n\nOver the past year, AAPL is &#x25BC;-19.0%.\n\nCurrent market cap: $523.85B.\n\n*****\n\nBeep Boop, I am a bot.

Their argumentation will also make sense.\nAnd then you'll have people telling you we can't know whether AAPL price will rise or fall in the long term.\nI'm in the 3rd category. I believe that nobody can know whether AAPL will provide a good return in the next 5 years. We can try to guess, sure. But the accuracy won't be better than flipping a coin.\n\nStill, without even knowing about AAPL future return, I can still tell you it's a bad long-term investment.  A long-term investment is not only about potential return. It's also about the likelihood of achieving that return.\n\ngood long-term investment = good potential return x high likelihood of achieving that return.\n\nIn that respect it turns out that AAPL (just like any individual stock really) is a bad long-term investment compared to an index (such as NASDAQ). Simply because stock prices sometimes go to zero... while index prices don't.\n\nYou have better odds (your expected return is higher) if you invest in the index rather than in AAPL.\n\nHaving said that, AAPL could still be a great play for speculation (high risk, high reward trades).

MSFT used to come out with new products, innovative products. Then they entered a long period of minor upgrades that were mostly a rehash of their big innovations.

Mostly they are releasing the the equivalent of Windows ME or Vista. For the most part they are mediocre products that people and companies reluctantly bought. The Apple Watch, the one new product for Tim Cook failed to launch. It sold okay, but mostly people that bought it are seen more as fan boys and girls. Compare the watch to the excitement and buzz that the first Iphone and first Ipad generated. When people saw those things, they HAD to get one. When they see the watch, they yawn and might quietly think, \"what a waste of $500.\" \n\nTLDR: Apple has mostly lost the cool factor and have no new cash cows on the horizon.
