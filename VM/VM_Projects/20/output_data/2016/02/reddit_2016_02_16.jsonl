{"title": "*BREAKING NEWS* - SUNE stock price turns negative. Unprecedented event.", "selftext": "Reuters. February 16, 2016\n\nFollowing a holiday long weekend in the U.S. and broad market volatility over the last few weeks, an unprecedented event has unfolded as SunEdison, trading on the NYSE under the ticker SUNE, has entered negative price territory for its common stock.\n\nAfter sliding from a high of over $30 in the first half of 2015, SUNE closed at $1.42 on Friday, an all-time low for the stock. After markets closed Friday the stock hovered around the $1.40 price after-hours as traders closed out positions and left the office for the long weekend. But on Monday, a bank holiday in the U.S., someone began unloading the stock in droves outside of regular exchanges. Brian Lee, the research analyst from Goldman Sachs covering SUNE, was reached by satellite phone from his Yacht in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI can only say what I\u2019ve seen come across Bloomberg and read online. There was a big seller in Europe on Monday - apparently someone didn\u2019t realize it was a holiday in the U.S. - and they were trying to exit a very large position and kept cutting their price since nobody in the U.S. was bidding. Somehow, rather than have buyers pop up, we had at least three other large sellers start pushing orders out from desks in Asia and Australia. Rumor is that bankruptcy is in the cards and nobody wants to \u2013 and forgive my language but I\u2019m quoting what I\u2019ve read \u2013 \u201cdeal with the shit that keeps on shitting.\u201d In any case, someone started putting out negative bids and they started getting filled. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nReuters has learned, through complex internet backtracing, that the buyer of these trades was a previously unknown North American hedge fund operating as \u201cWSB Yolo Delight LLC.\u201d. While we have not been able to find information on the fund \u2013 almost no documentation exists and they\u2019re not registered in any legal jurisdiction \u2013 we were able to get in touch with one of the senior fund managers. \n\n\u201cYeah, some retard didn\u2019t realize the U.S. market was closed Monday and was trying to unload a lot of stock\u201d said Dick \u201cChainsaw Vasectomy\u201d Pound from Dildo, Newfoundland, Canada. \u201cSome lads and I have talked about starting a long-only fund but our investors keep pulling their money out before we have a chance. They love weekly options. Anyway, I saw these offers for SUNE pop up Monday and with all this talk about negative interest rates, I thought what the hell, I\u2019ll put out a negative bid. Next thing I know, we\u2019re getting filled \u2013 literally being paid to receive SUNE stock.\u201d\n\nMr. Pound said the trades will have to settle during market hours on Tuesday, but the fund is expecting to take on around 10 million shares of SUNE and receive approximately $16 million in cash. He also says they're happy to take more.\n\nMohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, tweeted on Monday night that \u201csome shit was about to go down\u201d and that \u201ceveryone should get the fuck out of the pool,\u201d probably alluding to the trades happening over the course of the day. Reuters is working to determine if the NYSE, and indeed if even any bank systems, can handle negative quotes, but as of publishing has not been able to confirm.\n\n\u201cIndia is getting paid with oil to take oil. Japan and Europe are getting paid to borrow money. Why the fuck can\u2019t we get paid to receive stock?\u201d Mr. Pound said on a follow up call. When asked about WSB\u2019s next move, he said that UWTI, a leveraged oil index fund, was about to go down on him. Elaborating, he said \u201cProbably by the end of this week we\u2019ll be primed to insert from the top and start bidding negative prices for UWTI. We know there\u2019s a risk that other funds start trying to emulate us, but we're not worried. Traditional funds are twigs on the forest floor, while we are a mighty bundle of sticks.\u201d\n\nWith files from Phil McCracken and Ben Dover.\n\n*\\[Disclosure in case you\u2019re retarded: this is satire\\]*", "id": "461jzu", "created_utc": 1455610940.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Jesus Christ can I get a tl;dr? \n\nFuck it I'm putting in some SUNE calls.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "http://imgur.com/nWYOGq3\n", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10427623987197876}, {"body": "you are joking right?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You think this is a fucking game!?", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.228624626994133}, {"body": "Watch this garbage hit $10 by June and u/hurtsdonut becomes a yacht owner.
