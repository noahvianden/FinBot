{"title": "Amazon's business model for retail sales", "selftext": "For those of you that are watching AMZN, be aware of how they handle sellers on their website.  If you sell a fairly large volume of a particular item substantially below the typical retail price.  Amazon will request that you provide invoices of that product that you sell in the website.  They will claim the purpose is to verify you are not selling bootleg items, but in reality, they will contact the distributor you are using and offer to buy all their future inventory and then sell online for MRSP.  This is good for Buyers, but it destroys sellers who have spent a lot of effort searching for distributors and arranging to sell product, considerably below the typical retail price.", "id": "4cm157", "created_utc": 1459361833.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "ALL IN ON $AMZN", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12748709321022034}, {"body": "Pretty sure this entire statement is patently false. \nInvoices are requested if the seller wants to offer products in a \"gated\" category such as grocery, DVDs,  or health and personal care - or if reports/complaints are sent from customers regarding the authenticity of an item they received. \nAmazon is not out to get sellers... \n", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "This statement is not false.  I could give very specific details, but I do not want to out the Seller.  I had a Seller that was buying product from a local major Company warehouse.  These were considered seconds because the packaging was off or the product color did not meet the Quality Control tolerances.  The product was fully functional, however.   As a result, they were able to buy below wholesale and sell at wholesale, below the price Amazon could buy and sell for a profit.  After asking for a copy of the invoice to prove, these products was not bootleg, Amazon went to the local warehouse and signed an exclusive agreement to buy all the product available.  Then Amazon blocked the Seller from selling any more of that product line and sold the product at full MRSP.  This Seller has had about ten products he was selling like this.  One example I can disclose because there were a lot of Sellers, were new Disney movie releases.  Sellers could buy at wholesale and sell below retail and still make a good profit.  They went in signed an exclusive agreement with the distributor, blocked any Sales from all sellers, and now sell for a substantial profit.  You could call that a \"good business step\" by Amazon, but it destroys sellers that may have spent years developing good contacts and contracts.  Amazon doesn't care how many of the Sellers who made them who they are, are driven out of business.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Great, now we have to buy tampons in off-color packaging.
