{"title": "A Newbies Diary", "selftext": "This is my story. I am not here asking for advice. I know that what I am doing is probably stupid but I lack the knowledge to make educated buys/sells however my desire to participate in the market is stronger than my fear of losing money. I have decided that I will get my education in the process of making/losing money as I go.\n\n \n\nI am new to trading stocks so I did not know anything about it. Absolutely nothing. My early lessons were lessons I felt I should have already known about or considered before making my first purchases, yet I did not hesitate and just went bravely into the darkness with my embarrassingly small amount of money.  \n  \n  \nI opened an account at Ameritrade with $1,000 with the idea that if I lose it I wouldnt suffer from it. I decided I would spread it out a bit because I hear people use the word diversify quite liberally. Well, when you have a small amount of money that didnt work out very well. Making 5% on $400 just seemed so pointless. So I decided to craft my own little strategy to see how I could do with rapid turnaround trading. Here is what I did.  \n  \n  \nStep 1: Sell all of my stocks regardless of gains or losses and work with my entire cash fund as my weapon.\n  \n  \nStep 2: Create a watch list of large companies that have been around for a long time and were established. I felt this would insulate me from losing my money to bankruptcy or just closing the doors for financial reasons. I ended up with a list compiled of companies like Intel, Microsoft, General Electric, Amazon, Qualcomm and well, you get the idea.  \n  \n  \nStep 3: Watch the stocks for a couple of weeks and get a feel for where the stocks seemed to hover so that I could recognize the ups and downs to help me determine if it was a target for recovery.  \n  \n  \nStep 4: Wait for a stock to lose more than 5% of it value in 1 day due to bad news or no reason at all. Once one was identified, I would look for news that might explain the loss in value. If it didn't look catastrophic, I would buy it and sit and wait for recovery. My goal was to make 5% on each trade and get out after. I figured if I can make 5% on every trade my money would grow rather quickly if I was trading several times per week.  \n  \n  \nI had some great luck with this but 5% of $1000 wasn't enough, so I moved another $2000 into the account and started trading with a larger cash base.  \n  \n  \nI started doing this 6 weeks ago, and have now turned my 3K into 4k rather easily. Each time I do this, the profits are bigger because my initial buy in is bigger. I have done this with Twitter, Wal Mart, Bank Americorp, Intel and other stocks of similar size and value.  \n  \n  \nTo trade stocks this way, I had to apply for margin tradin with Ameritrade so that I could repurchase stocks immediately after selling. Waiting 3 business days for my trade to finalize was killing me. As long as I do not use more money than my previous trade was worth, I pay 0 interest.  \n  \n  \nI do know that I am only getting lucky because my strategy is that of a moron, but I am having a blast. I wanted to trade stocks but had no knowledge of it, and this is my 6 week success story.

I forgot to mention how i handle this. I only buy a stock if I have some confidence that it is going to rebound. I have no guarantee that it will rebound right after I buy it.

My goal is to make 5% but if it has momentum I will ride it. However, once I get my 5% I do not let the market close with me still holding it (this has cost me some money as well). The important thing to mention is, I have the stomach to be down and not panic. As I said in the beginning, I started with an amount of money that I could lose without it costing me sleep or stressing me out.  \n \nAs an example, one stock I watch and have bought more than once (both times have been very good to me) is CRC which I started watching when it was around 50 cents per share. I have made my biggest gains on this stock, once making almost 20% in 1 day. It has been going up this week so I have been watching for a crash, which is happening right now. I told myself if it dropped below 1.50 I would get it, but it is so close to closing I am not sure I want to be holding this stock over the weekend. I am in the process now of making a decision.  \n \nI like this stock because it seems to be consistent in its roller coaster, and trades in high volume. My hunch is, there are lots of people buying and selling this stock just based off of it performance over the past month and has very little to do with the financial outlook of the company or anything that could be considered sound investment advice.  \n \nThe CFO bought 8,000 shares at 1.38 which is where I bought it the last time I got in. That's sort of my mark of where the value is, so I just work from there.  \n \nAnd, damnit, it recovered 5% at the end of the day and I missed it because I didn't want to be caught holding it over the weekend.
