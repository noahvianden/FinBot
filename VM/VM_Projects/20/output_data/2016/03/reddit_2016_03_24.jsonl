AMD and NVDA pushing hard for VR stuff and working with it.\n\nIntel is debating ending it's GPU partnership with NVDA and moving to AMD.\n\nCouple the two together and playing on the potential bump come Tues due to the Rift (And then in another week or so for Vive) and it's potentially people trying to secure a low(er) price for what they hope is a ride into the Rift and Vive.\n\nIf it were an investment position, they'd also be trying to get in prior to the bump the Rift or Vive might give for the the possible Intel x AMD GPU deal.\n\nAlso, Sony is rumoured to be releasing a PS4 remodel (Likely just a smaller form factor of the current PS4 AKA PS4 Slim) which might use a refactored version of the AMD chips inside of it, thus giving a potential boost as well...\n\nSo there you go, 4 potential reasons AMD just took a nice bump. 2 long term investing reasons, 1 short term yolo reason, and 1 wsb long term yolo reason. Mix and match any of those\n\nNote: There's also the new GPU launching this year, so from an investment standpoint, there are 3 solid reasons to try and bank on them.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "And shorts covering.
