It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*\n\nValeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 19, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.\n\nWhen I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.\n\nIt is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&region=usa&culture=en-US&HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.\n\n### Thesis\nMy position is to buy before the catalysts. Once catalysts [mentioned here in Part 1: The Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4fbqyd/part_1_valeant_vrx_due_diligence_and_analysis/) start to happen, uncertainty will be removed. When uncertainty is removed through management changes, realignments of strategy, asset sales, cost cutting, etc., a depressed stock can have significant upward pressure.\n\n###Valeant Pharmaceuticals International\n###Due Diligence, Installment 2\n###*2015-2016: Lots of Investors Balking in Little Time*\n\n####**Five Big Catalysts for the Stock's Plunge**\n\nBetween 2015-2016, the stock plunged from $262/share (August 2015) to $33/share, where it is today (April 2016). That's an almost 90% loss. Morningstar's analyst, Michael Waterhouse, says [the stock's fair market value](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&culture=en-US&region=usa&HID=QUO_STK104) is worth $115/share. What happened?\n\nThere are many catalysts that seem to have happened at the same time to drop the price of the stock. Here are a few of the big ones that are often most discussed by journalists and bloggers.\n\nAs the thesis goes, when these catalysts have played themselves out and/or public opinion becomes disinterested, uncertainty is removed. When uncertainty is removed, VRX could have significant upward pressure.\n\n**Reason 1: Pearson, Canny or Just Clueless?**\n\nValeant CEO J. Michael Pearson, as a result of his previous superstar performance, 2008-2014, was slow to fall out of favor with management. However, after [unplanned margin call stock sales to support his lifestyle](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), publicity about [donating to charities but never paying](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), and a [disastrous earnings and guidance call in March](http://www.fiercepharma.com/financials/activist-ackman-vows-to-intervene-after-disastrous-day-at-valeant), among other things, Pearson burned through investor patience quickly.\n\n*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should know that the people who have invested previously are angry at the outgoing bad management for the volatility and will tend to be negative about management until less volatility in management and less volatility in results can be delivered.\n\nWe'll cover Pearson in a bit.\n\n**Reason 2: Martin Shkreli Goes Viral**\n\nShkreli was an employee of television host [Jim Cramer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer) old firm [Cramer, Berkowitz, and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Career) when he first caught the ire of the SEC for shorting biotech. He began a pharma portfolio company in 2011, [Retrophin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Retrophin), though was fired in 2014 and began the now-infamous Turing Pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn 2015, Shkreli went viral as the pharma exec who acquired and boosted the price of an HIV drug, Daraprim, by more than 5,556%. Going viral for raising the price of a drug launched him into the public eye and put him at the center of the American Healthcare Proxy Fight, described below, which then sucked in Valeant along with him.\n\nShkreli went from being unknown to being the [\"most hated man in America\"](http://qz.com/576554/martin-shkreli-the-ceo-who-jacked-up-prices-on-an-hiv-drug-was-arrested-this-morning/). In some ways, his own actions made this worse. When brought before a Congressional Hearing, Shkreli pleaded the fifth and tweeted that [politicians are imbeciles](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/04/martin-shkreli-congressional-testimony-turing-pharmaceuticals-valeant-fda-drug-prices/79808004/).\n\nThe most remarkable thing about Shkreli, despite all of the bad press about him, is that he has a growing fan base. His self-produced YouTube channels [featuring him doing tutorials in finance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gjB1PSXv_oAUSAQ16S0fA/videos) have earned him praise. \n\nShkreli has tweaked his media image, eventually coming to the conclusion that being transparent and accessible to the public through these tutorials could begin to change public opinion. His students may not all understand the business of pharma like he does, but they do get an understanding of the person behind the media. \n\n*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should pay attention to how quickly public opinion can change through transparency.\n\n**Reason 3: Ongoing American Healthcare Proxy Fight**\n\nThe American healthcare system is arguably in need of a lot of help. The affordability of healthcare for aging Baby Boomers has been a critical issue for years. On the other end of the age spectrum, struggling younger people (Millennials, Generation X) want reform because their expenses are also very high. The game involves a lot of power changing hands between a lot of powerful people, so it is no surprise that, aside from [Obamacare](https://www.healthcare.gov/), little progress has been made in decades.\n\nThis battle has been raging for a half century, and is often used as a [proxy fight](\nhttp://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/8082-the-healthcare-battle-will-be-a-proxy-fight-of-divisions-in-american-politics) for stakeholders behind the scenes. Political parties, corporations, and everyone with a stake in how healthcare is regulated are all involved, and things get very dirty very quickly when public opinion is stoked.\n\nA typical scenario is that politicians try to tackle the problem [through the use of public shame](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/04/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-faces-congress-today-but-pledges-silence/) of CEOs or companies to influence public opinion, as a sort of substitute for actually working together and introducing legislation to fix the system. \n\nIn contrast, Big Pharma fights back by influencing public opinion that government bureaucrats will only make things a lot worse and hinder improvements. One famous example was when then-First Lady Hillary Clinton [fought for healthcare reform in the 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) and was subject to significant amounts of lambasting in the media by the pharma industry with [year-round television advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_and_Louise).\n\nThe point being, while the amount of outrage present during election years is often higher than normal, this fight has been going on for a very long time and occasionally flares up.\n\n*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should understand that anger at American pharma tends to be cyclical -- a proxy war between two powerful factions -- and the public loses interest quickly once actual details emerge.\n\n**Reason 4: An American Presidential Election**\n\nAs a side note to American Healthcare, there is an American presidential election happening currently. Politicians have been using [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism), including outrage at established industries by candidates Trump and Sanders, as part of their platform.\n\nDespite Hillary Clinton's favorable reception with Wall Street ([Wall Street believes she will be the next president](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/06/wall-st-is-pretty-certain-who-will-be-president.html)), Mrs. Clinton [singled out Valeant](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fff89b8e-c922-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html) because the price of the drug dihydroergotamine had risen 356%.\n\n*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the American presidential election will dominate the headlines until November 2016, and pharma is an easy target for politicians.\n\n**Reason 5: 'Perfect Storm' of Balking**\n\nWhen there is uncertainty in a company, the stock drops as investors balk and pull their money from the shares. As we continue on, it is worth noting that it doesn't matter what the actual story is:\n\n- Anytime a company acquires significant debt, investors balk.\n- Anytime accounting irregularities are even *mentioned*, investors balk. \n- Anytime an insider dumps a lot of shares, investors balk.\n- Anytime management is suspected of having problems behind the scenes, investors balk. \n- Anytime management doesn't acknowledge something that appears real to the average investor, investors balk.\n\nIn the story of Valeant, there was a lot of balking going on in a very short amount of time, and that cumulative uncertainty dropped the stock.\n\n*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the nervousness and volatility around the company comes from balking so much in such a short amount of time.\n\n####**Pearson Goes Off the Deep End**\n\nLess than two years ago, Valeant's CEO, J. Michael Pearson, was an absolute superstar. Valeant had [returned in excess of 2,300%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Pearson#Career) since 2008. Yet, as the saying goes, a CEO is only as good as his or her last quarter. Pearson's downfall is often attributed to that superstar status becoming a little sloppy, a little arrogant, and a little distracted because of health issues. This led to a loss of control.\n\nI've read a number of things condemning his lifestyle, his management, his compensation. A lot of it is overly negative and probably not true. We know he was absent for a while and hospitalized with pneumonia. We know he was in the wrong position at the wrong place during the wrong time when Martin Skreli was taunting the public. We know he likely approved using mail-order pharmacy Philidor to steer its customers toward more expensive, Valeant-made drugs. It could be anything or everything that made investor sentiment turn against him.\n\n**The Superstar Gets Sloppy**\n\nWhat's clear is Pearson was off his game. He started to buy things he couldn't afford. He would make donations to nonprofit foundations he couldn't actually pay for. He bought hi-rise real estate in Miami with money he didn't have. He would try to do things publicly to \"juice\" Valeant shares to try to get more money.\n\nOne lifestyle issue that ended up dropping the stock was when Pearson was borrowing money (\"buying on margin\") and buying Valeant stock circa October, 2015. As anyone who has ever done this knows, this goes well until the stock sinks. When the stock drops beyond a certain point, the broker will perform a \"margin call\" and the investor must pay cash.\n\nGoldman Sachs issued a margin call on his stock holdings in October, 2015. Pearson couldn't pay. When the client cannot pay, the broker sells stock to pay. However, as the CEO of a public company, this selloff would be broadcast for everyone to see.\n\nUnable to pay the margin call, to take payment [Goldman Sachs forcibly liquidated 1.3 million of his shares](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65). In the insider activity log, in fact, you can see where all this happened. [Pearson's shares were sold and things got real really quick](\nhttp://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/insider-activity.action?t=VRX&region=usa&culture=en-US).\n\nFor a public company to have the CEO randomly selloff over a million shares, there's going to be repercussions and a shock to the system. Investors balk, asking, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n####**The CFO and Philidor**\n\nA significant item of uncertainty swirls around the use of a mail-order pharmacy to fill prescriptions, [Philidor](http://www.philidorrxservices.com/). That relationship apparently made things complicated enough that Valeant's Annual Reports were delayed. As far as I can figure out, CFO Howard Schiller and possibly Pearson allowed Valeant to partner with Philidor for some prescriptions. It was Schiller, however, who ultimately took the heat for it and was fired.\n\nThe whole thing seems to have started out as an experiment where Valeant lent employees to Philidor for support. Eventually, things became too close, and Philidor started steering its customers away from cheaper generics and toward the more expensive Valeant brands.\n\nIt is worth noting that in some countries, particularly ones where the quality of generics is not trusted, this practice is acceptable. However, in American culture, this constitutes a conflict of interest in the public eye. Pharmacies should remain neutral.\n\n**Philidor Dumped, Walgreen's Brought In**\n\nThis relationship was dropped in October last year after Martin Shkreli's story went viral and Valeant was launched into the public eye. A more proper (and palatable) relationship with a more traditional drug retailer, Walgreen's (Walgreens Boots Alliance ($WBA)), was formed.\n\nValeant threw Schiller under the bus publicly for the whole thing. Less so for the actual concept and more so because some of Valeant's deals had started to involve Schiller making decisions that were outside the realm of what he should have been making. Valeant says, generically, that he was fired for \"inappropriate conduct\". The CFO may have [had a conflict of interest](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-21/valeant-s-schiller-says-company-incorrect-about-conduct), but Schiller strongly denies any wrongdoing.\n\nDuring the most recent earnings call, Pearson said that it is more important to move forward, noting that [\"well over 90% of our doctors who [were] using Philidor are now using Walgreen's\"](http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/call-transcript.aspx?StoryId=3958769&Title=valeant-pharmaceuticals-vrx-ceo-michael-pearson-on-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript).\n\n####**Firing the Superstar**\n\nOn March 21, 2016, the Board announced the final decision that Pearson, regardless of his legendary status in making the company what it had become, would be fired.\n\nAt this point, Pearson overplayed his hand, creating more volatility for the stock and uncertainty: [he wouldn't leave](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/with-board-member-who-won-t-leave-valeant-is-at-mercy-of-bylaws). When that news was released, blogs were posting that the company was at the mercy of a rogue, out-of-control CEO.\n\nIt ultimately backfired for Pearson, because not only did he eventually lose his job, [he has been called to do a Congressional Hearing about raising the prices of pharmaceuticals](http://fortune.com/2016/03/28/valeants-ceo-testify-u-s-congressional-hearing/).\n\nThus, the Board (and by extension, the investors) eventually won. Pearson acquiesced and agreed to leave after a new CEO could be found.\n\nLegendary hedge fund manager and shareholder activist Bill Ackman [took the CFO Schiller's place on the Board](http://www.valeant.com/about/board-of-directors), where he is today, becoming an active investor instead of a purely passive investor. Ackman will be discussed in the next installment.\n\n*Takeaway:* Investors are betting that if the company can function reasonably with such volatile management, what it can do with good or even great management could be impressive.\n\n####**Tomorrow: The Turnaround**\nThere has been a lot of discussion around legendary hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and how he bet a billion dollars on Valeant, rode it to the bottom, and will now turn it around. We will cover who he is, where he's going, and why this may be his best performance yet.\n", "id": "4fhoda", "created_utc": 1461074143.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for the post.
