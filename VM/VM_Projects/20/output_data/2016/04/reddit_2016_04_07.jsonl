{"title": "Today's Trade", "selftext": "I closed my VRX calls for a nice gain today.. may have left some money on the table but gains are gains. Next up for today is NFLX.\n\nI bought May 20 $105 puts @ $8.45 for NFLX today. The last week has seen major buying at the open which has the look of institutions re-allocating fund this quarter only to get slammed down to $104 and then bounce between $104 and $105. The last 3 days has seen heavy selling at the $105 mark and that looks to be the ceiling to me. I'm expecting over the next few days as the morning ramps dissappear from funds no longer buying this up in the morning that the sellers will continue to take it down. With earnings coming up NFLX is now in buy back black out period so there shouldn't be any surprise up days. I think over the next few days this stock sheds a few a percent heading into earnings next week and intend on selling my puts before they announce next Friday.
