{"title": "How much skin does $Googl have in Pokemon Go", "selftext": "These are dots people have already connected, but I haven't heard any discussion from an investment standpoint. Pokemon is a brand owned by Nintendo (up 70% in 5 trading days) since release. However, the game itself was developed by Niantic Labs. The game is described as \"part owned\" by Nintendo.\n\nHow much is part owned, who owns the other portion? The only logical conclusion is Niantic owns some if not the remaining portion of the rights to the game. \n\nWho owns Niantic? They were an internal Google start up until 2015 when they were spun out as their own company. However, I haven't read any details as to the ownership. Is Google still the majority owner of Niantic labs?\n\nIf Google still owns Niantic and Niantic owns at least part of Pokemon Go, how much skin does Google have in Pokemon Go?\n\nThe game is worth roughly 18bn in market cap to Nintendo, is it worth anything to Google?", "id": "4tf22o", "created_utc": 1468846502.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Just for clarification, Pok\u00e9mon isn't really owned exclusively by Nintendo per se -- the licensing and marketing of Pok\u00e9mon is done by The Pok\u00e9mon Company which is jointly owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.  \n  \nAs for Niantic, Google doesn't have any direct ownership of the company but they have invested some money since Niantic spun off from them.
