{"title": "[Need Advice] Bought AAPL puts, up but not sure if I should hold.", "selftext": "About a week ago I purchased 50 AAPL puts @ 95 strike expiring 3nd Fri of August for the earnings call this Tuesday.\n\nCurrently, I'm up about 40% on the trade.\n\nI'm really unsure if I should sell the AAPL puts on Monday when IV rises further and take the profit, or if I want to risk holding. If I do hold, I was planning to sell 50 AAPL puts @ ~91 strike to try to hedge and mitigate the losses if AAPL remains flat or rises after earnings to deal with the IV crush.\n\nSeems like the greedier play to hold the puts, however. I think walking away with a 40-50% gain on the trade is quite good since I'm pocketing a good profit but I also realize that if earnings or guidance falls short of expectations, AAPL can easily fall below the 95 strike by the expiration and I will make a killing + collect on the IV crush of the options I sold (less some black swan happens and AAPL tanks > 10% which is highly unlikely). I was expecting that if AAPL does fall, it should be somewhere around $93 in 1-2 weeks. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation? Sell and walk away or hold and hedge with the credit spread? \n\nIf I'm correct, holding could potentially net a 100-250% gain, or a potential 10-40% loss if things go against me. \n\nThis is reminiscent of the time I got destroyed by holding through the brexit vote when I went long GBP... I'm still hurting from that loss, so I really want to sell... If anything, I could pawn off maybe 50-75% of my positions and hold a small portion, but I'm really not sure at this point. Pretty hard call to make. \n\nAny experienced traders please chime in. I think it's the novice mistake to hold and not take the gains when they're right in front of me and face the very real risk of losing it all... But I'm also such a greedy bastard HAHAHAHA. Earnings estimates from the street are actually pretty horrible, last quarter was ~1.97 EPS, and I believe this quarter the projections are ~1.40 EPS, so it's very possible that AAPL can outperform when the projections are so low. \n\nEdit: After reading through the comments, I've decided I'm going to sell somewhere around 70% of the holdings to secure profits Monday then sell a credit spread on the remaining positions, this way I've calculated if the position remains neutral/bullish I can still walk away with a very small profit of around 5-10%, and if I'm correct I still make a decent profit totaling ~60-100% of what I put in.\n\nWith that said, no chance for monster gains of 250%... But this is definitely the smarter play.
