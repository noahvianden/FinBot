Look at what happened to WorldCom and global crossing. Look at the historical shares outstanding for TSLA.

He's almost accomplished that. He's done so while producing only electric vehicles in an already extremely rough market. Think about what his ultimate plans are and then think about how much capital would be needed to achieve those goals. Think about the forest, not just the trees. Its a fuckton. It makes sense that hes had to whore himself out. The fact that were 2 years away from a 35k electric tesla car is astonishing as it is. If production was cut this quarter to make gains in the next half of the year, I see him coming within 5-7% of his goal at worst. After that, if production continues to expand as it has been, it should be relatively smooth sailing. Fixing leaks, trying to make a profit. All that being said, I think a lot of expectations are already priced in. I also think his cult of personality can be dangerous to his ego, companies and shareholders. He sets goals that are almost too ambitious to be achieved. Space x is a great example of a company with high goals operating efficiently. Solar city is a great example of a company with high goals that is not succeeding. The main thing to gather is, he is into incredibly edgy, new, frontier-type companies and goals. These are inherently risky. Ultimately I do believe tesla will succeed. Idk if I'd buy shares right now though.
