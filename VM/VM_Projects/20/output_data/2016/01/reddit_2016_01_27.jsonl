{"title": "Request: Knowing when to cut your losses (AAPL, GPRO, TSLA)", "selftext": "Hey guys. At the risk of being ridiculed for obviously inexperienced and reactionary buying, I need to ask your advice. Around the beginning of summer I bought into 3 very volatile stocks while they were... not prime for buying. Essentially, I bought into GPRO AAPL and TSLA all as they were doing really well. As you are probably aware, they are all 3 not doing as well as I'd hoped.\n\n Fortunately, I invested the least in GPRO and have chalked that up to a loss. AAPL and TSLA though I'm concerned with - they are down 28% and 24% respectively since I bought in at $130 and $247 respectively.\n\nI've heard you don't lose money until you sell but... damn this is getting hard to watch.

I worry about Apple because I am just unsure if they will have another global phenomenon product to build upon and push the share price up. However, i do think the share price will likely return to around what i paid for it somewhere within the next 2/3 years, unless they really start to stagnate or become less competitve. For me, I spread my portfolio across 13 different companies, and whilst Apple is one of my larger holdings, I feel that it is worth riding it out as a learning process as i don\u2019t immediately need that cash.\n\nI know that doesn\u2019t answer your question, because quite frankly i am not knowledgeable enough to answer it, but if you have a similar outlook for holding stock for a long time then you may want to go along for the ride for the experience and the learning.\n\nEither that, or pick a price that you are not willing to go below and sell at that price.
