Thousands of workers are being laid off left and right. Commodities are in insane oversupply, too; check out BTU (which did a reverse-split to stay afloat, mind you), X and MT, SDOC (which used to be SD until oil plunged so much it basically died), UPL, DNR, CHK, RIG, AA, and many more.\n\nGrowth is slowing across thousands of companies; the entire market is being propped up only by a few giants, really.
