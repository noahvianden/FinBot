The gtx 970 reks everyone, and amd makes zero money on cards below the r9 price range.\n\n2. I dont need to know. 1,67 x (profit margin of cards) = 1,67(Profit) no matter what. Their general profit margins can actually only go up, as their revenue goes up, while r&d decreases, management stays the same, and other expenses dont change much. So the profit from the cards are larger in the relation to their expenses.\n\n3. Read their report.
