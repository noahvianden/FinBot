", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">haha that \"one big vix spike\" is why I just got a 46 september put on svxy. if we can spike to 20 once in this time period I will be paid off pretty nice\n\n...Maybe.   If volatility stays low, SVXY could easily be in the 70s in a month or two.  46 September puts are $3.50 right now.  If you get too close to september, you're going to need SVXY to be at 42.50 or lower. I think it's going to take a VIX spike quite a bit higher than 20 for that to happen, and the longer the spike takes to show up, the bigger the spike will have to be, since SVXY will be gaining rapidly until then. \n\n>The futures curve are you referring to looking at vix spot and the vix futures contract in 1 month ?\n\n2 months.  SVXY tracks short-term futures, which tracks a rolling 2 month contracts. (http://us.spindices.com/indices/strategy/sp-500-vix-short-term-index-mcap)   The ones currently in play are June and July.  These are VXM16 (trading at 15.4) and VXN16 (trading at 17.6), respectively.  Spot VIX  is currently ~13.  The current composition of the short-term futures index (M1+M2 weights) has the index trading almost 30% above spot VIX.  \n\nThis means if realized volatility stays low for the next two months, SVXY should be up about 30%.  Even with some room for error and a few little spikes on VIX, you can imagine SVXY gaining a solid 25% in the next couple of months, which would bring it north of $75. If a VIX spike above 20 happens *after* SVXY hits the high 70s, then it won't drop SVXY to the 40s.  It a VIX spike happens *before*, then it might, although I still think it'd have to be a pretty big spike because it would have to be sufficient to change the back month (currently July) future as well.  In other words: if the VIX spikes to 20 but then immediately calms down, SVXY won't drop much.  If the market expects the spike to persist for a couple months, then SVXY will drop more, but it still might not drop the mid 40s, which is where you need it to get to be profitable.   In other words: be careful. \n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29019787907600403}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "That isn't spot, that's derivative trading.
