{"title": "NVDA ain't over yet", "selftext": "That was just the response to the good ER. Starting next week, the GTX 1080 will go on sale, a processing unit that doubled the performance of its predecessor. There is no way that the competitor (AMD) will be able to beat its performance any time soon. The more interesting part is not the GTX 1080, but the GTX 1070 which sells at $370, a more than fair price for most PC gamers considering GPUs of equivalent performance currently cost $1000. Nvidia will still be able to make profit off these models as they have gone the cheap route on a few features such as the VRAM. I really doubt that this will fall back to $35 unless the Chinese shit the bed again so you might as well plan ahead accordingly for the next ER which will be far far bigger than anything before that.\n\nCheers.", "id": "4jaa4b", "created_utc": 1463205273.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Shits priced in son.
