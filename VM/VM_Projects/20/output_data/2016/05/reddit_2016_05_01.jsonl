No market crashes occur if everyone is investing money they don't need.  \n1929 was based on margin debt (90% in some cases).  Drops in stock prices caused margin calls, which in turn caused people to sell stock to cover their debts, causing more drops in stock prices, causing more margin calls...\nThis was eventually exacerbated by the Fed not covering banks that were short from all the fire sales.\n\n2008 was not much different.  People used their houses as ATMs and financial institutions relied on rising prices to keep their ponzi scheme of MBS going.  When they didn't, people defaulted, MBSes defaulted (CDOs, etc), major institutions were on the hook to make up the difference and they could not.\n\nWhat will cause the next one?\nOil might.  When oil was over $100, people were paying big money (Hi-yield) to exploration.  Now at $40 all those are hemorrhaging.\nChina might.  Chinese were absorbing all those cheap wage jobs with dollars and then buying real estate in China and the US as well as gold and such.  What happens if China runs out of cheap labor?  And yes there is Demographic data that says that the 1 child policy is causing such a shift in China.  If so, manufacturing expenses skyrocket and factories will look elsewhere for labor.  Chinese sell what they bought to live (gee what happens when even a fraction of a Billion+ people start selling everything...).\n\nOr not.  :)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5976254940032959}, {"body": "Another wave of China's devaluation, Japan collapse, mass exit from Euro by countries following Britain.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Britain never switched to the Euro.
