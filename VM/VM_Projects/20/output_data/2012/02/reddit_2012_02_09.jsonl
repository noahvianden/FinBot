{"title": "Thoughts on Pump and Dumps?", "selftext": "I am a college student looking to get rich(aren't we all?).  When I initially started investing, with incredibly little knowledge, I fell into the pit of pump and dumps.  I was sucked in and turned my initial $7k into $10k in about two weeks.  I was on top of the world.  About two days later it tanked and I was left with about $5k.  I have since built up my portfolio by investing in large 'real' companies (go aapl) and have climbed back into the green.  \n\nMy question- Are pump and dumps a viable way to make some decent cash?  I was following one that doubled over a few weeks and then tanked.  Do you think that it is reasonable to time these suckers and make it work for my benefit or is it just a nasty evil that I should stay away from?  Let me know what you think!

Shit has taken an epic dump the past two days. I entered at .229 and sold once in the 30 cent range and the rest of my initial around 62to cents a share. Total % gain was about 85%.  It ended up running up to 1.90 I think. So in short there is money to be made. Go to stockpromoters.com and you can see what is getting promoted and by who.  What is even more crucial is if you can see how long it is getting promoted. When I got in nsrs I saw that over 7m was spent on promoting it and certain promoters were being paid 600k for a month of promotions. After finding that out it calmed my nerves from watching it go up and down.  The people who promote these kind of pumps first = awesomepennystocks.com.\n\nJust remember, these trash stocks are not to be invested in. They are to be traded.  Some penny stocks are legit, but if you're following promos they never are.  It's all about timing and a little bit of research.  Good luck!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "YES!

So far awesomepennystocks is the best and I have also dabbled with a few from toonicestocks, but aps always goes parabolic and they are normally the first to alert before other promoters begin their campaign.\n\nI guess it's legal because it's all third party stuff.  If you go to the OTC main website they have their stocks based on a tier system. It's based on how up to date companies are with their reporting/how legit they are.

Some of their more recent ones were potg and amwi. So you can check those out.  What I started to realize with the ones I looked at, if you buy at the highest point on the first day and sell at the lowest point on THE big dump day you'll still normally end up well past 100% gain.  NSRS for instance hit high 23 cents day 1, yesterday was their big dump and the lowest was like 71 cents.  They only release one pick a month or less... nsrs started in december and they still haven't released another one.\n\nI think since this one was so massive their next pick may just be a short runner. I am going to be looking at stockpromoters.com as well as investerhub to find out who all is promoting it.  I think once I get to around 50% I am going to sell the # of shares >= my initial investment and then use my judgement as to when to sell the rest.  So I eliminate my risk and I have free shares to ride to a reasonable level before dumping.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.202450692653656}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26406458020210266}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4387108087539673}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4611353278160095}, {"body": "I agree Awesomepennystocks.com and their sister sites are one of the best.

A trailing stop is set up so that the stop price trails the market price. So, if you set a trailing stop at 2%, the stop price will be 2% below market price at the time you set it. Then, as the stock price rises, the stop price rises so that it stays 2% behind it.
