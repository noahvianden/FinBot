{"title": "Gather round children, and let AmericanPegasus tell you how to double or triple your money in the next month or two, almost guaranteed.", "selftext": "One word.  **Synacor**.  (SYNC)\n  \nNot because they are some maverick company who is going to change everything, but because their stock price is going to soar in the next couple of months.  Don't believe me?  Too bad; you must not like money.  \n  \n- This is a legitimate company with respectable profits, but the source of this stock soar is going to be a major pump and dump conducted by a couple of notorious villains in the pump and dump scene (Lebed and NIA appear to be working in tandem).  \n  \n- It's trending like a mother-fucker: http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=synacor&cmpt=q  \n  \n- It's all over the 'pre-promotion' sites right now.  \n  \n- \u201c*NIA currently owns 379,000 shares of [Synacor]. NIA initially purchased 350,000 shares at an average price of $8.53 per share. NIA has agreed to a 60 day holding period on its initial position of 350,000 shares but intends to sell these shares at some point in the future after the date of July 2nd, 2012. NIA on Wednesday accumulated an additional 29,000 shares of [Synacor]. NIA intends to sell these additional 29,000 shares in the future and can do so at any time. NIA reserves the right to increase its [Synacor] position at any time.*\u201d  \n  \n- Pump and dumps can be profitable on their own, but when a legitimate company is facing a pump and dump, on good internet trending and momentum, and the pumpers in question have a definite date when we *know* they will attempt to sell their positions?  How much easier do you want it?  \n  \nAs of this morning (Monday) I am entering this position 100% of my bankroll until the next AwesomePennyStock hits.  I recommend you do the same, and then we can all laugh together on our stacks of money.  Or blindly hate on me and miss out on free money.  Your choice, /r/wallstreetbets.  And since I like jartek who runs this little club, I'll even be so kind as to let you know when I leave the position as well, and for what reason.  \n  \n**(edit 5/8/2012)**: Oof!  Stupid BOA downgraded their \"BUY\" recommendation harshly and that has caused the stock price to gap down.  You can't predict everything, but I think there's still enough devious minds and money in this one that they will absorb the blow and keep it moving.  But be more cautious than before, for sure.  \n  \n**(edit 5/8/2012)**: Fuck you Bank of America; you've caused a selling panic in an otherwise healthy stock, and cost me my lunch money.  I bought at $12 and sold today at $11.53.  Grrr....
