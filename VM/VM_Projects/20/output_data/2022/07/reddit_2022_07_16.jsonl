It\u2019s entries are all market orders. \n\nI\u2019d like to try it with highly liquid options. AMD, AAPL, TSLA with 10-20 delta. \n\nAre there any risks of absurd slippage taking market orders or these instruments or will the market keep them tight?\n\nI ask because I\u2019ve seen folks report some odd fills on options using market orders in the past.", "id": "w0fx08", "created_utc": 1657975667.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Never, ever, ever use market orders for options. That\u2019s a rookie move.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I think it depends. I like selling spreads, and do it on highly liquid assets. Because the timing is crucial, and chancing it on a limit could really miss a lot of opportunity, I just run them as market, and most of the time (like 97% of the time), I get the order filled for more than I expected to receive for it. When the options expire worthless, I keep the proceeds, wash, rinse, repeat. Did really well this week, all profitable days with between 10-30% profits.\n\nBut I think this is where the limit vs. market rule comes from: when you\u2019re BUYING options, and the ask/bid spread is significant, you can (and almost always will) instantly lose money on the trade, because you will not be able to turn around and sell it for market value at the price you bought it for, and time is working against you. The only way those win is if price goes in your favor significantly. So market trades are best used when it is a highly liquid asset, when you\u2019re SELLING option spreads perhaps, or just scalping on a 10-60 min window when you read technicals all day and are taking high quality trades on expected price action. \n\nOne of the assets I trade as market order options on is SPY, when I am responding to a double top/double bottom neck brake, or a key support/resistance area reaction, but I don\u2019t do it often because of what was just said, market orders are a lot riskier, and unless you really know what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re probably going to lose on it. Case in point, on that particular strat (with SPY), I am down about 1.4%, so that\u2019s one I\u2019m still learning to do right. One thing that helps is to not be greedy, anticipate a reasonable little profit and set a LIMIT order for when to sell that option.\n\nWhen in doubt? Yeah, just stick to limit orders. I just wanted to point out that there are a few ways to use market orders successfully, and show how I also didn\u2019t use it successfully so that you can learn from my error instead of losing your own money \ud83d\ude0a", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5990828275680542}, {"body": "10-4", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I recently saw someone get a limit sell fill on a contract during a moment of volatility.
