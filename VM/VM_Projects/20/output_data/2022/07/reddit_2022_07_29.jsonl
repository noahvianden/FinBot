{"title": "FOMO is the Mindkiller", "selftext": "Over the past week was big in business news since there were key tech earnings, FED meeting, consumer confidence report and GDP. Overall the news wasn\u2019t that good for the sign of the economy and yet the unexpected happened in the market. Most stocks were up and had very very high gains. Just a month ago everyone was fearing how a recession was imminent and get ready when the FED raised interest rates at a historic level and here we are again with more bitter news. Earnings overall weren\u2019t that good, higher interest rates, more government spending and most likely inflation to stay relatively high.

I don\u2019t know how a recession would pan out today vs the one two years ago or in 2008 but the sentiment now seems to be everything is priced in and is not as bad as we thought it might would and I see this more around the subreddit.  Do I know exactly how it will pan out? No I don\u2019t but it\u2019s the fact the sentiment changed that quickly in matter of less than a month. The next big set of news coming is up the inflation report (CPI) August 10th for July. If inflation is still remaining high at 9% it could mean more interest rate hikes by taking more drastic measures. Point being there\u2019s still a lot of macro effects (inflation, highest debt, rising unemployment, loans, etc...) that signal the economy still isn\u2019t strong. Also anyone in Europe with the looming energy crisis isn\u2019t a good sign either and further conflict with Taiwan/China with potential visits that can further the trade war.
