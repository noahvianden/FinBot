That\u2019s 3 straight weeks of moves less or inline with option pricing following 3-4 weeks of moves that far outpaced option pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013** SPY options are again pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX \u2013** The VIX closed the week near 24. The VIX futures curve remains upward sloping to the end of the year with Oct, Nov and Dec futures all above 28.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2%** (+/- $8)\n* QQQ **2.5%** (+/- $8)\n* IWM **2.4%** (+/- $4.50)\n* DIA **1.6%** (+/- $5.50)\n\n### In the News\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) completes a 20 for 1 split as of Monday morning. GOOGL was roughly $2240 on Friday which is $112 post-split. The stock has been in a range over the past 2 months of about 2120 and 2380. That is a range of $106 to $119 post-split. The company will report earnings the last week of July and the options market is pricing a move roughly in line with that range, just about 7% in either direction, corresponding to about $120 as a bullish consensus and $104 as bearish. Here\u2019s the pre-split expected move for July 29th, the week of Alphabet earnings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1smvjaa97c91.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=5126a990f6745bbb79c14fa973ff0f767ffc6034\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links*\u00a0below go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

{"title": "The market and the underlying Ponzi schemes.", "selftext": "At every cycle when the stock market and the people that are new to the markets want desperately something to invest, the start of new Ponzi schemes rise every single time.\n\nElon Musk made a good example of how Ponzi schemes can play out pretty well (because the business model is not flawed). The biggest advocate for TSLA was Cathie Wood, the most reputable Ponzi scheme creator from near history. The company TSLA hired Elon Musk (social media artist) with contracts that promise options if the stock market reaches some sort of price. No one was interested in EVs in that days. (he made a good job with the driving assistant)\n\nThe climate news media exuberance started. The world begins to die in 2060 if nobody does something. If we do not start now, the world will suffer severe, irreversible damage. These sorts of stories get the attention, because they are reasonable to the reader. The real attention happened in times of Corona. At this point the human experienced a \"spiritual relationship\" with the nature because he could not go outside.\n\nThe next part was the historic stimulus that reminded the central bankers of what they actually learned in school and how inflation works. All parts come together as the TSLA makes a profit. The investment world suddenly out of nowhere realized that EVs are the future despite the fact that in the past several companies tried the H2O and EV approaches but in the past, EVs weren't simply the trend. Sadly for them, they followed soon, and some competitors emerged (these are the people that ride the trend, make unlimited money, because of the euphoria, and do not care in the end). New companies with the goal to compete in the EV market. \n\nAll of them and the tech sector took the money like a sponge with the simple story of the future and unlimited prosperity. The politicians and policymakers didn't warn, they loaded up and surfed on the money wave.\n\nThis was probably the last ride on a stimulus-Ponzi-wave in the mid-future. All the companies already made money from issuing new stocks, and all the people that exploited this period already cashed out. The future was sold, and this future is not coming. The real future will be the realization of how the economy really works and what damage it can cause to other people, nations, stability, and freedom.", "id": "w0uilk", "created_utc": 1658017621.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w0uilk)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w0uilk)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10111024975776672}, {"body": "Unreal what people take the time to type out.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Right?
