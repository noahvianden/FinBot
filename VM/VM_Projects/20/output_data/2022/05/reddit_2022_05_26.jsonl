{"title": "Fed Minutes of May Meeting Recap - Points Worth Mentioning", "selftext": "Sharing this post of mine also here just in case any nerds have any thoughts. TLDR? Well then you certainly won't enjoy reading through the actual minutes. Overall, I don't believe the bottom is in. \n\n**Looking Forward:**  \n\"*Market- and survey-based measures of U.S. inflation expectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years. Nonetheless, far-forward inflation compensation rose over the period, and market participants remained attentive to the risk that, in bringing inflation back to 2 percent, the Committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected\"*\n\nTo me this seems to fit in line with how the markets have struggled to price things in officially because of the high level of uncertainty surrounding the Fed's moves going forward. For the rate hike this month we all knew it was no longer 25bps but there were definitely people who thought that 75bps was a real possibility instead of 50bps. Other numbers regarding housing and consumer spending has shown that outside of market participants, there are a lot of citizens out there still willing to spend cash on services and \"experiences.\" In order to quell this many believe the Fed needs to do more as indicated here.\n\n**Unemployment and Inflation:**\n\n*\"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved lower, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate increased in March, as did the employment-to-population ratio. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, remained elevated. The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March; this gain was much larger than the corresponding 2-month changes posted in each of the preceding four years and was the largest 12-month increase since 1990.\"*\n\nFrom my understanding of the most recent live speech given by JPow with the WSJ, which took place after the meeting for these minutes, JPow did all he could to dance around deliberately saying they cannot achieve their goals of lowering inflation without creating an uptick in the unemployment rate. Here we see in the quarter that unemployment actually declined which to me leaves the Fed thinking they have more to do in cooling inflation. With such pent up demand from supply chain and covid for the past two years, people are still willing to spend and the Fed has it works cut out to suppress this I believe. What's prolonging this task is how much wages have risen for people and in turn have allowed them to bear the brunt of inflation.\n\n*(Part of the Outlook Section)\"All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.3 percent in 2022. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.5 percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as supply\u2013demand imbalances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggregate demand and an anticipated easing of supply constraints. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside.\"*\n\nPivotal part to me is the \"skewed to up the side\" because time and time again we had heard rumblings of \"peak inflation\" after months of it being transitory as well. Of course they have to say that their plans are set to move inflation down, but all estimates/projections come with asterisk of \"hey, things out of our control could make this worse.\"\n\n**Credit/Debt/Lending:**\n\n*\"For most small businesses, credit appeared to be available, although these businesses\u2019 demand for credit reportedly remained weak.\"*\n\nI don't have a full take on this point, but I think it is interesting enough to mention. We around March when the consumer credit numbers were released that consumer credit had been racking it up in record breaking levels. But here we see that small businesses, often linked to the middle class and working citizens, that they were not looking for credit. Did they not need it? Could they not afford to take on debt of any kind? I don't know.\n\n\\*\"\\*The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained strong overall. The volume of credit rating upgrades for corporate bonds outpaced downgrades moderately in March, continuing a nearly yearlong pattern. The credit quality of C&I loans on banks\u2019 books continued to be strong as delinquency and default rates both remained low. Delinquency rates on bank and nonbank loans to small businesses edged down in February, while in the CRE sector, borrower financial health continued to recover. Household credit quality remained strong, and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards.\"\n\nPer recent articles in the WSJ and Bloomberg, this does not seem to be the case anymore, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-subprime-borrowers-are-missing-loan-payments-11652952602](https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-subprime-borrowers-are-missing-loan-payments-11652952602)\n\n*\"Business debt remained elevated relative to its pre-pandemic history, but interest coverage ratios were high.\"*\n\nDo you see this deteriorating? We see some larger cap tickers already saying they are not looking to hire as much. Saving money starts small, but its methods expand to all aspects of business when times get tough.\n\n*\"The staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) was elevated and that bank lending to NBFIs continued to increase notably. Relatedly, NBFIs\u2019 reliance on bank credit lines to meet unexpected liquidity needs could generate moderate liquidity pressures at large banks during times of financial stress.\"*\n\nI found this to be interesting, it was the last part of the \"Staff Review of Economic Situation\" section. They said that banks are well capitalized, that the consumer is strong, and that credit ratings for companies had gone up overall during this time. But, then why are NFBI's needing to borrow so much money? NFBI's can be considered as payday loan providers and even companies like J.Crew by offering store credit cards.\n\n**Reverse Repos:**\n\n*\"Market participants noted that ongoing uncertainty about the near-term path of Federal Reserve policy had increased demand for very short-dated investments. This demand, combined with declining Treasury bill supply, contributed to the downward pressure on secured rates and to rising overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) usage. The manager expected that ON RRP usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that, over the longer term, usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded.\"*\n\nIt is worth noting again that these notes are from the meetings on May 3rd. Since then, RRPs (reverse repos) have hit an all time of $2 trillion. Meaning that almost a month later we have still seen RRPs grow, which to me means that big money players out there are still feeling unsafe in parking their money places overnight to this day, meaning if they're uncertain about things still, then we should still be cautiously worried about he economic outlook.\n\n**Households:**\n\n*\"Households\u2019 debt-to-GDP ratio remained relatively low, and there were few signs of increased stress among lower-income households.\"*\n\nI wonder what he gauge will be like in their eyes next meeting or come the fall.\n\n*\"In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consumption spending. They pointed to several elements supporting this outlook, including strong household balance sheets, wide availability of jobs, and the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience in the face of new waves of the virus.\"*\n\nSee my second comment of the next section (GDP/Inflation) below.\n\n*\"Employment growth had continued at a strong pace, the unemployment rate had fallen to a near50-year low, quits and job openings had remained extremely elevated, and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly. In addition, a few other participants suggested that the unwelcome erosion of real incomes due to high inflation may have contributed to the increase in labor supply.\"*\n\nHow do we have participants saying that the consumer spending is robust and strong and that they see growth this year, then say well maybe there are so many people coming back to look for jobs because they need money? Stagflation incoming?\n\n*\"Most participants indicated that their business contacts had continued to report that substantial increases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers.\"*\n\nEventually there is going to be a tipping point in what consumers are willing to pay, right?\n\n**GDP/Inflation:**\n\n*\"The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and advance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year.\"*\n\nWell we will find out in 7 hours.\n\n*\"Participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021, real GDP had declined in the first quarter of this year, with net exports and inventory investment making large negative contributions to growth. They noted, however, that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong in the first quarter.\"*\n\nHonestly, stagflation may become a real issue. If the Fed does all they can to quell the inflation, but consumer spending is not stopped due to wage increases and its lagging effects, this could lead to trouble. I'm conflicted though, because in a sense, I can feel inflation in daily life, and I find it hard to believe that the consumer really is \"strong.\" But if the spending numbers are strong still as they keep mentioning (gotta remember this is for Q1 though), I feel like that puts us more in the direction of stagflation.\n\n*\"In addition, some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored; in that case, the task of returning inflation to 2 percent would be more difficult.\"*\n\nThis in reference to household balance sheets being strong due to cash stimulus, QE of covid times, and wage raises are record increases. I wonder what participants said this because this is the smart take, in my opinion we'll see inflation more plateaued like for a long time before we see anything near 2% again YoY.\n\n**Rates and Fed Balance Sheet:**\n\n*\"Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings.\"*\n\nI wonder if those who were not part of the most were more in favor of 75bps or 25bps. I still think 75bps is truly on the table.\n\n*\"This reduction, starting on June 1, would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary policy. A number of participants remarked that, after balance sheet runoff was well under way, it would be appropriate for the Committee to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities. Any program of sales of agency MBS would be announced well in advance. Regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction, several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial market conditions.\"*\n\nSince, May 4th SPY has fallen about 8.2% and since May 5th it has fallen about 4.8%, but some think once more QT comes into fruition on June 1st that more pain is on the way. I wonder if there is a way to play this, I used to think TBT was a solid way once the Fed started to get bonds of their balance sheet but I don't know.\n\n*\"At present, participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance. They also noted that a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook.\"*\n\nI view this on a scale from Easy - Neutral - Restrictive scale and we are somewhere between the Neutral and Restrictive side meaning that the Fed has to be more hawkish in its action due to things out of their control like supply chains with China and commodities in Europe.", "id": "uy0w0s", "created_utc": 1653544873.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|150|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/snb4tt/weat_etf_in_hopes_to_capture_the_likely_rise_in/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uy0w0s)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uy0w0s)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17994850873947144}, {"body": "The bottom of the bottom is nowhere to be seen.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "of OP\u2019s post?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Best comment", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14176979660987854}, {"body": "Agreed, I tried to read it, said fuck it the economy is broken and the markets are gonna break too, just a matter of time.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15526634454727173}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0759759321808815}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.176080584526062}, {"body": "Props for this post.
