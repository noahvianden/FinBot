This means that even if a stock stays flat for a year, its inherent value actually went down.\n\nWith that in mind, you could say that the SPY at its $405 low was trading at around $365 in 2020 dollars. Only slightly more than it was at the peak before the COVID crash, about 7% higher (16% unadjusted for inflation).\n\nIs it fair to assess prices in this manner or is there something I'm not considering? Because I'm not sure I've ever heard a trader factor this in, even in this very high inflationary environment.
