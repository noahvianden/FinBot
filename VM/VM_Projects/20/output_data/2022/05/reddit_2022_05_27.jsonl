{"title": "5-27-22 SPY Pre Market", "selftext": "Good morning everyone! I apologize for no daily TA last night. We are leaving for the camping trip today and unfortunately the camper battery was apparently dead which meant the electric jack on the front wouldn\u2019t lift the camper so had to do a bunch of sketchy shit to get it on my truck. Then it of course started pouring down rain and well it just wasn\u2019t a fun night lol. \n\nNote- due to the missing daily TA last night im posting my pre-market for everyone to see today which generally is not part of the free tier. \n\nAnyways here we are Friday before a 3 day trading weekend! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggnsopfsn0291.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c12b81934c88c941d0134c090b065c273133d5\n\nInflation data came in this morning and while it was not good\u2026 it wasn\u2019t worse than we thought! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5hiy986tn0291.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f30415e7450f5eae9c76d0eccd4ac666ebedb2a\n\nI showed this chart yesterday but currently we are looking at a v bottom from May 20th till now. We have been trading within this bear market rally channel for a week now. Overall it gives a possible resistance at max today of 415. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wk5kvsptn0291.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1faeda45850c8450892f6728bcb6cdfa2080500\n\nOn the daily you can see the same channel a little more clearer and how we have broken out from it. Todays big resistance is 408.5 to prevent a massive double top with the May 17th candle. Currently pre market we are testing this level right now. After that the blue probability zone lands us near 411 today and the channel give us that 414 upside potential. If this bear market rally continues to rally I will be looking for a 425-430 price target before June 10th (highlighted by the 1 and 2 below). If we open over 407.04 today we WILL leave a gap on the daily chart which is something to think about going into next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjgidq6un0291.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c2ec70993b6e3c66a0feea8d737b9439aa5e6b6\n\nMajor daily supports- 405.2 \u00e0 398\n\nMajor daily resistance- 405.5 \u00e0 411 \u00e0 417\n\nSupport\n\n407.7 -> 406.5  ->404.7  -> 403.3\n\n\\-0.5%- 403.3\n\n\\-1%- 401.3\n\n\\-1.5%- 399.2\n\n\\-2%- 397.2\n\nMajor resistance \n\n408.6  -> 409.9 -> 412.3 -> 414\n\n0.5%- 407.3\n\n1%- 409.4\n\n1.5%- 411.4\n\n2%- 413.4\n\n2.5%- 415.4", "id": "uyxorz", "created_utc": 1653656377.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|183|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1684|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ur9t1w/51622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spxvil/spy_210_the_bear_rages_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/us0d0d/51722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rj1up5/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uyxorz/52722_spy_pre_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skp8ci/24_spy_recap_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5w3m/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyng6s/buy_the_rumor_sell_the_news_hear_me_out_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/riyt4w/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdhxd/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgqp0q/spy_dec_14th_recap_and_dec_15th_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthl4s/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthspd/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ux4ri2/52422_spy_daily_ta_fomc_minutes_prediction/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uyxorz)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uyxorz)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5412873029708862}, {"body": "I thought people on WSB only ate caviar and would never camp, or was it they only eat at Taco Bell and actually live in a tent full time", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I eat taco bell and then diarrhea under the trees.
