Unless Russia does a full mobilization and throws 1 million or 2 million soldiers into the ring nothing like that will happen. And to be honest, Russia does not have the capabilities to outfit 1 million soldiers. They warehouse a lot of tanks but its like Germany. We have a lot of stuff but we can not get it to move around.\n\nRussia just overestimated their advantage there seems to be no reserves they can field quickly enough to influence the outcome (or they would have done that already).\n\nI do not see any reason why it would be beneficial for Russia to drag out this conflict.
