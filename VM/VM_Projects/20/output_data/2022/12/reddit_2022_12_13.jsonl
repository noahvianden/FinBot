{"title": "Nuclear fusion breakthrough - where and how to invest", "selftext": "A 70-year-long effort to harness nuclear fusion reactions to generate unlimited clean energy is finally taking shape. For the first time in history, U.S. government scientists have generated more energy from a controlled reaction than it consumed.\n\nThe breakthrough was achieved at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last Tuesday after successfully simulating the solar reactions.\n\nThe net energy gain that the experiment achieved paves the way for an abundant supply of reliable, clean, and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. If regularly achieved, net energy gains can curb climate change (if not reverse it in the very long term), oil sector-induced inflation can be tamed, and the world can eventually be weaned off its dependence on fossil fuels. (Deep dive: [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4b6f0fab-66ef-4e33-adec-cfc345589dc7))\n\n# The stock angle\n\nThis has been an achievement decades in the making because nuclear fusion has the potential to create energy to power the world without producing carbon or radioactive waste. The road ahead will still be long before this technology becomes commercially viable, but for those in it for the long game, here's a look at how the breakthrough can benefit publicly traded companies like Chevron (**CVX**) and Amazon (**AMZN**). \n\n>One of the world\u2019s largest energy companies, Chevron, has made several significant investments in the area of clean energy. In this regard, the company started the Chevron Technology Ventures investment fund, which allocates its investments to several low-carbon energy resources. The fund presently has 10 investments in several innovative energy technologies.  \n>  \n>  \nThe fund\u2019s investment in Zap Energy, a company that is developing nuclear fusion-related technology, can provide Chevron\u2019s investors significant exposure to this area. Moreover, its\u00a0investment plans in expanding its hydrogen capabilities\u00a0also speak of its commitment to improving clean energy.  \n>  \n>  \nApart from its investments in clean energy, Chevron\u2019s practical capital spending strategies and cost control measures can fuel solid long-term growth. Strong cash flow generating capability allows the company to up its oil production level, reduce its debt, and enhance shareholder value. Chevron is well-positioned to grow in the conventional oil and energy sector as much as it is when clean energy starts getting commercialized.\n\n**Chevron is rated** [HOLD by 12/13 WSJ analysts](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CVX/research-ratings) **and consensus of Overweight**\n\n>At first glance, Amazon seems to be an unusual choice of stock when it comes to the process of nuclear fusion. However, diving deeper, technology is a very intricately interconnected marvel; and being one of the biggest tech giants, very few technological advancements can escape Amazon\u2019s investments.  \n>  \n>  \nCompanies dabbling in nuclear fusion directly are looking forward to creating functional reactors in the next few years. Although it\u2019s likely that nuclear fusion technology commercialization won\u2019t happen until the end of the decade, one of the industries that might be among the first to jump on the bandwagon is data centers.  \n>  \n>  \nData centers run on high amounts of power because of the sheer volume of data that forms the backbone of tech. For that reason, data centers are found in less-populated areas and already have the infrastructure to support new generators; thus ticking two important boxes for placing a nuclear reactor (the phrase \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d now makes sense).  \n>  \n>  \nNow, Amazon already has billions invested in its AWS data centers and is continuing to expand its footprint in this market. In this case, it will not come as a surprise if Amazon, given its remarkable resources, adopts nuclear fusion technology to improve its cost efficiency and revenues.\n\n**Amazon has a** [consensus rating of BUY](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN/research-ratings) **by WSJ analysts**\n\nHere's a bull put spread on AMZN to make **1% yield (13% annualized yield)** as long as AMZN stays above **$80.92** through the next month.\n\nBuy 2 $79 p, Sell 1 $80 p, Sell 2 $81 p, all exp 1/13/23", "id": "zkyfnw", "created_utc": 1670945313.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3A%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Why isn't low inflation is not moving stocks? The pivot is confusing? Maybe this will help", "selftext": "This is how I think about \"the pivot\", or interest rate hikes generally.\n\nThere are 4 main baskets where money can be stored: Equities (stocks), Debt (bonds), Cash, and Real estate (land/rentals). There are others.. commodities, FX, artwork... but these are the big pieces of the pie.\n\nIf inflation is slowing down, it's the expectation of wall street that the Fed will slow down interest rate hikes and at some point soon, perhaps stop altogether. According to government measurements, inflation is slowing down lately - a lot. This tracks with what I see when I go to Walmart/etc. Retailers are really starting to pump up the promotions to move inventory. Gas prices are not far from where they were pre-pandemic (inflation adjusted). Rents are beginning to adjust down as people renew leases. Houses are sitting on the market much longer.\n\nIf interest rate hikes are getting closer to the apex yield, it's no different from a stock market rout where equities are getting near as cheap as they will get. ***High bond yields mean it's expensive to be a borrower, but great to be a lender. The same way equity offers the best return when it is purchased cheapest.***\n\nSo when comparing bond yields to stock yields, if a person is expecting the bond yield is nearing it's peak, *that's the time institutional money is going to start shifting into bonds* and out of something else.\n\nWhat is the something else? Considering the state of things, probably a mix of real estate and equities. In specific, the lowest yielding (most expensive) equities. Real estate is likely to be a lot slower, as it's not so fast and easy to sell.\n\nSo as long as bonds are expected to continue rising for a while yet, I don't expect any big stock rout. At least not because of bonds. Why would there be? Who wants to lock in a 10yr 3% treasury if a 4% treasury is just over the horizon?\n\nWhen the fed signals they will stop hiking, that's when I would expect an influx out of the expensive equities and into the longer term bonds. If and when the fed eventually backs off and begins tapering, those peak bonds near the pivot will be more valuable than what can be purchased subsequently.\n\nThose bonds are also sold on the secondary market, and a 4% treasury is more valuable when rates are falling and the only thing available from primary sales is a 3%.\n\nAnybody who was lucky or smart enough to buy a bunch of long dated Treasuries in 1981 got to enjoy bond coupons nobody has had access to in US Treasuries since. But at the time there was no telling how high rates were going to have to go, or how long they'd have to stay near that peak. The fed spent most of the 80's figuring it out.\n\nLike all things macro, there's a million factors, all relative to and acting on one another. No telling how they all interact. The best we can do is make generalized guesses and expect to be at least somewhat wrong.\n\nClear as mud, yeah?", "id": "zlam1b", "created_utc": 1670974057.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Both stock and bond yields are attractive right now if inflation will be <2.5% going forward.

To have rates held near zero as the norm promotes speculation and greed because of TINA and risk-free money.\n\nThere is a lot of hidden inflation pressure if the Fed starts backing down on rates. Housing prices haven't actually come down much, nor have food and vehicle prices. Wages haven't even caught up to inflation. Once rates go down again, housing prices will start going back up again, pushing workers again to demand more wages .\n\nAlso I am not sure that the medical service index is a good measure. Medical cost is so high that the inflation measure of it is almost pointless. Even with some deflation shown in today's CPI report medical cost in real life can still easily wipe out an average household's savings.\n\nI'm not invested at all at this point but will buy certain stocks if they get to my entry price.
