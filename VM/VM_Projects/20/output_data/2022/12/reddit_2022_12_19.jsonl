{"title": "Bull/Bear Warning: February 2023 CPI Print", "selftext": "[Bureau of Labor Statistics Press Release](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/24/2022-17994/updating-spending-weights-annually-based-on-a-single-calendar-year-of-data)  \\-  *Effective with the February 2023 release of CPI data for January 2023, BLS will update weights annually for the Consumer Price Index based on a single calendar year of data, using consumer expenditure data from 2021. This change impacts the CPI for urban consumers (CPI-U), wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), initial and interim versions of the Chained CPI-U, and CPI research series. This reflects a change from prior practice of updating weights biennially using two years of expenditure data. This shift will result in changes to some documents available from CPI, including the CPI Relative Importance tables Report and CPI Handbook of Methods.* \n\n**I've been exchanging emails with an economist at the BLS and here is what I've gotten back from him.**\n\n*The overall methodology will be basically the same. The main change will be that weights will be based on more recent data. For example, historically we had two years of data (e.g. 2019-2020) that had to be updated to the December pivot month (e.g. December 2021) by the change from the average index value in 2019-2020 to the index value in December 2021. Now, with the January 2023 update, it will be 2021 data updated to the December 2022 pivot month by the change from the average index value in 2021 to the December 2022 index value.  As for how it will impact CPI and core CPI, obviously any differences in weight allocations will translate in differences in the impact of various categories on overall inflation, but we can\u2019t make any predictions at this point.*  \n\nEssentially, the previous method would have used 2019-2020 weight data, updated by price change and now it will be 2021 weight data, updated by price change.   He wouldn't discuss how this could possibly change the CPI and Core CPI numbers but I will probably be looking to close out any positions prior to this print as I think there could be a serious rug pull in the same way that healthcare calculations changed in October.   \n\nIf you look back at my previous posts you'll see that I'm not optimistic about the future performance of the market but my conspiracy brain is telling me there is a greater than zero chance that they'll try to inflict maximum damage over the next 2.5 months, there will be another clear leg down as the 5% terminal rate gets digested by the market and the Q1 2023 earnings disappoint and then when the February CPI prints and it shows a dramatic drop the Fed will back off their current hawkish projections SLIGHTLY as they are still not going to want to dramatically ease financial conditions.
