I'm just looking for feed back, input, critiques, things to consider or watch out for, etc. Thank you.\n\n**Hello everyone**\n\nI'm pretty new to options. I've been pursuing the wheel strategy for 3 months with various low cost value ETFs and dividend aristocrats. I generally prefer 1 contract per ticker and not being assigned. I've sold 10 puts and 1 call so far on 7 different tickers. I feel I'm getting the hang of this.\n\nI'm personally anticipating significant movement in the broad market through Christmas if CPI comes in higher or lower than expectations.\n\nI have been looking at SQQQ and TQQQ as near term long plays for a couple years. I understand levered ETFs require special consideration. So I'm a little hesitant to try it; but wouldn't mind. So trying the wheel strategy with these tickers seems interesting **under the right circumstances**.\n\nI'm really curious about **selling deep OTM puts** on these, depending on CPI this Tuesday (Delta between -0.10 and -0.01). My bias is that the broad market will **rally if CPI comes in low** or **continue down if CPI comes in high**. My idea is to sell a put on SQQQ if CPI is high and TQQQ if CPI is low. My bet will be in the opposite direction of my bias. This is an attempt to collect premium only. I don't want to be assigned.\n\n**My ideal circumstances are:**\n\n* **Sell a put on SQQQ if CPI is high; market falls.**\n* **Or sell a put on TQQQ if CPI is low; market rises.**\n* **Delta between -0.10 and -0.01.**\n* **Expiration 12/16/22 ( < 5 days).**\n\nI'm just looking for feed back, input, critiques, things to consider or watch out for, etc.\n\n**Thank you for your consideration.**\n\nEdit: Small typo  \n\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for your responses.

{"title": "12-12-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis (happy pre-CPI day!)", "selftext": "Well if you would have told me on Friday at market close that spy was going to open and rally 1.43% today I would have laughed.. there was n world in which I suspected that would happen. Well SPY continues to amaze\u2026\n\nGood old JPMorgan out here with the pump\u2026 today was insane from a technical standpoint. There was at least 4 or 5 times where we broke our rising wedge and effectively VOLD (volume) was dumping and we should have dumped too\u2026 yet here we are. \n\nIf we look at the Pre-CPI days from 2022\u2026 this is the biggest pre-cpi day rally that we have seen since March 10th which was a 2.68% rally\u2026 That CPI for reference opened 1.1% and rallied to close at -0.45%.\n\nLooking at the VIX today which closed up 9.47% is the biggest pre-cpi move +/- we have had since Aprils CPI which resulted in a 15% move and a 0.71% open with a -0.37% close the next day for CPI. \n\nAre markets setting us up for a massive dump? Or are we getting set up for a massive let down and we open flat af tomorrow\u2026? Find out soon! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0spryu8kgj5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d370658b99c21e257f93b4b3a44603650a66c908\n\nWell we fought hard all day long at the bear channel resistance which was also the daily 20ema. There was a pretty convincing case almost all day that we were setting up for a pretty massive dump. However, it just never came. And then JPM put out there \u201cif we get a soft CPI we gonna see a 10% green day.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw0kgh9lgj5a1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ee0d024b931fa3771cd421b217ee3faab121c7\n\nTo be honest and im not one to say this is manipulation or that\u2019s illegal or whatever else\u2026 we already know we are trading a loser game\u2026 BUT this is a bit ridiculous\u2026 I mean the fact that one of the biggest banks can put out a statement saying something like that on such a critical day like today is honestly not okay\u2026 I mean if they would have said the opposite we woulda had a massive EOD sell off\u2026 their little article there literally moved markets. But I digress\u2026. Back to the technical. (side note- they are literally on drugs if they think spy is gonna have a 10% day\u2026) \n\nSo the biggest thing we should note for tomorrow is that there are three scenarios\u2026 big red, big green or flat open. \n\nWe have only had one flat open all year. On average we should see about a 2% +/- move though tomorrow. \n\nSo taking a look at SPY daily here you can see that we actually finished pretty much dead smack in the middle of that purple channel. This means to be tomorrow if CPI is bad we open under 390 (-2.3%+) or we open over 405.3 (1.6%+). When we think about this logically\u2026 we are already at the bear market resistance and FOMC is the following day\u2026 to me a good CPI is already expected and based off this huge run up today is what everyone is expecting. To be a bullish beat will net a lot less of a move than IF we miss\u2026 no one really is expecting us to miss on CPI. That is going to net a pretty massive move if it happens. \n\nFor those of you who missed me post here is my CPI predictions based off CPI consensus. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41lumcwlgj5a1.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43248b460ff37a116e231a9bc89ad495344a686\n\nI personally favor the case where CPI YoY will be lower than previous which was 7.7, however, it will be over forecast. I think CORE YoY is going to be unchanged or a slight miss. The biggest thing people are going to get burnt by is MoM inflation\u2026 we are yet to get a MoM inflation report that is negative\u2026 and historically it rebounds more than YoY\u2026 based off the numbers even the best case scenario still doesn\u2019t show a negative MoM print and worst case scenario shows a miss (increase) in MoM inflation. This in my opinion is going to net a massive red day and move if we actually get a miss on MoM inflation. \n\nThis is where I also think the case for a flat open is valid\u2026 we very well could see YOY CPI/ CORE decrease but MoM increase or MoM unchanged\u2026 markets very well might not know what to do with this news\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mqkzhemgj5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca38061296926f751bfd21551c3b8357ccfa282a\n\nAfter all the crappy price action on SPY last week I decided to go ahead and put Tesla back in the lineup\u2026 I missed her and she paid out nicely for me today. I did miss a big move this morning but still got some nice gains. \n\nOverall we rejected that daily 8ema aggressively and fell through the blue support line. With that we put in a double bottom support bounce off 167.8 which is where we bounced back on November 21st. \n\nThis is very much so a bounce or die day tomorrow for Tesla (and really markets in general). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3js441ngj5a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da1f655f3aa6111ff0179ed1f8f2e85212f25c0\n\nZoomed out on tesla you can see we have that black bear channel and also have the red bear channel which forms a falling wedge on it\u2026 If we leave that red consolidation channel on Tesla tomorrow (to the downside) then I truly believe tesla by EOY will see 130-140. However, if CPI beats tomorrow and we get a big green day we could end up seeing tesla double bottom here (well probs gap up) and push back to this red consolidation channel and attempt to EOW breakout there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2lbew1ogj5a1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=800e27a4c388076fdb1dff1ee2110f93bdd7d17e\n\nLast week in my TA I said that we should see the VIX close somewhere between 23 and 25\u2026 well we are right there right now. I am honestly shocked by the fact that the VIX opened nearly 7% up and SPY opened up and closed green like it did. Now granted its not a perfect correlation but its very uncommon to see such a huge divergence on the VIX and SPY.\n\nThat tells me one of two things. Either 1) everyone is hella bullish for tomorrow and everyone really does think we see 440 by EOY but they don\u2019t wanna get caught with their pants down and are hedged hella well\u2026 or 2) today was a complete pump and dump situation and we are going to see an incredible dump tomorrow. \n\nNow the biggest concern going into tomorrow is the the cost of premiums are nearly 2.5x the price of last FOMC\u2026 I have a fear or a feeling that we could. Actually looking at the price right now this might be the highest premiums have ever been going into CPI\u2026 this is even about 1.5x that of Octobers CPI\u2026 \n\nI mentioned I think CPI Strangle really is the best move for playing this as it gives you 66.66% odds of being right\u2026. However, I decided to go straight puts as I worry we get a flat open. \n\nBut something to keep in mind also is the fact that this week is CPI, FOMC and Monthly OPEX\u2026 so the premium prices might just be what they are\u2026 Sometimes premium prices aren\u2019t everything\u2026 I will say though that if I am remembering correctly\u2026 IV is actually relatively low compared to last time\u2026 we closed near high 50s when usually its 60-70s\u2026\n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\nI did not take a play today for the 5k challenge\u2026 I actually had a pretty rough week trading last week with my scalps. I did some research this weekend and wanted to go ahead and test some things first. I also didn\u2019t really with this volatility want to play the $5k challenge. I will most likely take this week off from it\u2026\n\n**Daily log-**\n\nI ended up swinging puts over the weekend and once again If I could close them after hours (spx) I would have netted nice profits\u2026 I really need to consider trading ES (futures) on my swings so I can get in and out with profits\u2026  \n \n\nI also think we are back at the time frame of no swings as technical just aren\u2019t following logic right now. I do think after this week we should have an overall sense of direction and hopefully things will be more technical based but we shall see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e1wncdpogj5a1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdce3fa256bc3fe87d01a20fa3c928bb1400be46\n\nHad i not swung a play this weekend I would have closed out a green day actually\u2026\n\nToday I made an adjustment and utilized ITM 0dte for my scalps It seemed to move much friendlier and I was able to net two nice scalp wins. I did watch 2-3 plays prior to taking these scalps which all hit green too. \n\nHad a pretty killer day today with my level to level plays. Those still remain on point and I enjoyed trading tesla once again today. \n\nI played the PH straddle today which 100% was the move\u2026 I was trying to put in a limit sell for 200% on the call side and for some reason it didn\u2019t register that I changed the premium and it sold it\u2026 so ended up selling the put side at the same time. Ended up netting about a normal 10% win on a full sized position so overall a good day\u2026 \n\nUnfortunately the nature of swings are the hit or miss. I was down about 60% at open and I talked myself into holding it expecting an EOD drop and that today would be a red day and that was a mistake. I need to get back to closing swings regardless of green or red at open. Had I closed that at open I would have netted a green day (small but green). \n\nGood luck to those playing CPI tomorrow\u2026 I highly recommend taking profits or cutting losses immediately at open\u2026 IV crush gonna be wicked\u2026", "id": "zkctfa", "created_utc": 1670882057.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "If CPI somehow beats these insanely bullish expectations (YoY 7.3% and MoM .3% last I checked) the rally will be ridiculous.
