She said that the House would take up the issue this month, before adjourning for the midterm elections. But on Thursday, Representative Steny H.

But members of the House, he said, \u201cneed time to look at it and make sure that when we do something, we do it right.\u201d\n\nThe delay was a potentially permanent setback to efforts to rein in stock trading by members in response to a surge of anger among voters and scrutiny by watchdog groups about lawmakers\u2019 virtually unlimited ability to buy and sell financial instruments.\n\nFull article: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/us/politics/stock-trading-vote-congress.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/us/politics/stock-trading-vote-congress.html)\n\nNancy Pelosi says they're still working on the votes for lawmaker stock trading ban bill.

In the past it was his time buys with SpaceX, etc. Reality, Elon thrives on having multiple projects to work on and his companies continue to exceed expectations.\n\nGrowth Rates - overall the growth rate is very strong (40-50% a year). But looking at the chart is a bit silly as there are various constraints to grow to 10-20 million in production per year that go beyond quarterly growth. I think Tesla is far ahead of anyone in doing the work to allow them to grow to that level. There may be periods of slower and periods of faster growth along the way but the growth is solid.\n\nAuto Loan - I have no idea what the relevance of that chart is to Tesla's growth. Maybe it indicates concerns with the overall auto market. Maybe it indicates more purchases and less leases. Who knows?\n\nMoving Averages - Sure, sure... Charts are cool. You should have seen the moving average up till near the end of 2019. Had you followed the charts then you would have missed out big time.\n\nValuation - Did you seriously compare by revenues? What about by profits? Not long ago you could have compared phone makers by revenue when Apple was not the mammoth they are now and yet Apple was the only one really making any profit. Seriously dumb man.\n\nTop Brands for Plugins in Europe - Cool chart... Of course ignore the specifics of the models (e.g. stupid hybrids) and definitely ignore that Tesla is producing as many as they can and will take time to ramp up. But let's play a game and look at BMW's figures. A quick Google Search tells me in Q2' 2022 (worldwide, not just Europe), BMW sold 40,602 BEVs and 54,282 PHEVs when in that same quarter, with production shutdowns, Tesla sold 254,695 BEVs or over 6X the amount BMW sold. I would guess that if we just look at BEVs and compare Europe sales between BMW and Tesla, Tesla will be far ahead.\n\nCosts going up - A chart showing use of some minerals without explaining the cost and not considering what cost will be as mining and refining improves is kind of meaningless. Copper for example costs $7.5 per KG and so 50 KG's cost $375. Maganese is maybe $2 a KG so 40 KG's cost $80. Graphite maybe $1 per KG so 70 KG's is $70. Lithium is currently expensive at maybe around $50 per KG so 25 KG's cost $1,250. Nickel at about $22.50 per KG and 10 KG's would be $225. Cobalt at about $80 per KG and 10 KG's would be about $800 (note, Tesla is working to remove Cobalt from their batteries). Zinc at $3 and only a minimal amount is used. Adding up these costs we get a total of $2,800. On the other side, Tesla has demonstrated a production method that as it improves will cut costs of making a car far more than some additional cost of materials cost. Also, you ignore the complexity of manufacturing and installing all the systems of an ICE vehicle. Long-term EV's may cost far less to manufacture than ICE vehicles. Then of course there is the Lifetime Cost of Ownership which should be less for EV's allowing for higher upfront pricing making them far more profitable to manufacture.\n\nBYD - In the first 6 months of 2022 they sold 323,519 BEVs. Tesla sold 564,743 BEVs in that same period. Also BYD makes some cheaper models that Tesla is not currently trying to make or compete with so not sure the relevance of them to Tesla.\n\nUnfortunately I have spent more time replying to this stupidity than I intended but nothing you have stated is of meaningful substance. They are just cherry-picked data points that are used to regurgitate the same old stupidity. The thing is, it does not matter. Tesla has no need to raise capital anymore so the stock goes down it matters little. Maybe Tesla can use some cash to buy back shares in that case. What does matter is that Tesla continues to grow strongly and continues to push the envelope and get products like FSD and eventually the Bot to their potential. They do that, the share price today will be a bargain and people will say they wish they bought now.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If you would like to buy some calls, I am selling.
