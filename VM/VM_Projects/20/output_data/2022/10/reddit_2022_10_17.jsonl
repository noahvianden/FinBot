Those who do get a chance to try the tech experience baffling branded content, persistent bugs, and empty worlds with no user interactions. Even employees appear not to enjoy the platform, saying there is a \"quality\" problem.\n\nLast month, in response to user complaints, Meta put the Horizon platform into \"lockdown\" \u2014 pausing the rollout of new features while it works to improve the user experience of existing elements in the virtual reality world, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nUsers have criticized the avatars' curious lack of legs as well as having few other users to interact with. Internal statistics, WSJ reported, indicate that only 9% of worlds built by users are ever visited by at least 50 people, while most never receive any visits at all.\n\nSome female users also report sexual harassment and digital groping, prompting Meta to institute a safety feature that creates a virtual 4-foot buffer around avatars on the platform. WSJ reported men outnumber women by two to one on the platform and that \u2014 while reporting \u2014 a WSJ staff member was asked to expose herself by a user she interacted with online.\n\nInternal documents show Meta has fallen far short of its goals for regular monthly users, WSJ Journal reported. The company initially had set a goal of 500,00 monthly users by the end of 2022, but has changed that figure to 280,000. The documents show the platform has less than 200,000 current users. Most users generally don't return to the app after the first month, while more than half of Quest 2 headsets are out of use within six months WSJ reported.\n\nRead the full article: [https://www.businessinsider.com/most-metaverse-users-dont-even-make-it-a-month-wsj-2022-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-metaverse-users-dont-even-make-it-a-month-wsj-2022-10)\n\nMeta\u2019s (META) flagship metaverse product \u201cHorizon Worlds\u201d reportedly has less than 200,000 monthly active users, compared with an initial goal of 500,000 by the end of 2022 & a revised year-end goal of 280,000.

{"title": "Trading SPY Week of Oct 17th", "selftext": "I am going to be using the SP Futures chart because the real points of resistance are coming from the SP index, and not SPY. Yes, the same general areas for support/resistance apply, but they will not line up with nice round numbers on SPY but they will on the SP500 Futures. \n\n**Big Picture**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9vxhzzu2eu91.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f6b06f62a4ac7b25aa1a63146149089dfa958cc\n\n**A few lines on a chart for you:**\n\n* 3250-3500 area of previous resistance. This was a battle ground after Covid and we are close to entering this zone again. \n* 3400 pre-covid high\n* 3600 the current price we are fighting over\n\n**Where are we going?** \n\n* Down: The bear market channel (tan lines) and the **3500** level line up pretty well and are within striking distance in the near term. That is my downside target. \n* Up: **3800** is the next area of resistance to the upside. Keep in mind volatility is still high, sentiment is still very bearish, RSI is on the lower end, and we are in the lower end of the channel. This is a setup for another bounce (remember last week?)\n   * We already got a meaningful bounce this AM and it might last for several days or even weeks\n\n**Don't press on shorts:**\n\n* This is likely not the place to press on shorts or buy more puts. That time was last week when SPY moved up and vix moved down.\n* Expect more shorts and put holders to close their positions as they get blown out by extreme moves to the upside and VIX coming down. \n* If you want to be short, *sell call spreads.* Yes, we likely will go lower but you are better off selling calls here than buying puts. \n\nExpect a bounce around 3500 and sell put spreads when we get there.\n\n**Why we would go lower**\n\n* Interest rates are going higher, yields higher, BOE is done interfering, Russia is moving nukes around and Europe is preparing, bank earnings and provide negative guidance \n* TSLA earnings and guidance shock the market to the downside \n* With today's early AM bounce, the RSI has come off the bottom and the \"pressure\" to the downside being removed, we are more likely to run out of buyers, run out of shorts needing to close and run out of hopium \n\n**Why would we go higher**\n\n* Russia will reach some level of cease fire. Today they stopped the \"draft\" it seems \n* China will reopen \n* Midterms are coming\n* Gas prices will be coming down most likely \n* Some level of uncertainty has been removed after last weeks economic reports. the market \"knows\" what the FED is going to do and less uncertainty = bullish\n* Sentiment is/was at historic lows - setting us up for a bounce \n* TSLA earnings surprise to the upside and this lifts the whole market   \n\n\n**Short Term Picture**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54dm14y03eu91.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=698a9d80055a124df7c2cf5ac3d9ab43e30ff0da\n\n* Notice in this picture we are about midway of the bearish channel (tan lines). This is no mans land.\n* 3800 is a meaningful area to the upside, 3500 is meaningful area to the downside \n\n**How to Trade It:**\n\n* Do not add buy puts here, do not go short, wait until VIX is 28 or lower, or we hit 3800. \n* Sell calls if you are bearish, but give yourself two weeks minimum and keep your sold strike at 3700 or greater (370 on SPY). \n   * **Sell -370/+380 early November call spreads on SPY. Try to collect $350> in credit.** \n* Close puts, close shorts, close any bearish positions when we get to 3500. My recommendation would be to *sell put spreads* at 3500 when we reach it because VIX will be elevated \n   * **On the next big down day, or when we get closer to 3500 on SP500, sell -345/+335 early November put spreads on SPY.** You could enter a limit order today for about $350 in credit and wait for them to fill \n\nWith both those positions filled you will have picked up $700 in credit betting that SPY is between 370 and 335 in early November.
