I then looked for financing and then reassessed if I wanted to take a gamble on a Tesla or even an electric car.  I worried about range anxiety etc.   I then thought about what I wanted in a car.  It was basically a commuter car.  And I thought about the savings on gas and service and I made the decision based upon that.  \n\nSince purchasing the car I\u2019ve paid $380 per year in charging expenses and a one time  $450 for a macerated tyre; a one time $700 for a home charging system, both expenses in the first year.  No service charges thus far.  In the first year I used a lot of the money saved from service and gas expenses to buy accessories.   When you get your Tesla you\u2019ll know about the community and the accessory stores that make some of the most ingenious devices and accessories.   \n\nThose were my thoughts and I have no regrets. Winter driving does use up a lot more energy but if you have an indoor garage, the beauty of warming up your car without starting the engine is a real treat.  In fact preheating in winter is an amazing plus.   \n\nGood luck with your new car.
