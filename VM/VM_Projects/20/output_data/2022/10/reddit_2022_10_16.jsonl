{"title": "Expected Moves, Tesla, Netflix, Snap, Goldman and more.", "selftext": "## Market View\n\n**Last Week \u2013**\u00a0SPY was lower by about 1.5% last week. That was inside the 2.9% move options were pricing. Similar to the 1.5% move higher 2 weeks ago, markets were much more volatile intra-week than the final result would indicate. Thursday saw a big rally that broke a 6 day losing streak, but those gains were short-lived as stocks were once again steeply lower on Friday. Treasury yields and the dollar continue to be the main drivers of the day-to-day swings. Earnings season picks up in intensity the next few weeks and that may begin to move the broader markets as well.\n\nImplied volatility remained near the highs of the year with the VIX once again closing the week near 32.\n\n**This Week \u2013**\u00a0SPY options are pricing about a 2.7% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $11 in either direction.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\u00a0(via Options AI)\n\n* SPY\u00a0**2.7%**\u00a0(+/- $10.50)\n* QQQ\u00a0**3.3%**\u00a0(+/- $9)\n* IWM\u00a0**3.2%**\u00a0(+/- $5.50)\n* DIA\u00a0**2.4%**\u00a0(+/- $7)\n\n**Economic Calendar**\n\n* **Wednesday** \u2013 Housing Starts, Beige Book\n* **Thursday** \u2013 Initial Jobless Claims, Fed Speech (Bowman)\n* **Friday** \u2013 Fed Speech (Williams)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Bullish by Not Being Bearish\n\nThe past few weeks we\u2019ve detailed a few strategies for a high-vol environment, including selling high IV (and wide expected moves) via Iron Condors as well using credit put spreads in potentially oversold stocks while not needing a rally to hold (just the stock to stop going lower). We\u2019ll check in first with the credit put spread examples from Oct 2nd\u2019s post that expire this week.\n\nThe first was the GOOGL -96/+91 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), which could be sold at around 1.90 at the time, with the stock trading 95.80 It could be bought to close for about 1.40 at Friday\u2019s close. The second was the GOOGL -91/+90 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), also with the stock trading 95.80. At the time it could be sold at roughly 0.26, it could be bought to close this past Friday for about 0.12.\n\nGOOGL stock is only higher by about a dollar since then and hasn\u2019t been much lower than where the stock was when those trade examples were detailed. The key point here is that buying calls or even call spreads in a high implied vol environment is difficult because rallies in the stock have not been sustainable. Buying premium needs a large sustained move to be right when vol is this high. But selling premium in high vol allows for some wiggle room, and can be best described in this case as being bullish, by not being bearish.\n\nContinuing on that theme, here\u2019s a comparison of an at-the-money call, and an at-the-money credit put spread in QQQ, expiring Nov 21st:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01mt1qpks8u91.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=9169ab50abd8a953cd1a8a32d4a38ed390cbe2a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llnyoclls8u91.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=82284addf5d2cdf3a06d7df3d0f159eb27bbe12f\n\nAs you can see, the two trades risk about the same amount. However, buying the call needs QQQ above $273.25, while the credit put spread needs QQQ to not be below $254.45. Obviously, the credit put spread can only make $657, while the potential gains on the call are unlimited. But\u2026 The call needs QQQ to be nearly $19 higher from its current level before it would make the same.\n\nAgain, this is just an example. QQQ will see some of its biggest names report earnings over the next few weeks and that credit put spread could easily be underwater. But the risk is defined, and the chances of it being a complete loss are much lower than buying calls, especially with implied vol so high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Earnings This Week\n\nExpected moves for companies reporting this week.

{"title": "Hear me out - Shorting SQQQ", "selftext": "So if you look at the long term graph, SQQQ is unparalleled at losing value. Volatility decay affects it, and it\u2019s recommended to never hold it long term.\n\nSo the idea is that I pay someone else to hold it for a while and buy it back later at a lower price. This way, volatility drag is actually working FOR me, instead of against.\n\nHow could this possibly be a bad idea for a very small percentage of my account for just in case? Even if stocks go to 0 in a day, it would at maximum gain 300%\n\nEdit: ok, so I did more research. The concept I\u2019m trying to do is profit from the volatility decay of SQQ (or TQQQ, more on that later). Since it will always naturally go down to volatility decay, turns out TQQQ also suffers from volatility decay. If I short BOTH, then my gain will be equally to the volatility decay of both minus interest. This work if we trade in a range and there isn\u2019t a clear movement in one direction. If, when I cover, the market has traded in a range for a while, even if it\u2019s very volatile, I will probably make a profit.\n\nTLDR I\u2019m going to short TQQQ as well as SQQQ because I expect the nasdaq to neither crash or skyrocket, but it will be extremely volatile in the meantime. It\u2019s possible I could gain from both trades, or one makes weaker gains and the other takes very significant losses and I still profit.\n\nThank you all for your advice, basically I\u2019m  trying to replicate an iron condor with shorting because then I don\u2019t have to try and time the IV spikes or crushes.", "id": "y5ph2m", "created_utc": 1665948397.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Hey ~~investor~~gambler, I heard you like shorting so I shorted your short\n\nNew ETF SSQQ, 3x inverse SQQQ.

We did see the dreaded 20 MA (currently at 368.30) rejection today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hskomkjhb6u91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f505b234524fd81511d211e3992455693d90c1ed\n\nSPY opened up with a lower high and rejection off 370. We then moved down and tested 200 MA on 2 min - trading in a triangle. In the triangle, we rejected the anchored VWAP and slipped through the 200 MA. We backtested the 200 MA at about 8:00 UTC-6 and rejected, hitting 360.97 target on scalping chart. For the next hour, we traded in a h&s pattern. Full measured move from neckline break was 357.89 and we hit that EOD.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkam2v9jb6u91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a50b2bfa2a56ffe24b20c6affa3ad2750e808ff\n\nWe are at support level of 4 hr. rectangle again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wf2uslkb6u91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff5c364865b02383201aa79fcef8abfcd905981\n\nI took two trades today. I played 365c on breakout and trimmed at 50 MA and left runners, hoping we\u2019d have a VWAP test. Didn\u2019t happen and got stopped out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/duydiq8mb6u91.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0ed45bba08912201e80d9517b8542a855d678c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spvkyn4nb6u91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d845f6186facc2fa93d1da91a669008d063f4602\n\nThe second trade I took was a triangle breakout with successful backtest. I took profit early as it was looking like it was going to stall. Couldn\u2019t get the full measured leg down and was stopped out of remainder contracts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qv4re9kob6u91.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe23252867048ca74f1655c5e4293b723a5dd4a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xa9f6uepb6u91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e8ee2c3705f2c51d54609cf56de88cc49d1735\n\nGood day today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7ecgu2rb6u91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=65d2f5541dfa222a192d3540478b298a95075f76\n\n# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n>Stocks in the United States fell after a report showed that year-ahead inflation expectations increased for the first time in seven months. The Dollar rose while Treasuries fell.  \n>  \n>The S&P 500 finished near the day's lows, down more than 2%. The growth-sensitive Nasdaq 100 fell the most, dropping nearly 3% as Treasury yields rose, with the 2-year rate returning to 4.5%. Both indices experienced their first weekly declines of the month.  \n>  \n>Equity markets fell sharply after a University of Michigan survey found that year-ahead inflation expectations rose in early October, while the long-term outlook improved. The increase may be concerning for the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep views anchored. It also comes on the heels of data released the day before that showed a key measure of consumer prices accelerated to a 40-year high in September. However, stocks roared back from early losses on Thursday, in one of the biggest reversals in history.  \n>  \n>In the most recent Fed comments, officials indicated that they are prepared to raise rates more aggressively than previously planned. Kansas City Fed President Esther George stated that the terminal rate may need to be raised in order to cool prices. The San Francisco Fed's Mary Daly stated that raising to restrictive levels and to between 4.5% and 5% is the most likely outcome.Forecasts released last month showed rates reaching 4.4% by the end of the year and 4.6% the following year, up from a current target range of 3% to 3.25%. Following strong payrolls and hot inflation readings, swaps traders have increased bets on rate hikes over the past week, with the market leaning toward back-to-back jumbo hikes at the next two meetings and a high above 4.9% next year.  \n>  \n>Bonds and the Sterling fell in the United Kingdom, capping off another turbulent week. Gilts fell as Prime Minister Liz Truss confirmed a reversal on a planned corporation tax freeze. On Friday, the Bank of England completed its emergency bond purchases, purchasing \u00a31.45 billion in long-dated and inflation-linked Gilts. Following that, 30-year yields rose 23 basis points to 4.78%, following a drop of more than 30 basis points earlier.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n>Fed's Bullard: The appropriate rate range should be in the 4.5%-4.75% by the end of the year, with any further increases in 2023 being data dependent.  \n>  \n>The UK is in talks with US LNG producers about major purchases - Sky.  \n>  \n>UK's PM Truss anticipates that UK's Chancellor Hunt will agree to no more U-turns on the UK tax package, according to person familiar with the matter. (Sterling weakened)  \n>  \n>Fed's Daly: 4.5%-5% is most likely the top Fed Funds Rate, and then hold it there.  \n>  \n>For the first time since March, US 1-Yr inflation expectations have risen.  \n>  \n>University Michigan Sentiment Prelim Actual 59.8 (Forecast 58.8, Previous 58.6) (DXY & 2 Yr Yield strengthened, S&P 500 & Gold weakened)  \n>  \n>UK's PM Truss: We have decided to keep increase in corporation tax.\n\n# \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA\n\nFib.

Do we reverse or do we continue this leg down to 342 - 336 range?\n\nWe are near .618 (356.57) retracement from Thursdays low. If we hold this range on Monday, then we head back up to test 370. Break 370 and I believe that we will see 380 - 384.

{"title": "Warren Buffett OP-ED from October 16, 2008", "selftext": "Warren Buffett wrote this OP-ED 14 years ago today, and I think a lot of what he said then still applies today:\n\n**Buy American. I Am.**\n\nOmaha\n\nTHE financial world is a mess, both in the United States and abroad. Its problems, moreover, have been leaking into the general economy, and the leaks are now turning into a gusher. In the near term, unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will continue to be scary.\n\nSo ... I\u2019ve been buying American stocks. This is my personal account I\u2019m talking about, in which I previously owned nothing but United States government bonds. (This description leaves aside my Berkshire Hathaway holdings, which are all committed to philanthropy.) If prices keep looking attractive, my non-Berkshire net worth will soon be 100 percent in United States equities.\n\nWhy?\n\nA simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. And most certainly, fear is now widespread, gripping even seasoned investors. To be sure, investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions. But fears regarding the long-term prosperity of the nation\u2019s many sound companies make no sense. These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups, as they always have. But most major companies will be setting new profit records 5, 10 and 20 years from now.\n\nLet me be clear on one point: I can\u2019t predict the short-term movements of the stock market. I haven\u2019t the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month \u0097 or a year \u0097 from now. What is likely, however, is that the market will move higher, perhaps substantially so, well before either sentiment or the economy turns up. So if you wait for the robins, spring will be over.\n\nA little history here: During the Depression, the Dow hit its low, 41, on July 8, 1932. Economic conditions, though, kept deteriorating until Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in March 1933. By that time, the market had already advanced 30 percent. Or think back to the early days of World War II, when things were going badly for the United States in Europe and the Pacific. The market hit bottom in April 1942, well before Allied fortunes turned. Again, in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was when inflation raged and the economy was in the tank. In short, bad news is an investor\u2019s best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America\u2019s future at a marked-down price.\n\nOver the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.\n\nYou might think it would have been impossible for an investor to lose money during a century marked by such an extraordinary gain. But some investors did. The hapless ones bought stocks only when they felt comfort in doing so and then proceeded to sell when the headlines made them queasy.\n\nToday people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn\u2019t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value. Indeed, the policies that government will follow in its efforts to alleviate the current crisis will probably prove inflationary and therefore accelerate declines in the real value of cash accounts.\n\nEquities will almost certainly outperform cash over the next decade, probably by a substantial degree.
