Brand new revenues from the new, historic NFT marketplace, which has more customers than Coinbase's\n\n5. GameStop's brand new revenue stream due to its new, 5-star GameStop App for shopping\n\n6. Plans for a first-of-its-kind global metaverse\n\n7. Block-chain-based dominance in its new GameStop wallet\n\n8. Financial backing and new partnership with cyber-asset-powerhouse FTX\n\n9. Investment support from cyber-asset-king, mega-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried\n\n10. GameStop's control over the e-sports product and viewership market, now thanks to GameStop's NFT market, players can retain ownership of their electronic sports gear\n\n11. New Merger and Acquisition chatter with the legendary Carl Icahn, who was just seen in a meeting with the GameStop chairman, who is planning to have GameStop buy-out other companies to expand its already-growing products\n\n12.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\\^IXIC) gained 2.3%. Treasuries retreated after a relentless climb in recent days that saw the benchmark 10-year note temporarily rise above 4.3%, a level not seen since 2008.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn remarks at a meeting Friday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said the U.S. central bank should avoid tipping the economy into an \"unforced downturn\" and that it was time to consider easing the pace of hikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvestors also assessed a Wall Street Journal report earlier in the day indicating Fed policymakers are poised to deliver another interest rate increase of 0.75% at their meeting Nov. 1-2 and but are expected to discuss the possibility of a smaller increase in December.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven with the past two down days, equities closed the week out sharply higher thanks to mega rallies on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closer to the end than we are to the beginning, and the more bear market rallies we see, the fewer are left before we finally flush it all out,\u201d SoFi's Head of Investment Strategy Liz Young said in a note. \u201cStill some more things to check off the list, but if or when earnings crack and just before economic data falls into contraction conditions, is when you start to pounce on market opportunities \u2013 that could be just around the corner.\u201d\n\nThird-quarter earnings season has so far held up better than many analysts have expected, with beats from companies like Netflix (NFLX), AT&T (T), and IBM (IBM) countered by big misses from names such as Snap (SNAP), which tumbled 28% Friday after disappointing Wall Street with its results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe social media platform reported a fifth-straight quarterly deceleration, along with lackluster profits and a warning that sales trends in the current three-month period may get worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt's difficult to parse out how many of Snap's issues are transitory,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a note. \u201cThe weakening macro backdrop is partially to blame for soft results, but we question how much is due to the iOS privacy issues and competitive threats.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSnap\u2019s declines also extended to other social media and tech peers Friday, with shares of Meta (META) down 1.1% and Twitter (TWTR) shares off nearly 5%.", "id": "yabqp0", "created_utc": 1666405782.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.38, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "A billion crabs just died who cares", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Crab futures?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "They don\u2019t exist", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The crabs have no future?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Same as us pal, same as us", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.031208422034978867}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29509198665618896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15499581396579742}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.500830352306366}, {"body": "You got crabs?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5212311744689941}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15346401929855347}, {"body": "Still down overall from ATHs, guessing it\u2019s gasping for air before the next drop", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83e\udd71", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.048693109303712845}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37624168395996094}, {"body": "I hold Netflix too, and I'm glad to see such a great growth, but my entry was about 380 (after the first massive drop).\n\nMy favorite stock bottomed, then skyrocketed on absolutely bullish great news and finished +66% from ATL.

There debt to equity ratio is currently around .85. EV/EBITDA is 14.1 and a P/S ratio of 2.04. \n\nThey are a service and technology company for oil and gas. They\u2019re one of the leaders in Carbon capture technology and heavy oil technology. I\u2019ve heard from insiders The world has more heavy oil then light sweet crude. They claim to be very close to access this oil. They\u2019re in the process of creating technology to produce/capture heavy oil and make it economically viable. \n\nThey have contracts all over the world with government and large scale oil/gas producers in the upstream/midstream/downstream oil and gas sector. The create software for drilling rigs and oil refineries. They have pumping technology that uses pressure to pull oil out of newly fracked wells. They hold many patents and have intellectual property rights all over the world. They create equipment to optimize the amount of oil you can get out of a well and have successfully created technology to extend the life of wells previously thought to be worthless. They also have revolutionized the industry through horizontal drilling tech. When the first round of fracking technology in the US caused some major companies to loose a lot of money when the wells ended up not producing as much as conventional wells. This company had a big role in changing that. It\u2019s the second shale oil revolution and these guys are leading the charge. Saudi Arabia and other middle eastern countries are looking into horizontal drilling and perforated fracking. This company is on the forefront of shale oil. There\u2019s rumors of a deal with Saudi Aramco. \n\nThey\u2019re like the oil and gas equivalent to HP or Apple. They also have a higher ethical score then other companies and their carbon capture tech looks very promising m. I\u2019ve researched it and it seems like they\u2019re not hiding anything. Overall a very competent company. They created artificial lift tech to in lack of better words \u201csuck\u201d the oil out of the ground. \n\nThey study geo mechanics and rock formation. They have sonar and technology that can accurately pinpoint reserves in the ground. They are an extremely relevant company and their employees stay with the company longer then the industry average. We also saw cluster buying three months ago with some of the top executives. Demand for oil is increasing year after year and rig counts all over the world are increasing. There\u2019s a huge demand for their products factoring they Ukraine war and OPEC+ production cuts. I sold some covered calls and own calls myself. I also own stock and the divined is nice but not at a level where I would start asking questions. The price is high but energy is looking like a safe bet. I\u2019m gonna dump these calls while I\u2019m still in the green probs Monday. The management is playing the long game. They\u2019re also playing the long game and paying of debt. No history of dilution\n\nGetting some buy ratings. What do you think?
