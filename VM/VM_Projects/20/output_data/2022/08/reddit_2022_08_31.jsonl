Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN, QQQ, SPY, etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN (with margin).\n\nNext day, market started it\u2019s descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because I\u2019ve lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole.\n\nI decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too, since I\u2019m sure they would be greedy if the risk was low, but they were ultra bearish.\n\nI place my 130P SEP 2 puts, two nights before jackson hole, unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didn\u2019t happen I should\u2019ve been up $120k from the beginning.\n\nAnyway, I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys we\u2019re keeping the market up. The market should\u2019ve been destroyed today, with the sell volume, but since the top side of the market is all wiped out, there are now huge gaps in ask sizes, causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k+ day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action, until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day.\n\nNow ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600,000 CAD with a 20% down payment :) Which will be the equivalent to an $800,000 house right now, pre-upcoming-crash\n\nThanks for listening to my story", "id": "x2231d", "created_utc": 1661913710.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Luck", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "do it again", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21266061067581177}, {"body": "He knows, that's why he's deleting his trading app. \n\nThis is a very smart move.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05626673623919487}, {"body": "The win may be luck. \n\nThe getting out and app deleting is pure skills.", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43454331159591675}, {"body": "Came here to say this", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19826574623584747}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15255828201770782}, {"body": ">I understand how important capital protection is now.  \n>  \n>Now ive deleted my trading app\n\nSmart.

{"title": "Great news regarding BBBY strategic plan", "selftext": "BBBY has declining revenue and a relatively fixed cost structure yet it has a new plan to reduce the number of stores and cut labor so that it can solve its debt problem.  Since when does shrinking your business while migrating towards lower margin national brands solve a debt problem?  It will never fucking work.\n\nEverybody says the valuation of BBBY is $900 million.  Complete BS.   This conveniently ignores $5 billion of debt plus $500 million in additional debt (despite the friendlier \"financing\" term,) that is tacked on putting the same money losing business further in the hole..  If BBBY was debt free it would might have a $900 million valuation.   I doubt it though.  The company has no business.  Businesses are supposed to make money.  A company that is bleeding money at a clip of $100 million a month is not a business.   BBBY has 6 months to solve its problems.   Does anyone really think it will turn a profit in 6 months?\n\nEverybody mentions price to sales in the valuation metric for BBBY.  Its fucking stupid.   Companies that valued on sales have very high margin businesses (ie software business like Salesforce) that are growing and or that have a platform that is scaleable (ie Amazon) so that it is clear their cash flow improves in the future.  BBBY has a negative margin business with sales that are shrinking, and it simply can never compete with Amazon.\n\nBBBY does not have a dominant web presence, it does not have state of the art automated warehouses in every city, and it does not have drivers that already travel to your neighborhood every day spreading their cost of delivery over many more items.   Amazon can offer its private label products at a far lower cost, and these products are eating away at the business of national brands in textiles and at Bed Bath and Beyond.  The trend is your friend.  BBBY will never be able to compete in e commerce with Amazon, and the shift back towards national brands will not work.  It is too late.  The BBBY retail cost structure is a noose around its neck.\n\nI keep hearing about how GME squeezed and BBBY can do the same.  Not a comparable situation.  First, the squeeze happened when the entire stock market was valuing companies with no earnings based on a negative real cost of capital.  More importantly it was a Bull market where the Fed was buying every asset in sight.   Now the situation has reversed, the Fed is selling every asset, and we are in a Bear market and money losing companies have been hammered.  Sure Gamestop has raised a ton of cash at equity prices that were 50x higher than its low.   Still, it burned over $200 million in the last quarter, and its cash will last until the end of next year at best.  There will be a day of reckoning for all of these stocks unless redditors keep feeding these money losing pigs.  Ryan Cohen will not save it.  You can bet your ass the day will come when he will post his 13D with some high priced calls and liquidate his stock in short order.\n\nThe reddit \"team\" strategy of we are are going to squeeze others only works if no one sells.  AS someone said, investing is a dog eat dog world.  No one gives a shit about you.  Especially here.Bulls and snake oils salesmen are the only ones with a voice due to downvoting.   You can bet your ass whenever something truly bad happens someone will post some new stupid ass bull hypothesis based on complete bullshit (ie Today was really a good thing when the Company filed an S-3 shelf offering allowing it to simply post a \"supplement\" and take $120 million from you suckers.  Once the first tranche of 12 million is sold, BBBY can and will cut and paste the same supplement again and again until all 900 million shares are taken by dumbass bidders.  Shelf registrations are used by penny stock pump and dump scams.  Great way to steal money if you are the company.   Rarely if ever good for investors).\n\nEveryone says they don't sell but last time I checked 160 million shares have sold in the last 2 days.  Someone is selling, and the price has fallen as a result.  It is a simple supply and demand situation.    More sellers and the stock goes down.    How often does someone say I sold in this sub?  Not too often, because if you do you can't even be here.  Karma silences reason.\n\nTo pull off a short squeeze, this stock needs a positive catalyst.  Ie an activist investor, or a plan that actually works where they can make money in the future.  Sorry but borrowing another $500 million just means the enterprise value of this company is over $6 billion.  That debt is there. Its not going away.  And the market says its not getting repaid, or you wouldn't be able to buy it for 20% of the amount borrowed by BBBY.   When a company's sales are not profitable, it does not have a business.   BBBY does not have a business.  Its only chance of survival is convince you all to feed it money every quarter.   There is no way in hell that this group will do that forever..\n\nIt may seem like you are among friends on your side, but only some of the people here are your friends.  Most sell you out every single day.  Sorry, it is the fucking truth. Don't be a dumbsass.\n\nIf you disagree, what is the end game here?  To continue to convince the masses that ponzi schemes in in stocks going out of business always work?  Businesses that lose shit tons of cash eventually die.   Maybe not this week, but at some time.  Shorting and ponzi shemes have been around for 100 or more years.   Polaroid, Blockbuster, Toys R US, Borders books, Tower Records, GM, Kodak.  They all BK'd.   No amount of trickery could save them.\n\nIf it does squeeze, do you really fucking think someone will give you a signal of when to cash out?  Fuck no.  They will cash out and then post \"bought more.\"  No one will ever say oh shit has turned, time to get out.  What is really crazy is that after Ryan Cohen sold, proving he thought the plan sucked, and he used trickery to pump the stock, snake oil bag holding salesmen immediately started talking about a merger with Gamestop.  Remember what was supposed to happen today?  The merger and spinoff of buybuybaby DID NOT happen, but no worries.  Move the goal post again.  Ignore that a billionaire who was made rich by this forum just screwed all of you, and also ignore that he might be much more clever than you and he fucking sold down to ZERO.  Thats his faith in this play.  ZERO.  \n\nGet a fucking life.   Bet on a real company.\n\nPS.  yes I own puts.  I'm up, though only slightly, and I can lose the money as well.  It is less than 1% of my net worth.  Not at all scared.
