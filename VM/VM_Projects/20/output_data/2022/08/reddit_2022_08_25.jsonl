On a side note, I think crypto is a wolf in sheep's clothing, but that didn't stop me from accumulating some in speculation.  Prior to 2008, gold was about $300 and crypto didn't exists.  Shortly after 2008 gold rose to about $1800/oz.  As crypto ramped up we saw the price of gold fall to about $1100 around.  Today gold is about $1800, while crypto is sitting at $20K.

Shorts have to pay the didvidend if they keep it AMC. The dividend for [$ZIM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ZIM&src=cashtag_click) is $4.75 or 10% of the share price. Loads of short sellers will try to close positions before AMC. Official SI reported is 12%.\n\nLate edit:\n\nGuys, AMC is short for At the Market Close. Probably I should have used **AMH - after market hours** to avoid confusion, but the record on stock owners entitled for dividends is literally closing **at the market close.**\n\n**All short sellers that will keep positions after 4:30 pm today, will have to pay the cash dividends as all shorters are responsibile for all dividends paid by the stock they borrow to sell short.**\n\nI should place some context here:\n\nIf you wonder what is $ZIM about: It is the biggest ocean shipping company listed at stock exchange (NYSE).\n\nThe 4.75 USD dividend (10% at current price) is for q2 and 10% boost for q1. By the end of the year they estimate to give out some 20$ in dividends.\n\n**Some say they can't as the shipping rates were falling in q2. That is true.**\n\n**Some say they will make even more money. Here is why:**\n\nEvery year in this planet, the peak time in shiping is just starting in August and ussually shipping rate are growing until winter. The next 2 quarters a full of shopping seaons like bak to school, black friday, Christmas etc. All is generating more demand for shipping so better rates for shipping cargo.\n\nTrivia: Israeli Government owns a key stake in $ZIM. They bosted their fleet capacity in the last 2 years and they also have 50% exposure to spot shipping rates.\n\nThat is the biggest exposure in the industry  - meaning most of their big cash made last year and this year is generated by the spike in shipping rates.\n\n**Now, this is a risk and a reward.**\n\nI chose to buy some for one simple reason: I noticed that every time the growth/tech stocks and the market  were doing reall really bad (May, June for example) ZIM was high.\n\nIt offers also little bit of hedging for all that amazing tech stocks.\n\n**Important:** \n\n**If yu own some or planning to buy some today, you might wanna keep it till September 8-9. You don't have to, you qualify for the dividend even if u sell tomorrow, but here is why:** \n\n**It is to be expected to see tomorrow a 3-4$ discount. Not from this price now** but from the **price at market close.**\n\nSo if the stock pops in thelast hours of trade, from that price some 3-4 dollars might be off tomorrow. Might. \n\n1. Depends how the market is feeling about Jackson's Hole tomorrow and every time the market droped this week, ZIM was higher - value&dividend refuge. \n2. Why Septemeber 8? Most of value investors and HF playing dividends stocks have this **\"reinvest divident\" policy** in place so on September 8 or 9 when the cash will go to the investors, we might see a consistent boost - almost equal to the discount tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "wxjdgn", "created_utc": 1661446617.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Nice writeup, only thing I will add is that the div is taxed at 25% by Israeli gov.
