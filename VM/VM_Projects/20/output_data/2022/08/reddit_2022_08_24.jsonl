{"title": "Jim Cramer says charts suggest the S&P 500 should keep trending higher for now. Do you agree?", "selftext": " Technical analysis from the veteran chartist Ralph Vince indicates the stock market should be able to keep trending higher in the near term, CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe charts, as interpreted by ... Ralph Vince, suggest that this market can keep drifting higher for the next few months as long as employment stays strong,\u201d the \u201cMad Money\u201d host said before cautioning: \u201cPlease don\u2019t get too complacent as there are signs that not all is well as we go into the final third of the year.\u201d\n\nOne reason for Vince\u2019s current outlook is his model focused on continuing unemployment claims, which are part of the Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobs reports. Cramer said the technician looks at that piece of jobs data for insights into the health of the economy and, by extension, whether it makes sense to be invested in the S&P 500. Strong labor markets are correlated with ascending stock markets, Cramer said, while recessions tend to be bad news.\n\n\u201cRight now, Vince says the continuing claims data remains in bull mode. Even though we\u2019re very worried about a Fed-mandated recession, we\u2019ve got an insanely strong labor market here,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cThat\u2019s good news for the broader economy, even if it makes the Fed more likely to raise rates aggressively down the road. But this stubbornly resilient job market also offsets some of the damage from those rate hikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, employment is not the be-all end-all,\u201d Cramer cautioned. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got to keep an eye on earnings and dividends and the market\u2019s overall valuation.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/charts-suggest-the-sp-500-should-keep-trending-higher-for-now-cramer-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/charts-suggest-the-sp-500-should-keep-trending-higher-for-now-cramer-says.html)", "id": "wwq65h", "created_utc": 1661363854.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|192|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|87|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wwq65h)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wwq65h)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.032610632479190826}, {"body": "Massive crash confirmed!", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "The volatility will be glorious ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3396835923194885}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11103388667106628}], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "there's that recession confirmation i was looking for.", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Oh thank god!
