He pointed to a weakening US economy and the Fed's interest-rate increases, which drive up the cost of borrowing and servicing loans for companies.\n\n\"The action of the credit market is consistent with economic weakness and stock market trouble,\" he said. \"I think you have to start becoming more bearish.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor noted he has been relatively neutral on the S&P 500 for the last six months, but is now ultimately looking for a target of about 3,000 on the benchmark US stock index \u2014 a 20% or so decline. It closed lower at 3,932.63 on Tuesday as equities tanked following the hotter-than-expected August inflation report.\n\n\"You always want to own stocks, but I'm a little on the lighter side,\" Gundlach said, noting he's not much of a stock picker. But he pointed to emerging markets as the biggest upcoming opportunity in stocks for investors.\n\nInvestors are closely watching US economic indicators for a potential trigger for the Fed to pivot away its rate hike campaign. They're concerned the policy could tip the economy into a recession, which would depress stocks, if the central bank doesn't get the balance right.\n\nGundlach now sees deflation \u2014 a fall in the overall level of prices \u2014 as the key threat to the economy and markets.
