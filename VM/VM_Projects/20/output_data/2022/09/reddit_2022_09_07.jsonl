{"title": "CNN reports - Apple is set to unveil iPhone 14 at \u2018far out\u2019 event | Will they also reveal their satellite partnership with Globalstar (NYSEAMERICAN: GSAT)", "selftext": "Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has done every year in September for about a decade.\n\nThe latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It\u2019s rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model \u2013 meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.\n\nFinally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company\u2019s flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday\u2019s event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.\n\nApple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple\u2019s bigger breakout successes in recent years.\n\nApple\u2019s event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: \u201cFar out.\u201d \n\nThis has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.\n\nWhile the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.\n\nMany analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.\n\nApple\u2019s stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.\n\nBut with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales \u2014 and all the subscription revenue that comes with that \u2014 be enough to turn Apple\u2019s stock from red to green?\n\nInvestors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. \n\nAnalysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.\n\nThe company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.\n\nOne analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with \"macro storm clouds building.\" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.\n\"This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,\" Ives added.\nApple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.\nAccording to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\nApple is that rare beast, a stock that still is exciting enough for the growth crowd but is also attractive to value investors thanks to its reasonable price, penchant for stock buybacks to boost earnings and a steadily growing dividend.", "id": "x88ncu", "created_utc": 1662565929.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|43|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2022/02/20/stock-market-open-monday-presidents-day/6871525001/) [x](https://i.redd.it/6ti030dl3lk91.gif) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x8148j/must_read_for_investors_looking_towards_the_next/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x88ncu)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x88ncu)\n    \nHey /u/WallStreetDoesntBet, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17119857668876648}, {"body": "Holy shit they better.
