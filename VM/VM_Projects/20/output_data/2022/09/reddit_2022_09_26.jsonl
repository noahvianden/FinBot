If volatility is *over* estimated by the market that means it is better to sell than to buy, whether you're selling calls or puts doesn't matter.\n\nYou are correct that when you sell an option you must decide on a direction, selling puts means you are more bullish and selling calls bearish. Again, in theory if the market is over estimating volatility *both* of these will be mispriced in the sellers advantage. However, in the real world, volatility tends to go up higher when the market goes down. VIX does not typically sky rocket when prices go up, and does when the go down (partially this is because of the magnitude of those drops).\n\nYou can sell short straddles as well which is selling both the put and the call.\n\n> Can\u2019t volatility fall and that directional bet go against me?\n\nIn theory this can be somewhat alleviated by how far OTM you put your strikes. If you know what your personal estimate for volatility is then you can look at the probability of your options being ITM (as well as define what you believe to be the correct price). This also works in your advantage (if you are correct) because of the volatility smile, further OTM options tend to have higher relative value (which is just IV).\n\nIn addition to all of this, risk management for selling options is more complex. Your choices (given your level of sophistication I'm assuming your account is not cleared for naked calls/pulls) are going to be limited to cover calls and cash covered puts. The former requires you to own the same number of shares are you are writing calls (100 per contract) and the latter requires you to have the cash in your account to purchase the shares if necessary (100 x the strike price per contract).\n\nSo if you want to short VIX, because you believe volatility is currently overestimated by the market, and  you happen to already own 100 shares of SPY, then you can write covered calls. In this case that might be the most sensible way for you to short VIX. If on the other hand you have a fair bit of cash handy you can sell cash covered puts. SPY right now is 364.31, so if you wanted to sell puts with a strike price of say 360,  you would need 36,000 in cash in your account. The nice thing about covered puts is you can limit the amount of cash you need with the strike, for example, though the premiums would be much smaller you could sell SPY puts for a strike of 165 and only need 16,500 in cash.\n\nIn either case your potential loses are quite high, but there are ways to limit these loses using more complex strategies.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wouldn\u2019t I be better off just selling a call spread against the VIX option chain?

{"title": "Don\u2019t look for a stock market bottom until a soaring dollar cools down. Here\u2019s why.", "selftext": "It will be difficult for the stock market to stop its slide and find a bottom as long as the U.S. dollar keeps soaring versus its rivals, according to market analysts.\n\nGlobal stocks suffered a bruising week, with the S&P 500 on Friday narrowly avoiding its lowest close of the year. At the same time, a key U.S. dollar index soared to a two-decade high, with the greenback soaring versus rival currencies and sowing volatility across financial markets.\n\nSee: These 20 stocks in the S&P 500 skidded as much as 21.5% during another brutal week for the market\n\nAfter the Fed raised its key policy rate by 75 basis points on Wednesday, currencies such as the euro EURUSD, -0.43%, British pound GBPUSD, -0.36% and Japanese yen USDJPY, 0.56% further plunged, while the U.S. dollar Index DXY, 0.51% on Friday rose to its loftiest level since 2002 and recorded the biggest weekly advance since March 2020.\n\nThe pound fell to a 37-year low against dollars on Friday, while euro dropped below $0.98 for the first time. The yen tanked to a fresh 24-year low, before Japan said Thursday it had intervened to prop up the currency\u2019s value, the first time since 1998. \n\nNon-U.S. currencies need to stabilize before international stock markets can find a \u201cdurable bottom,\u201d according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Looking back, a strong dollar in tumultuous markets has been a fundamental sign of market stress since the early 2000s, Colas said in a recent note. \n\nStill, the relationship between a strong dollar and global market turmoil is a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem, said Brian Storey, senior portfolio manager at Brinker Capital Investments. \n\nThe dollar\u2019s continued rally comes as investors ditch assets viewed as risky as they look for havens amid fear of a global recession. The greenback\u2019s surge is also in part a result of currency carry trades, where investors borrow low-yielding currencies, such as Japanese yen, and convert them into high-yielding currencies, such as U.S. dollars, to capture higher interest rates, analysts said.\n\nThe U.S. federal-funds rate currently has a target range of 3%-3.25%, while the Japanese central bank has maintained its negative interest rates. \n\n\u201cAs the Fed gets more hawkish, fixed income and then U.S. yields are rising quickly, and that\u2019s attracting money to the U.S.,\u201d said Brent Donnelly, president at Spectra Markets. \u201cThen there\u2019s also a feedback loop, where the higher yields are making people nervous and selling equities, which leads to a safe haven buying of dollars as well,\u201d Donnelly said. \n\nThe 5-year Treasury TMUBMUSD05Y, 4.080% yield on Friday headed for its highest level since November 2007, while the 2-year yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 4.286% continued its climb toward a 15-year high.\n\nSee: A historic global bond-market crash threatens the liquidation of world\u2019s most crowded trades, says BofA\nHow could the dollar rally slow down? \n\nA pause in monetary tightening by Federal Reserve could serve to slow the dollar\u2019s advance. However, with inflation remaining heated and the Fed resolute in its fight against inflation, that appears to be a distant prospect.\n\nFed officials on Wednesday signaled that they would tolerate a hard landing, with the economy potentially falling into a recession, as part of its effort to bring down inflation. According to the Fed\u2019s forecast, the unemployment rate will rise to 4.4% next year, which is 0.7% higher than the current unemployment rate. In history, there has never been a situation where the unemployment rate rose more than about 0.5% without the economy entering recession. \n\n\u201cUntil something breaks, probably in the credit markets, the Fed is going to stay hawkish,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cWhat eventually breaks this cycle will be blowups in credit and in equities that eventually lead the Fed to send a different message,\u201d he said. \n\nSome investors are also keeping their hope up on collective actions by global central banks to rein the dollar\u2019s surge. \n\n\u201cIn the past, when this has become uncomfortable, we\u2019d say we cannot rule out a coordinated worldwide effort by central banks to stop the increase in the dollar, because it\u2019s causing so many problems,\u201d noted Mace McCain, president and chief investment officer at Frost Investment Advisors. \n\nMcCain cited the Plaza Accord, a joint agreement signed in 1985 by the world\u2019s largest economies to depreciate the U.S. dollar in relation to the French franc, the German Deutsche mark, yen and pound by intervening in currency markets. \n\nIn the current market environment, it may be still be the safest play for investors to hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, though they should also prepare for the possibility for global equity market, or the dollar, to stabilize sometime in the coming quarters, said Brinker\u2019s Storey.\n\nAll three major stock indexes ended the week in losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.00% lost 1.6% during the past week, ending Friday at its lowest since Nov. 20, 2020. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.72% dropped 1.7%. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.80% declined 1.8% for the week.\n\nNext week, investors will be eyeing the personal-consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation gauge, to be released Friday. \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-look-for-a-stock-market-bottom-until-a-soaring-dollar-cools-down-heres-why-11663969017?mod=mw_latestnews", "id": "xohl8r", "created_utc": 1664194422.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|76|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|857|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xohl8r)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xohl8r)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08039200305938721}, {"body": "imports should get cheaper. more drop in prices for junk.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "so i can buy that famous thing in the uk for 4% cheaper now?   if only i knew what they made that i wanted.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3602273762226105}, {"body": "No new bull till \ud83e\ude73s cover", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10190342366695404}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30159035325050354}, {"body": "If you look at the S&P 100, and how much of their revenue comes from outside the US, then its easy to see how terrible earnings will be for them until the dollar comes way off.
