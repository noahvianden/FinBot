You can't trade and you can't choose to exercise.\n\nI don't follow your logic here.  You opened a fairly narrow IC on MSFT, with the short legs at 215 and 225, when as far as I can tell MSFT was at 226.  Your short call was ITM at the time you opened it.\n\nThen MSFT was around 240 when you opened a 240/245 call credit spread.  The short call was ATM.  Both these were bad trades to begin with.\n\nThen you bought to close the 240 short from the spread.  (Both legs were ITM, so what was the logic behind not selling the long as well?)  At that point, you had the IC, whose call side was well ITM, and a 245 long call which was also ITM.\n\nI'm going to infer from context that you believe that's what your position was when you wrote this post.  But it wasn't.  There are two more trades, which occurred at 3:59PM.  I surmise that you didn't place those orders yourself; that was TDA closing positions on your behalf to minimize risk.  They closed the call side--both legs--of the IC.\n\nThey left the 245 long call open, though, which I'm not sure why they would do if they want to minimize risk, because it was ITM.

The short version is that you are playing with things you don't understand yet, and unless you look at $1k and think \"that's peanuts\" you need to take a step back and proceed with much more caution.\n\nHere's the longer version.  First, you don't seem to fully understand how the options work.  You should be paper trading and reading up on them until you're confident you know how they work, and then you'll probably still be hit by surprises that cost you money.\n\nSecond, you're trying to make expert level moves but also not doing it right even if you had called it correctly.  Your initial iron condor with one wing ITM basically says you expected MSFT to drop.  But it can't drop too far or it will breach the other wing, which was set at a level it touched only 3 days previous.  Even if you called the move correctly, the thing to do there would be to sell the 225-235 wing at the start, and wait for the move down... then sell the 205-215 wing.\n\nBasically your play is underpaid for the 205-215 wing if you're right on your call.\n\nNext up, the bear credit spread you sold is doubling down on a failing strategy.  You should always be careful when you do this.  In this case, an ATM bear credit spread obviously says you think this should go down... and you were actually correct for a while, it did drift down for a bit.  When you make a directional play, you need to recognize when you're beat and exit.  In this case you should probably have used a stop loss.\n\nAfter it rejected at around 240.75 then drifted downward you should have recognized that if it breaks above that 240.75 high it's likely to go much further.  So you should have estimated a stop loss for the value of your credit spread at a bit higher than that... say 241.

Although I think in the long term NVDA is a great stock, I think their upcoming earnings will not meet expectations. My reasons are:\n\n\\- Not nearly as much hype for their newly released 40 series GPU cards compared to their 30 series.\n\n\\- Supply issues during their 30 series release and insanely high prices distanced many people from even thinking about buying an NVIDIA GPU card.\n\n\\- China lockdowns and economic troubles, in addition to recent US chip industry sanctions might have affected their AI/cloud business over there.\n\nThe only reason I have some trepidation about shorting NVDA is that they might come up with a positive guidance for future quarter earnings.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Anyone else got an earnings-related play in mind?\n\nEdit: I forgot that Microsoft reported good revenue in their Azure/cloud business, of which NVDA is a partner.

{"title": "The inflation has been beaten! We are going to all-time highs again! (No)", "selftext": "So, inflation in the US began to slow down, and this caused euphoria in the markets. But if you think about it, why did inflation go down? This is due to the sharp tightening of the Fed's monetary policy. Current lending rates for consumers and businesses are starting to become almost prohibitive. After all, the Fed's key rate is now at 4%. But no one will really give anyone a loan at 4%. After all, even the annual LIBOR for the banks of the first circle is at the level of 5.5%. Mortgage loans for 30 years are issued at 7% or more, etc.\n\nThus, the Fed's rate hike began to lead to a sharp cooling in final demand. But in the structure of US GDP, it is consumption that occupies about 70%. It is easy to guess that in the face of falling consumption, GDP will begin to decline. And if in previous years the Fed almost immediately began to reduce the rate in order to stimulate demand, then this will not work in the near future. Yes, inflation is showing signs of decline, but 7.7% is still a lot. And if the Fed only hints that it wants to lower the rate, inflation expectations will begin to rise almost instantly. And everything will return to normal again. All the Fed's previous work to fight inflation will go down the drain.\n\nSo ahead of the US economy is waiting for a further decline in aggregate demand and recession. Now the question is, how will the recession affect the stock market? What will happen to the revenue of most companies? How will the consumer behave when the unemployment rate starts to rise? It is difficult to imagine how the stock market will rise in such conditions with the Fed's \u201cprinting press\u201d turned off.", "id": "ysmsu3", "created_utc": 1668200031.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ysmsu3)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ysmsu3)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.020718056708574295}, {"body": "My boomer dad legitimately asked me if this 7% in a day was real.

Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. \n\nThis COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question \u201cwhat would the catalyst for such a drop be?\u201d Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn\u2019t much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. \n\nSo if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is \u201cwhere are we going? How high are we going to go?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0byl8v7iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6526517148b713a6e8f9d5b1479a461453f70ef4\n\nLooking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. \n\nHowever, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da\n\nNow if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn\u2019t break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. \n\nNext weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. \n\nI am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don\u2019t see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking \u201cbottoms in\u201d and they don\u2019t wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. \n\nFor me I wouldn\u2019t take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  \n\nKey support- 390 -> 375.8\n\nKey resistance- 399.5 -> 409\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsh6qf19iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=37480d73ed532dbcf135bcbc441cd0d4c96b2ccb\n\nSimilar case here on the Futures daily we haven\u2019t quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pckivin9iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dfefe3d32067d209c5c88a44bf8c63958271866\n\nWhen we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. \n\nSupport- 3915 -> 3770 -> 3705\n\nResistance- 4000 -> 4085 -> 4152 (bear market resistance\u2026 3.8% from close) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gujyi6aiez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=360b546b00bd44331a7b88507f0de893810f1228\n\nApple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v0exaraiez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31939546e40711ce5d2787140850194ebbc40942\n\nThe weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. \n\nKey support- 147.2 -> 141.3 -> 138.2\n\nKey resistance- 150.5 -> 151.9 -> 155.8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p063lc9biez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db46ba341aa1896eb847429b9cec3b2700ce0a6\n\nTesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. \n\nTesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bh9pavbiez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fca84522336e34f5b4b1127819a44f38bf570a2\n\nI actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. \n\nKey support- 195.8 -> 177.8 -> 167.9\n\nKey resistance- 207.3 -> 228.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hyg1mbzciez91.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07afd85e27a9d363318b1eff870b95193e5597e\n\nThe VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. \n\nThis kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don\u2019t see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? \n\nThere might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. \n\nRemember guys\u2026 CASH is a position! We don\u2019t always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself. \n\n$5k/ 10% challenge- \n\nOfficially went live with this challenge today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kj196eodiez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d71b1a1eb78fbf42f4d8c15814297264ae8356\n\nI will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000. \n\nDaily log- \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvf9xcgeiez91.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc6a3aa673c08c15c8c0ff848c07ab526001369\n\nOverall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play\u2026 if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. \n\nI also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. \n\nThis week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not. In review you can see that my win rate was much lower on them, however, profitability wise I actually was very successful. Something some fail to remember is that win rate doesn\u2019t always equal profits. For this week low win rate still netted profits. \n\nI am always learning and always critiquing my strategy. I will continue to monitor my L2Ls and see how next week shapes up. \n\nYOUTUBE will be up later!\n\nHow did your week finish?", "id": "yspok9", "created_utc": 1668207012.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3620|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxvyrg/52522_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w5k3q1/the_only_fomc_week_ta_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxkm5u/71222_spy_es_futures_daily_ta_and_cpi_swing_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yspok9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yspok9)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5107475519180298}, {"body": ">It was a great week for me.

But it is its surrounding environment which has been (and still is) transforming.\n\nThink about it ... if you were the owner of the Tupperware company on the brink of bankruptcy and out of nowhere a Genie appeared who granted you one wish, what would your wish be? That wish would likely be for everyone to return to work as if it were pre-pandemic days ... and that is actually starting to happen!\n\nIf that same Genie granted you a second wish, it would be that people would have less disposable income ... and that is also happening with the looming recession. Less disposable income affects discretionary spending habits ... so there should be less money for toys, trips, and unnecessary meals out. But people still need to eat in order to survive ... so they will just continue to do so in a more thrifty manner.\n\nThe aforementioned two wishes appear to be happening organically. Outside of those wishes, perhaps wishing for a buyout from a larger company would be a good idea ... and who knows, I suppose that is still a possibility?\n\nHowever, if you are wishing for interest rates to return to generational lows as they were for the past decade or so, that same Genie would probably first need to make call Jerome Powell ... and when he gets off that call, he's gonna look at you and say \"sorry, can't do that.\"", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34008508920669556}, {"body": "Hmmp", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.044367119669914246}, {"body": "I hope you did buy in at that time..", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1146855428814888}, {"body": "I re-use washed Chinese food take out containers.
