The central bank has increased its benchmark rate half a dozen times this year, taking the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75%-4%, and is expected to hike a few more times before stopping.\n\nIn recent days, Fed officials have said they expect smaller increases ahead than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases, the most recent of which came in early November. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is addressing the public Wednesday afternoon in a speech to be delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/elon-musk-says-the-fed-must-cut-rates-immediately-to-stop-a-severe-recession.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/elon-musk-says-the-fed-must-cut-rates-immediately-to-stop-a-severe-recession.html)", "id": "z8u4bw", "created_utc": 1669821552.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "For $200, what a highly leveraged debtor would say.", "score": 28, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29217708110809326}, {"body": "I think the word Elon is going to need a \u201cTrigger warning\u201d label on Reddit soon", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42521199584007263}, {"body": "Lol Elon can\u2019t pay his interest bill lol", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Basic economics agrees with musk.", "score": -13, "replies": [{"body": "*slurp*", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "It's funny how everyone was slurping him a few months ago, now that you guys don't like what his politics are he is such a horrible person now", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "Slurped him when one thought he was smart and an okay person.

{"title": "Fed Chair Powell says smaller interest rate hikes could start in December", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in December.\n* But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.\n* \u201cWe will stay the course until the job is done,\u201d he said during a speech in Washington, D.C. at the Brookings Institution.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead even as he sees progress in the fight against inflation as largely inadequate.\n\nEchoing recent statements from other central bank officials and comments at the November Fed meeting, Powell said he sees the central bank in position to reduce the size of rate hikes as soon as next month.\n\nBut he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.\n\n\u201cDespite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,\u201d Powell said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe chairman noted that policy moves such as interest rate increases and the reduction of the Fed\u2019s bond holdings generally take time to make their way through the system.\n\n\u201cThus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,\u201d he added. \u201cThe time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.\u201d\n\nMarkets already had been pricing in about a 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four successive 0.75-point moves, according to CME Group data. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is where the Fed goes from there. With markets pricing in the likelihood of rate cuts later in 2023, Powell instead warned that restrictive policy will stay in place until inflation shows more consistent signs of receding.\n\n\u201cGiven our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,\u201d Powell said.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will stay the course until the job is done.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s remarks come with some halting signs that inflation is ebbing and the ultra-tight labor market is loosening.\n\nEarlier this month, the consumer price index indicated inflation rising but by less than what economists had estimated. Separate reports Wednesday showed private payroll growth far lower than expected in November while job openings also declined.\n\nHowever, Powell said short-term data can be deceptive and he needs to see more consistent evidence.\n\nFor instance, he said Fed economists expect that the central bank\u2019s preferred core personal consumption expenditures price index in October, to be released Thursday, will show inflation running at a 5% annual pace. That would be down from 5.1% in September but still well ahead of the Fed\u2019s 2% long-run target.\n\n\u201cIt will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBy any standard, inflation remains much too high.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will simply say that we have more ground to cover,\u201d he added.\n\nPowell added that he expects the ultimate peak for rates \u2013 the \u201cterminal rate\u201d \u2013 will be \u201csomewhat higher than thought\u201d when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee members made their last projections in September. Committee members at the time said they expected the terminal rate to hit 4.6%; markets now see it in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CME Group data.\n\nSupply chain issues at the core of the inflation burst have eased, Powell said, while growth broadly as slowed to below trend, even with a 2.9% annualized gain in third-quarter GDP. He expects housing inflation to rise into next year but then likely fall.\n\nHowever, he said the labor market has shown \u201conly tentative signs of rebalancing\u201d after job openings had outnumbered available workers by a 2 to 1 margin. That gap has closed to 1.7 to 1 but remains well above historical norms.\n\nThe tight labor market has resulted in a big boost in worker wages that nonetheless have failed to keep up with inflation.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation,\u201d he said.\n\nPowell spoke at length about the factors keeping labor force participation low, a key factor in addressing the imbalance between open jobs and available workers. He said an important issue as been \u201cexcess retirements\u201d during the Covid pandemic.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-smaller-rate-hikes-could-come-in-december.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-smaller-rate-hikes-could-come-in-december.html)\n\nLink to the speech: [https://www.brookings.edu/events/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-the-economic-outlook-and-the-labor-market/](https://www.brookings.edu/events/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-the-economic-outlook-and-the-labor-market/)", "id": "z8zujf", "created_utc": 1669834796.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Can\u2019t wait to see the carnage when they raise 75 bips in December \n\n\u201cI said *could* guys\u201d - J Pizzle", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Right?
