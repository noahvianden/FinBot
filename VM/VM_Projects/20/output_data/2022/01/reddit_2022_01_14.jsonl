{"title": "Morning Update for Friday, 1/14/22", "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Have a nice Friday, and enjoy the long weekend :)\n\n*These posts are for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.*\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP:\n\n* LVS: Premarket resistance at \\~42.50. Will want to see it find support above 41, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down. Will be watching for upwards movement if it holds up.\n* WYNN: Potential support levels at 91 and 90. Relevant resistance at \\~95.\u00a0\n* MGM: Potential support level at 46, will be watching to see if it holds up or breaks down.\u00a0\n* WFC: Potential support level at 56.75. Will watch for more upwards movement if it holds up, could provide shorting opportunities if it breaks down.\n* UVXY: Will be looking to trade this if we see continued weakness from the overall market, I like watching SPY for reference.\u00a0\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* NVAX: Potential support/resistance level right around \\~100, will be watching for potential ORB setup.\u00a0\n* MRNA: Potential support/resistance level at \\~200. Will be looking for shorting opportunities if we break down and cannot recover. If it reclaims the 200 level, there is room for upside.\u00a0\n* TSLA: Will be watching for shorting opportunities down towards potential support level at 1,000. Could see a retrace towards 950 support if it sees continued weakness.\u00a0\n* JPM: Potential resistance level at 164. Will be watching for shorting opportunities if it fails to get back above that level.\u00a0\n* NET: Looking bearish after breaking down below 100 support in yesterday's trading. Potential support at 96, will watch for shorting opportunities if it breaks down.\u00a0\n* TSM: Potential support level at 135, will be watching for shorting opportunities if it breaks down.\u00a0\n* ZM: Potential support level at 160, will watch for shorting opportunities if it breaks down.\u00a0\n* SRC: Potential resistance level at 48. Will be watching for more weakness if it breaks down.\u00a0\n\n**Momentum Watchlist:**\n\n* MLCO: Potential premarket support around \\~10.40. Won't be too interested in trading it if it breaks down and cannot recover.\u00a0\n\nNot much looking great for the momentum list at the moment, could be worth running the scanner a few more times before market open.\u00a0\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks\u00a0are\u00a0looking to open lower after we saw some selling off in yesterday's session. The Federal Reserve has indicated that they could raise interest rates \"as soon as asset purchases are terminated\". The Fed is currently on track to end the tapering process in March, so the market seems to be pricing in the likely rate hike. With inflation continuing to run rampant, financial policy will continue to be a hot topic of discussion in the coming months. Omicron concerns seem to be taking a backseat to financial policy and inflation at the moment. I think it's worth noting that the omicron strain is notably less severe; if we get a more severe mutation, it could cause real problems for global markets.\u00a0\n\nS&P Futures are down \\~60 basis points,\u00a0Dow Futures\u00a0are down \\~60 basis points, and\u00a0Nasdaq Futures are\u00a0down \\~80 basis points. Gold\u00a0is trading flat this morning, while silver is down a bit. Crude oil\u00a0is\u00a0also trading a bit lower, but still holding above the $80 level. Banks are mixed after reporting earnings. WFC is trading slightly higher after positive results, while JPM and C are gapping down after expressing concern over rising labor costs. Semiconductor stocks\u00a0are down in premarket trading after selling off on Thursday. We saw weakness from tech stocks in yesterday's session; I'll be looking for more of the same today, although we could see a bounce. Vaccine-related stocks are seeing weakness in premarket, should see heavy volume in today's session. Airlines and cruise stocks\u00a0are\u00a0down a bit after seeing decent strength yesterday. Most are still hovering around resistance levels. The crypto market\u00a0is\u00a0down a bit after seeing some more red yesterday. Bitcoin is\u00a0currently trading around 42,300. We'll see if it can find support above the 40,000 level, but could be in for some more choppiness. Crypto-related stocks\u00a0are down in premarket trading as a result.\n\nRemember to use proper risk management; size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter.

Have a wonderful long weekend.*\n\nStocks ended the day mixed in another highly volatile session, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pushing sharply higher in the last hour of the session to close higher after trading in the red most of the day. \n\nMarket participants digested the latest CPI and PPI numbers, new commentary by Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and newly released monthly US retail sales report and a mixed set of earnings reports from big banks.\n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.05%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.62%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.56%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.14%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.17%\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +3.12%\n* Shopify (SHOP): +3.62%\n* Las Vegas Sands (LVS): +14.15%\n* Gamestop (GME): -4.76%\n\nUS retail sales slumped by the most in 10 months, suggesting that the current pace of inflation coupled with surging Omicron infections are taking their toll on consumer spending. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that US retail sales decreased -1.9% in December, slumping after a revised +0.2% in November, and greatly missing the -0.01% drop expected by economists. \n\n10 of the 13 retail categories showed declines in receipts last month, led by non-store retailers, which includes e-commerce. Those sales plummeted 8.7% from a month earlier.\n\nDepartment-store receipts decreased 7% after a 5.5% drop in November. Sales at furniture stores, electronics outlets, and sporting goods establishments also fell.\n\nReceipts at restaurants and bars, the report\u2019s only services-oriented category and a sign of omicron\u2019s early impact, dropped 0.8% after rising the prior month.\n\nMotor vehicle sales declined 0.4%. Automakers last year struggled to meet demand as production efforts were hampered by shortages of semiconductors are parts. The result was fewer vehicles on dealer lots and limited choices for buyers.\n\nThe government\u2019s report showed retail sales, excluding volatile gasoline and motor vehicles prices, slumped -2.5% in December.\n\nHere is the full retail sales report: [https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts\\_current.pdf](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)\n\nIn her confirmation hearing before Congress, newly re-elected Fed Governor Lael Brainard suggested the central bank could begin raising interest rates \u2014 a move that would tighten financial conditions and help bring down inflation \u2014 \"as soon as asset purchases are terminated.\" The Federal Reserve is currently set to end its asset-purchase tapering process in March. \n\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nMatthew Miskin, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Managemen, said \u201cTwo of the biggest things have been the supply chain disruptions and the fiscal stimulus. As the pandemic comes more under control this year, as the Omicron wave hopefully dissipates, we likely see the supply chain disruptions come off, and then we\u2019re not going to get more fiscal stimulus ... That in our view does cause inflation to come down over the course of the year.\" \n\nEarnings season is kicking off, with big financial institutions reporting earnings this morning. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares fell more than 5% after the company [posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter ](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2021/4th-quarter/ae462261-4964-48c6-b947-4b69963d1143.pdf)trading revenues and rising costs as compensation expenses increased. The stock drop marked JPMorgan's worst post-earnings decline since 2011. Citigroup (C) shares also fell after posting a similar miss on fixed-income and equities trading revenues for the quarter.  Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose, on the other hand, after [posting quarterly revenue](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2021-earnings.pdf) that topped estimates as both commercial and consumer loans picked up at the end of last year. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Biden administration announced its nominees to fill out the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, tapping Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa Cook, and Philip Jefferson for the roles. Each nominee must still go before the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation.\n* According to new Federal Reserve data Friday, manufacturing output declined by 0.3% in December to reverse course after a 0.6% rise in November. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.3% monthly rise in production in December, based on Bloomberg data. Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of overall economic activity in the U.S. \n* The [University of Michigan's preliminary January Surveys of Consumers index](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) came in at 68.8, falling from December's 70.6.

As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that US retail sales decreased -1.9% in December, slumping after a revised +0.2% in November, and greatly missing the -0.01% drop expected by economists. \n\n10 of the 13 retail categories showed declines in receipts last month, led by non-store retailers, which includes e-commerce. Those sales plummeted 8.7% from a month earlier.\n\nDepartment-store receipts decreased 7% after a 5.5% drop in November. Sales at furniture stores, electronics outlets, and sporting goods establishments also fell.\n\nReceipts at restaurants and bars, the report\u2019s only services-oriented category and a sign of omicron\u2019s early impact, dropped 0.8% after rising the prior month.\n\nMotor vehicle sales declined 0.4%. Automakers last year struggled to meet demand as production efforts were hampered by shortages of semiconductors are parts. The result was fewer vehicles on dealer lots and limited choices for buyers.\n\nThe government\u2019s report showed retail sales, excluding volatile gasoline and motor vehicles prices, slumped -2.5% in December.\n\nHere is the full retail sales report: [https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts\\_current.pdf](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)\n\nIn her confirmation hearing before Congress, newly re-elected Fed Governor Lael Brainard suggested the central bank could begin raising interest rates \u2014 a move that would tighten financial conditions and help bring down inflation \u2014 \"as soon as asset purchases are terminated.\" The Federal Reserve is currently set to end its asset-purchase tapering process in March. \n\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.\n\nMatthew Miskin, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Managemen, said \u201cTwo of the biggest things have been the supply chain disruptions and the fiscal stimulus. As the pandemic comes more under control this year, as the Omicron wave hopefully dissipates, we likely see the supply chain disruptions come off, and then we\u2019re not going to get more fiscal stimulus ...

The stock drop marked JPMorgan's worst post-earnings decline since 2011. Citigroup (C) shares also fell after posting a similar miss on fixed-income and equities trading revenues for the quarter.  Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose, on the other hand, after [posting quarterly revenue](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2021-earnings.pdf) that topped estimates as both commercial and consumer loans picked up at the end of last year. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Biden administration announced its nominees to fill out the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, tapping Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa Cook, and Philip Jefferson for the roles. Each nominee must still go before the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation.\n* According to new Federal Reserve data Friday, manufacturing output declined by 0.3% in December to reverse course after a 0.6% rise in November. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.3% monthly rise in production in December, based on Bloomberg data. Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of overall economic activity in the U.S. \n* The [University of Michigan's preliminary January Surveys of Consumers index](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) came in at 68.8, falling from December's 70.6.

{"title": "Tonight's \"scary data\" has the risk of blowing up, how will it stir the market?", "selftext": "The monthly U.S. retail sales rate for December will be released today and the market is expecting a 0% rate, which is lower than the previous value of 0.3%.\n\nRetail data is a key indicator of the state of the U.S. economy, as it shows the spending of U.S. consumers, which accounts for 70% of the U.S. GDP. Previously, this data was also called scary data because it always stirred up big market sentiment, but in recent months, the market impact of retail data has diminished.\n\nSo far, U.S. retail sales have increased by about 22% from pre-epidemic levels, even though the job market has not yet returned to pre-epidemic levels. However, this increase is likely to be followed by a narrowing of the trend.\n\nWells Fargo predicts that U.S. retail sales are likely to be flat in December. It pointed out that retail sales in November has been significantly lower than expected, and the price of essential items such as food and gasoline rose, squeezing consumers to buy optional consumer goods (such as electronics) space. Consumer spending growth is expected to slow further in December, with the monthly rate expected to fall to 0.2%, a four-month low. In addition to rising prices, the Omicron variant of the virus also puts retail sales at downside risk, especially in the service sector.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, one of the largest U.S. credit card issuers, also reported in December that credit card spending in the period from Thanksgiving (Nov. 25) to early December in November 2021 is worse than in 2020 during the pandemic, not to mention 2019 before the epidemic. According to Daniel Silver, an economist at the bank, these figures mean that U.S. retail sales data for December could be more \"pessimistic\".\n\nThe latest credit and debit card spending data from Bank of America also indicate that the slowdown in retail sales in December was much larger than the market expected: as shown in the chart below, Bank of America expects December retail sales to register a monthly rate of -1.3%, a 1.6% decline in retail sales excluding autos, and a 2.0% decline in retail sales excluding autos and gasoline.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clb10znolnb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=92da195c49a8e9649fd29362f1847bd240c85a8a\n\nBank of America mentioned that the bigger question is when retail spending will start to show a long-term decline, especially among lower income groups.\n\nIn terms of market impact, analysts point out that if the retail data released tonight disappoints, the dollar fears a further blow, thus driving gold prices to continue to rise.\n\nThe dollar has been sluggish this week, touching 94.63 from a high of 96.24 at the beginning of the week, and is now running below the 95 mark. Analysts point out that the dollar is struggling to find demand support for the time being, as this week's developments suggest that the Fed can remain patient in terms of policy tightening, and the retail sales report itself is unlikely to change that.\n\nThe market has now largely digested the expectation that the Fed will raise interest rates in March. The latest U.S. federal funds rate futures show that the probability of the Fed raising interest rates in March is 90.5%.

The interesting part is considering how they will get the US (and other places) to adopt a digital currency. Current syrup is taxed as an asset and a straight up headache for traders, miners, and investors. I think that to incentivize adoption of a national syrup currency, the IRS will bend the rules that allow CBDC's to be treated 'as-cash' for accounting and tax reasons, while maintaining that other syrup is still to be treated as an \"asset\", which includes USDT. Obviously people will keep using and trading regular syrup, but the tax crackdowns will get worse and worse to disincentivize this. Visa will make insane profits by controlling national currency tech, and then will use those profits to lobby non-CBDC syrup laws.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Stfu already how do I make money?\"\n\nLong VISA because VISA will win in the end, especially in countries where inflation runs rampant and CBDC will reign supreme.
