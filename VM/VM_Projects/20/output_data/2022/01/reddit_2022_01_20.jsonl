Didn't wanna short on the lows, and well, missed it. My target was 120. This market just broke under some key support levels, so it could be a bloody bit of time before the fed starts to disclose actual rate hike numbers and we see how the runoff will affect our markets. Or the market could rally back up to 470 before trickling down again. I don't think we print new highs until the second half of this year at the earliest though. \n\nMy point is, AMD could rally from 120 back up into the high 30s, and if it does that you could get out with 0 loss, then reposition once it rotates back down. Or it could keep crashing down to 70, or lower .. I would see what the market does tomorrow at least. If there's no fight and its just a sell off, id trade with the trend and preserve your capital, but if the market wants to bounce, you may be able to get out at a better price. \n\nAnother option is to just derisk, by reducing your position sizes. That way if it does rally, you still have some exposure, and if it crashes, you have less exposure and more cash to buy at a lower price. \n\nA true investor would just continue to hold and buy more as funds allow.

There is also a consideration to be made for the market conditions at hand. As a result, when you are entering into a CSP as part of the wheel, if the stock trends down, you need to look at 1) the stock itself and what may be the cause and 2) the overall market conditions.\n\nIf you have a stock which is selling off while the overall market is flat or moving up, this should be a red flag and you need to determine how much risk you are willing to take in this environment. The main risk is that if the stock is selling while the market is recovering, AND selling when the market is selling, then you are getting into a situation where you may simply catch knives if your puts get assigned.\n\nTo this end, and while it may suck, you need to set a price stop loss on your underlying, and close the CSPs out or sell the shares when that happens. This should be done for all trades you set up, because quite frankly FOMO and emotions will kick in and you'll second guess yourself and potentially make a counter-productive move against your own plan.\n\nMy personal approach from multiple painful experiences is to set a financial cap on my involvement in the position, and close the position if it gets there.

{"title": "8 large-cap stocks shrink more than 50% in value; is the S&P 500 about to plunge?", "selftext": "The selloff in technology stocks continues, and some investors are skeptical that a bear market in U.S. stocks has arrived. Three major indexes fell overnight, with the Nasdaq down more than 1%.\n\nMore than one-fifth of the STOCKS in the S&P 500 are now down 20% or more from their highest closing prices of the past 52 weeks. That sent more than 100 S&P 500 stocks, including giants like consumer Penn National Gaming (Penn), communications services ViacomCBS (VIAC) and health care Moderna(MRNA), into a bear market correction. A fall of 20% or more from a high is the usual definition of a bear market.\n\nEight S&P 500 stocks have even lost more than half their value from their highs, and investors have lost $2.4 trillion this year alone, according to Wilshire Associates, an independent investment manager.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txetaf90qsc81.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=a00efa4d30d3107dcd9a1fb52e55594d9868c6b8\n\nGeorge Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG, said: \"The risk of reduced fiscal support going forward, coupled with the Fed's fight against inflation in 2022, could end up materially tightening financial conditions. This could end up pushing the economy back to the stagnation of the early 19th century, or worse -- ultimately shortening the business cycle.\"\n\nOn a broad level, the S&P 500 is not yet in a correction, let alone a full-blown bear market. However, a large number of stock holders have felt the \"pain\" of the correction.\n\nAfter Wednesday's selloff, the S&P 500 is now down more than 5% from its Jan. 4, 2022 closing high, which may not sound so bad.\n\nBut growth stocks have been the driving force of the S&P 500 for years, hitting their peak late last year and now entering a correction. Many large-cap growth stocks are close to a 10% correction, and even the seemingly unstoppable Technology Select SECTOR SPDR ETF (XLK) is down nearly 10% from its December 28 peak.\n\nIn addition, four S&P 500 stocks have fallen 60% or more from their highs. Another eight S&P 500 stocks are down 40% to 60% from their highs. Another 94 stocks fell between 20 and 40 per cent. That doesn't even include the 158 stocks in the s&p 500 that are in the midst of a correction, but they're not in a bear market yet because they're down between 10% and 20%.\n\nAll of these statistics also say something about how badly some investors have been hurt. Some S&P 500 stocks caught up in the meme stock craze have been particularly hard hit. Shares of Penn National Gaming are now down 70% from their March 15, 2021, high. The stock is down nearly 18 per cent this year alone.\n\nShares of ViacomCBS, a money-driven company at the height of the pandemic, are moving in the other direction, also down more than 60% from their March 22, 2021 high and up more than 16% this year.\n\nEven some solid, fast-growing companies were hurt in the sell-off. Moderna, the maker of one of the world's most important COVID-19 vaccines, has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, with investors losing more than 64% from its Aug. 10, 2021, high.\n\nInvestors in the S&P 500 May be hoping that a full-blown bear market doesn't come.
