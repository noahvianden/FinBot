This generally amounts to very little being in school full time.  This year, we are talking about $500.\n\nLast year, we discussed what to buy together and decided it might be a good time to purchase BP stock.  We did fairly well with this investment over the last year, it returned about 35% with about $70 in dividends.\n\nIt's time to have this conversation with her again on what to buy.  We both have been discussing inflation recently and while she doesn't understand all the nuances of what's happening, we both feel the stock market may be teetering a bit and is heading for a correction soon.\n\nSo my question is, what to buy?  I did a google search for stocks that have done well during times of recession but I thought I would ask for more specific advice here.  For me personally, I always have felt good about an S&P index fund, but I want her to be able to pick out a specific company, one that pays dividends.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, January 27, 2022. Another volatile day", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 27, 2022**\n\nThe trend for this week continues with another exceptionally volatile day, with stocks opening the day higher before dropping sharply in the afternoon. However, after closing red, both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) turned green after-hours on the back of Apple\u2019s (AAPL) monster earnings report. \n\nMarket participants continue to digest yesterday\u2019s FOMC statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s news conference and newly released US GDP data. \n\n**Markets Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.49 \n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.01% \n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.03% \n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.27% \n* Volatility Index (VIX): -4.60%\n* Apple (AAPL): +4.50% after-hours\n* Tesla (TSLA): -11.55%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): -14.10%\n* Lending Club (LC): -28.13%\n* Teradyne (TER): -22.44%\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. For the full-year 2021, GDP grew at a 5.7% rate, marking the fastest since 1984. And this marked a sharp reversal from the contraction seen in the economy in 2020 when GDP shrank by 3.4%. Here were the main metrics from the print, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\n* **GDP quarter-over-quarter, annualized:** 6.9% vs. 5.5% expected, 2.3% in Q3\n* **Personal consumption:** 3.3% vs. 3.4% expected, 2.0% in Q3\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter**: 4.9% vs. 4.9% expected, 4.6% in Q3\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s monetary policy decision, the Fed held rates at near-zero and reaffirmed plans to finish tapering by March, at which point we will likely see the first interest rate hike of the year. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand \u2014 particularly for goods.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said, \u201cWith inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March\u201d. It is likely the first interest hike will come either in March or April, after the Fed completes tapering.\n\nHere is the entire statement: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf)\n\nIn his press conference following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said, \u201cI would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming conditions are appropriate for doing so. \n\nBut the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed that \u201cit will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,\u201d and Powell\u2019s commentary suggests the first increase will happen on March 16.\n\nCharlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said \u201cWhile offering some clarity on how the Fed would begin the process of removing policy accommodation, the outcome of the meeting fell short in providing the needed guidance on the timing and magnitude of the shift in policy. Today\u2019s meeting has market participants fully convinced that a March hike is certain, but with Chairman Powell not making any timing commitments, the door is slightly open for a slower moving Fed.\"\n\nThe Labor Department released its weekly jobless report, which showed first-time claims unexpectedly jumping to the highest level since October 2021, potentially a sign of renewed virus-related disruptions due to the surge of Omicron. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 286,000 vs. 225,000 expected and a revised 231,000 during the prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 1.635 million vs. 1.563 million expected and a revised 1.551 million during the prior week\n\nDespite notching a quarterly profit and sales well above analyst estimates for the fourth quarter, shares of Tesla closed down 11.55% to $829.10 a piece after the electric vehicle maker admitted supply chain woes were likely to strain operations and halt new vehicle launches this year. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $2.52 per share, vs. $2.36 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $17.72 billion, vs. $16.57 billion expected, up 65% YoY\n* **Auto Sales:** $15.97 billion, up 71% YoY\n* **Energy Generation & Storage:** $688 million vs $815.5 million expected, down 8% YoY\n* **Gross Margin:** 27.4% vs 26.6% the previous quarter\n* **Net Income**: $2.32 billion, up a staggering 760% YoY\n\nApple (AAPL), the largest company in the stock market, gapped up 4% at the time of writing after reporting exceptional earnings, which showed sales grew despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions. Apple lifted the SPY and QQQ, which turned green after-hours on the back of Apple\u2019s beat. Here are the numbers: \n\n* **EPS**: $2.10 vs. $1.89 estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **Revenue**: $123.9 billion vs. $118.66 billion estimated, up 11% year-over-year\n* **iPhone revenue**: $71.63 billion vs. $68.34 billion estimated, up 9% year-over-year\n* **Services revenue**: $19.52 billion vs. $18.61 billion estimated, up 24% year-over-year\n* **Other Products revenue**: $14.70 billion vs. $14.59 billion estimated, up 13% year-over-year\n* **Mac revenue**: $10.85 billion vs. $9.52 billion estimated, up 25% year-over-year\n* **iPad revenue**: $7.25 billion vs. $8.18 billion estimated, down 14% year-over-year\n* **Gross margin**: 43.8% vs. 41.7% estimated\n\nTim Cook said, \u201cWhat we expect for the March quarter is solid year-over-year revenue growth.

{"title": "Bull or Bear? Time for Some deep dive analysis.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly Chart S&P-500](https://preview.redd.it/q1w0b2rna5e81.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b7b06d2fd0c2274a26250e89f19421e26d9460a)\n\nBased on the Weekly chart we are still in the uptrend. We are laying right over the 50 week moving average, which may be support. However, this doesnt tell u much, which i why I present to you the daily chart. This chart contains a very interesting patter than may indicate this trend is still bullish, although weakening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily Char S&P- 500](https://preview.redd.it/nl9jw6jzb5e81.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=001df90289c516cc3a2d14546d4dd44ef7957c91)\n\nWell  what makes it interesting you may be asking your self? Its clear we have respected the 50 day moving average consistantly over the past year, except for two times. Previously during September-November and now. During the fall we ripped past the 50 day moving average, and bounced on the long term trend line. This time bears got more aggressive, and didnt respect either the 50 day moving average or the long term trend line. This pattern of bigger and bigger drop consecutively means that bears are willing to short lower and lower. This is definitely a bearish. However, on the flip side it means that the market is willing to support bigger swings, yet still move up the trend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the bears are growing in strength I think we will repeat September- Novembers pattern, and go up despite breaking major support areas. Last time the long term trend line was respected, and I think this time the 200 day moving average is going to be respected. However, if you are bag holding positions, I recommend you dump them on the recovery to of this down swing, as I do believe the next swing low will be much greater. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat to watch for?\n\nWell if you balls I recommend buying tomorrow, however if your a wuss I recommend you buy on the break above the 200 moving average. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to the fundamental side of things for you nerds:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[10 Yr Yields vs FWD Looking S&P](https://preview.redd.it/2r6r9dzlf5e81.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=446d9b8423d66eb3b7db0d88b1c874cd81ccc291)\n\nWell we all know that rates are going up one way or another, unless some how covid supply issues go away. Well, is this bad for stocks? The answer is surprisingly no. Above you can see as rates go up, the stocks go up too. However, a subtle detail you probably cant spot in that chart clearly, is that the initial reaction to lower rates is always lower stock prices, while the 6 month - 24 month reaction is positive returns in the market. \n\nCheck it out here:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/24/correlation-between-the-10-year-and-sp-500-could-point-to-new-highs.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/24/correlation-between-the-10-year-and-sp-500-could-point-to-new-highs.html)\n\nIn essence, 23 times that the 10 yr went up, the SP500 went up higher 19 out of 23 of those times. Since 1996, 11 out of 11 times that the rates went up, the SP500 went up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary:\n\nIn summary, if you combine the above fundamental factors with a a green close by the end of this week or next week, I think we are pose for a move higher.\n\nI end this DD with this chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart SP500](https://preview.redd.it/59k0kmvvi5e81.png?width=1711&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7cfb36c0bbfdd5d557575cb19237c047e8ae6e)\n\nHighlighted is every time we touched the 200 day moving averaged and subsequently bounced, while the blue hammers are times when we kept drilling. The one scary part is that the 2019 hammer drop is in sync with higher rates, but we all know what happend next. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nForgive my English...", "id": "sdozw4", "created_utc": 1643255253.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Futures trashed bruv", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19011840224266052}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.044252656400203705}, {"body": "Great big grizzly bear - both fundamentals and technical analysis points this direction", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.49496275186538696}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)puts on everything", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0749693512916565}, {"body": "You're too early.

{"title": "The problem with bubbles", "selftext": "In terms of bias, I\u2019m 60% cash, 40% invested in broad-based ETFs, and looking to purchase a home. \n\nInflation and investor capital is fucking the average American. Everyone knows home prices are up 30% in 18 months, and the root cause is investor capital pouring into income assets outside of the bond market. \n\nTypically, the best form of income for a conservative part of the portfolio are bonds. Debt that is owed is packaged together and traded in the market as a bond. The bond market, however, was decimated by the FED. Markets work well because of the natural forces of supply and demand. The FED artificially flooded the market to keep us afloat in one of the most uncertain periods in American history, and I personally agree with their efforts. \n\nThat being said, we are beyond the stages of transitory inflation and are obviously not fixing it in a natural fashion. The FED must act, and they are not acting fast enough. The longer they wait to raise rates and cut the balance sheet (where they hold all these bonds they\u2019ve bought) the more investors there are piling into income generating sections of the market (real estate, dividend stocks, etc.) \n\nAs a future home buyer who is witnessing people take 50% DTI (debt to income) to purchase a modest house with some debt on the side (auto, student loans, etc), it\u2019s sad as fuck. Investors (both institutional and retail folks buying a house to rent out) are injecting obscene amounts of capital into real estate because of the low rates. \n\nI know, I know, this is not rocket science to the sophisticated investor, but it is causing a bubble of debt for the middle class of America. As SPY and QQQ continue to moon, albeit finally coming down in anticipation of rate hikes, the more debt common Americans are forced to take on. Yes, they are willingly taking on this debt, but it\u2019s closer to forced than willing due to the obscene costs of property, cars, etc.\n\nSo, I\u2019m biased, but a market pullback to force investors to place their capital in places away from main street America and into traditional assets (such as bonds) is a good sign. The bulls agree too, I bet, that we are in a bubble. I hope this doesn\u2019t result in an overcooked economy that will crash and be bailed out by common Americans.\n\nThis is evidently my opinion and not fact.", "id": "se63w2", "created_utc": 1643310812.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "We're all waiting for Russia to invade Ukraine.

The Fed is going to begin unloading their balance sheets. That means the money tap is fixing to be turned off. Furthermore, interest rates rising impacts EVERYONE, not just corporations. Loans are more expensive across the board. Coupled with inflation, it's a giant lead weight tied to the entire market. People are going to be spending a lot less money & higher interest eats into earnings. Add that to the fact that stocks are still extremely inflated post COVID. Zoom out on almost any major blue chip chart & you can see that we are in a giant bubble. \n\nThe Fed is also not providing any concrete schedule. This adds a lot of uncertainty to the market. Furthermore, asset management firms are advising clients sell the surges & not buy the dips. Which explains why every pop we have had lately is immediately sold off. \n\nAlso, today's GDP report contained some warning signs. Mainly that most of the growth came from companies stocking up on inventory instead of people buying things. We also cannot forget that everyone received stimulus checks last year. Those checks are not coming anymore. Thus, they are not being inserted into the economy.\n\n\nAnother giant problem is incoming monetary tightening is not like prior years. During those years, the fed began tightening when inflation was near the desired level of 2%. It was preemptive & designed to keep inflation from increasing versus pushing it down. Meaning the Fed had a lot more latitude in how & when to raise rates & respond to changing dynamics. This means they are going to have to raise rates & taper REGARDLESS of the economic data.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">The Fed is also not providing any concrete schedule.
