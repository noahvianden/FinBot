{"title": "Rate Hikes - How it affects - Analysis", "selftext": "Lets do a simple analysis here. \n\nTake the popular stock AAPL - PE is \\~28 at current price $163. Investors were willing to pay up to $182 for 1 share of this company at low interest rates environment. PE at 182 would have been \\~32. In other words earnings per 1$ of investment here would yield 1/32 = 3.125%. Now lets assume interest rates goes up one percentage due to FED hike. Its natural this causes a ripple effect in way banks lend, finance, bond markets etc...naturally investors will demand 1% more return from stocks as well (this is for debate I know). So lets say investors want 4.125% now, which would equate to PE of 1/.04125 = \\~24. Hence prices would need to come down by 25% (24/32) from ATH to make this feasible which equates to $136. Now lets say AAPL has 5% earnings growth (projection is actually less from analysts for 2022 - source Schwab), price would go up to 136\\*1.05 = $143 by end of 2022.....2023 with another 1% rate hike and similar growth...it would go down further, unless earnings blow past expectations. \n\nUsing the same method we can say SPY would get to $360 by end of year due to rate adjustment, with 10% earnings growth, this could get to 396.

We've seen HEAVY asset inflation since 2016. I'm not throwing anybody under the bus it just kind of really got juiced under 2020 and 2021. \n\nI've mostly been of the belief that to have any meaningful inflation in the real world economy you have to have rising wages. You can have fluctuations but that just winds up being turbulence because if nobody can afford your jacked up price of bread then eventually it is going to have to come down. Without discussing inflation, it's obvious we are still experiencing supply chain disruptions. Some natural and some artificial. The thing about inflation is you really can't call it until after the fact. I'm still in the inflation camp but over some years. I'm not prepared to call the cpi increase of last year inflation. There just isn't enough money in the bottom of the economy (IE you and I) I think to drive this alone. Wages in the country have continued to be pretty stagnant so their 2 percent inflation target really wasn't that hard to reel in. The fly in the soup though is that people saved more than ever and NOBODY WANTS TO WORK. So remember what I said about wages? Well if this statement is correct... If they want people to buy back into working then you're going to need wages to rise. This will of course lead to some level of goods and service price increases until an equilibrium is found. Stuff like this is extremely complex and its no wonder there are so many conflicting opinions. \n\nWell here's why I spent all this time discussing this. Because the answer is a bit fat \"maybe but probably not\". Inflation is bad for savers. But it can be good for low income earners as it helps shore up their wages and bring them closer to those who have an assload of money and reduce some income inequality. But what we really are concerned about is circulating money supply because hey if we inject all this money into the economy what is gonna happen? (well depends on where it goes but stick with me here since I wanna get to your question). Initially the entire market LOVES all this extra cash flowing in. Because people will buy all kinds of assets at all different net worths if they can. Buttcoin. Gold. Tesla. GME. Whatever. Good times. \n\nBut the problem is that inflation eats into profits. So the real purchasing power of your profits may not be nearly as much as it was prior and yet your operating costs have only gone up as well with inflation. This generally isn't something that shakes out from one earnings report alone. Growth stocks are always hot during these periods because it's driven by speculation (your tech stocks if you will) and BIG NUMBER YESSS because they get valued on their eventual return. \n\nExcept eventually, the record stops and people start to slowly figure out \"wait a minute, this shot up 1000 percent and they aren't exactly doing much better a few years ago.\" the cracks start to form. More people take profits. They want to seek investments that PROTECT their wealth. Historically? Value stocks, commodities, gold, bonds even. That's why an increase in bond yield freaks everyone out because people pivot into it. Basically when everyone is making money more people say \"well I don't wanna hold the bag\". There's more factors obvs but that's a crude explanation. \n\nWell this cycle repeats and suddenly the market is a mess because some things barely drop and others dumped like a rock. So the short answer? \n\n***Inflation is pretty good for the market until it isn't***\n\nThat doesn't mean I have a clue where we are going. The market likes to do the opposite of what everyone expects and people have been expecting a crash since 2016 and here we are. Personally I haven't figured out where we are going yet.

{"title": "It was guaranteed right here on Reddit that the stock market would drop between October 24, 2021 and January 24, 2022, and it did. So lets talk about what the Fed might do from now.

Here is proof [https://www.reddit.com/r/astrofinance/comments/qab66z/the\\_book\\_the\\_mars\\_hypothesis\\_hypothesizes\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrofinance/comments/qab66z/the_book_the_mars_hypothesis_hypothesizes_that/)\n\nSo lets talk about what the Fed might do. Now according to the book \"The Mars Hypothesis\", the monetary policy proposal calls for the Fed to allow the market to decide rates based on a belief that certain planetary alignments can predict when demands for cash will be higher. The proposal also insists that the Fed could also implement policies that would reinforce the forecasted economic trajectory. For example, during a time when it's anticipated that demands for currency will be higher, the Fed can raise interest rates during that time. In the event of a bank panic because of this reinforcement, the Fed can just institute a provisional currency, a mars currency, perhaps with a reddish color, to keep the economy from collapsing . Normally the Fed embarks upon quantitative easing policies when it senses that demands for currency will be higher, which offsets the likelihood of bank runs. But in the Mars Hypothesis, the predicted bear market dates are there for macroeconomic projections in which it is advised that interest rates are cut after the predicted bearish time period ends. So, at the moment, the predicted bearish time period was from October 24, 2021 - January 24, 2022. And the market dropped. The book advises that the Fed should afterwards cut rates until the starting point for the next set of dates forecasting a bear market. However, with the way policy is applied at the moment, the Fed may do the opposite and raise rates when the book calls for lower rates. From The Mars Hypothesis perspective, the Fed should lower rates at the moment, but should have also raised rates back in October when the projected bear market time period started", "id": "sdhhpi", "created_utc": 1643233952.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "It go down", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Looks like it's going up", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "no it go down", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Post Market looks like going for a strong upward trend", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Draw some lines and I\u2019ll believe you", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09643229842185974}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3672664165496826}, {"body": "What did I say", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20010574162006378}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6085166335105896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5281164646148682}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2680926024913788}, {"body": "You lost me at Mars without Elon", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Lost me at reading", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Lost me at the giant wall of text", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Where am I", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26714271306991577}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5007299780845642}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2678186297416687}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15601739287376404}, {"body": "Did the Mars Hypothesis take into account the year of the snek??", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2929235100746155}, {"body": "I want to drop my nuts on your chin", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Before after or during the legitimate discussion?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08961698412895203}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08728905022144318}, {"body": "TL; DR\n\nBasically stocks that go down will RISE.\n\nStocks that rise... will go down.\n\nSo is the nature of the stock market.
