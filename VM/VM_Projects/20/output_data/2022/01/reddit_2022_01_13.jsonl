The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year.

Still, new filings remain near pre-pandemic levels. Continuing jobless claims improved to their lowest level since 1973. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 230,000 vs. 200,000 expected and an unrevised 207,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims:** 1.559 million vs. 1.733 million expected and a revised 1.753 million during prior week\n\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010.

CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.\n\nBy category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year.
