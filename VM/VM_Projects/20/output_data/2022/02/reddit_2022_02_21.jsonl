{"title": "Expected moves this week. SPY, COIN, BYND, SQ, MRNA, BABA, and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** was lower by about $8, or 2% last week, less than the 2.5% ($11) move options were pricing. Implied volatility is about the same as last week.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a 2.4% move this week (about $10 in either direction).\n\n**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** \u2013 The VIX closed last week just shy of 28. It had a range of about 24 to 31 during the week. As mentioned last week, traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop as it has been changing fairly significantly day to day (and even intra-day). What position is chosen when the VIX is near 20 or when it is above 30 can add headwinds or tailwinds to those positions, even trades with short time horizons.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2.4%** (about $10)\n* QQQ **3.2%** (about $11)\n* IWM **3.0%** (about $6)\n* DIA **2.2%** (about $7.5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nCryptocurrencies have bounced off recent lows but are still significantly lower than their Nov 2021 highs. One of the more high-profile equities in the space, **Coinbase** reports this week. COIN is down nearly 50% since Nov 21. It is lower than its IPO reference price of $250 and significantly lower than the intra-day high it saw on its first day of trading (above $400).  \n\n\nOptions are pricing a move of about 11% for earnings, (or about $21). With the stock $187, a $21 move lower would take out recent lows. In other words, the bearish expected move would mean a new low. And on the upside, a $21 move higher would not reach the $220 resistance level. In other words, the bullish expected move is not pricing a move back to obvious resistance. You can see the difference in probability assigned by the options market at those support and resistance levels.  \n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9pm1fzd3z8j81.gif\n\nThis can help inform strike selection beyond or inside of the expected move. For instance, those that are bullish could target the resistance level for the potential for extra reward beyond the expected move. And for those that are bearish, the options market is *not* putting a lot of weight on the stock being able to hold that support level if the stock goes lower on earnings. Therefore a move lower would be into uncharted territory, a situation that has seen outsized moves lately in other names.\n\nAnd finally, BTC options are pricing about a 6% move this week, less than the 11% COIN options are pricing, for those that see COIN trade more as a proxy than anything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links* go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

{"title": "Inflation Protection Ideas", "selftext": "Seeing lots of posts about inflation recently.  Thought it might be a good idea to review it and some options you have to defend against it.  And I will put my personal positions at the bottom.\n\nFrom Deep Risk by Bernstein\n\n**Deep Risk \u2013 Young investors series**\n\n-\t2 types of Risk\n  - Shallow Risk \u2013 loss of real capital that recovers relatively quickly\n  - Deep Risk \u2013 permanent loss of real capital\n-\tPermanent loss of capital (negative real return over a 30-year period)\n    - Severe, prolonged hyperinflation \u2013 hurts stocks and bonds but bonds more\n      - Wide diversification among international markets\n      - A tilt toward value stocks and commodity producing companies\n      - Gold bullion\n      - Inflation protected securities and annuities\n      - Fixed rate mortgages\n  - Gold bullion protects poorly against inflation and currency shocks\n  - Gold bullion does superbly with deflation\n  - Gold bullion does best when the public loses faith in the financial system\n  - Gold bullion is great for hyperinflation\n  - PME do not protect against deflation or certain disaster scenarios like gold bullion does\n  - You have to make choices as to what and how much you want to defend against\n  - Stocks in the US have done best when inflation ran between 0-4%.\n  - Stocks do protect against inflationary deep risk, but not in the short term. But they do protect against inflation in the long term\n    - To put it another way stocks, protect against deep risk, but exacerbate shallow risk\n  - Widespread diversification of stocks protects against inflation because it is unlikely that all nations would have massive hyperinflation at once\n  - Inflation devastates bondholders. Especially when it is a surprise/unexpected.\n - Fixed rate mortgage payments are also good for inflation\n  - A value tilt also provides protection against inflation. This worked in both domestic and international\n  - Inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. But is the easiest to protect against.\n    - International diversification\n    - Value Tilt\n    - PME\n    - Natural Resource Stocks\n    - Retired people should use TIPS\n\nSkating Where the Puck Was\n\n-\tWhen credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - ALL OF THEM\n-\tShort term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction\n-\tResign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. Which can be far more destructive to wealth\n\nRational Expectations\n\n-\tStocks that have the potential to have high returns during crises, especially inflationary ones, should consequently have the lowest returns of all among equity classes (Like PME)\n-\tWilliam Bernstein believes in 3 different industry groups for consideration into a portfolio\n  1. REITs\n  2. Precious Metal Equity (PME)\n  3. Oil/Natural Resource Equity (NR)\n-\tOil and Natural Resource stocks are a great inflation hedge and under appropriate circumstances, might not be unreasonable to have additional allocation to commodities producers\n-\tDon&#39;t purchase commodity futures. They are great in theory but not in practice. There used to be &quot;Backwardation&quot; in the futures market when investors were scared on deflation in their products and needed downside protection (IE a farmer selling his wheat crop in 9 months). Now inflation is the primary concern and futures contracts are in a condition known as &quot;contango&quot; which drives up the costs and reduces future returns\n\n4 Pillars\n\n-\tPM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.\n\nThe only guide to alternative investments\n\n-\tREIT&#39;s are a great choice. But do not invest in mortgage REIT&#39;s as they are bonds and not equity\n-\tREIT&#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds. This is true of domestic and international\n-\tInternational REIT&#39;s can provide a benefit but their expenses tend to be higher so be careful. A 50/50 domestic and international REIT AA is a good starting place\n-\tDo not treat your personal home as a financial asset. It is a place to live. It should not be included in your overall AA plan\n-\tInvestors who are not real estate professionals should gain exposure to REIT&#39;s though low-cost mutual funds and not directly buy properties as a way to achieve broad diversification\n-\tREIT&#39;s provide a reasonably good long-term hedge against inflation\n-\t5-15% is a good AA for REIT&#39;s in your portfolio\n-\tTIPS provide a guaranteed rate of return and are less volatile than nominal return bonds\n-\tTIPS have a lower correlation to equities than nominal return bonds\n-\tCommodities (Hard Assets) have negative correlation to stocks and bonds and act as a hedge against event risk (wars, disruptions, political instability, etc.) and inflation. Usually made up of Energy, Industrial Metals, PM, Ag, Livestock\n-\tCCF&#39;s do will during times of rising or unexpected inflation. But do poorly during times low or falling inflation\n-\tLarry Swedroe likes Collateralized commodity futures (CCF) and not the actual producers\n-\tWilliam Bernstein likes commodities, but not CCF&#39;s. He likes the actual commodity producers(Example - Oil and Materials). They won&#39;t provide protection from Shallow Risk like the CCF will, but they will provide protection from deep risk.\n-\tPME&#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds both domestic and international\n-\tExcellent hedge against inflation. Especially good for retired persons who need a hedge against inflation\n-\tThere is a large rebalancing bonus (as much as 5%)\n-\tPME are HIGHLY volatile so be careful and rebalance\n-\tPME tend to experience long periods of very low returns during periods of economic and political stability and short periods of high returns in times of crisis\n\nGlobal investing\n\n-\tThere is a weak negative correlation between inflation rates and stock returns\n-\tThe short-term relation between equity returns and inflation is weak, but over the long term equity returns impound inflation rates\n  - In 1920&#39;s Germany Hyperinflation, stocks hedged inflation well, but investors would have been better off if inflation didn&#39;t take place\n-\tThe negative relation between stocks and inflation is a short to intermediate term phenomenon. Over the longer terms, stocks behave as claims to real economics assets\n-\tInflation is likely to remain a factor in society, primarily because governments spend more than they receive in taxes, forcing the governments to borrow. Monetization of this debt causes inflation.\n-\tOver the long term, real estate should provide returns competitive with those on stocks and bonds, and its low correlation with other assets makes it valuable for diversification. Real estate has also been a superior inflation hedge\n-\tCommodities futures have low correlations with other assets.\n  - Commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other\n    - Why? Commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments\n-\tGold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.\n-\tCommodity futures tracked inflation fairly well, but underperformed it\n\nThe delusions of crowds\n\n-\tMarket Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions\n  - Technological and financial displacement\n  - Credit loosening\n  - Amnesia of the past\n  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles\n-\tUnder most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things\n  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)\n  - Keeping inflation under control\n    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies\n-\tThe Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)\n  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n-\tNo liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes\n-\tGovernments are the primary beneficiaries of inflation, in part because of tax structures that tax nominal rather than real incomes\n-\tCommon stocks do much better in a low inflation environment. They have performed poorly during deflation or high inflation, especially if the inflation is unexpected.\n  - Over the longer run, the companies can make adjustments to inflation, but in the short run those adjustments are difficult to accomplish\n\nA Random Walk Down Wall Street\n\n-\tExercise 6 \u2013 Buy a house. Real estate is a great inflation hedge. REIT&#39;s are a good choice to own commercial real estate\n-\tExercise 8 \u2013 Gold can have a place in your portfolio (5%). It is a good diversifier and is an excellent inflation hedge. Don&#39;t invest in diamonds or Collectibles. Buy diamonds and collectibles because you like them. Not as an investment. Do NOT invest in commodities futures contracts. You will get burned. Stay away from hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds. They are great for the managers, not for you\n\nStocks For the Long Run\n\n-\tUnder a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds\n-\tBecause of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again\n\n-\tBonds are bad during inflation as they are fixed income investments whose cash flows are not adjusted for inflation.\n  - It is also bad for the stock market. Stocks have proved to be poor hedges against inflation in the short run. But are great in the long run\n-\tAlthough fascinating to observe and understand a market&#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (CPI, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. Most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.\n\n-\tInflation and Deflation have characterized history as far back as economists have gathered data. But since 1955, there has never been a single year in which the US consumer price index declined\n-\tWhy the shift, because instead of Gold having control, now the government does and they always provide liquidity to prevent prices from declining\n-\tThe market used to react more to fed policy. But investors have become so geared to watching and anticipating Fed policy that the effect of its tightening or easing is already in the market.\n-\tStocks have an inflation hedge or an ability to maintain its purchasing power during periods of inflation\n-\tSince stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets, assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce, one should expect that their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation\n-\tStock are not good hedges against inflation in the short term, but no financial asset is. In the long run however, stocks are very good hedges against inflation, while bonds are not\n-\tSmith&#39;s Common Stocks and Long-Term Investments showed that stocks outperform bonds in times of falling and well as rising prices.\n-\tFisher found that in theory, stocks will be an ideal inflation hedge\n-\tIf inflation rears its head again, investors will do much better in stocks than bonds\n\nSafe Havens\n\n-\tGold\n    - Hedge against the banking system.\n    - No counter party risk.\n    - Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation.\n      - It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices).\n    - Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&#39;s.\n    - Gold is all about investors&#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value.\n      - It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected.\n    - During the 1970&#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective.\n      - Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven.\n      - This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective.\n      - The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.\n\nIAA\n\n-\tREIT&#39;s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns\n  - They are inflation hedges and likely to do well in an inflationary environment in which other stocks and bonds would be adversely affected\n\nBelow are the full posts on books by Friedman and Dalio.
