{"title": "U.S. economy perks up as omicron fades, IHS finds, but inflation gets worse", "selftext": "The U.S. economy accelerated in February as omicron waned and government restrictions were lifted, a pair of IHS surveys showed, but businesses increases prices at the fastest pace on record as inflation got worse, according to pair of IHS Markit surveys of business executives.\n\nA \u201cflash\u201d index of service-oriented companies jumped to 57.5 this month from an 18-month low of 51.1 in the first month of 2022, IHS Markit said. A similar gauge of manufacturers rose to 52.5 in February from 50.5.\n\nThe flash IHS surveys offer the first broad look at the performance of the U.S. economy in each month. Any reading above 50 means businesses are growing and numbers above 55% are quite healthy.\n\n**Big picture:** The economy suffered a blow as omicron exploded across the country, but the virus is receding now and governments are dropping restrictions on business such as vaccine mandates. That\u2019s giving a lift to the economy.\n\nPersistent labor and supply shortages remain a drag on the economy, however, and they are adding to the worst bout of U.S. inflation in 40 years. Some executives say the problems eased slight in February, but they are still a big problem.\n\n**Looking ahead:** \u201cThe pace of economic growth accelerated sharply in February as virus containment measures, tightened to fight the omicron wave, were scaled back,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. \u201cDemand was reported to have revived and supply constraints, both in terms of component availability and staff shortages, moderated.\u201d\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-economy-perks-up-in-february-as-omicron-fades-11645541710?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-economy-perks-up-in-february-as-omicron-fades-11645541710?mod=mw_latestnews)", "id": "sypwlq", "created_utc": 1645542725.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "A reminder to everyone, please focus on how this is going to affect a specific stock or the stock market in general.\n\nIf your comment is pushing political agendas, memes, insults, trolling, etc then your comment is going to get removed and/or get you banned.\n\nIf you *have* to discuss just the politics, then post this topic to r/PoliticalDiscussion without linking back to r/stocks, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "WHY the world needs Electric Vehicles BADLY in light of the Ukraine-Russia Crisis and super high inflation!", "selftext": " [Thankyou for opening your Tesla Folder \ud83d\udcc1](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/)\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nRussia is invading Ukraine, Oil prices have reached $5 a gallon, inflation is at 40-year highs and it seems like the world is getting scarier and scarier everyday\u2026\n\n# Now more than ever YOU NEED to own a Tesla or Electric Vehicle \u2026.. but why?\n\nIn this article I talk about the current insane volatility and dooms-day scenario we find ourselves in and specifically how Tesla and electric vehicles can not only save the planet, save your life but also save you lots of money.\n\nIt has never been more important to own an Electric Vehicle than it is now, so here is EXACTLY HOW this information ties to your stock portfolio\u2026..\n\n# The Increasing NEED to own an EV\u26a0\n\nThe market in 2022 is absolutely crazy, inflation has reached the highest levels since 40+ years ago. Meanwhile you might have gotten a 5% raise, woo-hoo, oh. Wait. Because inflation is so f\\*cking high you\u2019re purchasing power STILL decreased year over year! How crazy is that? The recent macro currents have not been this unpredictable in a very long time, with both the Federal Reserve tightening and potentially WW3 breaking out with the Russian potential invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBecause of all this, it is simple. You need an EV. You' need an EV, because it will drastically reduce the amount of money you\u2019re spending on fuelling up your car and getting it serviced. Tesla recently released an amazing feature that highlights the money Tesla owners are saving by not-having to buy gas for their cars. It\u2019s quite staggering.\n\nIn one example a Tesla user saved nearly $300 per month, *$300!* Do you not see how crazy that is? With recent gas prices reaching nearly $5 a gallon, it is becoming unjustifiable to purchase an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle as opposed to an EV.\n\nIt is a fact that a Tesla will save you money on fuel costs, maintenance, and depreciation. Buying an EV will save the average driver alot of money on running costs. Oh, and not to mention Tesla\u2019s appreciate? Although this is likely not to last, Tesla cars are now selling for MORE than people bought them for a few years ago.\n\nThe worlds current dependency on gas and oil is not only disgustingly harmful for the environment, killing it in the process, but it is also becoming more and more economically costly for us to be this dependent on them, this dependency was and is being exploited by Russia and is putting the world on the edge of war, because..\n\n# A World at War highlighting the importance of EV\u2019s \u270f\n\nThe current crisis in Ukraine and the fact that Russia is using their supply of Natural gas and Oil as a bargaining chip at the political table is costing thousands of people their lives and highlighting the need for the world to transition to sustainable energy NOW, not tomorrow not 2030 but NOW.\n\nPopular Stock market investor Ross Gerber summarized it strongly;\n\n>\u201cGas is $5.50 (!!!!) a gallon in Los Angeles. The best incentive EVER to buy an EV and never go to a gas station again! Save yourself from inflation and supporting the Russian invasion. Say NO to OIL.\u201d\n\nA short but powerful and truthful statement. Currently Russia is preparing an invasion of Ukraine and the European Union is struggling to provide meaningful sanctions because majority of its member-states are dependent on Russian Natural gas and Oil in someway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis hesitation to react to the clear violation of a countries borders is further reinforced by the current inflationary fears. Every person who owns a car that ISN\u2019T an Electric Vehicle is suffering severely at the hands of unprecedented increasing gas and oil prices.\n\nCurrently about 2.3 million barrels of Russian crude ($75 billion a year at current spot prices) heads west each day through a network of pipelines to export terminals on the Baltic and Black Seas, as well as pouring directly into refineries in central and eastern Europe.\n\nThis issue is universal and is robbing you of YOUR money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a European issue, as Ross Gerber mentioned, The United States is also feeling the impact of rising gas prices. The change to sustainable energy driven (literally) by electric vehicles is now more-than-ever an important step we must take to make our economies more resilient to political turmoil and the rash action of dictators.\n\nBy increasing our Sustainable energy sources we will be able to supply the grid with clean energy whilst decreasing overall costs and stabilizing prices. You will NEVER have to pay insane amounts of money to power your vehicle, to power your daily commute to work. As battery technology develops and EV\u2019s become widespread, this will become the new reality, it is only a matter of when this happens. But not only does owning an EV save you money, it could save your life\u2026..\n\n# Being in a Tesla could save your life \u26a1\n\nThe current European energy crisis could last years with natural gas stockpiles running lower and lower every day the recent storms hitting the United Kingdom and North-West Europe highlights the dangers of our current energy dependency.\n\nEurope remains at the mercy of Putin and the Weather. Not only will switching to Electric Vehicles decrease this dependency, but Tesla\u2019s are so well built *a Tesla could literally save your life.* With the recent storms creating BILLIONS in damage, some people unfortunately died when trees landed on their cars.\n\nA Tree Fell on Tesla owner Sam Fursey\u2019s car when they where driving, but luckily no-one was injured.\n\n>\u201c An old tree fell directly on my car, right above the driver's seat.  \nI was driving my best friend and his fianc\u00e9 to their wedding. We all walked away... **thank you higher powers, and Tesla engineers.**\n\nWith Tesla\u2019s safety-first design, the Model 3 was able to become \u201c**The safest car ever tested\u201d** by the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model 3 literally had the lowest probability of injury in a crash compared to over 900 other vehicles tested. **42,060 people.**\n\n42,060 people died on American roads in 2020. You NEVER know if this could be you, your loved one or one of your friends. Whether it is a tree falling on your car or a drunk driver t-boning your vehicle, you want to have the safest vehicles. Electric Vehicles in general are able to be safer than ICE vehicles due to the battery lowering the centre of gravity of the vehicle and allowing designers (like Tesla) to create significantly stronger castings that will better support the safety of the driver and passengers.\n\nNot only has Tesla driven this safety revolution, [but they are also DOMINATING the Electric Vehicle](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/p/how-our-need-for-teslas-has-never?utm_source=url) market, and the stock price is about to go crazy when Tesla becomes the MOST PROFITABLE Automaker in the world in the year\u2026\u2026\n\n# Tesla\u2019s EV dominance, and the future of the Stock Price \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTesla currently comfortably sits as the biggest manufacturer of Electric Vehicles with a market share of 21% meaning that more than 1 in every 5 EV\u2019s sold in the world was a Tesla car. Not only this, but Tesla has profit margins close to 30% whilst the average manufacturer sits at only 7%\u2026 Tesla is thus on the perfect path to dominating the world market by selling the MOST Electric Vehicles and also the MOST profitable vehicles. Reminder\u2026..\n\nTesla is set to become a Trillion dollar company (again) very soon, potentially adding over $200 billion to its current market valuation.\n\nBut more importantly, let me tell **you** about Tesla\u2019s DOMINANCE and how **you** should be reacting to the stock market\u2019s recent HUGE violations and specifically how to make or lose money right\u2026.\n\n# How to make (or lose) money right now \ud83d\udcb8\n\nBreathe. Breathe. Stop panicking. There are so many catalysts for Tesla stock in the coming year(s) it is actually unbelievable. Tesla trading around $800 means it is trading at only 8 X 2022 Revenue! It currently looks incredibly cheap when you keep in mind some short term and long term catalysts.\n\nWhenever you see volatility like this in the market, look at the companies you own and look at HOW they\u2019re performing. The current volatility in the year 2022 likely is irrelevant in 2030 when Tesla is producing potentially around 20 million cars per year. So always ALWAYS keep a long-term horizon.\n\nBut for everyone panicking in the short term, *SHOULD I SELL MY TESLA STOCK? or should I buy more? What DO I DO?!!*\n\nI can\u2019t answer that for you, but let me put it this way. Here are the current Short-term Tesla catalysts to keep in mind that:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Giga-Texas factory opening soon (Phase 1 capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year)\n\n\ud83c\udfedGiga-Berlin factory opening soon (Phase 1 capacity of 500,000+ vehicles per year) This factory also reduces import costs, thus increasing already high profit margins\n\n\ud83d\ude97Model S and X are ramping production (high margin luxury cars)\n\n\ud83d\udd0b 4680 Next-Generation battery cells are ramping production\n\nand so much more, so to ensure you DON\u2019T lose money during this volatile market keep a long term investment horizon.

{"title": "MOSAIC Co, enough DD to feed the world.", "selftext": "#Earnings is being reported Tuesday night, with Earnings Call Wednesday morning, so I decided to post my positions and research.\n\nMOS is the world's largest exporter of fertilizers in the world, located in Canada and the US. It's competitors are #2 Belerus (sanctioned against exporting fertilizers since January), #3 Russia (sanctioned for the rest of time), and #4 China (imposing self restrictions of exports in 2022). Since its Q3 2021 reporting, nearly all competition has fallen off the map.\n\nPros: Fertilizers require natural gas to be produced and oil to be transported. Along with all other parts of its supply chain, prices are skyrocketing since their low in October 2020. Because MOS is in a seller's market with orders already slated through Q4 2022, they are expected to nearly double their profits this quarter. They recently adopted ESG standards and have no negative news in the last quarter, making them a very reliable producer and distributor on the global markets.\n\nCons: The world's largest importers of fertilizers are India, Brazil, the USA, and Africa. India and Brazil are currently undergoing a squeeze and cannot afford the higher prices of fertilizers that they are accustomed to. India has recently reduced its farmer subsidies and is instead giving direct grants to farmers in hopes of encouraging domestic markets. Brazil is poor. They are basically telling their farmers to stretch their fertilizer supplies to last longer by using less per hectare. Food is kind of important to society so farmers will likely produce, even at a loss while they negotiate for greater subsidies.\n\nBusiness Climate: last month American competitor CF posted earnings and gained about 4%. Russia producer PhosAgro reported higher earnings with lower production than in the previous quarter. It's price dipped 15% but fully recovered within 4 trading days. Comparatively, MOS should see a +5% price increase and ratings upgrade soon.

{"title": "Russian Conflict Stocks / EV & Tesla & Solar", "selftext": "So it\u2019s shitty there are posts about how to manage financials in what\u2019s happening around the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Human misery is sad.\n\nMy prayers to those who are in harms way (not limited to only Ukraine but others like Yemen, Somalia etc)\n\nBut what are your updated plays?\n\nI\u2019m currently in energy and defense like probably many retards here. But I\u2019m upping my holdings in minerals and EV.\n\nMinerals are obvious but why EVs, Solar and green energy.\n\nI posit that with the coming days of insane oil/energy prices, these new green technologies will be seen by consumers as a need to get off such commodities that are tied to international fuckery and conflicts.\n\nIn my case I bought a Tesla model S and my mileage costs are stable.  I\u2019m also waiting for my Tesla solar and powerwall.  This way I\u2019m less reliant on the grid and can charge my car on purely solar.\n\nThis just hit me a while ago as into why Tesla can be the biggest company in the world.  I think after this conflict (hopefully minimal) many will see green tech as imperative to decouple from these countries that are fucking bullshit in how they treat their neighbors and citizens.\n\nSo I\u2019ve added more Tesla! Added GGPI! Added more LCID and some various solar plays.\n\nNow I understand why European countries have been writing legislation to outlaw ICE by 2030. It\u2019s actually a political and security protection versus just investing in new technologies.\n\nI\u2019m a huge believer in Tesla now with solar, powerwall and model S. I\u2019ll be purely insulated from energy costs in the future.\n\nThese are what will make me essentially get of coal/oil etc\n\nTesla Powerwall:\n\nhttps://www.tesla.com/powerwall\n\nTesla solar:\n\nhttps://www.tesla.com/solarroof\n\nTesla Model S:\n\nhttps://www.tesla.com/models", "id": "syv0mn", "created_utc": 1645555595.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|99|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|345|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq1hf4/gtlb_gitlab/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq25iz/gtlb_gitlab_massively_under_value_101_shorted_yolo/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq3lvd/gtlb_gitlab_enterprise_my_next_yolo/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sxeqdj/game_theory_metafacebook/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syv0mn/russian_conflict_stocks_ev_tesla_solar/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql4zhm/shorting_sbux/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql569x/shorting_starbux/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4wwip/gamma_squeeze_gme_be_careful/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o34bsp/russell_1000_and_amc_conspiracy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mknli9/visa_what_more_can_i_say/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8ilg4/corz_ipo_today_core_scientific_youre_welcome/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=syv0mn)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=syv0mn)\n    \nHey /u/mlamping, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Post your positions.
