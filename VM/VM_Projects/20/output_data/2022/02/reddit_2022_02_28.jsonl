Believe it or not, US stocks also fell sharply as SIULUNG said.\n\nMany people have asked why there is no March 2020. According to the Austrian economist Peter Schumpeter, there are three different types of cycles in the economy: long, medium and short. The short cycle is about 40 months, the three short cycles form a medium cycle and the 18 short cycles form a long cycle. The cycle affecting 2022 is the seven-year cycle, while the cycles affecting 2020 are the 30-year and 60-year cycles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjrhgtunwhk81.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=6357abbb245e69d3f1a3e35134500eba35770bd6\n\nChart: Different cycles affect stock market movements\n\nSo are US stocks done falling yet? \n\nBruce has many predictions for the future, as he mentioned earlier: \"According to current market estimates, the most common forecast is for the US to raise interest rates four times in 2022, but Bruce strongly believes that there may be more than four times, and that the pace of tapering will exceed expectations. \"Will interest rate hikes alone bring down the stock and property markets? We can't rule out the possibility that something like the first oil crisis will suddenly happen and push up inflation in the US, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates faster than everyone expects.\n\n\"According to the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture, Ukraine is the world's second largest exporter of barley, fourth largest exporter of corn and fifth largest exporter of wheat in the 2019-2020 market year. If the crisis does worsen, will energy and food prices rise sharply? And how will the Federal Reserve react? As SIULUNG said, if the US Fed misjudges inflation, will the US raise interest rates as it did in the 1970s?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsso4bopwhk81.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac0dac121957ad948195b09a0013163bc8ef213\n\nUsing the gold ratio, the NASDAQ has just rebounded after a 0.382 gold ratio pullback, which may indicate short term support at this position. The chart below shows that SIULUNG US stocks have already issued a sell signal, the last buy signal was issued in 2020, so be careful. If it falls below 0.382/12928 again, then the Nifty will head for the 0.5/0.618 gold ratio, which is 11717/10507.\n\nAnd we have to be careful as there is a chance of a stock market crash in the mid-March to May 2022 cycle, so we have to be careful or options may be a suitable tool.

{"title": "The Biggest Stock Market Crashes in History", "selftext": " A stock market crash occurs when there is a significant decline in stock prices. While there\u2019s no specific numeric definition of a stock market crash, the term usually applies to occasions in which the major stock market indexes lose more than 10% of their value in a relatively short time period.\n\nMarket crashes typically happen without warning, often on the heels of a long bull market run during which stock prices steadily rise. The hallmark of a stock market crash is panic-selling by investors who attempt to quickly liquidate their positions to either curb their losses or satisfy a margin call.\n\nWhile a crash of the stock market can occur quickly, many of the market\u2019s biggest crashes have had effects that were long-lasting and deep. Here\u2019s a brief look at some of the market\u2019s most notable crashes.\n\n**Biggest crashes in the history of the stock market:**\n\n**1929 stock market crash:**\n\nThe worst stock market crash in history started in 1929 and was one of the catalysts of the Great Depression. The crash abruptly ended a period known as the Roaring Twenties, during which the economy expanded significantly and the stock market boomed.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:\\^DJI) rose from 63 points in August, 1921, to 381 points by September of 1929 \u2014 a six-fold increase. It started to descend from its peak on Sept. 3, before accelerating during a two-day crash on Monday, Oct. 28, and Tuesday, Oct. 29. The Dow on what is now known as Black Monday tumbled by nearly 13% and declined by another almost 12% on what is referred to as Black Tuesday.\n\nBy mid-November, 1929, the Dow had lost about half its value. The stock market was bearish, meaning that its value had declined by more than 20%. The Dow continued to lose value until the summer of 1932, when it bottomed out at 41 points, a stomach-churning 89% below its peak. The Dow didn\u2019t regain its pre-crash value until 1954.\n\nThe primary cause of the 1929 stock market crash was excessive leverage. Many individual investors and investment trusts had begun buying stocks on margin, meaning that they paid only 10% of the value of a stock to acquire it under the terms of a margin loan. The investment trusts also often purchased shares of other highly leveraged investment trusts, making the trusts\u2019 fates highly intertwined. Consumers, too, increasingly purchased items on credit. When the debt bubble burst, it caused the greatest stock market and economic crash in modern history.\n\n**Black Monday crash of 1987:**\n\nOn Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by nearly 22%. Black Monday, as the day is now known, marks the biggest single-day decline in stock market history. The remainder of the month wasn\u2019t much better; by the start of November, 1987, most of the major stock market indexes had lost more than 20% of their value.\n\nNo single event caused the stock market to crash in 1987. Instead, a series of factors drove the sell-off, including a widening U.S. trade deficit, computerized trading, and tensions in the Middle East. The rise of program trading, which occurs when computers make automated trades, likely played the biggest role in this crash. The computers tended to produce more buy orders when prices were rising and more sell orders when prices fell. As those sell orders flooded the market on Oct. 19, it caused other investors to sell in a panic.\n\nBecause the Black Monday crash was caused primarily by programmatic trading rather than an economic problem, the stock market recovered relatively quickly. The Dow started rebounding in November, 1987, and recouped all its losses by September of 1989.\n\n**Dot-com bubble of 1999-2000:**\n\nDuring the late 1990s, the values of internet-based stocks rose sharply. As a result, the technology-dominated NASDAQ Composite Index (NASDAQINDEX:\\^IXIC) surged from 1,000 points in 1995 to more than 5,000 in 2000. But in early 2001, the dot-com stock bubble started to burst. The NASDAQ peaked at 5,048.62 points on March 10. The index would go on to plummet by 76.81% until it reached a low of 1,139.90 points on Oct. 4, 2002.\n\nThe primary cause of this crash was overvalued internet stocks. Many investors speculated that dot-com companies, even those without revenues, would one day become extremely profitable.\n\nAs a result, they poured money into the sector, driving up the valuation of every company with \u201cdot com\u201d in its name. This stock market bubble burst when the Federal Reserve tightened its monetary policy, constraining the flow of capital. The NASDAQ did not again rise to its 2001 peak until almost 15 years later.\n\n**Financial crisis of 2008:**\n\nIn 1999, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) wanted to make home loans more accessible to those with low credit ratings and less money to spend on down payments than lenders typically required. These subprime borrowers, as they were called, were offered mortgages with payment terms, such as high interest rates and variable payment schedules, that reflected their elevated risk profiles.\n\nThis increased availability of mortgage debt appealed to both previously ineligible borrowers and investors, fueling explosive growth in mortgage originations and home sales. At the same time, consumers, many of them new homeowners, took on additional debt to buy other goods.\n\nCompanies seeking to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the surging economy also heavily indebted themselves. Financial institutions, similarly, used cheap debt to boost the returns on their investments.\n\nThis debt-fueled stock market started to show signs of impending collapse in March, 2007, when the investment bank Bear Stearns could not cover its losses linked to subprime mortgages.\n\nBear Stearns\u2019 failure was not enough by itself to cause the stock market to crash \u2014 it kept rising, to 14,164 points on Oct. 9, 2007 \u2014 but by September of 2008, the major stock indexes had lost nearly 20% of their value.\n\nThe Dow didn\u2019t reach its lowest point, which was 54% below its peak, until March 6, 2009. It then took four years for the Dow to fully recover from the crash.\n\n**Coronavirus crash of 2020:**\n\nThe most recent stock market crash occurred in 2020 as COVID-19 spread worldwide. During the week of Feb. 24, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 tumbled 11% and 12%, respectively, marking the biggest weekly declines to occur since the financial crisis of 2008. The Dow would go on to decline by 9.99% on March 12 \u2014 its largest one-day drop since Black Monday of 1987 \u2014 followed by an even deeper plunge of 12.9% on March 16.\n\nHowever, unlike prior crashes whose recoveries required years, the stock market rebounded back to its pre-pandemic peak by May of 2020. Fueling that rapid recovery was an enormous amount of stimulus money, with the Federal Reserve slashing interest rates and injecting $1.5 trillion into money markets and Congress passing a $2.2 trillion aid package at the end of March.", "id": "t36s4i", "created_utc": 1646022321.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah, nice try man.

Yet the narrative being used to support the \u201cbottom is in\u201d belief in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that stocks spring back quickly from geopolitical crises. As MarketWatch reported earlier this week: \u201cDespite near-term volatility in the wake of geopolitical events over the past three decades, ranging from terrorist attacks to the start of wars, stocks have tended to bounce back relatively quickly, \u2026 rallying 4.6% on average in the six months following such crises dating back to 1990 and rising 81% of the time.\u201d\n\nOr consider this tweet a money manager sent out after the news broke that Russia had invaded Ukraine: \u201cExcellent buying opportunities never feel good at the time.\u201d After presenting one of the many lists of past geopolitical events that are circulating around Wall Street, the tweet continued: \u201cLesson? Buy when there\u2019s blood in the streets.\u201d\n\nThese narratives gloss over the extent of the short-term losses that geopolitical events inflict on investors. The attitude adopted by the market\u2019s cheerleaders is like telling a boxer to celebrate being knocked down because it creates the opportunity to get up again. Another problem with these rosy pictures is that they subjectively use past geopolitical crises to prove their point. A far different conclusion emerges if we focus on a specific subset of global crises relative to this latest one: war.\n\nThe chart below highlights six major geopolitical events since 1941 that involved military invasions and/or threats to national sovereignty. The chart plots the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +2.24% performance over the six months following the conclusion of those crises. In three of these six instances, U.S. stocks had yet to recover.\n\nFull story here- [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-could-keep-stocks-sliding-for-weeks-before-the-market-hits-bottom-11645781162?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-could-keep-stocks-sliding-for-weeks-before-the-market-hits-bottom-11645781162?mod=home-page)", "id": "t3be0t", "created_utc": 1646039112.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Hi all.

If anyone is in doubt, please go see what Sandy Monroe has to say about Tesla. He breaks down cars and reverse engineers them for car companies. Uneqivocally says that Tesla engineering is basically alien tech. He states that correcting door fits and gaps is easy to eventually fix ( as problems that  Japanese and Korean cars had when they first entered the market but eventually became non issues) but basic engineering of the cars is the real core of good cars.\n2. The fact that Tesla makes 30% profit off of each car as opposed to 7-10% industry standard already puts them ahead of any other car company.\n3. The fact that the gigafactories are so automated and efficent that it takes them 10 hours to produce one car, while VW ( the next best legacy automake in theEV ) takes 30 hours  shows no one will ever catch up . Their lead will only accelerate.\n4. They have the tech. They have the reputation. They have the funds . They have the lead. They have the batteries . They have more factories planned and in motion. They have no debt.
