{"title": "HIMX - Value Growth Combo TTM P/E About to Drop Further this ER", "selftext": "HIMX is a fabless semiconductor company that is back in screaming value range. As of market close on Monday it\u2019s TTM P/E is 5.84 but before market open on Thursday it\u2019s Ttm PE will drop below 4.5 after reporting earnings.\n\nWhy invest in Himx? \n\nHere is the quantitative analysis. Well not only is it tech growth at a value price but unlike a value trap it\u2019s actually growing revenues significantly yoy and sequentially (75.4% yoy and 15.2% sequentially last er). Their Ttm revenue is about to exceed their market cap and their gross margin has been impressive and improving (47.5% to 51.7%).They also traditionally pay out the majority of their profits as a once a year special dividend. Over the past decade that payout has ranged from 62.5% to 100% of earnings per share.\n\nHere is the qualitative analysis. They are a dominant market player in their segment of display and touch integration ICs. They make display drivers and touch integration for mobile phones, computer displays, TVs, tablets, VR displays, and automotive displays including hud. At their last industry technical conference the ceo of continental described their expanding business relationship with Himx. Since demand for Himx leading technology is through the roof they have had the luxury of prioritizing their highest margin vertical (automotive) which is also their least cyclical vertical for their lowest margin which traditionally has been mobile. If you have driven any modern car recently you understand how much display and TDDI is included in each car. They were first to market on many technologies in the past two years including recently the first display driver to support 8k resolution at 288Hz refresh rates. \n\nI\u2019m very bullish on HIMX as one of those stocks that is a clear dislocation in the market. It\u2019s valuation and analysis so not match up. Even after inflation ramped up the lowest and most conservative discounted cash flow model I have seen values this company at $22.42 per share meaning it could double this year and still give you an insane dividend (it will def be above a 5% yield). Even if it doubles by years end and earnings stay flat it would still be below a 10 trailing pe at that time.

{"title": "After Soros, many large pension funds in the United States bought rivian shares, the \"Tesla killer\"", "selftext": "According to securities documents released on Monday, seven large pension funds, including CalPERS, the largest pension fund in the United States, bought shares of rivian, an electric vehicle start-up, in the quarter ended December 31.\n\nAccording to whalewisdom, a fund tracker, the seven pension funds include the teacher retirement system of Texas, CalPERS, Maryland State retirement and pension system, Utah, Colorado Pension funds in North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nAmong them, the California Civil Service Pension Fund (CalPERS) manages about $492 billion in assets and is the largest pension fund in the United States. According to the announcement, the fund purchased more than 305000 rivian shares. If the closing price of rivian at the end of last year is US $103.69, it is equivalent to a market value of about US $32 million.\n\nThe $191 billion Texas teacher retirement system of Texas fund holds about 33000 shares of the company.\n\nThese measures show that the risk appetite of pension funds, which have always been biased towards soundness, has increased. This may be because these pension funds still face a funding gap - although US stocks have been on an upward trend since the outbreak of the new crown, according to the global sovereign wealth fund, a data platform for large buyer institutions, overall, the average capital adequacy ratio (a measure of assets and liabilities) of US pension plans is still less than 75%.\n\nIt is worth noting that the well-known institutions that bought rivian are not just pension funds. A report released last week showed that several well-known investors, including billionaire George Soros and hedge fund tiger Global Fund, increased their holdings of the company's shares in the last quarter.\n\nRivian's share price rose more than 12% on Monday and narrowed to 6% at the end of the day.\n\nTaking advantage of the trend of electric vehicles, rivian became the star enterprise in the wave of US stock IPOs last year. At the end of last year, its IPO raised US $12 billion, becoming the largest financing project of US stocks last year.\n\nHowever, rivian's share price performance has not been ideal since its listing. As of Friday's close, rivian's share price has fallen 43% so far this year. As of Monday's close, the company's share price closed at $62.65, still about 64% lower than the high of $179.46 on November 16 last year.", "id": "ssxf1h", "created_utc": 1644910463.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|46|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ssxf1h)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ssxf1h)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15279841423034668}, {"body": "Is Rivian making skateboards yet or just the R1T?", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Shirts and hats", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Don't forget the scooters!!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2589133083820343}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11864610016345978}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27502012252807617}, {"body": "Idk, for the size of the funds,  it seems like pocket change to them", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Good comment this one", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15428724884986877}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09645171463489532}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3574323356151581}, {"body": "Big mistake.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Huge.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32289919257164}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08646275103092194}, {"body": "\"I have a rivian\"  \n\nIt sounds like, \"I have a STD\"", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Like a bump on ur butthole or undercarriage", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20490869879722595}, {"body": "Except no one has the std yet, I mean their rivia yet.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5204596519470215}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.163993701338768}, {"body": "The R1T is really nice and all that, but they got to figure out how to manufacture a lot of vehicles and make a profit eventually.

The Stock has been going parabolic recently and it is reaching major resistance at around $80 and has already pulled back after trying to get above $80  so the bleeding could possibly start to get worse.\n#2. Oil Prices Are reaching very high levels almost $100 could possibly experience a correction I\u2019ll get back to this later because it could be a risk. \n#3.

{"title": "$CAT ready to break out!", "selftext": "Based on technical analysis of both SPY and CAT, I believe that CAT is ready to breakout from its current levels.\n\nFirst a look at SPY and the general market. Spy is currently in what looks to be a cup and handle formation following a jump on reports that Russia is pulling back from the Ukraine border. Today SPY oscillated between 446 and 444 frequently with 444 serving as solid support several times throughout the trading session. 446 which served as resistance was actually broken at the end of the day on high volume hinting that tomorrow might be a continuation of todays upward move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY cup and handle, break of resistance](https://preview.redd.it/gn0qk0vjg2i81.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca8c6bee315d7e1c3ec1a19020a2ec4f4030929d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVIXs movement also points to a green day tomorrow as it fell below the support at 26 towards the end of the day. This support previously acted as a resistance and was confirmed as support after being broken and retested in the last week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX break below 26 support](https://preview.redd.it/o1e9gzs9h2i81.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=b54a4a707fac40144390c383d0ae6d8192c409d7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to the stock play, CAT. I believe that CAT is in both a large inverse head and shoulders set up on the daily timeframe and a smaller inverse head and shoulders pattern on the hourly timeframe. This, combined with a recent earnings beat and good SPY setup will provide a strong basis for a pump in the coming days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Larger inverse head and shoulders dating back to late January](https://preview.redd.it/ujzloo3xh2i81.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=036988a3dcce3f63cabf09538edb0e606738b05f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Smaller inverse head and shoulders forming on hourly timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/zxjf8zj4i2i81.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=5448177feab0e0c95b9d2f82bdedde48c589409e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SPY looks like its going up tomorrow, VIX looks like its going to go down more, CAT looks like its going up TOO!\n\nIf you follow me, you can also see that I played CAT once in the past for a 4% daily move!\n\nPositions: 3/18 210c", "id": "stee07", "created_utc": 1644961838.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|23|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|44|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgnjkr/blink_is_primed_for_short_squeeze_get_in_while/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=stee07)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=stee07)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2684873342514038}, {"body": "Yeah it may go up 3%.
