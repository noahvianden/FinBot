Scaling this up, especially for a single play, is a great way to quickly blow up your account.  For these kinds of trades, you should be looking to keep them small, fast, frequent, and diversified.  It's fun to imagine tripling your account in 15 minutes, not so fun to imagine losing 33% in a second.  As such, you should really only be allocating a small portion of your portfolio to this kind of strategy even if you are really confident in it.\n\nThese kinds of concerns should always be at the forefront of your mind, which I'm assuming is the case (if not, then stop now).  As others have stated, this basically requires automation with very rigorously tested mechanisms, cause there's no way to do this at any significant scale by hand and a slight miscalculation can be dire.\n\nAlso recognize the need for proper risk management.  Again, you *shouldn't* be placing a significant portion of your capital in any one bet, but even if you do properly diversify, etc., a major, correlated downward event can absolutely ravage your portfolio before you can liquidate your position.

{"title": "Two kinds of bears (update to my stellar PTON DD from two days ago)", "selftext": "People are asking why wsb was so bearish and pton and why they were wrong, so, allow me to explain -- you people down voted my magnificent due diligence instead of upvoting it as I deserved. \n\nDespite your lack of appreciation for my wisdom, here I am once again. I have dumbed it down somewhat and I will incorporate some folksy metaphors in an attempt to get my point across -- please enjoy.\n\nChapter 1, Two Kinds of Bears.\n\nTwo kinds of bears will hunt a stock in the wild. The first is the bear of overvaluation, the second is the bear of obscelescence. You may think of these two bears as the \"anti-value\" and the \"anti-momentum\" bears respectively. Just as value and momentum are the two market factors responsible for the bulk of stock price appreciation, so it is true that perceptions of weakness in either of these factors are the \"bears\" that prey on stocks and make them go down. \n\nWhen both bears target a single stock simultaneously, they will mercilessly pummel the shit out of it. A recent example is FB(a stock I like, by the way) -- with the market beginning to perceive that FB is neither on the cutting edge nor particularly cheap, (depending on how you value the losses from reality labs), FB stock was mauled and assaulted by the two bears and thus fell drastically. \n\nOne bear is potentially survivable -- two bears at the same time is invariably gruesome. \n\nPTON, like Facebook, is not seen as a particularly innovative company nor a particularly cheap one. PTON has been under assault for some time by both bears. Consequently the stock fell nearly 90% from its highs.\n\nYet, in this particular case, both bears have left not to return. The anti-value bear is repelled by the enormous layoffs and new CEO, a former CFO that make the meal unattractive to him. \n\nThe anti-momentum bear appears strong, yet mostly appears strong from temporary trends that favor him -- the fading of the coronavirus had given this bear courage, but it is a one time favor and sure to slip away. \n\nPTONs return to growth is essentially a 100% certain outcome -- the question is around timeframe. I believe that within 12 months, the narrative of a recovery in the business will be widely accepted, and the stock will trade significantly higher -- $70 perhaps.

{"title": "What is the best time to buy and sell? Generate Trade Ideas using Seasonal Patterns", "selftext": "Trying to bring back the detailed DDs that were here before everything exploded last year with growth. This is from a blog post I recently wrote.\n\nSeasonal patterns repeat themselves time and again in financial markets.  From many corrections taking place in Feb-March, to the end of year [Santa Clause Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus_rally),  retail traders can learn about them, and leverage historical data and  seasonality to generate alpha in the markets. For instance, going into  small caps [IWM](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=IWM)  at the start of October and staying in till end December every year has  yielded a profit of about 9% every year. Compare that with [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  where the average yearly profits are about 17%, despite the holding  period being 4 times more i.e 3 months compared to full year. These  types of statistics can help us come up with trade ideas, and that is  what we are going to discuss in this blog post.\n\n## Seasonality Data\n\nWe will start with more macro analysis and move towards analysis that is very granular and can  help us do a deep dive into seasonal data.\n\n## Month, Week, and Hour Seasonality\n\nWe are going to talk about the radar charts for months, weeks, and hours seasonality in [Stocks Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard). The figure below shows a summary of the charts for [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  Each corner is either a month, hour, or a week day, and the values are  the number of times price has closed green for each variable. More  specifically, at each point, we look at data from the last 20 years, and  calculate how many times the price closed green. For instance, the  value at August would be the percentage of how many times in the last 20  years [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)'s price closed higher than it opened in the month of August.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onef1os30wg81.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=786373f3e3dd0d4477ff16b4389d26a1db6cd806\n\nWe can see that [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  seasonality starts to get better from July onwards and continues to  increase till the year end. This can inform us that trading [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  for bullish plays is best done during the last six months of the year.  On the other hand, we can see that the seasonality is quite even/bad at  the start of the year, which can actually prevent traders from going  heavy into bullish plays at the start of the year. Although this data is  useful, it is still not granular enough to give us specific plays.  Therefore, let's talk about a few more tools we have.\n\n## Granular Seasonality Across Time\n\nKnowing what's the best half of the year to buy a stock is good  information. But we can do better, and look at more granular information using our Seasonality & Price Movements widget in [Stocks Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  This tool shows the cumulative average daily, minute level, and hourly  change for the stock under analysis. At each analysis point, we observe  how much did the price change, and create a cumulative graph of that  change, averaged across time. The purple line demonstrates that while  the green and red lines are simply the upper and lower bounds of how  much price is expected to move at a maximum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqlwq4t40wg81.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=55fdd2047230fc9cc85e8d308cd5f7880656bcf7\n\nThe chart above illustrates the granular seasonality of [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  from 2010 to 2019. We skip 2020 because of the COVID crash, and want to  do testing in 2021. From the chart, we can observe a number of things.  First, the start of the year is a very choppy time period for the market  in general and stocks do not have a clear direction. From March  onwards, price starts to get in a bullish trend, but the trend is not  very strong. In around June-August period, there is on average a quick  mini-rally. Finally, after August, price starts to gradually continue  going up historically with a strong uptrend, leading to an end-of-year  Santa Rally. Those are quite a few observations, let us now see if they  actually worked in 2021 and 2022. We advise readers to do this analysis  on 2020 as well, because they will find very similar stats.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3c0eiug50wg81.png?width=2884&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a6285692caf0f2886414d168c2b0e0a1da002c\n\nHaving the knowledge from looking at the seasonality from 2010 to  2019, let us now see if that applies to future data as well. Analyzing  the last two years, we can observe very similar behavior in [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  Dips and choppy markets both happened in the start of 2021 and 2022,  which is not surprising given we had already observed that fact over the  historical data. Another great thing is the rally from June to August,  which netted about 7% in just three months in 2021. Finally, we can see  the big rally at the end of year, which we call the Santa Rally.  Overall, the price of the entire year looks very similar to the average  price of the last 10 years. That is a very strong edge for retail  traders because it lets them stay in and out of positions at the right  time, and somewhat time the market, which is an incredibly hard thing to  do without looking at any seasonality data.\n\n## Intraday Seasonality\n\nMost people look at seasonality based on days, weeks, or months of  years. However, there also exists seasonality in how the price of a  stock moves intraday, and retail traders can leverage that to great  effect. Let us take a look at [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  and how it moves intraday. The first thing we need to do is pick the  minute level seasonality in the tool. The figure below shows that the  price of the stock, on average, goes down for the first half of the day  and goes up on the second half of the day. It is important to note that  this is averaged data across many months, and it will not work out  exactly every single day. Despite that, if we see a dip on the first  half of the day, we can somewhat assume that the stock can potentially  move up on the second half of the day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dulp9fb60wg81.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=366b30e1ac2002fa4274424fcd1289c9a4c6cf38\n\nLet us actually test this theory on minute level data for [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  from Feb 1st to Feb 4th, 2022. The figure below demonstrates the  effectiveness of the intraday seasonality. Looking at the four days of  data, we can see that the stock generally tends to go down after the  market opens. There was only one day where it did go up for a while, but  by the mid day, the stock is either down or break even. Despite that,  it starts to go up in the later part of the market hours. It was only on  Feb 3rd, where it went down a bit towards the end. However, an accuracy  of 3/4 is quite good especially since we are simply looking at  seasonality without doing any additional analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rjkx7170wg81.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=805a284b25325c93d46625717e8229b737f10128\n\nAnalysis like this can help us find patterns that different stocks  follow, and make plays based on them. For instance, if you want to go  bullish on [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  for a day trade, the second part of the day is where you should enter  into your position. For readers, we would urge you to take a look at [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)'s intraday seasonality chart. You might have heard that [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) makes most of its move pre-market and after hours - you will see a proof of that.\n\n## Macro Comparisons\n\nSeasonality data also lets us analyze differences in how different  sectors or indices move across the year. The chart below shows a  comparison between [QQQ](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=QQQ) and [IWM](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=IWM).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfgb5bs70wg81.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bdd281559e832bdaf90879bfdb6631c842128e\n\nLooking at the charts, there are some differences that catch the eye.  First, QQQ can often rally at the start of the year, but IWM rarely ever  goes up much at the start of the year. In contrast, IWM goes up  significantly more at the year end compared to QQQ. Although the  principle here is valid for all types of comparisons, if you look at the  data for IWM in 2021, you will see that we actually did not get any  rally at the end of year. This example is added deliberately to show you  some limitations of seasonality analysis. It only looks at historical  data, and if market regimes change, it can be invalid for future.  Therefore, please always do some additional due diligence on top of your  seasonality analysis.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAs discussed in the last section, it is paramount that you do some  additional due diligence on top of your seasonality analysis. As long as  you're doing your due diligence, seasonality data can provide you great  insights and trade ideas, that can help you become a more profitable  trader. We hope this guide will prove useful to you and help you become a  better trader.
