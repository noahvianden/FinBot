{"title": "RKT - Bull thesis", "selftext": "We\u2019re nearing the end of a pretty nasty downtrend trend for Rocket Companies (RKT), but it may be time to consider buying in at these levels for a long position. I\u2019d love feedback on my thesis below.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the stock has struggled in the face of raising interest rates to combat inflation. It\u2019s been looming over the stock since early 2021 (aside from when it meme\u2019d). Now that we have a little more clarity from the FED on what we\u2019re dealing with and how we\u2019re gonna handle it, the next few years may actually be favorable for Rocket even if on the surface, they\u2019ll be making less money than they did during the pandemic. \n\nI believe the competition will be way more affected by higher interest rates than RKT. This is a reality that all mortgage companies have to deal with. But RKT has deep pockets along with more diversification into other revenue streams to wait out slower periods. I believe there will be more consolidation in the mortgage industry in the next few years (we\u2019re already seeking it with moves like Better.com, look that up if you haven\u2019t seen that mess) and it\u2019ll only help RKT obtain more market share. \n\nThe execs at RKT have also been very savvy with acquisitions to grow their platform outside the traditional mortgage route. I predicted that they\u2019d start acquiring companies about 3 months ago (see post history) and they bought Truebill (a 1.275 billion all cash deal) a few weeks after my post. They\u2019re funneling tons of cash into advertising this app. I see adds EVERYWHERE for it (youtube ads, public transit, etc) and it\u2019s a brilliant way to get users in the door/into the ecosystem for more service offerings. The user base growth is a story no one seems to be talking about. It will be key in the long run as they strive to obtain the most market share. I expect another major acquisition to be done by the end of 2022 at the latest. Jay Farner (CEO) stated that they\u2019d be very aggressive this year to acquire companies as they become more appealing to buy with everything coming down from pandemic highs. \n\nAnd the cherry on top, Jay also stated that he plans to buy $36 million of his own stock throughout the year of 2022. The stock price of 10-11 seems to be an established floor with the worst news already known and behind us. The upside heavily outweighs any risks that I see but I\u2019d love to hear any *constructive* negative theories that you may have (especially at these prices).\n\nPosition, 3600ish shares (dividend $ recently reinvested back into the stock, rounding) @ a 17 average. I\u2019ll be buying calls soon as well. Preparing to buy call leaps by the end of the week. I expect this to be a 20 stock by 2023.", "id": "tsdmcw", "created_utc": 1648666580.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Mort industry is about to get wrecked.

The housing shortage hasn't gone away.  Everyone is assuming that rates will continue to rise throughout the year.

I also think that the majority of the inflation we are seeing is supply chain related.  Although it may take a couple of years for supply chains to fully heal, I think we will see improvement by the second half of the year.  This biggest risk IMO is that the Fed goes too far with rate hikes.  Rate hikes won't repair the supply chain they will only hurt demand.

But a Wall Street Journal analysis of nearly 400 such trades over three years indicates that information about the sales routinely leaks out ahead of time\u2014a potentially illegal practice that costs those sellers millions of dollars and benefits banks and their hedge-fund clients.\n\n[The Journal\u2019s analysis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-we-analyzed-wall-street-block-trades-11648647951?mod=article_inline), covering 393 block trades between 2018 and 2021, found that 58% of the time, the share price declined in the trading session immediately beforehand, controlling for the performance of peer companies. Of the 268 trades for which the Journal was able to determine how much the banks paid, the sellers would have received $382 million more if the stocks had performed in line with the benchmark, or about $1.4 million per trade.\n\nA handful might be explained by a negative headline or chalked up to bad luck. But the persistent pattern of stocks falling in the run-up to big insider sales suggests a more widespread problem: Information that should be confidential is getting out.\n\nThat pattern is now at the heart of a federal investigation into whether banks tip off favored clients to coming block trades. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sought trading records and electronic communications from a number of big banks and hedge funds, and the U.S. Justice Department is running its own probe, [the Journal first reported in February](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-probe-block-trading-at-morgan-stanley-goldman-other-wall-street-firms-11644875448?mod=article_inline).\n\nThe investigation for now appears to be focused on [Morgan Stanley](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MS), [MS **-1.44%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MS?mod=chiclets)the dominant bank in block trading in recent years. The firm disclosed later in February that it had been responding to information requests from the Justice Department since the summer. In November, it put one of its senior executives in charge of block trading, Pawan Passi, on leave. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Passi\u2019s behalf and repeated attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.\n\n[Goldman Sachs Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GS) Inc. has also received requests from regulators, the Journal reported.\n\nThe investigation, along with a broader market decline, has chilled the big business of block trading in recent months, bankers and investors said.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s analysis found that when Morgan Stanley executed a block trade by itself, the median stock trailed its peers by 0.7 percentage point in the trading session leading up to the deal, meaning half performed worse than that. That was the worst record of any of the biggest banks that are major players in block trading. The median of [Credit Suisse Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CS) AG\u2019s deals was underperformance of 0.4 percentage point, the analysis found. The median trades executed by Goldman and [Barclays](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BCS) PLC roughly matched the market.\n\nAcross all banks, the median stock lagged by 0.2 percentage point.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Goldman and Barclays declined to comment. The other companies and investors mentioned in this article either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond.\n\nLeaks could come from a number of sources. Companies tend to approach multiple banks to bid on block deals, leaving open the possibility that someone other than the winner of the business has leaked the information.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a comprehensive public list of block trades. Some are registered with the SEC. Others can be gleaned from more obscure corporate filings. Many leave no trace at all. The Journal\u2019s analysis drew from databases maintained by research firms IPO Boutique and Dealogic as well as information from market participants, and matched details of those trades to securities filings where possible, but the list likely isn\u2019t exhaustive.\n\nInsiders who want to sell a slug of stock have a problem: Posting the order to a public exchange would likely tank the price. So they turn to Wall Street.\n\nAn investment bank agrees, generally around midday, to quietly buy the shares at a discount to the market\u2019s closing price later that day. The bank then aims to flip the stock to its trading clients at a higher price and pocket the difference. It is a clubby world: Four or five banks do the vast majority of trades, and the same roster of hedge funds line up to buy the shares, according to the data and market participants.\n\nWall Street thrives on information edges, and at the beginning of a block deal, the bankers are holding a valuable nugget: They know that a wave of selling is likely on the way. That is because public shareholders, assuming that corporate insiders are better informed, tend to copy their trades. A flood of shares for sale also knocks the supply-demand balance out of kilter.\n\nRegulators suspect that investment banks have been tipping off their top clients, who jump in and sell ahead of that wave, according to people familiar with the probes. In many deals examined by the Journal, the stock-price slide began in late morning or early afternoon, around the time sellers typically alert bankers to their plans.\n\nThe ultimate losers in these situations are often pension funds, endowments and foundations. They invest with private-equity firms, which use block trades to unwind stakes in newly public companies.\n\nBain Capital, which lost out on $33 million after Canada Goose\u2019s stock fell in the final hours of trading before it sold a slug of stock, counts Indiana teachers and Los Angeles city workers among its investors, according to public records. Pension funds are also big investors in Boston-based T.H. Lee Partners, which missed out on at least $31 million of proceeds on five block trades between 2018 and 2021 due to unexplained price declines, trading data show.\n\nBlock trades can be risky. Banks compete to buy the shares at slim discounts, and if they misjudge investor demand or there is a sudden, unexpected drop, their profit margin can quickly evaporate.\n\nThat creates a financial incentive to leak details ahead of time. Knowing which investors will buy the shares, and at what price, could help a bank fine-tune its bid and decrease its risk of losses. And tipping off top funds to a profitable trade\u2014selling short a stock heading into a block sale tends to be a winner\u2014could curry favor with important clients.\n\nThere are other reasons a stock might fall ahead of a block trade. When a company goes public, employees and early investors are usually prevented from selling their shares for a period of time, generally six months. Hedge funds know when those so-called lockups expire and often short the stock ahead of time.\n\nBut fewer than 20 block trades in the Journal\u2019s list appear to be linked to the expiration of IPO lockups, and they performed only slightly worse than the rest. In the vast majority of examples, there was no obvious reason the stock might have underperformed.\n\nMost resemble what happened to 3G Capital, a private-equity firm [known for its investments in household brands](https://www.wsj.com/articles/3g-capital-diversifies-away-from-food-with-hunter-douglas-deal-11640966951?mod=article_inline). Between 2018 and 2021, 3G executed at least three block trades to trim its stakes in two of them\u2014Kraft and [Restaurant Brands International](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/QSR) Inc., the parent company of Burger King. Each time, it hired Morgan Stanley to sell the shares, and each time the price moved against it.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 2018, shares of Kraft climbed all morning, outperforming the S&P index of other big consumer-products companies. At 12:26 p.m.\u2014right around the time that sellers of block trades typically engage banks\u2014the stock price started to fall sharply. It closed down 1.6%, lagging the index and costing 3G Capital some $13 million in lost proceeds.\n\nIn another 3G block trade a year later, shares of Restaurant Brands cratered at noon and closed down 1.8% on a day the index rose.

I.E. dispensing, smoothing, and then jetting basically an adhesive onto the powder.\n\n\nThey combine that with Bi-Directional printing so that each direction is a complete step of the process and get insane print times. The final part needs a bit of work to depowder and then cooks for a bit before it is done or goes for final machining. [All of those processes manage to be faster and less costly than the traditional subtractive manufacturing approach.](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/pgv-cuts-lead-times-by-up-to-80-using-desktop-metal-3d-printing-technology-202448/) Not to mention the flexiblity and lack of needed tooling, reduced maintenance, it goes on and on.\n\n\nOf their recent aquisitions, Desktop Health owns a line of very popular resin 3D printers, and has a patent on some [fancy dental resin. \n](https://dental.desktophealth.com/products/materials/flexcera/)\n\n[The forust line](https://www.forust.com/) reuses wood waste to make all whatever you can think of in wood, and can apply customized grains, be finished sanded and whatever else you would do with regular wood. \n\n\nExone had some very popular [sand printers.](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/99/kimura-foundry-group-purchases-10th-desktop-metal-sand) These are used to make molds for casting and shit cheaper, faster, and in house. now DM's so they tap into casting and replace it at the same time \n\n\nI mean look at all the different metals they can print. (Including those they develop) ((scroll down)) https://www.desktopmetal.com/materials\n\nThis doesn't even cover their smaller printers, which can do things like carbon fiber. The financial stuff is already above, and yeah it took them a long time to release the thing, but that tells me in part they wanted to make sure it's good. I'm a huge fan of the space and this particular company. bagholder confirmed.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I've been looking for a 3D printer stock that stood out and I may dip my toe into a small position of DM.
