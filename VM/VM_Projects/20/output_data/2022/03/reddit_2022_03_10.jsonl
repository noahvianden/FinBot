{"title": "[Opinion] Why I think you should start paying attention to US cannabis reform", "selftext": "Hey everyone! \n\nBefore reading, please understand the risks of investing into a fledgling sector. It\u2019s all speculative at this point, always be aware of your risk tolerance, time horizon and how much volatility you can stomach. Always do your own research and read all public disclosures before investing. \n\nEdit: If you\u2019re unsure of your risk tolerance here\u2019s a link to an investment [risk questionnaire](https://s21.q4cdn.com/198919461/files/doc_downloads/enterprise-components/assessment_reports/IWT_CurrentReport_RiskToleranceQuest.pdf). Just my opinion, but I highly recommend against buying cannabis stocks at this time unless you\u2019re at least \u201cvery aggressive\u201d. If you complete it, details are on pg 5. \n\nI\u2019ve been following North American cannabis reform for several years now, my first investment into the sector was just before legalization in Canada. The potential American market is enormous (10-12x Canada\u2019s). I\u2019ve read many different projections for the sector and they range from $70-$100b+ by the late 2020s. A market that size will support some very large valuations in the future. \n\nAs it stands today, the US Senate has been the holdup on reform, but Chuck has made multiple statements that he plans to show us legislation in April. As majority leader he sets the legislative agenda, definitely someone worth paying attention to if you invest or plan to invest in the sector. There\u2019s a big appetite for reform on both sides of the aisle, so even if POTUS threatens a veto (highly unlikely imo) congress can override it. \n\nI\u2019m not going to endorse any specific company or business model, that\u2019s outside the scope of what I want to discuss today. I will say, I think it\u2019s important for everyone to research the Canadian and Oregon markets as a case study before investing. Oregon is the most mature and saturated cannabis market in the world, it gives us a glimpse into what the future may hold. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s become clear is flower quickly becomes commoditized (as in Canada & Oregon) and margins crash, this has caused many headaches for Canadian producers (I don\u2019t own any Canadian cannabis stocks anymore). The gross misallocation of capital by many of these firms has valuable lessons to teach. \n\nImo the future of the industry will be those companies that focus on branding (very important), distribution and higher margin products like edibles, oils etc\u2026 \n\nI believe a well run, scalable wholesale business with strong branding and distribution can achieve gross margins of 45-55% +\n\nImportant things to consider when researching cannabis companies (my opinion): \n\n> The most lucrative target market from what I\u2019ve read will be female head of household. \n\n> Capital allocation strategy. Make sure they have experienced management that can allocate capital efficiently. When Congress moves on banking reform the industry will be flooded with cash, many inexperienced management teams are going to struggle to scale quickly and efficiently (Canada has many examples) \n\n> The business plan, and an outline of how they are going to scale in the future. Make sure you understand the business you\u2019re buying into. \n\n> The CEOs and senior management's compensation plan. It\u2019s wild to me how many CEOs in the sector have set themselves up with lavish compensation plans while their businesses hemorrhage money. Look for management teams whose incentive structure lines up with shareholder interests. Or better yet, executives who are buying the stock with their own money. \n\n> Personally, I eliminated businesses from my list who had numerous execs (or the CEO) who worked in the illegal sector. No judgement, I just don\u2019t want to invest money with someone who spent their time working in a grey or black market. Too many bad habits develop imo and transparency doesn\u2019t become part of the culture. Another lesson learned from the Canadian market \ud83e\udd23\n\nThis is all just my opinion, please take it with a grain of salt lol. I\u2019m comfortable with high risk, highly volatile investments but they aren\u2019t for everyone. Please know your risk tolerance, that has the single biggest impact on your success when investing. \n\nWould love to hear everyone else\u2019s thoughts!

{"title": "Running a synthetic short on RIDE", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nJust the name *Ford Lightning* does something to my American DNA by putting hair on my chest. My doctor has warned me about high cholesterol, my psychiatrist about the mega lottery environment of this sub, and my dealer about fake Sinaloa chalk. But most importantly, a friend of mine, an autist, has warned me about the EV startups. Specifically the SPAC EV start-ups, like RIDE. His rosacea beams when he talks about them, his voice booming with an authority that makes FOMO unavoidable. I found him last Saturday where he usually is in Sapphire (Times Square location). He wanted to talk about his investment newsletter he\u2019s about to start putting out while a piece of Cuban meat ground expertly on him, contaminating our space with what I learned was an essence called *Warm Vanilla*, by Bath & Body Works. I pressed him on which EV to short and how to do it. He slapped the Cuban\u2019s ass and instantly appeared an enormous square-shaped bouncer from the shadow warning him. Normally this will get you thrown out, but he greases the place like the lesser Biden did Ukraine. Anyway, my friend became functional, getting his shit under control and staring at me. This was rare though, as he can hardly maintain eye contact. But it was dark enough, and he gets Bolivian marching powder from the same cats that sell to the anorexic towers overlooking Central Park, the half empty ones owned by a dozen shells working back to a czar colluding to replace Putin before he\u2019s Grand Dragon of Finland and Arch Duke of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYou sell a call at strike price A,\u201d he said, \u201cThen you buy a put at strike price A.\u201d\n\nI thought about it a moment. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the equivalent of just shorting the stock?\u201d\n\nHe laughed at me but was staring in the Cuban\u2019s eyes now. \u201cThe margin requirement is far less, way less.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amazing when stupid simple things like that get overlooked. With this strategy I can short RIDE to bankruptcy which will happen later this year and have enough money for violent YOLO\u2019s as circumstances demand in what\u2019s certain to be a volatile trader\u2019s market. The autist explained the importance of lasers in the manufacture of semiconductors and modern batteries. He took a veiled shot at me claiming I\u2019m familiar with neon at the liquor store I frequent, but neon gas is necessary for these lasers. He says Ukraine effectively exports all the world\u2019s neon for these, and with the conflict, it\u2019s pretty much over without Obama-style bailouts with Trump-sized denials. He calls shorting these EV\u2019s a millionaire maker and that they\u2019ve already enjoyed their stonk and meme gasps.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for them to get undressed by the buzzards.\u201d\n\nThe FOMO this guy writes into me is like the bank robbery scene in the movie Heat. But suddenly the meat spoke, she said something interesting while we were briefly talking about Russia, her pleasing boobs rattling with each syllable:\n\n\u201cCubans don\u2019t want their grandpa\u2019s revolution, they want jobs. Putin no understand generational divide. Nobody cares about or wants their parent\u2019s Soviet Union. Is gone. Culture change. World change. Globalization. Interdependent...\u201d\n\nThe lecherous Patrick Bateman inside us all would\u2019ve paid anything to smash this meat and leave it for dead. Trust me. Anything at all. NYC strippers are amazing, smart, cognizant creatures. Someday I want to get a list of all the old Harvey Weinstein haunts and try figuring out if they had anything to do with him shafting Saving Private Ryan from getting best picture in 1999. Anyway, knowing I\u2019d be looking to make up for blue balls with another dancer in the Sapphire\u2019s employ, I quickly left. I rode my bike back to Brooklyn, and in my apartment searched r/wallstreetbets for anyone of the same mind as my autist. All I found were degen bulls buying calls and refusing to admit they\u2019re trying to make up for missing out on TSLA.", "id": "taoree", "created_utc": 1646880919.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|34|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=taoree)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=taoree)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2108478993177414}, {"body": "What's an anorexic tower?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Those new and impossibly thin skyscrapers you see cutting the NYC skyline like daggers and scalpels.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What if I don't see the NYC skyline?

{"title": "Amazon stock has its second-best day of 2022 on planned 20-for-1 split", "selftext": " Amazon shares bucked a down day for the market, rallying more than 5% after the company announced a 20-for-1 [stock split](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/amazon-announces-20-for-1-stock-split-10-billion-buyback.html) and said it will buy back up to $10 billion worth of additional stock.\n\nIt was the second-best day of the year for Amazon, which jumped 14% on Feb. 4, after an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings report. The stock closed at $2936.35 on Thursday.\n\nStock splits don\u2019t change a company\u2019s fundamental prospects, but they lower the price of each share, potentially attracting a wider swath of investors. In Amazon\u2019s case, reducing the share price by 95% could make the company a contender for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which weights its 30 components by stock price rather than by market cap.\n\nWere the split to happen as of Wednesday\u2019s close, the cost of each share would go from $2,785.58 to $139.28, and each existing holder would get 19 additional shares for every one they own. Amazon would have the 12th-smallest weighing among Dow stocks, which would put it in the middle of the pack, right alongside Walmart.\n\n\u201cWe believe AMZN is one of the biggest companies with a clear pulse on the American economy and not included in the Dow Jones Top 30 Index,\u201d wrote Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst at MKM Partners, in a note to clients after the announcement. He recommends buying the stock.\n\nAmazon is the latest highly valued tech company to pull down the price of each share through a split. Google parent\u00a0Alphabet announced\u00a0a 20-for-1 split in February. In mid-2020,\u00a0Apple\u00a0disclosed plans for a 4-for-1 split, and\u00a0[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA)\u00a0told investors it was instituting a 5-for-1 split.\n\nFor CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos in July, the split and buyback could be aimed at appeasing shareholders, who have had a rough stretch of late. Amazon was the [worst performer](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/amazon-was-the-worst-performing-faang-stock-of-2021-heres-why.html) among U.S. Big Tech stocks last year, and the shares were down 16% in 2022 prior to the announcement.\n\nAmazon said the change is also targeted at helping corporate staffers.\n\n\u201cThis split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nDistributions from the stock split will be made to shareholders at the close of business on June 3, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 6.\n\nThis is\u00a0Amazon\u2019s fourth stock split since its IPO in 1997, and its first since 1999, when the company was a fraction of its current size. It also split on a 2-for-1 basis on June 2, 1998; a 3-for-1 basis on Jan. 5, 1999; and a 2-for-1 basis on Sept. 2, 1999.\n\nAmazon\u00a0shares are up more than 4,300% since the last split was announced.\n\n [Amazon stock has second-best day of 2022 on planned 20-for-1 split (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/amazon-stock-has-second-best-day-of-2022-on-planned-20-for-1-split.html)", "id": "tba50l", "created_utc": 1646949785.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tba50l)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tba50l)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I did not want the split because I think it will increase volatility (bear in mind I live in Europe and none of my three brokerage accounts allows fractional share purchases). \n\nHowever, I now want to sell put and call options, and this split makes it possible for me on AMZN in the first place.
