At that time he was so prescient this would be a discussion point at some time in the future he wrote down EVERY equity mutual fund in existence at that time which came out to about 320+.  So over about 25 years how many of those funds beat his VFINX in REAL life (not theory)?  11-12.  That is <4% beat the index.  Now if add just a conservative 1.5% extra fees due to higher cost of active funds which is WAY conservative from that time period it lowered the outperformers to 5-6.  That is <2% that beat the index.  Keep in mind that data is just over 25 years or so.  An average investors life time is around 50 years (30-80 for example).  So you can imagine the chances are even worse as the time period is extended.

{"title": "$ET is breaking out and so is Natural Gas!", "selftext": "Hi everyone! Got some more technical analysis for y'all.\n\nEnergy transfer ($ET) has recently formed a double bottom and bounced on support. In addition it has broken a resistance which has stood since early March. On the 4hr timeline, the MACD has started to flip to being bullish and the RSI is also now curling upward indicating strength in the underlying stock. This can all be seen in the following chart.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/ma9QKaFa\n\nIn addition to the breakout seen in the ET chart, natural gas looks like it's on the verge of a breakout as well. Natural Gas, along with all other commodities have been performing very strongly as of late as we all know. Though natural gas has lagged Brent oil in terms of gains, it looks like its ready to play a little catch up. Seen in the chart below, natural gas is currently breaking a resistance that has stood since October of last year and considering ETs main business is in the natural gas industry, it's likely this will only fuel ETs breakout.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/LgSIYA9y\n\nSome final notes: natural gas is being labelled a renewable energy in Europe along with nuclear providing another catalyst. Additionally, broader markers seem strong with the recent rate decision coming in lower or at expected depending on where you look. This decision has been priced in a lot during the past few weeks as it has been in the headlines for the market almost daily, hence the quick recovery after the flash crash today.\n\nHope everyone makes some money and has a nice tail end of the week!\n\nPositions: ET 5/20 10C\n\nOh and also ET absolutely CRUSHED it's most recent ER", "id": "tg0y1r", "created_utc": 1647488008.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|26|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|62|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgnjkr/blink_is_primed_for_short_squeeze_get_in_while/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tg0y1r)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tg0y1r)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21400518715381622}, {"body": "Natural gas and oil will just keep going up forever.
