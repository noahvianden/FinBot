{"title": "Outlook for $BRK.B for the next 12 months?", "selftext": "Hello. I'm from Turkey and if you follow the news regarding our country lately we have a hyperinflation-ish situation (which is still going on) in our country and a FX crisis (peaked 3 months ago but the fundamental risk still exists). In addition we have a huge boom in housing prices especially in Istanbul, which is where I'd like to buy a house. Real estate prices increased %20 in USD terms, whereas my salary is down like  %5 in USD terms (and I'm actually very lucky compared to the most of the other employees who didn't get this much of a salary raise since I got a %85 raise in TRY terms). So, in short, things are not looking good both for the time being and for the future..\n\n\nAs I said above I have an intention to buy a house in Istanbul but for this to happen, first I need to sell another house in a minor city where the real estate prices didn't increase much compared to Istanbul. So I don't know when will this sale happen and thus I'd like to invest my current cash position in a valuable stock which will perform relatively well for at least upcoming 12 months. When I looked into it, $BRK.B looked like an obvious choice for that kind of investment but I'd like to get your opinion on this. Based on the fundamentals, the company seems quite a bit undervalued right now. However on the other hand, it is currently in it's (almost) ATH price and the last analyst expectation for its price was $364, so it seems there's not much room left for the potential growth from that perspective. I personally believe in Uncle Warren and I heard that he bought some oil companies a while ago so even if we have an inflationary period of time for the upcoming 12 month, BRK.B might perform relatively well compared to the rest of the market, but overall do you think is it (still) a good time to buy this share at  the moment?", "id": "tqtegt", "created_utc": 1648534877.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "12 months is extremely short term.

With stocks you are taking on the risk of losing all your money if the company goes bankrupt (since  stock holders are last in line in bankruptcy court), i.e. \"single company risk\".  So they expect returns HIGHER then bonds called \"ERP\" (equity risk premium), i.e. difference between return of stocks over those of corporate bonds to get folks to put money in stocks vs. corporate bonds.  \n\nWhat finance theory suggests is there is NO extra premium to be had by DIVERSIFYING that risk of single company risk.  It is what they call an UNCOMPENSATED or NONSYSTEMATIC risk.   The risk you take on buying one single company does not warrant expecting a higher return then just buying a basket of single companies.  In either situation the investor is just getting the ERP.  So basically is it just a gamble of losing all your money if the company goes bankrupt with no increased expected return hoping you get an Apple vs. a multitude of many stocks that fail to beat the index.\n\nThe above is pretty dry theory so maybe just answering the question \"What are the chances of picking out the next Apple vs. a dud?\"would be more useful...\n\n2 links below give you an idea of the chances of how many companies beat the index.  The first link shows in the last 10 year period that just ended.  Only 20% of ALL stocks beat the index.  So you have a 80% chance of picking out an underperformer.  Second link shows the data back 25 years.  It shows:   67% of stocks fail to beat the index and the overall median return of all stocks is a whopping -53% vs. the index!  The odds of finding the next Apple was 7% in that data set.  So, that means you have a 93% chance of failing to find the next superstar stock.

Jim Cramer declares the bear market is over\n\nPublished: March 28, 2022\n\n \n\n>The stock market has climbed a pretty sizeable wall of worry over the last two weeks, with the S&P 500 rising 8% during a period of continued war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve rate hikes.  \n>  \n>Jim Cramer, the CNBC commentator, seemed to be in a triumphant mood on Friday.   \n>  \n>\u201cThere are 600 companies that came public in the last 18 months. There\u2019s like seven of them that trade north of nine bucks. This is the bear market, just like 2001, except for we have rates much lower,\u201d he said.  \n>  \n>\u201cYou remember those days, those companies were all jokes,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m looking at all the companies under $10, many of them are actually making money. We are in some weird market, that is a bear market, and that no one called it as a bear. And I think the bear market is over.\u201d  \n>  \n>So, that\u2019s a lot to unpack. The generally acccepted definition of a bear market is one where prices have dropped 20% or more from a recent high. That occurred first in the small-cap Russell 2000 [**RUT,** **+0.00%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/RUT?mod=MW_story_quote), and then the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite [**COMP,** **+1.31%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote), though not the S&P 500 [**SPX,** **+0.71%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote).  \n>  \n>Cramer\u2019s reference to stocks under $10 is a reference to special purpose acquisition companies, that are typically priced at that level. According to Tuttle Capital Management, there were 613 SPAC IPOs last year, and another 52 so far this year.

Amazon orders took weeks to deliver because I assume there wasn't enough stock to ship it outright, and almost every physical location was completely sold out.\n\nPersonally I think the earnings will be the highest yet, but do you think I am missing something or misjudged on this?
