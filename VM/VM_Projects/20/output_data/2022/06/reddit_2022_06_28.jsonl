{"title": "DraftKings Lands New Bull as Profitability Nears. This Analyst Also Likes Penn. -- Barrons.com - $DKNG", "selftext": "[https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RE722X073NCW](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RE722X073NCW)\n\n**DraftKings Lands New Bull as Profitability Nears. This Analyst Also Likes Penn. -- Barrons.com**\n\nKarishma Vanjani\n\n(Dow Jones) -- DraftKings and Penn National Gaming stocks will outperform the market by selling additional products to their existing customers, according to a new research note.\n\nJMP analyst Jordan Bender on Tuesday initiated coverage on the gaming companies with a Market Outperform rating. He cited the market positions of DraftKings (ticker: DKNG) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) and sees an opportunity for both companies to sell from one channel to another, known as cross-selling.\n\nDraftKings' stock was down 2.9% to $13.20 on Tuesday whereas Penn National was up 0.8% to $32.58.\n\n\"For DKNG, iGaming is the obvious cross-sell,\" said JMP's Bender. DraftKings iGaming products like Rocket and Spanish21 are variations of real-life casino games that can be played online. Although they are geared toward a slightly different demographic, the analyst believes the company can use its growing marketplace to offer other services like to sell sports apparel and leverage its customer base.\n\nAnother reason for Bender's rating was DraftKings' market exposure. As North American online sports betting continues to grow and gets legalized in more states, Bender believes the company will be able to sustain its market share as one of the top-three U.S. players. Additionally, specialized products, like its partnership with micro-betting company SimpleBet, could help exceed long-term internal revenue targets, the analyst said. He forecasts it could reach $2.87 billion by 2023, more than 2% versus consensus.\n\nBesides JPM, Jefferies analyst David Katz reinstated coverage of DraftKings (ticker: DKNG ) at a Buy just over a month ago, saying the risk/reward was highly favorable.\n\nFor Penn National, Bender likes that the company has leveraged its position between its casino database, and its acquired online assets Barstool Sports and theScore, managing to cross-sell to the different customer groups. These channels have proven to lower customer acquisition costs, he said,\n\nBender thinks there is an upside to Penn National's shares even in a recessionary scenario. Casinos have traditionally been unaffected by inflation, gas prices, and downturns given the convenience of a regional casino and the entertainment it provides for a low spend, he said. Penn's revenue only fell 3% during the financial crisis, according to Bender.\n\nKatz agrees with Bender. Over a month ago, he wrote that he believes in \"the relative benefit of regional gaming in uncertain times.\"\n\nPenn National has also managed to maintain its market share in the past year in the face of high levels of industrywide marketing and promotions. \"We attribute the sticky market share to a more loyal Barstool player and casino database \\[and..\\] believe this bodes well as elevated marketing and promotion spending declines over the next year.\"\n\nWrite to Karishma Vanjani at karishma.vanjani@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires", "id": "vmv22a", "created_utc": 1656443122.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|97|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|151|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ush4pz/suspicious_of_an_analyst_buy_rating_on_risky_bio/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq4ryy/dkng_updated_morgan_stanley_detailed_analysis_as/) \n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vmv22a)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vmv22a)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35279691219329834}, {"body": "God I fucking hope so my whole body cramping from these heavy bags", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Same brotha!", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14591257274150848}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04548823460936546}, {"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

On top of that, the only other ride in that section, The Millennium Falcon ride, is underwhelming by modern standards and isn't innovative at all.\n\n- The Oriental Land Company does a better job at being Disney than Disney Parks does in the States because they're actually always investing and innovating. Just take a look at Tokyo DisneySea for example.\n\n- Everest is a worse ride due to a fundamental design flaw which was slowly breaking the Mountain, and ultimately required them to permanently disable the giant Yeti that was the showcase of the attraction. Without other Gates being open to take guests elsewhere, Everest cannot ever be taken offline long enough to be fixed, even if Disney did decide it was worth updating.\n\n- Disney has lost nearly all its ride sponsorships which used to be a part of what kept them fresh and interesting. Things like GM, Kodak, Siemens have all left the parks.\n\n- Disney massively increased ticket prices to the parks while cutting Cast Members and reducing benefits for everyone except those doing the crazy expensive packages/hotels.\n\n- The Galactic Starcruiser Hotel has opened with very few amenities, small rooms, extremely few cast members for the \"experience\" which was the entire draw of the place, and not to mention that the guests at the hotel can't even get on the major ride associated with said hotel because, as noted above, the ride breaks down all the time.\n\nThere's a ton of reasons to be bearish on Disney, and to dislike them as a company for your portfolio. And they've got a ton of problems. Wokeness ain't one of them, and is having exactly 0 impact on their bottom line for the last 30 years, especially when compared to any one of the above issues.\n\nSource: Lived in Florida the last 15 years, and I know dozens of current and former employees from engineering to actors to janitorial and lots in between from every one of the parks both Disney and Universal.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4372939467430115}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.666630744934082}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.00774543359875679}, {"body": "Tale as old as time\n\nTrue as it can be\n\nBarely even friends\n\nThen somebody bends\n\nUnexpectedly\n\n\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\n\nI swear to god the mouse is gonna bend you all over and rail you bears.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10813931375741959}], "tickers": ["dis"]}
