See if we can come up with something before market close. \n\nMain CPI components are shelter (40%), transportation (20%), food (15%), medical (8%), education (6%), recreation (6%).  Break down further, you can figure total energy weight around 9% (fuels in transportation and home energy usage). \n\nRent is down in May (10% vs 10.6% in Apr, www.apartments.com), airline tickets and entertainment weights too small to really matter, goods are unlike to go up given the excess retail inventory.  So, food and energy would be the drivers. \n  \nUse DBA and USO as proxy, we can estimate that food and energy price increase in May would contribute to about 1.2% CPI increase in May (USO gained 18.2% (use average 9.1%) and DBA up 5.6% (use average 2.8%) from Apr low to May high, then add up the weighted average).  \n\nCPI increased 0.8% from Apr 2021 to May 2021.  Base effect alone not sufficient to have a lower YOY CPI.  \n\nThat\u2019s how far I got.  Given that market has bounced, and I have no way/run out of time to estimate decline in other components.
