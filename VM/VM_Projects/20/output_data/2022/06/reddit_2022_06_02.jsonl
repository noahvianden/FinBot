{"title": "Stone Co ER FDs today and beyond.", "selftext": "**TL;TR**. ER FDs betting on good results. Results are released today 06/02 after market close.\n\nStone Co is a medium-sized, Brazilian company. It's a Fintech company. Yes, that sounds gross. This industry has monkeypox mixed with covid. Plus Brazil is south of Greenland.\n\nIt first came to my attention when I read that Warren Buffett was buying a stake in this company. That was in 2018. He bought 10% of the company at IPO price. Something close to a ridiculous stake compared to the size of Berkshire's portfolio. Ridiculous but hey, Mr. Buffett counts the pennies. The first quarter of 2021 he sold 1/4 of his holdings at $74. Very very nice partial profit taking. He keeps the rest, so overall his holdings are at a loss. Other sound investors followed, the infamous Jack Ma's Ant financial, the Walton family, or rock star Cathy Wood, among others. Green flag.\n\nStone is a $3 billion company. It's a company with products similar to Block (NYSE:SQ), but limited to the Brazilian market. We can also compare Stone to Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU). This is a $17 billion company. Although Nu is a different beast, it also has the monkeypox and is Brazilian as well. The funny thing is that Buffett also owns a portion of it. StoneCo's revenues are only half of Nu's. Growth is comparable to Nu's. If we run some numbers, our little retarded brain might conclude that there are extremely bad vibes around StoneCo compared to its peers. Run your numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Charts**\n\nHey monkey, cut the shit, let's take a look at a long term chart, so we know where we are. You'd better do your own technical analysis, and find better charts elsewhere. I don't want to be a technical analysis rock star, so let's keep it simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Long term weekly candles](https://preview.redd.it/ezur17qa16391.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=f50d12fcab982c10ba45a97f24c81a45e02a751a)\n\nIPO October 2018 priced at $24. It reached that day $34. Next we can see a bubble-shape uptrend fueled among others by the well known unprecedented fed's QE. On the chart we can see important level around $17. This level stopped the pandemic sell-off. As we can guess that's precisely the target price set by many industry analysts now. \n\nAt the peak of the bubble it reached $94. From there to lower than $9, that's a drop of a whopping 90%. This grabs the attention of losers and apes like me. Whenever a stonk drops like a stone, there is something fishy smelling or it's simply a stone. Funny name now. Or maybe I'm just fucking smart and I will be instantly rich because I see what no one else sees. Let's buy bucks to the penny.\n\nNobody wants to hear about Fintech. If someone says Fintech, I straight up puke. That's a vomit flag. Vomit made the price close to zero. At $7.00 precisely. You brainless retarded ape, remember the IPO was at $24, Buffet bought at that price and the company has been growing in double digit revenue ever since and generating positive cash flow ever since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short term, 4h candles](https://preview.redd.it/wy7gsirr16391.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfda4dbfeadfbdda4c6d15492c4826eba7f12adf)\n\nShorter term, last May shows a too-good-to-be-true reversal pattern. The sad thing is that most stocks in the market did the same, so what? No matter what, green flag it is.\n\nHey, freak out about that March hype. A candle is not a candle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThis sucks. It takes lots of work to place here the numbers, so you can have a look elsewhere.\n\nStoneCo company itself has all data very well organized and with many colors. I like colors. Presentations there are Apes friendly.\n\n[https://investors.stone.co/financials#quarterly-earnings](https://investors.stone.co/financials#quarterly-earnings)\n\nI'm not a fundamentals rock star either, so let's keep it simple. I like'em. I see growth and I see steady, positive cash flow.\n\nOhhh, a quarter losing money. Red flag.\n\nThe company tries to be clear about numbers. Negative earnings quarter has explanations if you buy the explanations. They acquired Linx, an obvious competitor and took a 5% stake of a bank, then started a loan business. They lost money. The good news is that they did it all with their own money, not by begging for extra cash from shareholders' pockets. All this comes with opportunities and risks. They admit 2021 was a bad year and they identified what they did wrong. I like the no excuses policy.\n\nThey seem to be getting better at risk management now. That's what they say and that's the play. Last quarter they returned to the green numbers by posting profits again. The profits were driven by their puzzling revenue growth. The stock soared 40% after the results were released. Read it again: 40%. You can see on the short term chart a huge green candle with huge volume in March. However, the monkeypox virus was still there, and those gains didn't last. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Good vibes and no bullshit at StoneCo web page](https://preview.redd.it/sz37ua0xl6391.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=a269af40d6837d76fa2b3454bd56faecd213b6c7)\n\nI like the motto. No Bullshit.\n\nYou can find most data about the company growth in its web page. Growth in number of employees is not there, but it's here : )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Number of employees. Source: macrotrends.net](https://preview.redd.it/1mxqllt117391.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=20cd10f8d5b7fe219e078d179a85c8d1a68cb049)\n\nIf you search/research a bit, you'll find great DD at the SearchingBeta site, if you like 'em.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retarded perspective**\n\nHey, this company was trading at $94 and now it's at $10. That's juicy upside potential, then I'll be filthy rich tomorrow. Get a life and fuck your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend.\n\nHey, this company is Fintech and has posted a loss, better short it wildly to zero and beyond. Okay, but don't lose your pants. Your wife's boyfriend likes it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In risk/reward we trust**\n\nIt started at $24 and now it's at $10. The company is making money and growing steadily. Major investors are holding the stock. Well, maybe we've found an undervalued stock.\n\nRisks: Fear over vomit-stocks remains and we are reverting the bubble. Additional stark reality is that StoneCo's banking can lead to losses. Brazilian interest rates may also hurt. Merchants can default and not pay. Some soulless guys may continue to play dirty with the Brazilian credit registry system. Whatever it is, we don't care. We want quarterly profits. If not, shut up. If it's green, it's good. Over.\n\nReward: Read it again 40% jump last earnings release. Spell it. F-o-r-t-y. If it doesn't jump this time you better blame Wendy. Long term positions too.\n\nIMHO the stock has already priced in a fuck up situation. I read your mind. Bad things can always get worse. True. What if mister market decides that earnings are not good enough? Okay, then roll.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**. This wsb account is new. Red flag. I'm sorry I cannot connect the last one, dunno why. I don't care actually. Fuck the first ape to mention this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;TR**. ER FDs betting on good results.
