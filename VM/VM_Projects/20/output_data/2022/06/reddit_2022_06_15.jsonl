When VIX<13, buy SPX (Market is steadily going up)\n2. When 13<VIX<32, sell SPX puts (Market is fine, selling put takes benefit of the market and meanwhile having safety cushion for mild drop)\n3. When 32<VIX, sell SPX Iron Condor (Bleeding market with options over priced, good time to sell. Selling Iron Condor is a better choice than selling straddle, due to it defined max-loss)\n\nIn my opinion this strategy has such advantages:\n\n1. Holds a critical rule in choosing between buy/sell: **only sell option when they are over priced.**\n2. VIX is an efficient indicator of: **not only** if Index options are over priced, **but also** how the market is performing.\n3. When market is just fine (not very good, not very bad; which is most of the time), selling PUT is wise.\n4. Selling Iron Condor instead of Straddle: **defined max-loss is important**\n5. Do this strategy **ONLY** on Index options! Using the same strategy on stocks easily cuts the fund by half.\n\nSummarize in one sentence: **apply different option strategies on different market conditions**.\n\n**NOTE: I clearly said PUTVM beats SPX in the last year, not in all history.

This is even if you just Wheeled the sector ETFs, you probably outperformed even more strongly had you bought the strongest stock in each of these sectors and then Wheeled or used a dip buy strategy (buy under the 20 SMA, sell when it crosses back under after a certain sized move).  \n\nHolding an ETF like SPY or QQQ is smart, because they are generally designed to go up, but to act like it is the only strategy that makes money is beyond dumb.   SPY is up 175% over 10 years, not anything to sneeze at, but many of these other sectors are up well over 200% to the obvious strawman extreme of BTC/USD that is up over 3100% in just 8 years that I have data for.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ask u/MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS, he evidently has this whole \u201cstock market\u201d thing figured out:\n> it was quite easy to beat SPY", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I don't have anything figured out.

If the prices of raw materials and capital investments rise, manufacturing cost goes up. \n\nCompanies can react by either 1)raising prices or 2)borrowing if interest rates are low. But since using debt to finance growth/operations is now becoming increasingly expensive due to rising interest rates, more companies may choose the former. This leads to higher prices passed on to consumers and higher inflation.\n\nGranted, units sales may fall due to high interest rates but since per unit manufacturing costs are pushing higher, good prices may not fall. \n\nEither way PPI has a part to play in inflationary expectations.\n\n\n(I digress here moving into the supply side specifics\u2026)\n\nI think the basic economics explanation for todays inflationary situation is when the supply curve is moving backwards due to costs of production and the demand curve forward due to lifting pandemic restrictions. So the Fed is trying to move the demand curve back to force prices down by raising costs for consumers but unintentionally moving the supply curve back further in the process as costs soar for producers. \n\nSome companies at this juncture fire newly hired, less productive workers to cut costs or simply shutdown since these are the quickest steps available. This reduces labour demand and wage costs in the medium term which eventually lowers PPI. As for land costs and raw materials costs, these will likely only change in the longer term. Capital cost will only get worse from here.\n\nUnfortunately, recent unemployment and wage changes according to the BLS have not reflected much of that expected change so maybe the market hasn\u2019t reached the medium term yet. Average import prices have also not fallen from countries like China, SK etc. Plus, given the current political climate, I doubt the gov will like to see unemployment tick up so the administration may intervene directly or support unions which blunts the efficacy of rate hikes and increases bankruptcies. And then there are other problems in the respective industries like with retail that has to restock most of its inventory due to mismatches etc which will push up demand and PPI in the next qtr supporting inflation. The shipping industry that will see more delays as China reopens etc raises transport/freight costs. The Fed may then try to push for even more rate hikes until the end of the year which is the nightmare scenario.\n\n\n(I digress even more to interest rates here. sorry, a lot of pent up rage the more I think about it\u2026\ud83e\udd2c)\n\nOn the demand front, quarterly earnings and revenue outlooks of many firms have also not changed meaningfully, with only a few firms revising their outlooks lower. Inflation has also not fallen meaningfully for CPI, total or core data i.e. below 0.4% mom growth. If the Fed takes this at face value and adopts a more aggressive stance, then the stock market is f*****. Hopefully, the Fed adopts a wait-and-see approach for the next month or two before changing their stance. However, given recent interviews from the Fed that repeat how they are trying to catch up to inflation, this feels unlikely. \n\nSo for now the whole market is just praying for the wait and see Fed rather than the catching up Fed. And today is the day we arrive at the fork in the road and the Fed tells us if we\u2019re going to heaven or hell. \n\nBut before that, we are likely going to see another ugly retail sales data (given May CPI last week) and lower oil inventories (given gas prices in May). Mortgage applications should also be falling significantly. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m just praying the import price index falls big due to dollar appreciation.

The S&P 500 traded Monday at 15.8 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet, still above the 15-year average of 15.7.\n\nRaising rates Wednesday by a larger 0.75-percentage-point, or 75-basis-point, jump could be one way for the Fed to catch up to an increase in inflation that has been far higher and persistent than officials anticipated. Evidence that measures of inflation expectations by businesses and households over the long run are rising would be especially alarming inside the central bank.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that the Fed has decided to do 75 basis points rather than 50 basis points because of the data we\u2019ve gotten over the last week or so showing higher inflation and maybe some more disturbing news on inflation expectations,\u201d former New York Fed President William Dudley said at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network event on Tuesday.\n\nBut he said he expected officials were \u201cprobably splitting the difference\u201d by opting instead for the 0.75-percentage-point move.\n\nAnalysts who closely parse the central bank\u2019s policies were divided Tuesday over whether the potential costs outweighed any benefits from shifting to a more aggressive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise from the half-point rate increase expected before the recent inflation reports.\n\nSome warned that the central bank, by having recently provided unusually precise steers that it would raise rates by a half percentage point this week, risked sowing greater confusion in financial markets. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, in a note to clients on Tuesday said he was worried that the 0.75-point rate increase \u201cis not embedded in a credible and systematic policy strategy and, without this, risks looking like a panicky response\u2026that may not age well.\u201d\n\nMr. Guha, a former adviser at the New York Fed, said such a move created a \u201cserious morning-after problem\u201d by inviting difficult-to-answer questions about what the Fed would do next. \n\n***The Fed\u2019s campaign to tame inflation is upending the dynamics that ruled the stock market in recent years, when rock-bottom interest rates drove investors to seek returns in risky assets. The popular view that there were no alternatives to stocks helped push the S&P 500 ever higher, reaching a recent valuation peak in September 2020 of 24.1 times its projected earnings.***\n\nMore recently, ***worries about inflation and the path of interest-rate increases have provoked turmoil in markets as well as vigorous debate over the right valuations for stocks in the current environment.*** One source of concern is the risk that the Fed\u2019s tightening will push the economy into a recession, damaging both business fundamentals and investor sentiment. More immediately, higher interest rates reduce the value of companies\u2019 future cash flows in frequently used pricing models.\n\nOne concern for financial markets is that bond investors are beginning to anticipate not only a sharper path of increases, but a higher destination or so-called terminal rate for the Fed. On Tuesday, investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 89% probability that the Fed would lift rates to around 4% or higher by June 2023. That market-implied probability was at 1% four weeks ago, according to CME Group.\n\nIn periods of distress, investors can be quick to decide that stocks are worth much less. And historically, valuations have fallen farther before bottoming. In the selloff of December 2018, during the Fed\u2019s most recent previous rate-raising cycle, the S&P 500\u2019s forward multiple fell as low as 13.8. In the depths of the March 2020 selloff, as the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic shut down swaths of the economy, the index traded as low as 13.4 times its projected earnings. \n\n***\u201cMarkets don\u2019t typically bottom near historical medians,\u201d said Greg Swenson, portfolio manager at Leuthold Group. \u201cThey tend to overshoot on the downside from a valuation perspective.\u201d***\n\nAdding to concerns for stock investors: ***Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.*** U.S. companies have warned of challenges on multiple fronts, from rising costs to a foreign-exchange hit from a stronger dollar.\n\n***\u201cThose valuation multiples are based on a really overly optimistic earnings outlook,\u201d Mr. Swenson said.***\n\n***Another valuation model, the Buffett Indicator, compares the value of publicly traded companies in the U.S. with the country\u2019s gross national product. As of the end of last week, a version of that measure was 29% above its historical average and above its peak in the dot-com bubble days of 2000***, suggesting that the market is overvalued. The metric was named for Warren Buffett, who once called the indicator \u201cprobably the best single measure of where [stock market] valuations stand at any given moment.\u201d \n\nTwo recent surveys have shown signs that consumers\u2019 long-term inflation expectations are rising. Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that such expectations were rising, or becoming \u201cde-anchored,\u201d because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.\n\n---\n\nA couple notes:\n\n1) ***For investors utilizing the passive strategy, none of this matters.***  The original plan was to DCA through thick and thin into the index, and none of this news alters that plan, at all.  Financial news like this is targeted towards people with an active component to their investment strategy.\n\n2) One key theme in this article is that ***valuations matter***.  This time is no different. \n Most bears over several years have been warning about this, but there has been no catalyst to spook the market until lately, that catalyst being persistent inflation.\n\n3) ***Don't Fight the Fed***.  This should be self-evident by now to newer investors.\n\nedit\n\n4) An extra note.  One of the bolded quotes in the article:\n\n>Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.\n\nThis is why CAPE is valuable.  CAPE does not go off earnings projections...it instead goes off historical earnings.  One in the hand is worth two in the bush.  ***According to CAPE, the market is still about as overvalued as it was in 1929.

{"title": "Soft Landing In Phoenix", "selftext": " \n\nIt's a soft landing but you get locked in the cabin with 250 other people in phoenix for 12 hours when it's 120F and the AC is turned off. They start going crazy, people are delirious from lack of hydration. One chick starts warming up her vocal threads for opera with her la la la la's. Some other older guy randomly laughs like an old prospector and mumbles things you don't understand. The baby two seats behind you is always crying. The guy next to you never looks at you and just makes little nervous coughing sounds.\n\nThankfully you brought your F M radio so you tune into NPR because you are smart. JPOW is talking about FOMOC and the 'comony. He drops a whopping 300 bps increase and you are suddenly like LET ME OFF THIS FUCKING PLANE, I NEED TO SELL MY PUTS.\n\nRight before takeoff you were in the Newark NJ airport at the bar getting sloshed bragging in the daily thread how bears are fucked and someone dared you to go all in on calls.\n\nInstantly you are now sober and try to spring to action. You need to get your laptop from the luggage compartment. You struggle with your buckle while the young music student starts singing in in Italian but you don't give a fuck you are just tuning it out. If only you could get to your laptop you might be able to get a sliver of 3G signal to hot spot your laptop and sell your position. The airport is a radio frequency island of desolation but you might be able to get a reflection off of the hot metallic tube that is your current situation.\n\nEnraged by the heat and the dehydration you start to really struggle with the 1950's lap belt until you are violently shaking the chair. You start to grunt and start shouting I NEED TO GET OFF THIS PLANE. The old prospector starts to laugh maniacally in a nervous manner and looks straight at you with his crazy eyes. It's JPOW staring you down, he knows, he knows. You are still listening to NPR and JPOW keeps talking about how \"tight\" things are, tight labor market, tight spreads, tight tight tight just like your lap belt.\n\nYou are now like the goddamn hulk and rocking the chair just whining and groaning, the sweat is pouring off your face in streams, the opera chick is back to la la la's but they are REALLY LOUD. The prospector is laughing, a baby is crying somewhere and people are starting to tell you to calm down. All you can get out is \"I NEED TO SELL MY PUTS\" but nobody understands what you mean it sounds like gibberish.\n\nThe men turn to alpha Chads because they are sick of everything and start telling you to shut the fuck up bro.\n\nSuddenly an air marshall rushes back with some flight attendants. They see you enraged and struggling but don't understand. Immediately you are duct taped to the seat and all you can do is shake it violently.\n\nJPOW finishes his speech saying that inflation has been fixed, the market will heal naturally and the soft landing is mission accomplished.\n\nThe opera singer is now slowly crouching in the aisle in front of you. She's quietly singing the la la la's again but slowly moving towards you, staring you in the eyes and getting louder with each crouched step. The baby starts to cry again and she she starts singing in Italian until she's three inches from your face. You can't look away, you just have to stare at this weirdo and accept your fate.\n\nYou give up and start to cry because now your life savings has been reduced to 0.01 per contract.\n\n\"Mission Accomplished, super tight landing\" says JPOW in your ear.", "id": "vciimp", "created_utc": 1655255479.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|34|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|5942|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vciimp)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vciimp)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07694224268198013}, {"body": "TF?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Hey", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16674627363681793}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11707765609025955}, {"body": "Bruh as a phoenix native this gave me flashbacks.
