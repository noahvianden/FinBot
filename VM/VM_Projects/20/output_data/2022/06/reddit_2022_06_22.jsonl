The same people buying gold and silver as a safe haven also view bonds as a safe haven.\n\nWith this rate hiking cycle, bond yields are getting higher and higher.  Higher yields attract investors.  Someone who might be considering gold as an investment might choose a bond instead because of guaranteed returns as opposed to a speculative bet on precious metals.  When you buy a bond you are almost guaranteed to get your money back plus a yield.  With gold you are not guaranteed a return and instead could lose money. This makes bonds more of a safe haven.  \n\nGold historically in short term performance doesn\u2019t actually have the perfect relationship with inflation as many people say it does.  But also you should notice that gold pre pandemic was 1680 and now it\u2019s 1840.  That is a 9.5% and has come close to matching inflation.  \n\n A second point I should make is that you mentioned you\u2019re in silver trusts.  Not only is silver a precious metal that is challenged by rate hikes but it\u2019s also an industrial metal and that\u2019s where most silver actually goes to.  Obviously we have all been hearing about the recession fears and industrial production will fall during a recession leading to less demand for silver which will in theory lead to lower prices.  In the short 2020 recession silver fell around 35%.  In the 2008 recession it fell around 55%.  Silver is a commodity that can bring huge rewards but is mostly a very speculative asset that must be acknowledged as being non-appreciating historically.  To put it in perspective silver was over $50 in 1980.  If you bought 42 years ago you\u2019d be down nearly 60%\n\nI do believe the inflation trade is done or mostly done.  I do believe we will have a recession that is strong enough to curb demand enough to stop inflation.  But for future scenarios the best inflation hedges are commodities like energy, grains, or base metals.

Think like this: A Ukraine-Russia war happened while inflation and energy prices were at near peak levels in a negative interest rated environment and gold could only climb up to 2050 dollars. Now interest hikes are coming with a very possible recession which will consumption less thus lowering the need for industrial metals. Silver will take quite a beating because if that. Similar to oil price. Oil hit the highest in 2008 and started to dip very heavily. And it wasn't a thing to be happy about because it dipped because of the lack of industrial need. Recession in an inflationary environmental will make production halt.\n\nAs for gold, it will start to increase when Fed stop hiking the rates. If Fed stops hiking before inflation drops to some significant levels it will mean that Fed doesn't have necessary will to stops the inflation. So gold will soar as soon as people realize that.

Also peep the ITB for home builders. Why is that going up???? Fewer homes being built and fewer applications for new homes. Homes for sale are already being marked down and sitting in the market longer. Plus people will run for the door and sell properties they are over leveraged with due to economic down turn.
