The big plus is learning to do this has gotten me comfortable with industry jargon, and how to read a 10-K. I have gone from knowing almost nothing about excel to being pretty confident in using it. Sorry I\u2019m just super happy with what I have learned. Going from so ignorant about the market to realizing I have some legs to stand on.\n\nAlso I add a margin a safety at the end, 3 to be precise. 20%, 30%, and 50%. I know adding that at the end is different than adding it to N but I do have some safety added in. I also have 2 extra growing percentages and compare all of these to deem a company over or undervalued. All of these can be change on the fly as well. I plan to add more to this spread sheet. A dividend evaluation and I believe I plan to start learning RIM soon. Hoping to have a template I can change and insert a few things to get good starting info for companies. Also sorry how long winded this got. Thanks again.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well normally you only use the FCF as an input to compute the terminal value, which is some kind of perpetuity, assuming constant growth- at this stage (t=T+1) you consider the company to be in a steady state. Before that (for t from 0 to T, what some call the investment horizon) you compute each year\u2019s FCF. You chose your investment horizon so that it is the relevant timeframe during which your company will transform so as to get to that hypothetical steady state (for Amazon I\u2019d use a long investment horizon, at least 10y, since the business evolves so much). To compute FCF for year 0 to T, you have several way depending on the infos you have. What I like to do is to work from the topline to the net operating profit after taxes to get the FCF, using company guidance for CAPEX (also remember to make capex and d&a converge to the same level as you get to the end of your IH), and I suggest you try to forecast the working cap for each year so as to compute the change in wc (since using a % of sales for that makes little sense). To go from one year to the next what I usually do is apply a growth rate to the revenue, and depending on the company or what I know, tweak the gross/ebitda margins, d&a as a % of sales etc\u2026\n\nWhat you get from that is what you think is the fundamental value of a stock, the idea is then to buy when it trades lower, sell it if it trades higher.\n\nI don\u2019t want to ruin the fun for you, but the reality is that without things such as Bloomberg/capitalIQ or brokers\u2019 research (be it on individual stocks or sectors), your DCF won\u2019t give you a very reliable target price. It\u2019s definitely a good exercise, as it makes you look through financial statements and look for clues in earning calls etc, but I\u2019d suggest that you stick with more qualitative analysis (macro analysis, then for individual stocks look into their pricing power, differentiation, strategies, reputation..) and for numbers just use multiples, DDM if applicable.. But why not keep doing dcf for \u00ab\u00a0fun\u00a0\u00bb just to keep looking at financials, and update them as results are published.. and also do a sensitivity table on excel with wacc and terminal growth (or other variables) to have a broad idea of the range in which the target price is.. It wont be very reliable for growth stocks though as discount rate and growth rate have a huge impact on the target price.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I\u2019d anything DCF for would mainly be used on stocks that are already set.

I do use capex and net cash flow to find my FCF for each year out to 10 yrs prior. It\u2019s also where I get my historical average from. I know it\u2019s not the best to use so it\u2019s why I have a place to slot in two other % of my choosing, along with 3 different margins of safety.\n\n[Here](https://ibb.co/TLSj2f7) is my GOOGL evaluation if you wanted to look at.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s really good that you look at previous financial statements as well, I\u2019d suggest also looking at earnings call and previous guidances to compare with actual results, to get a feel of how the company managed to deliver on its promises in the past. I personally think that it\u2019s very good that you have a long-term, fundamentals oriented mindset (I think a lot of the \u00ab\u00a0technical\u00a0\u00bb and factors analysis you see on some subs is bullshit), and again doing FCF can only be beneficial, only thing is that you should remember that they are only rough estimates given your resources. I looked quickly at the one you did on googl, only 2 remarks : what formula did you use for the cost of equity, i don\u2019t see how you get to something so low (anyway wacc is so tricky, I\u2019d always do a sensitivity analysis and not use a single one). And second, I think you should use this formula for fcf: NOPAT+D&A-CAPEX-varWC, and decompose NOPAT as (Revenue-COGS- other OPEX)*(1-tax rate).
