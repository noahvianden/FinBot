They're notably behind on some very important developments and rely on price competition and \"technology hits\" to gain marketshare. These strategies are looked down upon by investors like me.

As an investor the risk of that NOT happening should be very high in your mind. You should also be cognizant of AMD losing share (as they have done in GPUs for the last 2 years), at these valuations even a tiny stumble will crash the share price. What you can be reasonably confident about is AMD growing with the market and expanding use of semis, and should at max trade at a faang-like multiple.

{"title": "Why we Moon for the rest of the month - Historical Analysis by Jeffries/Bloomberg Research", "selftext": "While it\u2019s been looking a bit unwell for some time, the AAII Bull-Bear spread took the plunge this week and finally slid under -30, taking it to its lowest level in 8Y, back when economic data was softening and the Fed was getting ready to taper. Jefferies: \"We also included the 12WMA, which reached its lowest level since early \u201909. The point is, bullishness is just about as low as it can get, and that tends to be when things turn around. We looked at performance for the SPX when the Bull-Bear spread drops below -30, and: 1) only found 12 instances; 2) highlight the incredibly strong performance thereafter and 3) point out that ex-GFC, you couldn\u2019t really ask for a better MT/LT signal\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4g1p7q5q7u81.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=092b5c258f88995a5dd27811ff28ff2c10267b40\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ds7ut8h6q7u81.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=710005614caedff0b8a84d9ba6c2006a9637d99a\n\n\"One interesting data point we observed is a sizeable rally following the market correction. On its own, corrections can either be a nice dip to buy, or a single leg on a multi-leg bear market. To encapsulate this, we looked at the % of SPX constituents that are trading above their respective 200DMAs. When the market narrows to just <35% of members above that threshold, and you see a solid month of performance, the rally has tended to sustain. This is especially true over the medium term, where 3M performance averages 12%.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nv82vmt8q7u81.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f35dc07db2b81bd72c7a4501e120be752314e5d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h950fmh9q7u81.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=0106189249b46caa8656962448da633348a14c0a\n\nTLDR: There's a very high chance that calls will print for the rest of the month", "id": "u64em1", "created_utc": 1650255170.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|505|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9mdb8/yall_ready_for_the_next_big_squeeze_rkt/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u64em1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u64em1)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2901983857154846}, {"body": "I\u2019m new here.
