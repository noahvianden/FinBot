But they work differently and it's important to know how it differs because that's going to affect how you manage the trade, take profits or losses.\n\nSimply - it's important to understand your trade. Greeks are a way to do that. What greeks shouldn't be relied on for is an edge over the market. A 16 delta strangle isn't necessarily better or worse than a 16 delta dollar wide credit spread.
