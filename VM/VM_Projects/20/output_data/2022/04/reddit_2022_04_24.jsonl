All they need is an initial seed, and they'll grow from there.\n\nPrice competitiveness is coming with scale. The cost of LIDAR has fallen off a cliff (predictably so), and Moore's Law has swept up the computational side of things.

I'm not sure how we're going to bridge the gap, but briefly:\n\nThings that \"don't stay put\" are not a problem. Again, the maps are self-updating. That's the point. They don't need to be 100% accurate on every run, it doesn't work that way. Maps not how the vehicle makes decisions in the moment, but rather provide supplementary information for an extra boost of confidence.\n\nThe industry term for this is 'priors', but the human analogy is simply *memory:* If I ask you to grab me something from a store across town, you'll use your memory of all the previous times you drove similar routes to to get there.\n\nYour memory goes further than just planning an efficient map route \u2014 you know detailed semantics: You know to avoid the one street which is full of potholes, and you know to stick to the left hand side on the one boulevard which has had on-going construction for the last month or so.\n\nIf, on the way there, you spot a new bridge closure, you add that to your memory too, and you'll avoid that bridge in the future when you might have otherwise taken it to another destination. The big pothole you usually avoid has been fixed? You'll remember that in the future too, and start taking the lane you otherwise wouldn't have.\n\nThat's all maps are: Memory.\n\nRemote 'operators' (no known industry player actually directly 'operates' their vehicles \u2014 the term teleguidance is preferable) are not a significant cost. They aren't assigned 1:1 to each vehicle, and phone home only to get backup on the ambiguities *everyone* will face. Vehicles might phone home every hour or so to start, but as performance improves, that number will eventually drop to once every couple hours, once per day, and perhaps even once per week or so.\n\nEvery company attempting L4/L5 will eventually use them, including Tesla. The economics are such that it makes no sense not to use teleguidance \u2014\u00a0it's extremely cheap to implement at scale.\n\nZoox has a great video on [how their teleguidance system works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQHuutVx78), if you're interested.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You do understand it's a circular argument?

They require substantial infrastructure, 5G, and that alone creates a problem of scalability. Then comes operator cost. I've seen some Cruise videos and it's clear when operator intervenes. It's quite frequent, and that's how they are pulling these fancy demos.\n\nThen there is another problem nobody wants to talk about: LIDAR has serious issues with power, weather and eye safety.

Mapping isn't about augmenting the fidelity of your immediate surroundings because your perception stack sucks \u2014\u00a0it's about seeing the things you could never see no matter how good your perception stack is, because those things are either too far away, or occluded. \n\nGoing back to the pothole example, it's about *knowing that pothole is there* way before you could even see it \u2014 and simply not using that lane ahead of time, rather than scrambling to get out of the lane the moment the pothole comes into view.\n\nPerceptual fidelity is not the issue here.
