Now, however, with gas prices, inflation, and interest rate hikes have many likening this period to the 1970's, in which the US stock market underperformed (especially large cap growth). A mere .25% interest rate hike and the end of QE have been enough to cause the NASDAQ to correct by almost 20% - and more rate hikes are on the way.\n\nWhile I'm still personally bullish on tech long term when we eventually rebound, I am opening a position in Small Cap Value. I believe that should we really witness another market rotation and decade of underperformance such as the 1970s, that Small Cap Value will do well. In the 1970's it outperformed massively, and currently IJS, an ETF that tracks Small Cap Value stock index, is down -6.17% YTD. Not great, but so far is beating more conventional investments such as cash (-7.5 Jan and -7.9 Feb 2022) the NASDAQ (-18.99) and the US Market as a whole (-11.83%). When eventually we do recover, Small Cap Value historically as been an asset class that does best in \"recovery environment\" and \"a young bull market\"\n\n**TL;DR;** For me personally I believe now isn't the time to sell tech stocks at a loss, as Tech is still way forward.

{"title": "Breaking: Twitter in Talks to Strike a Deal With Elon Musk", "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Twitter could finalize a deal as soon as this week, people familiar with the matter say. The two sides met Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal and were making progress, though still had issues to hash out, people say. The deal is expected to be finalized this week, but there is no guarantee they will reach a deal. \n\nTwit\u00adter Inc. is in dis\u00adcus\u00adsions to sell it\u00adself to Elon Musk and could fi\u00adnal\u00adize a deal as soon as this week, peo\u00adple fa\u00admil\u00adiar with the mat\u00adter said, a dra\u00admatic turn of events just 10 days af\u00adter the bil\u00adlion\u00adaire un\u00adveiled his $43 bil\u00adlion bid for the so\u00adcial-me\u00addia com\u00adpany.\n\nThe two sides met Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal and were making progress, though still had issues to hash out, the people said. There are no guarantee they will reach a deal.\n\nTwitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made April 14 without saying how he would pay for it, and [put in place a so-called poison pill](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-moves-to-block-elon-musk-from-increasing-stake-11650040204?mod=article_inline) to block him from increasing his stake. But after the [Tesla](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA) Inc. [TSLA **-0.37%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA?mod=chiclets)chief disclosed that he has $46.5 billion in financing and the stock market swooned, Twitter changed its posture and opened the door to negotiations, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Sunday.\n\nMr. Musk has said from the beginning that his $54.20-a-share offer is his \u201cbest and final,\u201d and he reiterated to Twitter\u2019s chairman Bret Taylor again in recent days that he won\u2019t budge on price, some of the people said. The conversations between the two sides were expected to focus on issues including what Mr. Musk would pay should an agreed deal fall apart before being consummated.\n\nTwitter is slated to report first-quarter earnings Thursday and had been expected to weigh in on the bid then, if not sooner.\n\nThe potential turnabout on Twitter\u2019s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n\nMr. Musk made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company\u2019s decision.\n\nMr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn\u2019t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to [reduce the platform\u2019s reliance on advertising](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-elon-musk-would-do-with-twitter-11650200403?mod=article_inline), as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n\nSome shareholders rallied behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC\u2019s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. \u201cHe has an established track record at Tesla,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.\u201d Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n\nMr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer\u2014which is far from guaranteed\u2014he would still need a way around the company\u2019s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n\nOne oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target\u2019s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter\u2019s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year\u2019s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n\nTwitter\u2019s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. Mr. Musk has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, which totals more than 9%.\n\nThe financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days\u2014which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive\u2014likely contributed to Twitter\u2019s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal.\n\nTwitter\u2019s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has \u201cgone nowhere\u201d since the company went public eight years ago, Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management, said earlier.

{"title": "Finally understand Tesla and its Trillion Dollar Value (had for a while) and why it is hard to be shorted", "selftext": "The Reasons and correct me if I am wrong:\n\n1) It is **the modern** car company. Don't know if it will be an electric or hydrogen fuel future, but the car has the design (interior and exterior) similar to what Apple did with the smartphone. Every other car manufacturer is copying it and building off it. It is in the 10-15 rankings for total made annually. \n\n2) It is a **car insurance** company because of the autopilot. I think most car manufactures will provide insurance when level 3 or higher autopilot is fully functionable. They will have to cover for any issues with accidents and software errors. People will be driving with fully autopilot in the future and issues will be on the software. \n\n3) It is a **car dealership and service** company. In USA and worldwide (I think), car manufactures sell to car dealerships and they have their own repair shops. Tesla is operating both (I think). From what I read on reddit, it costs a lot for fixes and replacements on Teslas so money there. There are around 500 worldwide and some have service centers. \n\n4) It is an **EV Charging** company. There are Tesla charging station all over the world and I am sure an universal charging cable will be available or made mandatary by law (I fully support this) in the future. I think Tesla is testing a **convenience store** plus charging station concept for EVs in California.\n\n5) It is a **battery and energy storage** company. I think its R&D department will create the latest batteries for cars which is used by power companies and currently homes.\n\n6) It is a **data and mapping** company. Tesla cars have been on roads, highways and freeways around the world which has stored information for AI to build upon. It uses Lidar and cameras, they open sourced their patents. \n\n7) It sells **carbon credits** and will continue to until the market will have enough players to make it a loss. It also has **bit\\*coin,** meaning companies can hold anything other than cash (which is becoming or is useless) that can pay interest quarterly and can be easily exchanged back to cash or other services.  \n\n8) It is **the modern roofing** company. In my opinion uv solar roof shingles is better than having a solar panels over the roof.\n\n9) I think it could be a **full transportation** company. It will offer the electric truck and semi-truck, could have electric boats, jets or anything they can design. \n\n10) It is designing and planning to make human like **robots**. Robots and machines have been available for a while since the 1970s for car manufacturing. I am sure everyone has seen those Japanese robots, rumbas and other robots. Tesla will just build on all these ideas and create the **humanoid**. \n\n11) I think I read that Tesla wants to be a **autonomous taxi** company as well.", "id": "ubxbbc", "created_utc": 1650925617.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|14|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ubxbbc)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ubxbbc)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.009119777008891106}, {"body": "Defense work as well.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.040982380509376526}, {"body": "Just go and read Tesla\u2019s master plan.
