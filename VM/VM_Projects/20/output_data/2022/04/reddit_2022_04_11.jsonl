Plains All American Pipeline (NASDAQ:PAA)\n\nPAA's strength lies in its well-located midstream energy infrastructure in the lowest-cost U.S. shale basin (Permian Basin). In fact, it has such substantial scale and strategic positioning in the Permian Basin that Morningstar speculates that:\n\nIt's not much of a stretch to state that there is a high probability that in some fashion Plains touches every barrel of oil the Permian produces, earning a fee, if not multiple fees.\n\nWhile weakness in volumes from the basin relative to supply of infrastructure has led to poor financial results for PAA in recent years, demand is beginning to recover in the basin and we expect PAA to be a big beneficiary of this trend. \n\nWall Street analysts seems to agree with consensus estimates for distributable cash per unit expected to improve at a 7.9% CAGR over the next half decade, despite growth capital expenditures set to decline to a mere $275 million in 2022 (down from $950 million in 2020).\n\nManagement is allocating the extra free cash flow primarily towards paying down debt in an effort to further strengthen its investment grade standing and set the business up to better weather any future downcycles like it experienced in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, PAA has been allocating free cash flow towards equity unit repurchases - accelerating its buyback pace in Q4 - and is also growing its distribution at a brisk pace (just hiked its quarterly distribution by 20.8%) in an effort to restore it to its pre-cut level. \n\nWith an expected 2022 free cash flow level of $1.3 billion, PAA currently offers a mouth-watering 16.5% free cash flow yield that covers its recently increased distribution by more than two times. \n\nThis - when combined with expectations of strong per-unit distributable cash flow growth over the next half decade - will enable PAA to deleverage, grow its distribution, and buy back units at a very solid clip and should lead to outsized total returns for unitholders. \u201c", "id": "u1hys7", "created_utc": 1649712040.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit Inc. has banned Seeking Alpha articles sitewide.\n\nTo get around this, please repost your comment/thread with the link removed, and the relevant parts of the article copy and pasted. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
