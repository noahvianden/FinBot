{"title": "Aercap\u2019s (AER) 3.5b loss of aircraft to Russia could pop the \u201caircraft leasing bubble\u201d:", "selftext": "Aercap, the world\u2019s largest aircraft leasing company, has submitted an insurance claim for 3.5 billion worth of aircraft and engines that Russia refuses to return.\n\nHowever, even if they do get the entire insurance claim (unlikely as the claim is going to be fought in court, Loyds of London suggests they should get 10 to 15% https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2022/03/30/660380.htm ) this loss is about much more than the assets/planes themselves.\n\nIt reflects a change in how Aercap will be able to do business.\n\nAercap acts as a \u201cmiddleman\u201d between investors who offer capital to buy aircraft, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines. However, their unprecedented loss almost certainly means an end of the cheap debt and cheap insurance payments they rely on. \n\nAircraft leasing is relatively new over the past 40 years. The number of commercial aircrafts that are leased from a leasing company has grown from 1.7% to 51% of total aircrafts ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095749/share-leased-aircraft-aviation-industry-worldwide/)). \n\nThe growth of this industry is largely based on the Cape Town Treaty ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape\\_Town\\_Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town_Treaty)), a treaty where all signatory countries agree that that they will facilitate the repossession of assets like planes, trains, farm equipment etc to the original state.  \n\nBy stealing foreign aircrafts, Russia has broken this treaty, showing that leasing aircrafts is much more risky than previously understood. \n\nAercap is highly indebted, owing about as much as it owns in assets (74.5 billion in debts, 74.6b in assets *(before the Russian loss)*. They require access to cheap loans in order to facilitate their position as a middleman between bond investors and airlines. They say so themselves: \n\n\u201cWe have incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the GECAS Transaction, \\[most recent 30B bond/loan offering\\] which has significantly increased our indebtedness and debt service obligations, increasing risks relating to our substantial level of indebtedness\u201d (2021 q4 earnings FORM 20-F, p 6).\n\n**\u201c**To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available\u201d (FORM 20-F, p 7). \n\n\u201cDespite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt\u201d (FORM 20-F, p 7).\n\nAt the time of borrowing the 30b, before the Russian loss, the company had a \u00a0MSCI ESG Rating of \u201cA.\u201d This was largely because investors bought into the Cape Town Treaty, seeing planes as assets that are really hard to lose. After Russia stealing the planes, the chances of AerCap ever being able to borrow money again at such a cheap price seems unlikely. \n\nThe same is true for their insurance costs, both the type of insurance AER will have to buy (in order to avoid a similar situation now where they have to fight the claims in court) along with the the increase in premiums to reflect the risk means that their overhead will increase significantly. \n\nAll this means a significant increase in overhead costs in an industry that relies on high amounts of debt. It may be untenable for them to continue to borrow enough money cheaply enough to maintain their company.", "id": "tx9kf1", "created_utc": 1649205389.0, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Naked VIX Calls", "selftext": "Trying to get some feedback on this idea that came to me over the past couple of months. I'm having trouble finding much negative potential so I thought I would post here because I *know* there is more that I'm not seeing.\n\nIdea:\n\n45-60DTE $VIX Calls\n\nStrike around $50-$60\n\nKeep cash on standby, somewhere between 100%-150% of the strike ($5000-$7500). This allows a somewhat \"covered\" position, although the short option is still \"naked.\"\n\nRoll for credit when <30DTE back to 45-60DTE\n\nThought process:\n\nThe highest the VIX has ever been was Q4 1987 when it briefly reached $172.79. From the time it crossed $50 it only stayed above that point for one month. I also think the VIX is calculated differently than it used to be back then, but I can't confirm that. The next highest point was Q4 2008 when it almost crested $90. It was over $50 for one month and then went back above $50 a day later and stayed for a little over a month. Q1 2020 was a similar story.\n\nVIX, by nature, will return lower because high levels of volatility aren't sustainable. Outside of a true SHTF scenario it will go back under $50, and in that scenario I'm not counting on fiat to get me very far, anyway. 45-60DTE allows enough time to ride it out if the option goes ITM or roll out a couple of weeks. Worst case it can be bought back for a loss. VIX options cannot be exercised before expiration.\n\nWith the relatively high volatility right now (VIX is around $24.25), 6/20 $50c options are trading over $1.25 per share. Seems like an easy 2% gain if you keep cash on standby. If you play it risky by keeping less cash (say go as far on margin as your brokerage lets you, *not a suggestion*) and/or going for a lower strike you can make some serious money.\n\nTell me where I fucked up, because I'm sure there's something wrong with this.
