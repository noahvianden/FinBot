I know the whole argument that their numbers might not be as strong the next quarter, they lack market share, the majority of their business is in a declining market, their product suck, etc, etc. But I have seen nothing but positive articles from Seeking Alpha, and several firms have upgraded AMD to buy, and have a target price of $5 to $6. There has been Intel bashing these couple of days, but is AMD just there lingering? And AMD's stock barely saw an increase when their GPU units were released. And their prices were far more competitive than Nvidia's. \n\nAs we saw with ONVO, the articles from Seeking Alpha help shoot their stocks up. But why hasn't AMD been in the spotlight? It has been lingering in the mid 3's. I bought shares at 3.75 and those rose to $4 something before it dropped to 3.50 (and I bought more at 3.5 and then it dropped more).

They paid a high price(low margin chips for consoles) to basically get every major game developer to code for their architecture.  This, plus Mantle, may result in them winning more benchmark wars with Intel/Nvidia, garner more positive press, and lead to eating away at Intel's market share due to a major price/performance/sentiment gap.

They're using x86, same as any PC, same as Intel. They aren't really winning anything by doing that. Admittedly, they might have a slight leg up over Nvidia now if they're able to provide developers with the tools to fully leverage the GPUs within the consoles and there's no reason to think they aren't. But they also shoot themselves in the foot as developers will simply develop to squeeze more performance out of those console GPUs rather than target higher end GPUs in computers. \n\nAMD hasn't done much, the margins on the chips they sell to Sony and Microsoft are extremely low and it keeps them stuck with those chips for quite a while. That'll give them revenue but it won't give them much in the way of profits. They'd have to have something pretty amazing to get their stock to move.

ONVO is risky because there's no guarantee it'll succeed in its goal of printing actual livers. If it achieves that goal, there is a HUGE market for 3d liver printers because livers are (not surprisingly) in very high demand seeing as the supply is awfully limited. There's 121,000 people on the waiting list and only about 10,000 donors in the US. \n\nONVO probably will also be the exclusive provider of the liver \"ink\" or whatever mixture they need to put into the printer to make it print functional livers, so that's additional revenue that isn't bought just one time. I imagine the printers aren't going to be cheap either, so your \"few million in income\" statement seems a little too conservative. At $9.55 a share, their market cap is about $740 million, which I think they could easily grow into and expand past if they achieved the goal of creating a stable product that works for human transplants.\n\nThe PROBLEM with ONVO is that achieving their goal is at least a decade away, and that's assuming everything goes very well for them. Biotech companies are risky because it's very easy to fail at making your product and easy to go bankrupt because everything in the industry is crazy fucking expensive. I work in a research lab, and we regularly use antibodies that cost $300-400 for a 40 uL volume (uL meaning microliters). If ONVO succeeds, it'll be worth well over $13 a share, but everyone just got too excited over nothing, so the jump from $5 to $13 was more than unreasonable.
