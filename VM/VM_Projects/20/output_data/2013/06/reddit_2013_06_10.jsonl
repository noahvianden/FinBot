In addition to the fact that they are losing money on each car.

Anything which appears to be a new release will be a refining on something which is already developed. Anything actually new which Apply might invent/release will be a complete flop. I do not see them reinventing any other industry like Steve did with Music.\n\nThere is a reason why Apple almost went bankrupt when Steve was ousted in the 80s, there is no one else who can take his place and move Apple in the same direction. I see Jobs leaving Cook in charge because Cook was the least horrible of all other choices not because he was the \"best\" of all other choices. (Cook is a great tech CEO, but he is no Steve).\n\nDont get me wrong, I love Apple and everything they have done, but that Apple was really Steve Jobs and now, its just a corporation with a lot of money, a lot of talented people, a good CEO and just like a lot of other tech companies.\n\nToday the stock is worth: ~$438.
