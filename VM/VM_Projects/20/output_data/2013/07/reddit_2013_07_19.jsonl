It's not really an uptrend, but more importantly, the MACD is falling despite higher lows on each day.\n\nSecond image is a 1 hour chart looking back to mid-May when the stock really took off. It looks like long-term distribution ever since, but good luck trying to short it with the way it defies gravity.\n\nTrend reversals tend to show up in a shorter time frame before the longer timeframe, therefore: is the short-term distro a possible sign that the long-term distro is nearing an end?
