I'd wait for the momo down for sure but this is gonna be a juicy short if the timings right.\n\n5.2% gross margins excluding ZEV credits. Guidance to zero ZEV credit revenue in Q4. So that means 2000 bps of gross margin improvement for an extremely capital-intensive cut throat business. Factory in high-cost California. Overseas demand? Also no tax credits overseas. One-time gain from the DOE loan accounting. They stopped reporting reservation numbers so there's no longer a proxy for demand. \n\nThe way the earnings release actually reads, and read it it's a fun one, is extremely defensive:\n\n> However, an important point for investors to note is that we are reaffirming our prior guidance of a gross margin of 25% in Q4 2013, assuming zero ZEV credit revenue. This may turn out to be greater than zero, but we are not counting on it. What really matters is improving fundamental automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits. On this front, Tesla improved nine percentage points from the prior quarter and continues to improve every month.\n\n> Obviously, there is a huge amount of work ahead to improve the gross margin of Model S, but we have a clear roadmap to achieve component cost reductions, as well as achieve additional manufacturing and logistics efficiencies. As a result, we expect to achieve gross margin in the high teens in Q2. Importantly, this expectation includes the impact from lower ZEV credit sales, a lower average selling price due to a higher mix of 60 kWh cars, as well as limited sales of the now discontinued 40 kWh cars, which will have a range-limited 60 kWh battery pack. As mentioned above, we expect that our gross margin will continue to rise into the second half of the year to our target of 25%, assuming no contribution from ZEV credits.\n\n> The lease accounting treatment for cars sold through our new financing plan will have no impact on our cash flows, and we expect to be roughly breakeven on cash flow from operations in Q2, despite launch costs in Europe and a huge increase in service centers, stores and Supercharger stations. However, the deferred revenue recognition required by GAAP for lease accounting will lead to a net loss on paper in Q2. We plan to provide information so that investors can evaluate our results both with and without the impact of lease accounting, as we believe the actual effect on Tesla is positive.\n\nI do not think they were expecting this response; that's not the way the release reads.
