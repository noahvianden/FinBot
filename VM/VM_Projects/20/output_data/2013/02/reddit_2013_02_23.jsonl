{"title": "Short straddles on AAPL has been like robbing the bank...", "selftext": "...when the manager forgets to lock the door and set the alarm.\n\nTrouble is I haven't traded options in years (never was any good at it when I did) and I'm not sure this wasn't just blind luck or  a one-time sweet spot in time decay.  \n\nFrom 2/15 on I shorted both the call and the put on the March 01 weekly expiration on the open of each trading day and covered on the close of each day. Made a bunch of money but not as much as I'm about to outline (because of slippage) as an example of how this worked.  For example, the most this setup would cost would have been $26.66 (without slippage or commissions) on 2/15, and less each day after that, down to $15.5 on the open yesterday (2/22, and it closed at 14.30).  Day-trading from open to close netted around $10.32, or about 38 percent without slippage or commissions.\n\nWithout the slippage and commissions, a short-and-hold would have netted $12.36, about 46 percent for the week, but I have no idea what the protective stop would be for a short-and-hold and I suspect day-trading reduces the risk considerably.  Certainly, the day-trading kept me from going insane, which is what I used to do trading options.\n\nAny suggestions or observations on how dumb (or maybe smart) this has been would be appreciated.\n\n**EDIT 2/26/13 -- Didn't make this bet today so of course it was worth about 13 percent on the day trade.  Want to thank everyone for their thoughts and warnings.  Am keeping all in mind, especially the risk.  But...but...** \n\n**Here's what this looks like on a chart (AAPL is at the top, the 450 put and call for March 1 expiration is in the middle and the descending line at the bottom is short straddle itself) -- I have been playing this as day trade (in at the open out at the close) but look where it fell from on 2/11 (eleven days ago).  My, my, my...**\n\n[**THE AAPL SHORT STRADDLE - MARCH 1 EXPIRATION**](http://screencast.com/t/xEviKVSmAmK4)\n\n**EDIT 3/2/13 -- Wrapping up this strategy... This short straddle made money on five of the past six trading days, losing only yesterday when AAPL went into free fall.  Yesterday's loss was roughly the equivalent of one of the other 5 days gain so no big deal.  Overall gain was about 29 percent on money committed to the trade.**\n\n**However, there are moving targets here that helped make the trades profitable.  It was a day trade each day, put on at the open and covered at the close, which for better or worse eliminated overnight risk. Also, since it was a day trade, I scaled down each day to the nearest AAPL strike, that is from 450 to 445 and finally to 435. Also mid-week I switched from the March 1 weekly expiration to the March 8 weekly expiration.  Had I stayed with the March 1 450 straddle throughout, yesterday's loss would have wiped out the week's gain and then some (on AAPL's sharp decline Friday, calls flat-lined and puts went through the roof). So, as far as I'm concerned, I think the keys to winners here are the day trade adjustments and the time decay in the weekly options.**\n\n**Been good week this week.  Could be different next week.**\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "1939y7", "created_utc": 1361646203.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Don't naked short options...
