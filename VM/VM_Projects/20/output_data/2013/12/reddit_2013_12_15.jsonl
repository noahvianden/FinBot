Ik ben nieuw op reddit en wist niet dat ik geen e-mail notification hiervan zou krijgen :).\n\nIk denk dat elke persoon anders wil leren. Ik had er zelf enorm veel aan om gewoon te proberen met een klein beetje geld. Je kan ook 'Paper Traden' zoals dat heet. Echte posities innemen met vals geld is dat. Dus je kan terwijl leren mbt kennis maar ook praktijkervaring opdoen zonder risico.\n\nIk merk wel dat ik voor mezelf het paper traden altijd minder serieus neem. Het was enorm leerzaam voor mezelf om te beginnen met een beetje echt geld (ik had 4000 EUR waar ik enorm traag mee begonnen ben...) maar het kan met veel minder he. Op de website die ik onderhoud www.stockspikes.com zijn we gestart met $1000 voor een bepaalde challenge die we aan het doen zijn.\n\nWaar je best belegd zal ook ieder je een ander antwoord op geven. Sommige mensen gaan zeggen dat je in US moet zijn, andere Europa afhankelijk van moment. Sommigen grote bedrijven zoals IBM, andere kleinere bedrijven.

En ook het 'echt' voelen als je portfolio groeit of krimpt. 1 van de belangrijkste dingen die je zal moeten leren (heb ik op mezelf moeten inzien) is dat je moet kunnen omgaan met verlies.\n\nUltiem zijn er veel dingen die je kan doen. En iedereen heeft zijn eigen mening, spijtig genoeg. Daarom hou ik het bij 1 ding, het volgen van legale insider trades. CEO's bvb. die aandelen van hun eigen bedrijf kopen. Die moeten dat namelijk aangeven en statistisch gezien heb je altijd meer kans dat die aandelen het beter doen op korte termijn. Dat is ook een beetje waar www.stockspikes.com over gaat.\n\nIk zou zeggen probeer zo snel mogelijk te beginnen en focus op 1 ding.
