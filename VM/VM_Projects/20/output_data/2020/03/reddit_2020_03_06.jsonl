{"title": "\"This is what the start of a recession after a long bull market feels like\" , Credit Market Endures Worst Day in a Decade on Virus-Fueled Rout", "selftext": "Bonds of possible distressed companies, which are affected by the virus, are selling off and there are signs of the credit market for leveraged loans and high yield loans freezing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>(Bloomberg) -- U.S. credit markets are suffering their worst day in a decade as fears intensify that the spreading coronavirus will hurt corporate income and some companies\u2019 ability to repay debt.  \n>  \n>**Bonds of American Airlines Group Inc. dropped to near distressed levels** as companies worldwide canceled business travel and a growing list of conferences and sporting events were called off. **Debt of rental-car companies and cruise lines came under increasing pressure. And energy company bonds and loans fell further into distress as crude oil prices slumped.**  \n>  \n>**The sell-off triggered a surge in a derivatives index that investors use to hedge against losses, pushing it up by the most since at least 2011**, prices compiled by Bloomberg show. The credit-market meltdown was the culmination of a week in which investors withdrew the most cash in at least 10 years from U.S. funds that buy corporate bonds and loans.  \n>  \n>\u201cThis is what the start of a recession after a long bull market feels like,\u201d said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. \u201cThis is the first day of seeing some panic in the market.\u201d  \n>  \n>While stocks have sold off over the past two weeks in dramatic fashion, the drop in credit had largely been orderly until now, market participants say. They\u2019re bidding securities even lower to get trades done, making transaction costs that much higher. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve experienced such volatility in their careers.  \n>  \n>**Most of the selling pressure is hitting on the more liquid names such as General Electric Co. in investment grade and Charter Communications Inc. in high yield.** B**onds sold this week from well-known issuers such as McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Cigna Corp. have been battered in the secondary market. Leveraged loans continued a two-week plunge, with more loans dropping below 90 cents on the dollar after trading closer to 99 or par before the sell-off.**  \n>  \n>\u201cIt feels very tenuous,\u201d said Jerry Cudzil, head of U.S. credit trading at TCW Group. The market is illiquid, and buyers are naming their price, he said.  \n>  \n>Comments Friday morning in New York from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow seemed to remove the worst sense of panic in the market. Kudlow favors \u201ctimely and targeted micro-measures\u201d to respond to the economic impacts of the coronavirus, he said during an appearance on Bloomberg Television.  \n>  \n>Despite the slight reprieve, the pain is widespread, with travel companies and energy bearing the brunt of the pain. **American Airlines and Viking Cruises Ltd. are among the worst travel industry performers in the high-yield market Friday, with some of their bonds yielding more than 12%, according to Trace. Energy bonds have plunged with oil, affecting investment-grade companies like Hess Corp. and cuspier borrowers like Chesapeake Energy Corp., whose 2025 bonds are trading at just 40 cents on the dollar.**  \n>  \n>Some of the prices can be misleading, said Mark Benbow, a fund manager at the Edinburgh-based Kames, who trades in both European and U.S. markets. Since traders are so averse to taking risk, it\u2019s more reflective of bonds being marked down as opposed to real buying or selling activity, he said.  \n>  \n>\u201cThe prices on the screen are a bit of smoke and mirrors,\u201d Benbow said. \u201cIn reality, brokers either don\u2019t have the inventory, or don\u2019t want to be too long or too short on any position, so it\u2019s very difficult to buy or sell.\u201d  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**It\u2019s also been difficult to bring new debt offerings, for those brave enough to tap the markets. After a six-day hiatus, the longest streak since July 2018, the investment-grade market reopened this week, only for some borrowers like Oneok Inc. to pay massive new issue concessions and see their bonds immediately trade lower after pricing.**  \n>  \n>**In other markets like leveraged loans, borrowers aren\u2019t even trying to bring new deals, or are rethinking plans to do so. Pharmaceutical research company Alkermes Plc yanked a planned $350 million loan from the market Friday, citing market conditions, in the fifth deal to be pulled this week. Just one deal launched this week for $380 million, the lowest volume of 2020 so far.**  \n>  \n>Leveraged loans prices fell to the lowest since January 2019, and the selloff accelerated Friday morning, with many issues sinking an additional one to two points, traders say. The average loan traded at 94.8 cents on the dollar Thursday, the lowest level since early last year. Actual trading volumes, however, were muted as buyers and sellers attempted to discern the appropriate price, sources said.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\u201cThis is the first day the loan market has felt sloppier for higher levered credits and especially for credits most tied to travel, lodging and group leisure activities, even post Larry Kudlow\u2019s comments,\u201d said Scott Macklin, director of leveraged-loan strategies at AllianceBernstein. \u201cThere still is good two way flow for higher quality credits, albeit at lower levels.\u201d  \n>  \n>Loan investors are weighing a double hit. They may see weaker earnings that erodes companies\u2019 ability to pay them back. This week\u2019s emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve -- and the potential for more -- is also lowering their base-level compensation on floating rate assets.\n\nsource:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-market-endures-worst-day-172026613.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-market-endures-worst-day-172026613.html)", "id": "fehzot", "created_utc": 1583520144.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, that's the spread but the article is also talking about individual bonds trading at $0.40 on the dollar.

{"title": "Buy solar where the sun is still shining upon the market: SolarEdge (SEDG) DD", "selftext": "In the face of significant market headwinds - I humbly submit for your consideration a bull case for SolarEdge (SEDG).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the last year, SEDG has continuously beaten market earnings expectations in spite of the now year and a half old [25% tariffs](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/472691-analysis-trump-solar-tariffs-cost-62k-us-jobs) that were placed on photovoltaics against China - which has significantly diverted production to other areas of the world and at the time was seen as a potential pitfall for investment in solar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, the company is for all reasonable purposes operating without any significant debt (D/E of 5.68) - which gives them a ton of wiggle room if we do enter a recession as a result of eurodollar/covid 19 problems. Additionally, it will insulate them from shock related to failing zombie companies who are leveraged to the tits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, the stock is uncoupled from the broader market (-.25 Beta) and is still trading near ATH - implying that smart money is still pouring in despite broader market fears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFourth, in the last year SEDG has significantly expanded its foreign operations - [signing new deals](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solaredge-supply-enfindus-inverters-1gw-080000014.html) with European solar installers like Enfindus. As a result of this and its 33% earnings surprise in December its 2020 EPS expectations have been revised up 11 times in the last 30 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFifth, I believe that SEDG is in a stronger overall position than its primary market rivals [ENPH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ENPH/analysis?p=ENPH) and [RUN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RUN/key-statistics?p=RUN) in large part due to its larger market share and lower total debt than either, giving it more potential leverage for growth than either moving forward. (Actuallly, interestingly, a very strong bear case can be made for RUN as a result of its negative EPS and total debt being greater than its entire market capitalization).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that SEDG represents both a long term growth opportunity and a good short term hedge against market volatility. It will continue to perform better than its major peers for the foreseeable future - and I believe that the future demand for renewable energy will only continue to increase. For this reason, I believe that bulls looking for a play to ride out this market will find SEDG to be a really good addition to your portfolios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no strong convictions regarding call plays in the face of short term market headwinds - but I would strongly support LEAPS or actual investment into the company. In short, make tendies where the sun shines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: SEDG good company, SEDG make many tendies, you buy SEDG for tendies", "id": "fem7gy", "created_utc": 1583536804.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "The sun will cease to exist in 10^100 years, so i\u2019m going short solar.
