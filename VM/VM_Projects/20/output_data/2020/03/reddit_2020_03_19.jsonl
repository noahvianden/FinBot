{"title": "Incoming inflection point for general market decline: more studies are emerging showing that existing cheap and widely available treatments have high efficacy in treating covid19 patients", "selftext": "Hi guys, I am back with some good news. Back in February 10th, 9 days before the market began its crash, I wrote a thesis about why an impending serious global economic downturn was inevitable unless two things happened: 1) immediate treatment is developed 2) vaccine developed by next flu season:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/\n\n>So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our \"dip\".\n\nI also wrote a follow up literally a trading day before the oil war started between Russia and Saudi Arabia and prices went crashing that went into further details about what will be unfolding in the coming weeks/months. I detailed trouble for oil industry and oil communities, needed government policies (bailouts, stimulus, helicopter money to consumers), hidden losers like casinos (will be trading cents on the dollar) and private prisons, etc. All of this developed literally within days after the thread was posted.\n\nThis will be my third post in this series but it will be a brief post:\n\nI believe that the market decline is quickly coming into sight because we have increasing evidence of efficacy of various widely available drugs in treating covid19.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/186Bel9RqfsmEx55FDum4xY_IlWSHnGbj/view\n\nThis is the latest peer review study showing that drugs like hydroxychloroquine has been shown to cure (test negative) 90% of patients after 6 days vs 96% still positive for virus after 6 days in the control group.\n\nThis builds on what we've seen reported in countries around the world:\n\n- China just approved chloroquine, an old drug to treat malaria, as an effective treatment of nCov. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202002%2F17%2FWS5e4a436be4b00949486814d8.html&sandbox=1\n\n- \"It would be a medical mistake not to give chloroquine against the Chinese virus\" Didier Raoult, expertscape #1 expert on communicable diseases. https://www.20minutes.fr/sante/2727411-20200226-coronavirus-faute-medicale-donner-chloroquine-contre-virus-chinois-selon-professeur-didier-raoult\n\n- Included in both the Chinese and Korean treatment recommendations https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550 http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428\n\n- hydroxychloroquine seems to work too \"20 patients with new crown pneumonia as of February 17th. The clinical symptoms of patients with 1-2 days were improved significantly after treatment with hydroxychloroquine. After 5 days of use, 19 cases of chest CT showed significant improvement in absorption\" https://www.jqknews.com/news/388543-The_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_has_short_term_curative_effect_on_the_treatment_of_new_crown_pneumonia.html\n\n- earlier update on 21 Feb of 135 cases that generally got better http://www.china.org.cn/china/2020-02/22/content_75732846.htm\n\n- One of the top french specialist on the subject announced that chloroquine might be the medicament we needed and results from the tests in china are amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L6ehRif-v8\n\nSo here's some info on what's happening:\n\nDrugs like Chloroquine works in treating the virus because they are Zinc Ionophores. Zinc inhibits viral reproduction but zinc has a hard time making it past our cell walls. Zinc ionophores solves this problem and has been shown to work for other viral infections as well.\n\nData coming out of countries like China and South Korea shows that case fatality rates dropped immensely after adopting widespread use of these drugs. France is following their lead and the data coming out of France in the coming weeks will help confirm the efficacy of using zinc ionophores.\n\nChinese data are rightfully criticized for being unreliable, but South Korea's case fatality rate is an order of magnitude lower than countries like Italy where the zinc ionophores has not been reported being widely used.\n\nThe discovery of this existing cheap and widely available treatment is what will help return us to normal. The next step will be a rushed vaccine by the next flu season to hopefully permanently put covid19 behind us.\n\nI should note that the early studies have \"flawed\" methodologies. The most recent peer reviewed study has a very small sample size. But this is the nature of emergency crisis situations. You need to use incomplete and often flawed data, apply a giant margin of safety on it, and then draw conclusion about what will likely develop.\n\nMy opinion is that there has been enough data to show that we can probably dramatically decrease the scary case fatality rate to something manageable. All studies are showing the efficacy of these drugs and CFR data from countries using these treatments show drastically fewer deaths.\n\nAnother good news is that my feared \"paradigm shift\" may be alleviated as well. I warned that the most important news to look for is the mutations of this virus. This virus's spreading characteristics makes it very unlikely evolutionary pressures will heavily favor more benign versions of the virus. This is because other viruses like SARS burn out quickly and prevent its own transmissions. They show symptoms too quickly and kill too quickly making it easy to detect/contain. This virus with its multiweek asymptomatic spread means the deadliness of it will not be easily selected out through evolutionary process. So it can evolve deadlier strains and propagated almost as easily as it can evolve more benign strains.\n\nAnd with rapid mutation of new strains, this will hamper efforts to vaccinate against it.\n\nHowever, with zinc ionophores, we may have a more general treatment option that will work on subsequent mutations and strains. This may help us stomp the virus out and prevent a paradigm shifting reality where we have \"seasonal flus\" of various strains of covid19 that kills 15x-20x more people than our current seasonal flus.\n\nOnce news of this starts circulating through America, and more data comes out of countries like France, I believe that the market will reach its bottom.\n\nI should note that there are a lot of \"lagging indicators\" like unemployment that will continue to worsen for months after the market finishes nose diving. Just because the market bounces back doesn't mean a lot of layoffs, bankruptcies, and foreclosures won't continue to happen.\n\nFor this third post, I had originally wanted to create a thorough discussion on the 35 or so crucial leading indicators I believe will predict and even pin point he exact turning point in our financial markets. There are some fascinating data points from other countries/regions/industries that leads our financial market remarkably consistently. But I have repeatedly warned against using models based on previous crises to predict what will happen with this virus because of its unique and unprecedented effect on our markets. We can't use past models of previous diseases to model this because those previous diseases have vastly different characteristics (rates regarding spread, hospitalization, death, effect on economic actors). So I'll put those leading indicators off for now and stick with my original thesis. We almost certainly have the treatment now, the next step is a vaccine before the next flu season.

My first thread covering this topic was made on /r/investing literally moments before the press briefing. I had expect a lag between knowledge of these treatments and the dissemination of news of these treatments. But with the press briefing, everything has been sped up.\n\nI traditionally trust a few very reliable indicators to judge a \"hard\" bottom in a recession for the markets. But some of these indicators need up to 2 quarters of info to confirm. There is also the unpredictable nature of what government actors will do regarding lockdowns. However, I think we're about to get clarity from the biggest economic players very soon.\n\nSo to answer your question: it depends on completely unknown government actions. I really don't want to talk about this until I see a few crucial data points coming in. **But I know that's boring so I'll take a completely speculative guess and say that we'll see a bottom before June 20th.** At least a soft bottom where all of the huge nose dive losses will be over. I think that news of lockdowns and earnings reports will be the big drivers of losses. I expect those things to be priced in by 2nd quarters earnings.

I personally won't be shorting the general market past -35%. My shorting past that point will be industry/sector dependent. For example, the airline industry still has a LONG way down. \n\nThe only issue is the bailouts that are coming. The bailouts should be structured in a way that wipes out shareholders or at least heavily favor the government but with the Trump administration even something like this is a wild card. Trump is dead set on saving the stock market above all else it seems, so I am not ruling out that he may literally bailout EVERYONE, even the shareholders. Blank check no-interest loans are not off the table...\n\nAs for entering the market, I will also play it safe and wait for my key indicators to hit the sweet spot. In any other recession, I have pretty strong confidence I can enter the market a couple of weeks before or after the bottom, but this market downturn has developed so quickly that it is outpacing the indicators I depend on.

If you buy option call 1 month ago. It is around 450x by now. Maybe another 450x in next 2 months. You are not missing out. \n5. Can spy drop to 100? The answer is yes. No one know what will be happening right now. No one ever see something like this before. Close your eye and buy what you can with vxx. Let ride this to the moon together.\n\nLastly. I invested 1k into vxx option buy and sell and buy and sell. I'm currently 88k right now.

Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking    down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/crpJNFE](https://imgur.com/a/crpJNFE)\n\nAlso   all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest  in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either  buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the     aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of  these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nI like the HD put 110 orders for 01-2021. Seems aggressive and against this move today. Uber too should be watched. 11 puts are way way OTM by next friday, it doubt it will happen. But if it does wow.\n\nDon't   just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.   Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined   instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry   about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of   putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND  IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso  with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT   - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when  I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and unusual like SBUX   order flow.\n\nEDIT  - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.

{"title": "Cruise stock DD - TL;DR Cruises massively oversold and can weather pandemics for a year", "selftext": "I was reading a fascinating blog post bringing a rare glimpse into the insights of the cruise charter business:  \n   \nhttps://www.myvacaya.com/the-charter-cruise-resort-business-a-primer/\n\nVacaya is a new all-gay full-ship cruise and land resort charter business. Their only competitors is [Atlantis Events.](https://atlantisevents.com/) \n\nApparently cruise-ship charter terms are very hard-line and non negotiable. Pandemic is actually one of the clauses in the contract that is specifically called out - no refunds for a pandemic to the charter companies:\n\n> The Charter Contract\n>Charters are not part of a cruise line\u2019s standard week-to-week business of selling cruises to the general public. It\u2019s a carve out, run by its own department with its own executives, budgets, sales force, sales goals, operations team, etc. And this one aspect of our relationship with the cruise lines is the one that\u2019s causing most of the confusion as it relates to all that\u2019s going on with Covid-19. Because cruise lines have carved out charters as a separate business, we don\u2019t get the same benefits the general public would get in regard to the rebooking terms and conditions the cruise lines are offering to their standard (read non-charter) passengers. We are being held to a different set of terms. And frankly, they\u2019re not very forgiving.\n\n>In fact, \u201cpandemic\u201d is a specific call out where most of the cruise lines ultimately bear no responsibility whatsoever \u2013 creating a sort of \u201clike it or lump it\u201d scenario. So we\u2019re having to have very complicated conversations \u2013 ones where relationships are worth their weight in gold \u2013 with multi-billion dollar corporations whose charter business is a locked revenue stream for them, not subject to the ups and downs of standard sales (since the contracts are guaranteed so far in advance). These cruise line\u2019s guaranteed charter revenue is sometimes used to balance losses the company might face elsewhere (for instance, during these Covid-19 days where they\u2019re having to give so much back to their non-charter guests). So the cruise lines hold to those contractual guarantees with a tight grip, holding nearly all the cards over the charter companies.\n\n>It\u2019s a really tricky position for us to be in \u2013 caught in a strange in-between. These large corporations can afford to have a bad year. Sure, their shareholders might not like it, but they\u2019re built to withstand even major business disruptions. But make no mistake about it, the cruise lines will lose countless millions here. But\u2026 and it\u2019s a big but\u2026 they are all likely to weather this particular storm. Charter companies like VACAYA are in a much different spot \u2013 unable to amortize losses across fleets of ships sailing week in and week out like the cruise lines can. We are an event company \u2013 with set events throughout the year. So we have to approach these challenge in a different way. And our challenges are myriad.\n\nIn general, chartering has become massively popular. There's all kinds of cruise ship charters - nude cruises, star trek, huge EDM parties, etc. Cruise ships have tons of guaranteed revenue from the charters. Unlike other businesses they had the foresight to prepare for pandemics.\n\n\n# TL;DR what call-strike-etc\nCruise lines are over sold. Buy cruises - they can weather this pandemic and were smart enough to put it in their contracts of their guaranteed revenue. \n\nRCL LEAPS 21 JAN 22, maybe at the money?\n\nRCL220121C20  - trades for 13.00-16.90/share, RCL is $22.30 at the time of this post.

{"title": "4/20/2021 Update of the Coronavirus", "selftext": "Update on the Coronavirus 4/20/2021\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 months since the Coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China. To date, 4 billion people have tested positive and over 293 million people have died. Here is the US, it wiped out almost 1/3 of the population. The global economy finally collapsed just before thanksgiving 2020. Beyond the virus related deaths we had millions more perish after all the riots broke out. We rode out the great coronavirus war in our missile silo community in Nebraska. FDA finally approved GILD\u2019s Remdesivir treatment in November 2020 but it was already too late. The treatment had been proven effective since the beginning and if approved in April 2020, it would have prevented the global collapse. By November 2020, hospitals throughout the world were completely saturated and overwhelmed. Not to mentioned all the doctors and staff who also contracted the virus and eventually perished. U.S. markets are still operational with no one physically in the NYSE but most companies have gone bankrupt. The WSB community thrived during this period as they continued to short every single company until one by one they went bankrupt. Most bulls  died from the virus along with all the boomers. A huge influx of babies were born in December 2020, coined the Corona generation. You can still trade options nowadays but are limited to the few remaining ETFs, SPY currently at $69 and VXX at $420 and companies like GILD at $1420, TSLA at $1880 and SPCE at $420. We are rebuilding and things will get better. Thanks to the Gilead\u2019s antiviral treatment and vaccine we will eventually eradicate the coronavirus. \n\nGodspeed WSB community! \n\n-A True Autist\n\nEDIT: On a serious note, stay safe out there WSB gang! Thanks for all the tendies you all have help me make, I\u2019m sure I speak for many fellow autists. Let\u2019s stay safe so we can continue making crazy money collectively!

{"title": "Short Skin", "selftext": "There is a hit to the skin care industry that is not priced in. \n\nObviously all beauty retailers have taken a massive hit due to the income elasticity of their products, but that\u2019s not where it ends. The underlying demand for skincare products is going to plummet due to two reasons during this multi-month quarantine period.\n\n\n1, Women aren\u2019t going outside anymore, so there\u2019s no need for them to put on makeup. How much uglier are your wives right now than they usually are? Are they starting to look like Frida Kahlo? I thought so. \n\n\n2. Acne is going to decrease, a LOT. This is not even close to scientific but people are now washing their hands & showering much more than they ever have. In addition to this, they\u2019re not going outside so they aren\u2019t being exposed to pollution, and even if they are pollution is decreasing from less traffic & factory activity.\n\nMuch of this has not been felt by skincare companies yet because people usually have a month\u2019s supply of skincare/acne product at home. However, this will crush their revenue over time & the next earnings reports for companies like ULTA, KAOOY & KSRYY will be abysmal. \n\n\n**TL;DR:** MSFT 200c 3/20", "id": "flio45", "created_utc": 1584654868.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Puts on my forskin", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Cashed those out years ago.", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15289431810379028}, {"body": "I sold my puts too early.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23512673377990723}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05651872605085373}, {"body": "> This is not even close to scientific \n\nI'm all in.", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1450229436159134}, {"body": "My wife just bought a years worth of eye cream so she can look awake for her boyfriend.
