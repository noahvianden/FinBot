We don't know if additional funds will be provided to Boeing's supply chain, which require about 75% of the funding, or if that $17 billion is meant to just cover production for around three months of a collapsed jetliner market,\u201d    \n    \n    \nBoeing 115P  5/15", "id": "fpkfre", "created_utc": 1585259327.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m going back to angery birds", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07652435451745987}, {"body": "Yea imagine thinking debt or unemployment matters when you are a chosen business with infinite fed money.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03102080151438713}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.00464567169547081}, {"body": "Boeing will never go down while they still have military contracts.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "115 is a very generous number if we bottom out again.
