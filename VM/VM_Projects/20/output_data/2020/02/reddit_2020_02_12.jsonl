Leaves me with a gain of $1.65, but holding options that are $3.96 ITM. Meaning a loss of $2.31 per contract if AMD closed where it is now on 3/6.

What I do know is that either it was a lack of pilot training, poor system design, or a combination of both. I admit and do think Boeing makes great planes, arguably the best. But could they have made a better software? Of course, but in the software industry iteration is a balance between costs and functionality. So I dont blame them only for making an incomplete system. Practically any system today is incomplete to a certain degree. However, what I do blame them for is the lack of training. They knew the system had this particular behavior from test pilots yet for some reason did not modify it (which is the first mistake). The second mistake is not informing pilots of this particular behavior. It might have cost them too much money to modify the system, but at the very least document and train pilots to be aware of how the MCAS works in these particular scenarios. Whether or not pilots should know how to trim the airplane day one of flight school is besides the point. When you introduce a new system that performs and behaves differently, you tell the operator.
