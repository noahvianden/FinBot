It seems like a pretty shitty platform (although I can't compare since I'm new to this), but they were in the top three among European platforms on the comparison sites I looked through, and there didn't seem to be a lot to choose from anyway.  \n\n\nI've had a few support calls with them because I found it weird that my \"initial margin\" and available cash keep moving when I write a call option that's covered by a long position in the underlying (AMD in this case). Their response (after I eventually got through to someone who cared to say more than \"computer says no\") was as follows:  \n\n\n>Dear Client, Please note that in case of writing option that system is calculating 2 margins. One margin is the additional margin ( The additional margin serves to cover overnight price changes in the underlying value when the option position cannot be closed because of limited trading hours). In your case this is covered by the instrument you own already. Second margin is the premium margin ( The premium margin ensures that the short option position can be closed at current market prices and equals the current Ask Price at which the option can be acquired during trading hours). Basically what this means is that you always need to have enough funds on the account equal to the option value in case you want to buy back the option. What you see on the platform is the difference between the option value and your available cash, informing you whether you have enough cash to close the position without incurring negative cash balance. Obviously if you do not want to close the position than this information is not relevant for you. This is how our platform is made.
