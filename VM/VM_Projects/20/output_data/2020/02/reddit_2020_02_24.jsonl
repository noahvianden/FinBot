To understand Tesla you effectively have to replicate Elon's first principles analysis - and that is very, very hard.\n- As you mention it in the video, Tesla is growing very fast. Its valuation model is necessarily a function that is exponential nature - and even small differences in the exponents escalate quickly over the 3-5-10 year time horizons of investors. Whether it's 35% or 45% annual growth makes a 43% valuation difference over a 5 year period (!).\n- So beyond the TSLAQ criminals trying to manipulate the stock price for their financial advantage, you can literally also end up with significant number of investors who rationally believe that Tesla's current fair value is $250, $500, $1,000, $2,000 and $7,500.\n\nThe result: significant contraction of the float and volatility. \ud83e\udd20", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "this matters. \n\nyou're awesome.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": ":)", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.236458882689476}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10031980276107788}, {"body": "Looking forward to watching it.

But how about I have a plan and adjust it as new information comes in?\n\nI bought 52 shares at an average of somewhere below 300 because I noticed that the analysts talk out of their back side, nothing they said made sense. I only invest in things I think I understand and since I was following Tesla for years, I started investing. Its the only stock I own because its the only company that I follow close enough to know whats going on. I didnt invest in any more stocks since then because I switched to doing options beginning this year. And I am up there big time as well. Im not doing day trading as I think this is stupid but if you follow tesla, you can kind of predict the earnings direction. The complete sell off of inventory in Q1 was a large give away.\n\nSimilar thing will happen around battery day. Tesla is expanding its production like crazy, yet it doesnt expand its outsourcing of battery production like crazy. There is only one explanation to this discrepency. They must have a plan to produce batteries at scale internally big time. And that plan must already be in motion, otherwise they would not be able to produce model Y at scale this year. Not to speak of the plait power train. I bet on a strong stock move on battery day because of this. I will adjust my view as new data comes in of course. So far, I see no contradiction.\n\nAn other topic that you didnt cover but you should have: Teslas imminent inclusion in S&P500. I bet that much of the recent run up is as much a value correction as it is that big institutions want to get on the ride for S&P500.
