{"title": "Can I trade options after hours? TL;DR - No. The longer answer is in the post.", "selftext": "This question is regularly asked and I didn't see it in the r/options FAQ, so here's the TL version.\n\nIt seems to come up the most during earnings season as traders are looking to close options after hours based on a big move.  Let's remind folks (in one place) when you Can trade options and then some ideas for handling those after hours moves.\n\n#### Regular market hours\n\nFor US equity options, the regular market hours are from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM ET.  We'll stick to Eastern Time zone throughout the article to avoid any confusion. \n\n#### Minor Exception\n\nThere are multiple symbols, mostly ETFs, that actually trade until 4:15 PM.  As of the writing of this article, here's a list:\n\nDBA, DBB, DBC, DBO, DIA, EEM, EFA, GAZ, IWM, IWN, IWO, IWV, JJC, KBE, KRE, MDY, MNX, MOO, NDX, OEF, OIL, QQQ, SLX, SPY, SVXY, UNG, UUP, UVXY, VIIX, VIXY, VXX, VXZ, XHB, XLB, XLE, XLF, XLI, XLK, XLP, XLU, XLV, XLY, XME, XRT\n\nA nice resource for these names is at [NasdaqTrader.com](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=optionshours)\n\nIf I missed one, educate me in the comments and I'll update the post.\n\n#### Proprietary products (CBOE)\n\nCBOE offers options on their proprietary products.  SPX and VIX also stop trading at 4:15 PM.   CBOE also started offering what they call \"global trading hours\" on both of these products - you can trade them from 3:00 AM to 9:15 AM.  \n\n#### Futures\n\nOptions on futures can be traded almost around the clock starting at 6:00 PM Sunday and going through 4:15 PM on Friday. There is a gap between 4:15 PM and 4:30 PM and then 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM Monday through Thursday.\n\n#### So, Can I trade Options After Hours? \n\nStill no (outside of the exceptions listed above).  That means if you bought that call in Tesla (Ticker: TSLA) and it rockets after hours because Elon Musk finally invented the perpetual motion machine, you can't sell your call to lock in profits.  Then when it turns out he was just having another $420-inspired tweet storm, and the stock returns to reality at the market open, please don't contact me asking why you couldn't sell your call.  Just re-read this article! \n\n  \n\n[Elon Musk's $20M tweet](https://preview.redd.it/e8lgrapcjpw51.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd0816cdd3a66f1fd98c26fcc7442c55301a00c)\n\n#### That's annoying, what can I do?\n\nGlad you asked - it lets me really stretch out this article.\n\nIf you need quick market exposure after hours (for say - an unexpected election result) - I would suggest the futures.  You can buy/sell them outright or use the options.  \n\nBack to the TSLA example, your only choice is to buy or sell the underlying.  You can trade the underlying during Pre-Market (4:00 - 9:30 AM) or After-hours (4:00 - 8:00 PM).  The liquidity will not be as good, but it works in a pinch.  \n\nThe idea is that if you have a call and the stock takes off, you sell shares to lock in some of the gains.  If you have a put and the stock drops significantly you would buy shares.  If there is continued volatility, you can continue to buy/sell shares accordingly.  \n\n#### TL;DR\n\nCan you trade options after hours? No (except for futures, SPX, and VIX). You can hedge your portfolio with those products. You can gamma scalp with stock when you guessed right and bought calls/puts in \\[insert popular stock here\\].", "id": "jmbvsl", "created_utc": 1604271049.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Nice write up.

Plus, more and more competitors are entering the market to compete for Netflix's subscribers while also pulling their content from Netflix which forces Netflix to spend more money to develop their own content.

{"title": "Bloomberg: The U.S. stock market could be headed for a lost decade", "selftext": "\"When the history of the modern financial era is written, there\u2019s one comment that\u2019s almost certain to merit inclusion: \u201cStocks only go up!\u201d\n\nSports-blogger turned day-trader Dave Portnoy\u2019s pithy observation this summer was designed to both amuse and provoke. But if you\u2019ve put money into U.S. stocks since the market bottomed out in 2009, the chances are you think Portnoy is basically correct.\u00a0Plenty of professional asset managers would concur.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the most important question for those considering investing savings today, when stocks are by some metrics among the most expensive they\u2019ve ever been, is whether Portnoy\u2019s philosophy is about to be turned on its head. In other words: \u201cwhat if stocks don\u2019t always go up?\u201d\n\nThere are reasons to think this fantastic period for the U.S. stock market might soon be followed by a prolonged hangover, possibly lasting a decade or more. Such a stretch of disappointing equity returns would have profound implications for millennials and generation Z.\u00a0The standard advice around financial planning and retirement saving that\u2019s worked so well lately \u2014\u00a0put your money in an index fund that tracks the market and forget about it \u2014\u00a0might no longer work so well.\n\nIn the past decade, investors who bought an index fund that mirrors\u00a0the S&P 500 Index and reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 13%\u00a0average annual return, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nEven a deadly global pandemic that\u2019s triggered a deep\u00a0recession and widespread unemployment only briefly interrupted the ascendancy of U.S. stocks. The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again). Young investors\u00a0may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case. Consider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain\u2019s preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It\u2019s not alone.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy\u2019s assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.\n\n\"Stocks Only Go Up\"?\n\nFollowing a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns\n\nCould the U.S. market face a similar fate? There\u2019ve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929\u00a0Wall Street crash.\n\nLong Hangover\n\nU.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash\n\nAs recently as 2012 the S&P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO\u2019s Jeremy Grantham think\u00a0something similar could happen again, but it\u2019s not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund\u00a0billionaire Ray Dalio\u00a0of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone\u2019s vice chairman Tony James\u00a0have both warned about a\u00a0\u201clost decade\u201d\u00a0for equity investors.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019d followed GMO\u2019s advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you\u2019d have missed out on seven years of stellar returns.\u00a0So what\u2019s different now? 1. Extreme valuations Equity\u00a0valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s largess.\u00a0A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,\u201d investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager\u00a0wrote recently. He\u2019s described today\u2019s menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as\u00a0\u201cthe worst in history.\u201d\n\nExpensive Stocks\n\nU.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap\n\nThe CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise\n\n 1. Ultra-low interest rates Low interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because\u00a0they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today\u2019s money and reduce the cost of servicing\u00a0debt. But with U.S. short-term\u00a0rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. \u201cWhen real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,\u201d Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse\u2019s\u00a02020\u00a0compendium of past market returns. \u201cInvestors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.\u201d\n\n 2. Profit margin reversion A key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize\u00a0earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are\u00a0starting to face more competition\u00a0and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also\u00a0in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.\n\n 3. An aging population This is often considered a key reason for Japan\u2019s prolonged stock market slump.\u00a0Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.\n\nWhile this all sounds bleak, it\u2019s some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation.\u00a0In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do\u00a0to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks. For starters, if returns are lower I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.) Hopefully, the gloomy scenario I\u2019ve painted won\u2019t materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll be prepared.\"\n\n\nSource: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-31/personal-finance-what-if-stocks-don-t-always-go-up-advice-for-young-investors\n\n\u00a0", "id": "jm5j6m", "created_utc": 1604249711.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Japan\u2019s lost decades was a combination of fiscal mismanagement, overbearing debt load, and complete lack of technology growth, leading to stagnation.  \n\nAs a result, Japanese investors and savers pulled their money from the Nikkei and put it into US equities.
