It's the context of its underperformance.\n\nThe massive movement in EV's didn't occur in a vacuum. The entire energy space has been moving for months, beginning with new energy and TSLA as a proxy for all EVs, and then it really took off in November, with TSLA going dead and rally leadership switching to the more competitive EV companies in the field. \n\nAfter the election, old energy jumped in and we just had the best week ever in oil & gas stocks last week, with a massive rally as XPEV, NIO, and the other EV stocks hitting their peaks. \n\nThis is all taking place as a large cyclical move back into energy -- old energy, new energy, and new energy technology like EVs -- as people anticipate the end of lockdowns at the end of this Winter. TSLA was actually sagging this whole time the remarkable inflows to other EVs and energy was taking place. So even though its deflation in the past 4 weeks was incremental, it was still remarkable given the context. It only moved starting around the time of the S&P 500 announcement.\n\nThis is TSLA's final moment, because it was elevated purely by circumstance when it was already way above any conceivable potential. The S&P 500 institutional buying will lift it into stupid territory and when the next few quarterly earnings reports show it losing market share to better EV cars, or cutting prices more and selling at bigger losses, there's going to be a blowout crash in its stock.\n\nTSLA can't suddenly transform itself into a company that doesn't make junky, iconic cars that only people who can afford a car that randomly falls apart will buy. And with big moves to new energy & EVs, it's going to be harder and harder for TSLA to make so much of its revenue selling carbon credits. The company is so worthless, it's like a hoax that will be a textbook example of social media hyped meme stocks 10 years from now.\n\nEdit: [11/26/2020: Tesla (TSLA) Recalls More Than 9,500 SUVs on Safety Concerns](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tsla-recalls-more-9-130501808.html).
