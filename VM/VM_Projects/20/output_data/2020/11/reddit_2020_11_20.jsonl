Their increase in revenue has been attributed to a significant increase in their EV sales, especially their premium Han EV with their blade battery which allows a range of 376 miles along with an intelligent driving system.

It is also an art, its like trying to value art as well only the people who know how to value art can value it. I get it, but it does work, but if you aren't willing to put in the work you'll never get the skill.\n\nThere are many really rich people from TA, Dan Zanger is one, he got me started another is William Oneil of Investors Business Daily, [Investors.com](https://Investors.com) is their website. There are a ton of people who use TA, which is why its a thing and you even have heard of it. I use TA every single day.\n\nLet me tell you WHAT TA actually is, most people don't get this perspective because I don't think that most people talk about it or even think/know about it.\n\nTA is the analysis of what has ACTUALLY HAPPENED. It takes a ton of money to move things in the markets and when you analyze the actual trades you get to see a picture and that is the analysis. The chart patterns, if you are not familiar chart patterns are similar structures in the chart that rhyme over and over again with similar results. When you many of the same signs over and over again you start to see the big picture. Its kind of like when you started to learn about sex, you were like \"WHAT!\" Then you got some experience and now if you were to tell the kid about sex they would be like \"WHAT!\" and you would say \"you'll see\". It kind of works like that with non-believers. It seems too good to be true. But its important to know if the stock you are looking at is being bought or not. One thing that TA does is it eliminates 95% of charts for me so I can focus on the ones that have the accumulation patterns and signatures I look for. I have about 100ish stocks on my watchlist and look for more all the time, all I do is look at the chart to see if the rest of the market is interested in it or not. If the market is not interested I am not either, if they are I'll keep an eye on it. This is how you get to participate in these runs! You hyper focus on the best stocks moving right now and if you stay around long enough you can maybe get some before they turn up. \n\nNow, with that being said its not like you can know a few chart patterns and go make money, its one thing to know TA and another thing to make money in the markets. There are many different ways to LOSE money in the markets. You have to know many things to be profitable. Just like if you wanted to start a business, there are many ways you go about getting clients but after a while you find out what works for you.\n\nIn trading you need to know your position sizing, how much you are going to put into any single trade, when you are going to cut your losses. One of the most important things is WHEN to invest and when NOT to invest. One of my largest difference makers in my trading what learning to not do anything when the market is not in my favor. When things are looking up though you have to jump in! The market will move quickly without you leaving you with no position. You also cannot get in too deep into the run, you have to be quick to get in.\n\nSo its not that TA is everything, in reality its about 20% of the equation, but its an important part of the equation. So sure you see my video there and think I'm nuts. You can call me what you want but at the end of the day but being market savvy, I'm up 100% on this position already with a target of over 500% up, I use options so its larger than the actual Tesla run.\n\nEven if I'm wrong and this gets to only 750, I have still set myself up to be profitable at over 569 and I have to July to let this work. So even if the TA is wrong I'm still ok. Thats super important because things fail all the time! If Tesla does fail, I'm out! Thats the game, its not being Nostradamus, its about being pragmatic and methodical, its about being cautious and bold and you guys are LUCKY to get guys like me to show you this shit lol. \n\nNOW, there are a bunch of shitty people out there doing TA, I get that but there are diamonds out there but over time if you study you'll learn the difference and more importantly what YOU like. I know guys that follow me that didn't take this trade and are now bitching, its just not for them. That is ok, they'll grab another one that I don't like and thats how it goes there are stocks for all kinds of people regardless of your style. I am 50/50 last time I checked on my trades but I'm up over, damn I just checked, 744% this year on my account. Woo hoo! Go Tesla! \n\nThe reason I share is because I'm fucking excited! This stock is model book perfect like I said in the video. And I do want YOU to participate! I didn't as you guys to pay me anything so take the information and try to use it in some way, maybe for next time but don't just throw it out because you don't understand it, TRY to understand because if/when this thing gets to 900-1000 you'll remember this post.

These facilities were set up to cover virtually ALL aspects of the credit markets from corporate debt to credit cards. Pretty much any debt that can be securitized, these facilities were set up so that the FED (through their SPVs) can purchase these CDOs or ETFs and provide liquidity to the credit markets and raise investor confidence. Now, the only way the FED can continue to purchase these debt assets is if the Treasury continues to support the FED by providing funds to cover any potential losses the facilities may incur ([https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/09/federal-reserve-lending-facilities-what-are-they-how-are-they-funded-and-how-will-they-support-the-economy-during-the-coronavirus)). The amount of money the Treasury can provide is stated in the CARES act and is $455billion dollars, the same amount as stated in the title.\n\nRight now, Mnuchin is pulling that amount from the FED and is therefore refusing to extend the lending facilities past year end, which means the market now knows that the backstop they enjoyed from the FED since March is running out and the confidence they had that the FED will support virtually all corners of the credit market is now shattered. Even if Mnuchin only wants to pull the plug on 5 of the nine facilities, it wouldn't matter because investor confidence is now gone. \n\nExpect yields in credit markets to rise and VIX to spike. We might even have a minor replay of March.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Trump is stabbing us in the back by sending Mnuchin to kneecap the FED's ability to print.
