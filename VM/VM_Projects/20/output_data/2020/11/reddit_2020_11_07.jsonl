That means that 150K trucks less sold eats all their profits away and they sell about 250K trucks per quarter on average. That means that losing 60% of their share of the truck market, turns GM into a company that doesn't make profit anymore if everything else stays the same.\n\nHowever, I really simplified some things. For instance operating leverage. The same way Tesla now is really profitable (and grows that profitability very fast) because they sell more cars, the reversed will happen to GM when they sell less. The fixed cost will become a bigger part of the cost per truck, so the 17K profit per truck won't hold.\n\nAdd the transition cost to electrification, the covid situation and the possibility that automotive hit its peak last year due to a changing use of cars (self driving/car sharing) and I can't see how GM isn't in big trouble.
