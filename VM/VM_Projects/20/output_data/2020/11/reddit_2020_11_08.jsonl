But have a hunch it's going to be bullish.\n\nA good example is TLRY, the stock has been beaten down but trying to break out. New interest in weed, Biden legalization, etc. \n\nOk so possible scenarios:\n-Buy a call: if the stock price moves up great. If it moves against you, 100% of your premium is at risk.  It can expire completely worthless. This means you get 0 nada. Nothing of value. \n\n-Buy a call and sell a put: If you buy the Jan 21 $10C and sell the same Jan 21 $10P you can enter this trade for a net credit of $1.70. (Your broker will likely lock up cash to secure this put short). If the stock price moves up your short put expires worthless, so you pocket that credit, the calls gain premium value, and the broker releases the cash secured for your put. Of course you can close out your put short any time (as the price approaches 0). \n\nIf the stock price moves against you, your call isn't worth anything and now you get assigned on your short put. The cash your broker kept is used to buy shares. But your cost bases is now $1.7 lower per share than if you bought the shares directly. Congrats you are now a bag holder. But at a lower cost basis.\n\nIn my mind, if you are wrong on a stock movement short term, eventually you'll be right at some point in the future. So you can add these shares to your portfolio at a lower price than buying them directly. Even if you sell the shares for a small loss it's preferable to loosing absolutely 100% of your premium risked buying just a call. At least if you hold shares you have a possibility of breaking even again. \n\nI'm not an expert and this is entertainment.
