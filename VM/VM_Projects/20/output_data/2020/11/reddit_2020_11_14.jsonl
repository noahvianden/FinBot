{"title": "Lordstown Motors and the Endurance EV Truck", "selftext": "Let me tell you about Lordstown Motors, and why the awful name belies a company that has some strong fundamentals.\n\nLordstown is an electric vehicle manufacturer based in Lordstown, Ohio. They are producing the Lordstown Endurance, a pickup truck that is aiming to be on the market in September 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Good**\n\n1. Lordstown is targetting fleet sales, not consumer sales. This mitigates one of the largest concerns with EV trucks - range - as fleet usage is typically less mileage-demanding than consumer usage.\n2. Lordstown has taken over the former GM assembly plant in the same town. Getting assembly up and running is a huge endevour, and purchasing a decommisioned one is sure to shave time off.\n3. Lordstown already has 40,000 pre-orders from a variety of fleet purchases.\n4. Financing won't be a problem as they just finished a merger with a SPAC, gaining $675 million in the process, so they're sitting on an ample warchest to weather time to market.\n5. Their CEO is the former CEO of Workhorse.\n6. Their connection with GM will also play out with the $2.3 billion battery factory that that GM is building in Lordstown in conjuction with LG Chem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Gamble**\n\n1. The Endurance is using a skateboard design. While relatively novel, the design is being pursued by Rivian and Ford. Notably, however, Tesla's Model S is moving away from this skateboard chassis which Musk says is a natural evolution of EV design.\n2. The Endurance is using hub motors - this means a motor attached to each wheel. In theory this should mean less moving parts, less weight, and more room on the chassis - something important for a truck aimed at fleet use. The biggest concerns with hub motors is an increase in unsprung weight. This could mean poorer handling if it's not mitigated. It also may be less of a concern for a fleet vehicle.\n3. The Endurance is aiming to hit market in September of 2021, this would make it the first fully-electric production EV to market, and critically a year ahead of Ford's F-150 EV. If they fall behind their delivery goal they cede territory to Ford in a market where first mover advantage could be critical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Bad**\n\n1. Lordstown got hit with a lawsuit over unpaid work on the septic systems in their GM plant. This didn't concern me very much as it pre-dates the SPAC aquisition and cash infusion and they have been in complete agreement that the money is owed and are paying it back.\n2. Lordstown also got hit with an espionage lawuit on Friday from Karma Automotive. That name might sound familiar from the Fisker Karma. Indeed, Karma is the successor to Fisker Automotive which was scooped up by a Chinese EV company during bankruptcy. Not sure what to make of this one yet. The judge in the case denied Karma's request for a restraining order and instead ordered both parties into discovery. The whole thing revolves around the entertainment system on the vehicle. Even if Karma wins I don't see it sinking the company.", "id": "jtthah", "created_utc": 1605318830.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "We're trying to get away from the low quality, low effort, memes that have taken over recently. \n\nSo all DD threads are getting automatically stickied going forward, but punishment for DD flair abuse will be harsh.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for how to improve please shoot us a modmail, or slide into my DMs.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10306366533041}, {"body": "Define \"became\"", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Define \"sub\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": " *noun*\n\n1. 1.a submarine. \"the yachtsman claimed his boat had been sunk by a sub\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Define \"allegory\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Define \"allegory\"\n\n *noun*\n\n1. a story, poem, or picture with reference to former Vice President Al Gore.\"South Park's Imaginationland episode is an allegory.\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Define \"facetious\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "*adjective*\n\n1. of or relating to the face. \"The positioning of her derriere atop his forehead was facetious.\"", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "can't tell if joking... 10/10.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.\n*****\n> That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.\n*****\n> In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.\n*****\n> The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.\n*****\n> # Next hurdle for market\n> \u201cWe largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cGrowth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That\u2019s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it\u2019s a long-term pivot point.\u201d\n*****\n> The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n> Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.\n*****\n> Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.\n*****\n> The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.\n*****\n> # Value vs growth\n> Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.\n*****\n> Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&P 500.\n*****\n> In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%.

Through early morning Friday, the S&P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**\n\n> So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.\n\n> In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Rest-of-Month.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # November Expiration Week: S&P 500 & DJIA Stronger\n\n> DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it\u2019s different.\n\n> S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday\u2019s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/13265e8eff0782bd041e1e0a067dc3fe/7883f89830a49be6-29/s500x750/2885f1dc67e4228626741cb7343d992817ec5583.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d6a7fb10dbb1b8380672d5944d48644f/7883f89830a49be6-b5/s500x750/39e1a2f390dbf489cf5bb9ea3384c0d5807cfc51.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9201ade7e11162142381783f8156173b/7883f89830a49be6-c5/s500x750/b4b5afb73ee7a109663d4019f6cbfa31a7c5aa1e.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/61cf940fbf5dad46c8daa54942793f48/7883f89830a49be6-32/s500x750/7cedc50f07edc9418f507d890a648ad42db916ef.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But\u2026\n\n> DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.\n\n> S&P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, \u20130.27% median loss.\n\n> This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b30ef3831a0d9fba86495cdc148b2c22/83c3c7d6350c9827-a4/s540x810/ae0bba2b8a4208ad3cd1434bfd8aab7932046617.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # New High in New 52 Week Highs\n\n> As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**\n\n> Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Distance-from-52-week.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Big Milestone For Small Stocks\n\n> No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**\n\n> In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-Russell-2000-Six-Days.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention\n\n> Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress\u2014a scenario that historically has produced solid S&P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven\u2019t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president\u2019s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there\u2019s new leadership. Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. \u201cThe S&P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn\u2019t happened since late 1982,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlthough there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.\u201d The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don\u2019t anticipate this time being any different.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers\n\n> With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&P 500 that are up over 20% following today\u2019s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.\n\n> In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**\n\n> Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year\u2019s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Worst-Stocks-1109-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election\n\n> For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**\n\n> The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Problem-govt-labor.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar\n\n> Pfizer\u2019s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the \u201cgo-to\u201d positions throughout most of the pandemic.\n\n> The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today\u2019s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.\n\n> Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/86b0c38fda06a991b0dff788e125ad8d/b50bde8b92d0b3a1-5b/s500x750/7dbabf47c90b7da6961e2d23f94a9abb1e8d4287.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ntRgt4A.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BPYsDg8.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0M8ILC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  11.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NoHPXKo.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EqCY7lq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lw83hhF.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FFUyg9w.png))\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/R78y9vB.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bKdqcYL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fff0sUp.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.20.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NIO Inc. $44.56\n**NIO Inc.
