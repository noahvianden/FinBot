Their main holdings are going to be companies like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc. But they'll also hold a lot of stocks like VISA, Johnson & Johnson and Proctor & Gamble.\n\nWhere to put your money depends on a lot of factors like your age, your risk tolerance, how long you intend to keep the money in the market and whether you'll add to it each month, and how much you want to research the market and manage your portfolio (an hour or more a day), vs just put it in and only look at it occasionally (maybe a few times a month).\n\nIf you have a higher risk tolerance, you could develop a nice portfolio focused on a mixture of solid, established tech stocks along with some newer, riskier tech stocks.

ETFs, in my opinion, give you more diversification (as long as you don't pick overlapping ETFs), more safety and similar opportunities for growth as individual stocks.  The ARK group of ETFs are considered risky and have higher expenses, so I'd be inclined to recommend you pick only one of those. Also, I listed more ETFs than you need for diversification.

{"title": "Why bad economic data is unironically bullish", "selftext": "TL;DR: Good economic data means less stimulus, less stimulus means that markets propped up on cheap credit and other stimulus measures shit themselves. Conversely, bad data means air will continue to be pumped into the markets.\n\nFebruary 2018, 9 fucking years after the Fed started QE to counteract the financial crisis: [Dow Jones suffers worst day in over six years as global stock markets plunge](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/stock-markets-continue-to-fall-amid-interest-rate-hike-fears/).\n\nWhy? The economy was doing TOO well: \n\n> **The plunge, initially triggered by fears that strong US employment numbers would lead to wage demands and rising inflation**, represents the first two-day drop of 1,000 points or greater for the Dow since August 2015.\n\n> According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 \u2013 **so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are** \u2013 but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year.\n\n> Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at currency dealer FXTM, said investors were nervous about the prospect of higher interest rates. **\u201cThe era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u2019s undoubtedly bad news,\u201d he said.**\n\n> Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said: **\u201cMarkets have been addicted to low interest rates and global central banks pumping money into the financial system.** **As economies around the world are improving, this means higher interest rates and less stimulus from central banks. That\u2019s why investors are throwing a hissy-fit. Not because anything is wrong.\u201d**\n\nEven the UK got in on the action:\n\n> **The FTSE\u2019s fall was limited by worse than expected economic data** that sent the pound down to $1.40 from $1.42 overnight.\n\nThink about that. Weak economic data is why UK markets would have fallen more had the economic data been better.\n\nWhat's the mean for us today? We have at least a year of horrible economic data ahead of us. Ya boy JPOW has a few trillion more dollars he plans to lend and has promised that interest rates will be this low for years. \n\nSPY 330c 01/15.", "id": "hil4qj", "created_utc": 1593514546.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\"The era of cheap money is ending,\" yeah, right.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Someday it will. 2030 probably.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24658198654651642}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4145551323890686}, {"body": "You\u2019re nuts if you think we\u2019re going past 330 by 2021 but money printer does go brrrrrr\n\nAlso this is the hundredth post I\u2019m this week about some retards uneducated opinion on why stonks only go up how about some actual information instead of your simple minded conjecture", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "They forget to inverse themselves lol", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What is I told you I was actually mad bearish and I'm just looking for any reason I'm wrong?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07242070138454437}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010339997708797455}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05489769205451012}, {"body": "Bro I spent at least 20 minutes googling for a news article to confirm my biases.
