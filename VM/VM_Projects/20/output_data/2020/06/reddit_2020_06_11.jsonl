{"title": "First time buying stocks, did I make good first purchases?", "selftext": "Hey guys - my friend who's pretty savvy in the stock market finally got me to start investing today. He gave me a few options, told me to diversify, and gave me some good starting points. He also told me that the last few days and the next week or so will probably be pretty bad for the market, so now is a good time to buy stocks. Here's what I bought today and my reasoning behind these. Let me know if I'm off to a good start. I only spent about $1200, I have more in savings that I'm willing to spend but I'm being a little conservative as I'm just starting. My goals are more long term (5-20 years) as I don't have the time or energy to trade daily.\n\n\\-Nikola ($NKLA): Just opened, competitor to Tesla, electric truck manufacturer. One of the hotter new stocks at the moment. I think there's room for other electric vehicle stocks alongside Tesla. I plan on buying Tesla stock once I can transfer more money to my account.\n\n\\-Xpress Spa: Fresh off a 1/3 split, my friend told me it's a good time to invest since they're doing COVID-19 testing. Don't know too much about these guys, but stock was cheap.\n\n\\-Ideanomics ($IDEX): Friend recommended this to me since it was cheap. Also did some research and saw they're planning on facilitating purchases of commercial electric vehicles. They've already made deals for commercial buses in China. Was only $1.01 a share today.\n\n\\-Draft Kings ($DKNG): Not only a casual user of the app, but sports gambling is going to explode in the next 1-5 years.\n\n\\-Eldorado Resorts ($ERI): Purchased Caesar's Palace and will be the first casino partner of the NFL. That alone is a good sign of future success, along with the fact that there are more and more pro sports teams moving to Vegas.\n\n\\-Penn National Gaming ($PENN): Owns 36% of Barstool Sports which has become one of the leaders in the sports blogging industry. Also owns 40+ gambling/gaming locations throughout the country.\n\n\\-GAN Ltd ($GAN): Online Casino Gaming\n\n\\-Heico ($HEI): Specializes in aerospace avionics, components and spare parts. Also makes medical equipment like ventilators, X-Ray systems, sterilization, and personal protective equipment. This was me trying to diversify and I did some research and it seemed like a solid buy.\n\n\\-II-VI ($IIVI): Friend told me to look in to some optics companies as they will be strong in the future of manufacturing. I did some research and found II-VI, which makes opto-electronic components for a wide range of manufacturers.\n\n\\-Viavi ($VIAV): Network test, assurance, and measurement company that tests equipment for networks. Don't know TOO much about this, but have seen it on multiple articles as a solid stock with the upcoming 5G revolution and ever expanding network across the world.\n\n\\-Tesla, for obvious reasons\n\n\\-Qualcomm ($QCOM): Finally made peace with Apple and will be supplying chips for the iPhone for next 6 years. With 5G inevitably booming in the next few years, I saw this as a must buy.\n\n\\-Ericsson ($ERIC): As a communications-equipment company who will be rolling out 5G technology worldwide, I saw this as a great buy. They also sell software and radio hardware and has a deal with Oppo, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. Expects 2.6 billion 5G subscriptions by 2025 and is only selling at $8.76/share.\n\n\\-Verizon ($VZ): Just another attempt to get in on the 5G revolution.\n\n\\-PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF ($SPHD): Watched some YouTube videos and I really liked what YouTuber Andre Jikh had to say about a few ETFs and Dividends. I like the sound of ETFs as they take a lot of work out of investing, provide consistent dividents, and aren't volatile.\n\n\\-Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ($VTI): Want for the same reasons as SPHD, but after some research see that it's a bit more growth oriented (albeit volatile?) than SPHD. Thought it be good to grab this along with SPHD as it also gives dividends.\n\nSo...like I said I am a complete beginner in investing in stocks and really did all of this just by googling stuff and doing some research, watching youtube videos, etc. Please tell me if I'm an idiot about ANY OF THESE stocks and why I'm wrong, because that's why I'm posting this.\n\nAlso - what are some great FREE resources to use to get more stock education, advice, and trends on the market?", "id": "h17as9", "created_utc": 1591907303.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019ll be buying NKLA at $20 a couple months from now lol", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3962106704711914}, {"body": "These are the recs he gave??? \n\nFor fucks sake", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "No not all of them, just some.

{"title": "Coronavirus FUD and discussion on AUM (Autist's Update on the Market)", "selftext": "Hey guys. Self described medical-expert here to give you the daily update on the 'rona. I am here to reassure that the Media narrative being spun is FUD, and anyone who fearmongers is a PEDO GUY. I am going to use FACTS and DATA to CRUSH the doubters. \n\nDaily confirmed cases in US is trending DOWN WITH A TINY UPTICK over last week.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/GTRpv3b\n\nYes, there's a small uptick over last week, but with the mass protests occurring now two weeks ago, the notion that we are going to see runaway exponentials beginning again looks extremely unlikely -- a tiny little bump which won't repeat because the protests and the ending of the lockdowns are factors that won't repeat. So we are fine, I'd bet anything and am.\n\nConfirmed deaths looks even better, a straight line downward -- this makes sense too. People are enjoying the sunshine again, higher Vitamin D levels are protecting people.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gBX5weQ\n\nSource on Vitamin D: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-21211/v1\n\nVitamin D is not technically a Vitamin, but a hormone. It protects against viruses, it increases your testosterone levels and protects against obesity and health problems. One of the reasons African-Americans are susceptible to the 'rona is lower vitamin D, also obesity which is itself partly a result of lower Vitamin D. Being low D is the same as being low T.\n\n\nWe can see there are some countries having problems with the 'rona -- Brazil, India are the two biggest. One locked down and the other didn't (Totalitarianism doesn't work!). Both are poor countries with mega-slums. Both are equatorial nations which is why their spike took longer to happen. In the US, most of our people who were highly susceptible to the virus already got infected during the Winter which is why our Summer is looking so good. Brazilians are less rule-abiding than Indians which is why they have a bigger number.\n\nThe seasonal impact from this virus is now undeniable. Countries with exponential curves right now are all equatorial or Southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere is looking fantastic.\n\nThat unfortunately means that there WILL be a second wave in the fall. Make sure you TAN, get the SUNSHINE, make sure you LIFT. Make sure you take Vitamin D to INGEST SUNSHINE IN PILL FORM.\n\nMake sure you stay within six feet of ROBINHOOD USERS and anyone who buys HTZ or CHK and take off your mask and breathe directly into their faces. Let's make the market efficient again!\n\nToday I sold my puts up 40%. I am usually always wrong on my market timing, but that being said:\n\nWe have a V-shaped recovery and an unlimited money printer so I would continue to err on the side of bullishness. I fully believe we continue to set all-time highs in the coming weeks. This is a bear trap!
