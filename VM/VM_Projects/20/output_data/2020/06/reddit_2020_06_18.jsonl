{"title": "Tesla call spread with short strike now at the money", "selftext": "A month ago I posted about Tesla (when it was $830) and compared a call spread (the July 830/1000)  vs the 1000 call because they were similar prices ($55 on the spread, $47 on the call). Here was [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gij559/higher_probability_trading_in_high_dollar_stocks/).\n\nOne of the things you often hear traders talk about (and it's even discussed in the comments on that post) is when doing a multi-leg trade, if the move happens too quickly, sometimes you wish you had just done something more 'simple'.\n\nIn this case TSLA hit the target of $1000 a month 'too soon'. I revisited these trades today and to compare how they performed vs eachother.\n\nBut more importantly, I wanted to show how I manage a vertical spread when it's gone ITM and hit its target with alot of time to go til expiration. I'm not sure a ton of people understand that flip... from going long premium with decay *against* you... to long premium and decay *with* you.\n\nIt's a cool concept to understand and can then be used to help form a mental stop in the stock of when to take profits.\n\nTo the trade. With TSLA $1000, at the target, but with a month to go, buying the 1000 call would have worked great. It is now trading $80, a gain of $33 dollars.\n\nBut let's compare that to the 830/1000 call spread (long the 830 call, *short* the 1000 call). It's worth worth  $115. A gain of $60!\n\nNow, the next question may be, but now the Call Spread is capped, while the call can keep making money, so the call is better now right? It is true that the call spread is capped, but right now it's only worth $115. That means if TSLA keeps going higher, it can still make another $55 (max value $170). And even if TSLA doesn't go anywhere and is $1000 a month from now, it would still make that last $55.\n\nThe 1000 call, on the other hand, currently trading $80, needs TSLA to keep going higher, above $1080 in the next month, just to not *lose* current profits. And it needs TSLA to get above $1162 to be worth more than the 830/1000 call spread on expiration.\n\nFor those thinking in theta terms, the Call has decay working against it. The Call  Spread... because it is short the 1000 call (which is now at-the-money)... has decay working *for* it.\n\nAs far as managing the call spread, it's easier than most think. Be patient and wait to see what TSLA does next. If it keeps going higher this call spread will continue to make money. Even if it goes sideways near 1000, this call spread will continue to make money. AND, if it does start to go lower, you have room. In fact, you can make a stop in the stock below (mentally) at which point the current profits would be at risk at expiration. Here's how:\n\nThe trade is currently worth $115. That means that in a month, if the stock is above $945, this trade will have made more money than it has right now. (it's intrinsic value is 170 right now, but it's trading 115, meaning it just has to finish above 830+115 to be worth more than it is now) That's a pretty large buffer to the downside where it can be worth even more. And to the upside it guarantees it will be worth more.

{"title": "Elliot Wave Analysis and Projections", "selftext": "I know technical ANALysis is not the end all be all, and it should be used along with the rest of the magic crayon indicators and fundamentals. I have attached below a labeled SPY graph and right below that the classic Elliot Wave template. The basic theory is this - markets move in waves and these waves replicate in a similar pattern based on the overall trend. Depending on the time frame you look at, these waves are always repeating themselves within their waves (waveception), from the 1 minute chart all the way up to the 20 year chart and beyond. The classic pattern that Elliot noticed is applicable in bull and bear markets. Waves 1,3, 5 & B are moving with the trend, with waves 2,4, A & C going against the trend, then the trend either continues or reverses. Like with all good technical indicators, it's somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy because enough people over time have accepted it and believed it, so it became built into how people and their algos trade the markets. \n\n[Entering Wave 3](https://preview.redd.it/zw3tll6vkk551.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b62b4c6bc693163f80666fe395fad04949e0d324)\n\n[Classic Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/smfafsqdlk551.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef70516e355140741b2c282ebd0a62e09cbc72f7)\n\nI currently believe we are entering wave 3 of the cycle, which is typically the strongest wave. It would not surprise me if we touched all time highs before wave 3 becomes wave 4. Although we continue to face risks of the virus and rising cases, people are starting to accept the new norm and have nowhere to put their cash. Money market fund AUMs are at all time highs, and people are going to get tired of earning .01% on their cash. Investing and trading is 'cool' again even outside of wallstreetbets, and this is the biggest dislocation the market has seen in 10 years - people want to get in and play. The Fed and the Government have actually come together, and likely saved us from a depression. There is a lot of pent up demand, and people are itching to get out and will take whatever precautions they feel will help. A lot of the data is coming in way better than people expected, and the brrrr brrrr will likely continue. \n\nTLDR; STONKS ONLY GO UP, BUY THE FUCKING DIP\n\nOptions Positions; XRX 10/17 25C, NOK 1/15/21 4C, XLK 1/21/22 100C, XLE 1/21/22 40C, VIX 7/22 52.5C", "id": "hb5adh", "created_utc": 1592445164.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|135|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1xgdc/actual_free_tendies_with_xbit/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q8qo8l/toasty_tendies_ahead_tost/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9cuob/tlt_calls/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m34j47/farm_gang/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r6wayd/daddy_jpow_the_hawk_in_doves_clothing/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5tt9a/spce_put_selling/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gad99j/xle_dd/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=hb5adh)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=hb5adh)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2731974720954895}, {"body": "This horseshit only works when Mercury is in retrograde, and HOLY FUCK, Mercury is apparently going into retrograde again tomorrow.

{"title": "What is going on with Wirecard ?", "selftext": "Let's try to answer this question !\n\n**Who ?**\n\n\u00ab Wirecard is an international supplier of electronic payment and risk management services. Wirecard offers products and services in the areas of [mobile payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment), [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce), [digitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization) and finance technology. This traditionally comprises the integration of payment methods, payment transactions via e-commerce as well as payment transactions at the stationary checkout ([POS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale)). In these areas, Wirecard currently works in cooperation with 280,000 companies (as of December 2018), including [Allianz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz), [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM), [Qatar Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways),[Rakuten.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten.com) and [Transport for London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London), among others. The transaction volume in 2018 was US$125 billion. In the first half of 2019 the transaction volume grew by 37.5 percent to EUR 77.3 billion. \u00bb Wikipedia\n\n**Shareholders ?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzpbs9z98q551.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65866db19ca77189d307e4f61b528e538b7f374\n\n**Creditors :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Deutsche Bank took half of Markus shares as a collateral for a loan of 150m \u20ac to Markus not Wirecard\n\n**Market share ?**\n\nThose are the countries using the most Wirecard :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl1tg5xa8q551.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=69082fc467534b0a127e1d42deefff048a4a9824\n\nMarket shares of the European competitors :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsz15v5c8q551.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=30d876934f7ee8734a3a58f2c219a05e95d9ba0c\n\n*Side note* : Amongst international competitors there arePaypal, Visa, Apple Pay \u2026\n\n**What happened ?**\n\nAll really begun with this 59 pages report written by KPMG ([https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht\\_Sonderpruefung\\_KPMG\\_EN\\_200501\\_Disclaimer.pdf](https://www.wirecard.com/uploads/Bericht_Sonderpruefung_KPMG_EN_200501_Disclaimer.pdf)) concerning a forensic special investigation on Wirecard, which basically mean that they are investigating about a **specific case** with the aim of fully clarifying a potential (not necessarily criminally relevant) violation or misconduct, so this is not a annual audit.\n\nIn this report, KPMG complained about the lack of will of Wirecard to give informations, KPMG was unable to obtain standard information that it requested from Wirecard such as bank statements, customer names and contracts as well as transaction data.\n\nThis document was the main reason of the Chris Hohn\u2019s open letter. The famous hedge fund manager published an open letter on April 28 to Thomas Eichelmann, the chairman of Wirecard ([https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf](https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/wirecard/TCI%20-%20Letter%20to%20Wirecard%2028%20April%202020.pdf)).\n\nIn his letter, he states the audit made by KPMG was inconclusive, \u00ab KPMG explains that it has encountered an \u201cUntersuchungshemmnis\u201d (in English: obstacles to the investigation) \u00bb, basically, 1 billion $ was missing between 2016 and 2018. So it raises questions to how investors, lenders and regulators can be confident that Wirecard\u2019s current and historic accounting is accurate, so they wanted for Wirecard to show some trust by firing Markus the CEO, but today he is still here. He concluded by announcing that he was short selling 1.04% of shares outstanding of Wirecard.\n\n**Since then :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* TILP filed an investor lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that the KPMG report showed that the group for years had experienced a massive shortfall in compliance\u009d that it had been obliged to disclose to shareholders early on. Why is it important ? Because this law firm has already won cases against Porsche and Volkswagen during the diesel gate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Al Alam a Dubai business payment processor their most significant business partner entered liquidation on May 2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Today the stock dropped 61% and their bonds by more than 40% because EY which was conducting an annual audit said that they were unable to confirm the existence of 2.1b $, and that \u00ab  spurious cash balance \u00bb have been provided to auditor by 3rd party. This missing fund represents 25% of the company. They have to come clean by tomorrow (June 18).\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nConsidering the online payment business as fast very forward industry, Wirecard is facing two challenges :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* First, they will need to find a managerial equilibrium in a short time\n* Second, they will need earn back trust from current clients and future ones. They may loose more clients in the short term.\n\nThose challenges are actually very hard to tackle in an healthy market but in this one it seems nearly impossible, furthermore, big investors will be selling massively those next few days so we might see more loses.\n\n**I am not a financial advisor but I would say that in the long and short term the stock is going down as well as the company.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : Forgot positions :\n\n\\- short Wirecard through turbos and warrants if you can,\n\n\\- or 26/06p on $DB, but this one is risky since this is just 100m \u20ac possibly lost.\n\n\\- or more autistic 15/01p on $DB because if they loan to business with shares as collateral, they might be fucked if stocks go down.", "id": "hbm6ji", "created_utc": 1592511657.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=hbm6ji)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=hbm6ji)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1681872308254242}, {"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The management didn't care about compliance at all. Where are those $1.9 billion? Have they ever learned how to make corect balance sheets? No. I think the money is not gone but they simply couldn't provide correct documentation. Imagine you create a startup in a booming market. You hire more and more employees but don't train them and don't question their work. I am sure some people who worked there left the company because they realized people are producing pseudo-compliant shit because they are clueless or reckless or simply don't care. Once person A left the company, person B had to take over persons A work and didn't question/care about it. This is how you fuck up documentation from time to time. This is why KPMG had its concerns. It's the responsibility of the management to assure compliance. They don't care. Basically a bunch of kids leading a company, ridiculous. They will most likely be acquired by another company (or go bankrupt - but I don't believe that).\n\nI would say skip wirecard, it can go either way...

I guarantee you that all hands were on deck, if that money existed, it would have been found by now.
