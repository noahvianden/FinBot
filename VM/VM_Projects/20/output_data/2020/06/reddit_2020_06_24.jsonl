{"title": "Different Ways of Making Money In the Stock Market", "selftext": "In my last post I was explaining how the current stock market is in a bubble.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hbkmui/how\\_to\\_invest\\_during\\_this\\_stock\\_market\\_bubble/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hbkmui/how_to_invest_during_this_stock_market_bubble/)\n\nIn  the comments I told some people that I thought short term investing  would be the best for this type of market. I realized I made a mistake  of assuming everyone would be willing to accept the high risk and high  level of difficulty of short term trading (although I do it, since I'm  willing to take the risk and challenge). So I made a little summary of  the different strategies. If you are experienced in the market you can  skip this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Day Trading**  \\- The most lucrative for a small account (<$1mil) but with the  highest fail rate (90%). Only about 8% of people who attempt day trading  end up being consistently profitable, making 1% a day. **Level of difficulty:**  Very difficult. A lot of studying and research is required. Fast  reflexes and fast thinking is a must. Day traders can make money  whichever direction the market decides to go. Day trading can be very  lucrative in volatile markets like today. **Level of risk** is very high.\n2. **Swing Trading**  \\- Swing trading can be days, months, years, or decades.  Ray Dalio would be a good example of a long term swing investor (partially value investing). Through research done by Bridgewater, they strategically place hedging investments when they see the market going down. Short term  swing traders are similar to day traders. They look for momentum and  ride along. They will do a combination of technical  analysis and fundamental analysis. Good swing traders expect to make 20% a year. Many day traders eventually become swing traders. Once their  portfolios grow too massive, it becomes harder and harder to jump in  and out of trades instantly with the limited amount of liquidity during  the day. Many Wall Street hedge funds are swing traders. **Level of difficulty:**  Difficult. Studying and research is still required. Swing traders can  also make money whichever direction the market decides to go. **Level of risk** is high.\n3. **Value Investing**  \\- Warren Buffett would be the prime example of a value investor.  Surprisingly, his strategy is pretty simple. He buys when cheap. He'll  wait for the Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio to fall below 0.8 (see chart  below). He's buying when everyone else is crying. Value investors pretty  much wait for market valuations to become cheap and then buy companies  that they know will last forever. Currently, we are at extremely high  market valuations, so Buffett's cash balance is at record levels. He is  ready to jump in when opportunity rises. **Level of difficulty:**  Moderate. Study and research is required but can be done over a  long time. The hardest part of value investing is patience. Most people  don't have the patience to not invest during an elongated bull market  (bubble as some economists call it). Value investors don't think in  terms of how much money this company I own is worth today. They know  that during bubbles (low interest periods) stock prices will go up and  during recessions stock prices go down. They hold regardless. **Level of risk** is moderate [https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/)\n4. **Dollar cost averaging (DCA)**  \\- This is for the average hard working person. Just consistently put  money into your retirement account and not even look at it until it's  time to retire. You consistently deposit into your account regardless of  whether the market is in a bubble or a recession. The key is  consistency. **Level of difficulty:** Easy. Unless you are willing to do the studying and research for the above strategies, you want to choose this strategy. **Level of risk** is low.", "id": "het535", "created_utc": 1592968281.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "You forgot #5 YOLO trading - the easiest and the most popular way to trade.

The two main criticisms Alex levelled at these plans was that they would struggle to develop the software and sensors. The sensor part is probably the easiest one of the whole problem to solve. The sensors Tesla uses are simple and not unique. Nvidia has a large number of partners in the sensor area, and I'd imagine they can help Mercedes by providing this knowledge. \n\nOn the software side Nvidia has DRIVE AutoPilot ([https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/01/07/nvidia-drive-autopilot/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/01/07/nvidia-drive-autopilot/)). It sounds like the functionality would be similar to where Tesla is now. I'm sceptical of that but wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia became the #2 in functionality after Tesla where ADAS is concerned. This DRIVE AutoPilot is launching in a Volvo vehicle by the end of this year. It's unclear exactly how much of the functionality will be Nvidia vs Volvo, but I posit that it's a majority if not all Nvidia.

In comparison The Nvidia A100 server GPU can do 624 TOPS INT8, about 8x faster. It pulls 250 W in comparison to 36 W of HW3, so it's actually more energy efficient as well. Moore's law, when Tesla first developed their FSD chip in 2018 it was hot shit, now, not so much really. \n\nStart of 2018 the fastest chip Nvidia has was the NVIDIA TESLA P100, confusing name, I know, that's why Nvidia dropped the \"Tesla\" naming with the A100, anyway the Tesla P100 was the fastest GPU in the world 2018 and could do 21 TOPS. Middle of 2018 Nvidia released the Tesla V100 that had tensor acceleration and could do 130 TOPS. GPUs move quick, Tesla fabs the FSD chip on 14nm, the Nvidia V100 was on 12nm, A100 on 7 nm next gen is probably on 5nm and another huge boost in performance. \n\nBiggest benefit for Tesla is that they probably make their chip for like $50 something, meanwhile Nvidia wants $8,000 for a V100, they don't even really sell A100's standalone, but 8 of them in a box is $200,000. Plus Tesla is already using these cards to train their neural networks in the cloud, and that's the tricky part. Not adding like $5000 to the car price for an Nvidia sticker seems like a good idea. \n\nThe biggest thing I'm worried about HW3 for is that it's a nightmare to program for. Google Cloud TPU v3's are similar custom designed silicon like Tesla has and those chips are notorious for being a nightmare to actually use. Nvidia makes the hardware very easy to use through like PyTorch (which Tesla uses). However Tesla already does most of their AI work on Nvidia GPUs and probably just compile it over to their FSD chip at the end, so it's not a big issue. \n\nAlso it's not like Nvidia is any kind of leader in AI, they just follow the trends and make the hardware. They have published some AI papers and results, but it's more like \"We threw 4092 of our fastest GPUs at this problem and got a SOTA result, look how much you can accomplish if you decide to use Nvidia GPUs\".", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Yeah that\u2019s not true. \n\nMB has been developing driver assistance technology since it came out with the long range radar back in 1999.

The amount sold was ~4% of Kimbal's shares and options, and less than 1/8 of the amount he sold last year also using programmed trades, so presumably he will sell more this year. He has other businesses and charities that may need money from time to time, particularly his restaurant business, which he said had suffered considerably due to the coronavirus shutdown, so likely the money from this sale of stock was welcome.\n\nThe thing that analysts typically wonder about when an insider sells shares is whether he/she has inside knowledge of a problem the company is facing. But given that Kimbal used automatic trading, that he sold only a small fraction of his TSLA holdings, and that he apparently sells on a fairly regular basis (plus I believe he also receives options as compensation for serving as a director), this doesn't appear to be the kind of sale that would give significant evidence of negative insider information.

You can get ducked pretty bad in the case that trading is halted(this is what happened to me) cause the market makers can change the hard to borrow fee daily to literally whatever fee they want and you HAVE to pay it and if it\u2019s on a halted security you CAN NOT close your position. It\u2019s how market makers basically ensure that when a company is dying and no one owns shares and everyone is shorting it, that the market makers don\u2019t lose out. They literally will halt the stock and rob you of whatever value you should have gained from the price decline. This is pretty rare tho, but it did happen to me in 2018.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7251216173171997}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7186609506607056}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5299121737480164}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No. You can not short for free.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No you cant.

{"title": "#1 mobile gaming app for 2020 crushes the competition and it\u2019s players.", "selftext": "Since March of 2020, Robinhood\u2019s \u201cStonk trading\u201d augmented reality game has quickly grown to be the most popular game in the world. Despite competition from the likes of Thinkorswim, and more recently Webull, Robinhood\u2019s still reaching highs of 10.7 million concurrent players during trading hours, and with over 200 million registered players as of May 1st, Robinhood is undoubtedly unbeatable right now. The real question, however, is whether Robinhood will be able to maintain it\u2019s popularity once the upcoming DLC, \u201cMarket Correction\u201d is released. \n\nTo answer that, we\u2019re going to have to cast our minds back to when Covid 19 first started appearing in Chinese bat meat. Many thousands of ordinary people found themselves unemployed or \u201cworking from home\u201d as state and federal governments began shutting down businesses and discouraging public contact in an attempt to curb the spread of \u201cCOVID 19\u201d. The displaced workers, initially spending time day-drinking and playing ordinary video games, became restless. Word spread quickly about Robinhood and it\u2019s hallmark game \u201ctrading stonks\u201d.  \n\nPart of Robinhood\u2019s appeal comes from its unexpected narrative. Despite it existing solely as an MMORPG, RH spent the majority of 2019 breaking the usual multiplayer gameplay tropes by introducing a continuously evolving plot line spanning multiple seasons of Stonk Trading content.\n\nIt all started with a free stock for signing up, and then more free stock for recruiting new players. This created a sense of easy money in the RH community and since then there\u2019s been numerous in-game events like \u201cDaily Pump and Dump\u201d, \u201cWhich way will the market go?\u201d and the soon to be released \u201cYOLO on SPY puts\u201d\n\nReddit\u2019s wonderful way of accepting and supporting new players means it has created an incredibly passionate community, which thrives on speculating on what it all could mean and the potential outcomes. Without these awe-inspiring moments, the game wouldn\u2019t be half as intriguing. The community is the heart of Robinhood- yes, even the WSB players who love to kill you with a \u201cban\u201d headshot.\n\nAlthough RH has been executing the most impressive multiplayer narrative in games for over a year now, none of that matters if the game isn\u2019t enjoyable to play. But there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s captured the attention of millions around the world, and it isn\u2019t just down to the Gay Bear dance and Stonks always go up attitude.\n\nIt\u2019s the trade-by-trade experience.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see why Robinhood initially exploded in popularity. Free stocks; the only battle Royal for Tendies; retard-friendly aesthetics; and not to mention that the average skill level is \u201cnone\u201d. Players have not improved along with the game itself. When RH first launched, single stock transactions were elite tier, not the complex Double Iron Sheik Diving Condor Spreads some players can construct now in an instant - and this is coming from someone who can mostly keep up with the meta and wins fairly consistently. Robinhood\u2019s encouragement to \u201cGo ahead, try some options\u201d also helps keep the game feeling fresh, and proves that it\u2019s constantly listening to its community.", "id": "hf5ndx", "created_utc": 1593020929.0, "score": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "For a pay to win game this one sucks.

Riley Principal Merger Corp. II (BMRG), which announced that it had signed a Letter of Intent with Eos Energy Storage, an established provider of long-duration energy storage focused on providing a domestic solution to a global need: **low-cost, safe, and environmentally friendly energy storage.**\n\nEssentially, Eos is **building a better battery for use in large scale electricity grid applications.** Their **patented** Aurora and Znyth technologies offer a scalable, fully recyclable and sustainable alternative to lithium-ion battery power that uses Earth-abundant, non-conflict minerals for production. Eos currently operates in 3 continents and has secured over $160 million in invested capital to date including AltEnergy, Holtec International, Reservoir Capital Group, Generation Capital, Ospraie Management, Ace & Company, Fisher Brothers, and Prisma Energy Solutions, among others.\n\nThis market is HOT. The confluence of technological advancements, large scale investment from prominent companies, and trends toward decarbonization create an extremely favorable environment to raise capital for this type of business. As electric grids rid themselves of coal, renewable energy and natural gas are picking up the slack. Within renewable power, solar has experienced a growth unlike other sources, growing 49% per year in the last decade. In fact, 2019 was the first time in 130 years that renewable energy consumption surpassed coal consumption in the United States. All this energy has to be stored somewhere. Companies like Tesla have been pushing battery technology forward for years and recently announced their \u201cmillion mile battery\u201d, which will be a substantial leap forward in the longevity for electric vehicles. Furthermore, there is potential to increase solar cell efficiency from \\~30% to closer to \\~47% through combining different materials instead of using exclusively silicon, which would drastically reduce the cost of solar per megawatt and increase solar utilization.\n\nThe management team, led by Joe Mastrangelo, are GE Power and private equity veterans who have deep experience in this space. Joe comments, \u201cThe global energy storage ecosystem is expected to grow with a CAGR of 20% over the next 20 years. The current market is primarily served by lithium ion batteries manufactured in\u00a0China\u00a0and\u00a0South Korea \u2013 and with our zinc-based system offering a safer, greener, and less expensive solution, it is our strong belief that Eos is poised for significant long-term growth and material cash flow generation.\u201d The focus of Eos seems to be very in-line with where the current market trends are pointing.\n\nThe transaction values Eos at $290 million pre-money with BRMG providing $225 million of additional new equity financing, including a $50 million PIPE. It\u00a0is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. BRMG and Eos will host a joint investor conference call to discuss the proposed transaction on Thursday, June 25, 2020\u00a0at\u00a010:00 am ET.", "id": "hf7p9q", "created_utc": 1593027187.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Hey guys, I actually wrote this article and posted it on the website [spacinsider.com](https://spacinsider.com).

{"title": "Wall Street Bets Journal - Issue 2", "selftext": "#\u00a1GUH!\n\nA real fuckening developed today in the early hours as markets across the board fell.  The reason for the drop is debated but insiders report that a quant at SPY headquarters slipped on a pile of money and fell against a window, inadvertently opening the curtain and allowing an unspecified number of algo servers to see the world outside.  It is being reported at this hour that the servers are bearish due to seeing 3 of the four biblical horseman of the apocalypse fly down fifth avenue with flaming swords of the end times.\n\nAfter seeing the pullback, several retards in the daily thread decided to contribute the best of their keen intellect and made bold, and incredibly stupid predictions.  WSB newcomer u/brundonius was reported as saying *\u201dEveryone knows we\u2019re closing the day bullish.\u201d* u/amoctar , not content to leave his brain damaged screeching unheard simply stated *\u201cgreen eod\u201d* Unsurprisingly, both of these users were reported dead several hours later when they mistook a rat trap as a hot pocket and decided to share luncheon.\n\nThe selloff ended abruptly when thousands of previously affirmed permabears decided to experiment with other orientations and bought puts at the bottom.  \n\n##The War at 302\nFighting intensified today between the Axe Bodyspray Chads and Logic Neckbeard Virgins today.  Chads were pushed back throughout the morning but appear to be holding ground.  Published below is a letter from the front.\n\n*My dearest Gertrude,*\n\n*It is with a heavy heart that I report the bears have overrun 304, fighting is fierce, and I cannot help but admire these brave gay beasts.*\n\n*The bulls have set up their last stand at 302, and fighting is thick.  And they are giving it their all.*\n\n*The 420th division \u201cFighting Chads\u201d have entrenched with their Red Bull cannon.  And the memechine gun nests are numerous and well protected.  The 69th brigade \u201cthe flying BA gang\u201d has been bombing bears with insults and cargo shorts for hours.  But I fear the bears ultimate weapon \u201cReality\u201d will make it all for naught.*\n\n*What will be the outcome? I cannot say.  There is so much blood.*\n\n*Yours in SPY strangles,  -REDACTED-*\n\n###Impotent Rage at the Nations Capitol\n\n\nFinally, President Trump took an opportunity today to take a stroll on the White House lawn this afternoon.  Upon spying a large oak tree, he is reported to have frowned, steeled himself in fury and shouted *\u201dLAW AND ORDER!\u201d* at the plant.
