My HYSA rate is so low that I might as well invest in the market it instead. I want to put a good portion of it into something safe so I figured I could put them into ETFs. Seems like I'm too late and missed the train as most have seen significant growth within this last year and have recovered from early this year. Should I just invest it now or wait for a pullback?

To their credit, they reported the numbers and they were excellent from a satisfaction standpoint. Consumer Reports surveyed different age groups on how satisfied they were with their vehicles and in every single generational group, Tesla was the top automaker.   Negative things like the case of that roof flying off are actually quite rare, but because they are this \"startup\" Tesla, they get all kinds of press. One reason there is a large bias against Tesla is the oil industry saw ahead of time that if they were successful, it would force a larger adoption of EVs and major manufacturers (like VW) would be forced to enter the space. This obviously is a bad thing for that industry as it will reduce demand over the years, so it is likely they have something to do with influencing some of these short-sellers to continue to do so and to get on financial shows and talk about a \"busted growth story\" at the beginning of the quarter, when European shipments are down. The other factor is that Tesla does not pay these media outlets anything in ad revenue, so there is going to be an inherent bias for those that pay their bills. There is clearly a lot less of this click-bait \"sponsored\" negative press now than ever, but it is still there. \n\nAs for tangible reasons to look at Tesla: 30 to 50% YoY growth in revenues, rapid factory deployment and then local production in China, where they have significantly reduced costs due to not having to ship every MIC car overseas and deal with tariffs and taxes associated with that. Then you have the story that they are going to three shifts in China and about to start exporting to other RHD countries, further saving on costs to batch build in the US. Giga Berlin factory is coming along very quickly despite attempts to slow it down by \"environmental groups\" and Covid, the Austin Terrafactory, that is already starting to pour concrete foundations, and an expectation of an Indian factory next year. With regard to battery technology, their main concern is being supply-constrained and they are aggressively forming partnerships and even acquiring land rights to resource-rich land to allow for future mining. They are more vertically integrated than any automaker and are also looking at not only producing their own patented cells with state of the art manufacturing, but are also researching ways to extract the elements with less waste and less expensively - in house. \n\nThey are focused on first-principles from top to bottom. They don't just do things \"because that's how it has always been done\" and strive to make every part of the manufacturing process streamlined and more efficient. Elon has stated their goal is to be the best manufacturer in the world. The gigantic casting machines they have created are unique in the industry and they have their own special alloys they've developed in-house to allow for it. They will allow for a faster, poka-yoked process that will ensure less defects per car frame and a stronger frame.  The \"octo-valve\" is an iteration on the \"super bottle\", which in itself was a revolutionary technology leap. Their FSD computer was designed in-house and industry experts have analyzed and confirmed it really blows away anything Nvidia has - and they just decided to hire the right people and develop it.\n\nTesla is at the top - right behind SpaceX - of companies newly minted engineers want to work for. They have their pick of top-tier talent with an open mind. \n\nI could go on and on about this, but it gives you some idea of why some of us are very excited for what the future brings for Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the answer this makes sense. it sounds like they have a ton of proprietary tech.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12781305611133575}, {"body": "https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302804/tesla-ranks-last-on-influential-jd-power-quality-survey", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "As a counter: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-tops-consumer-reports-owner-satisfaction-list-2019-2", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Jd power is pretty much a pointless survey, companies can buy their spot in the ratings and it is only the satisfaction of ownership on the first 90 days of ownership.

{"title": "First week wheeling (no bragging, promise)", "selftext": "Hi Y'all,\n\njust completed my first week wheeling.  I honestly don't mind if wheeling is better or lesser than buy or hold, but I've had a lot of fun already.  I learnt some very basics about trading options, traded my first options, and am keen to learn more.\n\nI was originally going to place one CSP on MSFT, but I went a bit crazy and did 4, here were my trades, placed Monday Sep 28th.\n\nMSFT Sell CSP 10/30/2020 @$195\n\nQQQ Sell CSP 10/30/2020 @$250\n\nSPY Sell CSP 10/30/2020 @$300\n\nAAPL Sell CSP 10/30/2020 @$100\n\nHad no idea how this was going to go, wasn't even sure I would get the trades right (i.e. placing them correctly), but I did place them right, and closed out SPY and AAPL today for 50% profit.  I set up GTC BTC orders to sell at 50% profit and they executed today.  So I made a grand total of $96 on SPY minus $0.52 fees, and $86 on AAPL minus $0.52 fees.  So, not big returns, but I really am enjoying the journey.  My MSFT and QQQ still have open GTC BTC orders.\n\nI've read/learnt more since I made the initial trades, and feel slightly better positioned to make the next trades.\n\nBackground:  I took $100k of 401k that was in a bonds ETF which was ultra reliable, safe, but very small returns, and decided to wheel it.  I will be happy, no ecstatic, if I can beat the returns I was getting on the bonds ETF.  Also I am enjoying the heck out of this.
