EV, hybrid and Gas parts).\n\nTesla is a step ahead of everyone else and has a chance at taking a large portion of the consumer share. However supply lines take a lot to build up to scale, which Tesla is doing beautifully with vertical integration. That and all the other streams of revenue  they have going for them places a great chance of them doubling or quadripling in value over the next decade, even if they drop heavily if the EV bubble pops. BUT, that is assuming they can keep up the hype of their base, maintain and grow their supply lines without issues, and hold onto their market share once larger companies catch up. Other companies have much larger, cheaper, and more efficient supply lines but will take ~4+ years to retool and ramp up production. Not to mention profit margins will eventually return to razor thin like the current Auto Industry. I think they are a safe bet for a long hold, so long as you can stomach voilitity. Biggest thing is that Tesla looks like it is here to stay and will remain in the industry for our lifetimes, any investments should hold their value and give decent returns.\n\nNio on the other hand is more of a black box in my opinion. It is hard to know exactly what is going on there, but Nio currently has a good reputation  and has the appearance of transparency. They have recently received very good consumer reports which indicate a growing brand recognition within China, and have sale numbers to support that. They do have a Nio home product line that may be a large source of revenue and brad appeal but it isn't guaranteed to work. They could easily 10x in value if they gain a large share in China, not to mention going north of 100x if they can break into international markets and avoid the \"made in china\" stigma. However all of the challenges that Tesla faces are also issues for Nio. Nio has nothing that can assure investors that they will stand the test of time. In short, it is advised to be comfortable with losing every penny invested in Nio. However there is a slight chance that they may win a stable longterm portion of market share (or be bought out) and reward investors with very large returns.\n\nThanks for reading, have a good day!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3984758257865906}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29211315512657166}, {"body": "Well I became rich utilizing a lot of info from youtubers.

PEG ratio is a measure of correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. When the ratio is less than 1, it implies that the company is undervalued. Sitting at a current PEG ratio is around 0.40, $ACI is extremely undervalued to say the least. For example, $WMT has a PEG ratio of 4.75, $TGT has 3.13, $COST has 4.93, and $DG has 2.15 right now. \n\n$ACI IPO-ed in late June and till now has remained mostly unnoticed. This earnings will be its beckoning call and I can see it hovering around $30 by the end of the year.\n\nN.B.

The S&P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.\n\nProspects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14.

In addition, Goldman has been undertaking initiatives to boost the GS Bank\u2019s performancewith its acquisition of the online deposit platform of GE Capital Bank in April 2016.\n\n\n2. Lower Credit Risk\nGoldman Sachs holds a total debt level of $560 billion and debt to capital ratio of 0.71X compared to the industry average of 0.75X as of Jun 30, 2020 . GS\u2019s earnings stability and strong cash position of $406 billion as of Jun 30, 2020, confirms lower credit and debt repayments risk if the economic situation worsens.\n\n3. A Strong Industry Leader\nInvestment management is a relatively stable and high-return-on-capital business that is well suited to the current regulatory environment.\n\n4. Higher Margin Business\nThe  company\u2019s investment management business has become a  priority. Assets under supervision exceeded $1.8 trillion at the end  of 2019, while related investment management fees have recently clocked in at around 17% of net revenue compared with 11%-12% before 2008.\n\nTo sum up, Goldman Sachs has maintained sufficient capital buffer and is well scaled to weather the current economic environment.
