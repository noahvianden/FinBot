{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Mon, Oct 19, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 19, 2020**\n\nStocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. \n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.\n\nOver the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said \u201cI want to do a bigger number than she wants \\[Pelosi\u2019s $2.2 trillion proposal\\]. That doesn\u2019t mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.\u201d These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trump\u2019s endorsement can help move the needle.\n\nIn response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson said, \u201cWhile there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.\n\nIn Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into \"Level Five\" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on \"medium,\" \"high\" or \"very high\" alert. London is an area of \u201chigh alert\u201d meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ally Financial (ALLY) had price target raises by Piper Sandler, BMO Capital, and Morgan Stanley from $31 to $34 at OVERWEIGHT, $34 to $36 at OUTPERFORM, and $31 to $38 at OVERWEIGHT, respectively.\n* NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) had price target raised by Credit Suisse from $60 to $69 at OUTPERFORM\n* Snapchat (SNAP) had price target raise by KeyCorp from $29 to $35 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Texas Roadhouse (TXRH)  had price target raise by Wedbush from $71 to $82 at OUTPERFORM\n* Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)  was upgraded by Guggenheim from NEUTRAL to BUY with a target of $70\n* GoodRx (GDRX) had coverage initiated today by a myriad of analysts. mixture of targets ranging from $50 to $70 from Neutral to Buy.\n* ConocoPhillips to buy Concho Resources in an all-stock deal valued at nearly $10 billion\n* Kodak (KODK) CEO  Jim Continenza  says his company will still move toward manufacturing drug ingredients, even with the government's loan uncertain. Very weird.\n* AMC announced it is resuming operation in many theaters in state of New York, starting October 23\n* ConocoPhillips  to buy Concho Resources in an all-stock deal valued at nearly $10 billion\n* Unions representing over 10,000 Disney theme park workers have told California Governor Gavin Newsom that the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, can safely reopen when its location moves into the state's \"orange tier\" of COVID-19 test positivity and adjusted case rate.\n* NASA gave Nokia-owned (NOK) Bell Labs a $14.1 million grant to build a 4G network on the moon to help astronauts control lunar rovers, navigate lunar geography in real time, and stream videos. Stock was up 3.44% at the time of writing.\n* Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) said it would pay $3.6 billion to take control of China's largest big-box retailer and a major rival to Walmart (WMT) in the world's most populous nation.  The company said it plans to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., which operates more than 480 large supermarket-department stores in China.\n* Influential Taiwan-based analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities writes in a research note that preorder sales of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro in the first 24 hours were in the 1.7 million-to-2 million units range, compared with 500,000 to 800,000 units for the iPhone 11, \n\n\u201cThe secret of getting ahead is getting started\u201d - Mark Twain", "id": "je9m53", "created_utc": 1603138129.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "What a crap shoot that last hour, holy crap.

So I don't believe there will be any federally-mandated or federally-supported lockdowns.\n\nReleasing a stimulus package does seem to be important to the stock market.  The market swings based on the perceived progress of a stimulus package.  Trump wants a stimulus package to be passed, and he wants a big one.  That should be well received by the stock market.  However the Republican-majority senate does not seem to have the same motivation to pass a stimulation package.   There are signs that the Senate Republicans are splitting from Trump ([source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/18/election-2020-mitch-mcconnell-gop-senators-inch-away-trump/3640704001/)).

It's just really hard to predict what might happen. You're definitely right that the market will go giddy for a stim package, but that will be short lived if the virus situation continues to get worse. Time will tell how things work out.

{"title": "Southwest or Delta long term?", "selftext": "Hi! So my mom has been inspired by investing success over the last 3 months (I've earned 40% returns in 3 months, as compared to the market's 10% over the same period) and has asked me to invest her money for her IRA. I have most of the stocks figured out: AMZN, AAPL, FSLY, DOCU, PYPL, SQ, SE, WMT, NEE, FVRR, LULU, and NVDA. However, I wonder if I should include LUV and/or DAL in her portfolio. Also worth noting is that only half of her IRA money will be in stocks: the other half will be in ETFs.\n\nMy belief is that LUV is simply the better stock. They have a better balance sheet and equally importantly, they are a leisure-focused airline. A core assumption I'm using is that while leisure travel is a temporary loser of the COVID-19 pandemic, business travel, as much as I hate to say it, is a permanent loser of it. Yeah, it will still be around, but it will most likely be a permanently smaller part of the aviation industry going forward, and you can thank Zoom for that. There was a Motley Fool article written back in August about how Zoom is the biggest long-term threat to airlines, and I agree. However, I know that this is no guarantee. It's really a question of if the economic benefits of in-person meetings are greater than the travel expenses, and honestly, I have no way to know if that's true. I have a family friend who works at Goldman Sachs so next time I get to talk to him I'll ask him about this. Even if business travel does recover, though, it will be a far slower recovery than for leisure travel, so ultimately whether the first assumption is true or not, it can be confidently said that leisure travel will win out during these years of recovery and possibly beyond.\n\nHowever, there is also a case to be made for DAL. The main lure I see for them is the general care toward their passengers that I have not seen from the other 2 major airlines, American and United. These things add up and I could see them luring some upper-middle-class leisure travelers who have money to invest in a higher quality flight but are concerned about the virus and disease in general. So even if Delta's business travelers don't return, they can still come back up because of those new, wealthier leisure travelers. These travelers are also likely to be some of the same workers that can do remote work a lot of the time, so they will have more time off to travel, which strengthens that case even more. If Delta can win some of that market, they could definitely do well in the future.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Thank you in advance!\n\nP.S: I hear that you guys are concerned that I'm investing my mother's money in the market. I completely understand this, and I am aware that. However, I'd like to be clear that she told me I can do this. I am also using Motley Fool to help guide me, so I am not on my own here. Also, for the question of this post, I basically told her that she can do what she wants in regards to that, but I could not justify either stock right now.
