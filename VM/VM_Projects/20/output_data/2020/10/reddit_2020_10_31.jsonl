{"title": "PMCC Strategy - October Update", "selftext": "  \n\nHey Gang, I wanted to give an update for the end of October with my current positions on the PMCC strategy that I am running.\n\nBackground information on my trading plan can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/jhmpyr/pmcc\\_strategy/\n\nSo far, this month has been a wild ride with the volatility surrounding COVID-19 and the upcoming election. Overall, my portfolio is down, but it could be a lot worse if I owned stock outright and did not sell any calls against my positions. Realize that my portfolio is pretty tech heavy, but I will continue to diversify. \n\n\\-Current Long Positions:\n\nCAT 21 Jan 22 $110 Call for $4,839\n\nNIO 21 Jan 22 $20 Call for $1,547\n\nAAPL 21 Jan 22 $75 Call for $3,785\n\nQQQ 17 Sep 21 $210 Call for $7,460\n\nAMD 21 Jan 22 $55 Call for $3,125\n\nSPCE 21 Jan 22 $15 Call $1,235\n\nROKU 16 Apr 21 $175 Call for $7,730\n\nGME 21 Jan 22 $10 Call for $770\n\n\\-Current Short Positions:\n\nAAPL 20 Nov 20 $122 Call for $233 (6.16%)\n\nAMD 27 Nov 20 $87 Call for $185 (5.92%)\n\nCAT 20 Nov 20 $165 Call for $229 (4.7%)\n\nNIO 20 Nov 20 $36 Call for $126 (8.14%)\n\nQQQ 27 Nov 20 $291 Call for $540 (7.24%)\n\nROKU 20 Nov 20 $255 Call for $645 (8.34%)\n\n\\-Premium Breakdown (October only)\n\nAAPL \\- $3,785 paid, $619 collected, 16.35% return\n\nGME \\- $770 paid, $64 collected, 8.31% return\n\nSPCE \\- $1,235 paid, $94 collected, 7.61% return\n\nROKU \\- $7,730 paid, $599 collected, 7.74% return\n\nQQQ \\- $7,460 paid, $540 collected, 7.24% return\n\n\\- Current PMCC Value\n\nCurrent total invested: $30,491\n\nCurrent value of long positions: $26,734\n\nOctober premium collected: $1,916\n\n% Return of premium: 6.28%\n\nP/L: -$1,841 (adding in the premium earned)\n\n% P/L: -6.04%\n\nNovember potential premium: $1,813\n\nAn update to the strategy is I have been rolling down for additional credit when I am showing 50%+ gain. This worked out this week, I closed out most of my short positions on Tuesday and then reopened some new positions after the small rally on Wednesday.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this strategy so far even though I am showing a paper loss, the amount of time I have until my long positions expire give me some time for the market to turn around and turn these losses into gains while continuing to earn premium. This market downturn has opened some buying opportunities as well, and I am keeping my cash allocation at 40% for something to open. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, critiques, or my math is wonky let me know.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional trader or financial advisor; I am sharing this for you guys to either learn something from it or poke holes in the plan. The stocks I have chosen are stocks that I like to trade, and I am not endorsing any equities whatsoever.

The PMCC strategy is one I\u2019ve explored but moved on from because it seemed like to me the rewards don\u2019t justify the risks. \n\nThe long call is a depreciating asset albeit with LEAPS theta is  VERY low. Definitely much cheaper and efficient use of capital then purchasing shares because your downside is capped at cost of premium and your cost basis gets lowered each week or month. \n\nFrom the high IV environment we are in selling monthlies you\u2019ll pretty much have your long call paid for in a year. So the position is dollar neutral correct? The downside is if the price drops you can keep selling calls but you\u2019ll lose the value of the long call. Breaking to the upside means you\u2019ll be buying back your CC and thus losing money, although the long will appreciate in value. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, the risk seems very low, but the rewards do as well. In a perfect world you\u2019d sell covered calls until a spike in price, then roll your long option for a profit. Is that correct or am I being too pessimistic? \n\nAlso, ideally if the underlying was rising we\u2019d sell puts, but that doesn\u2019t help this strategy does it? I guess you could replace your long with shares if you get assigned on a pullback and then sell CC against that, hoping for assignment, kinda like a modified wheel?\n\nEDIT- also, your long calls are super deep ITM. Do you have any particular reason for being that deep, it seems to me that a call closer to ATM would be much more cost effective thus increasing premium ratio while minimally adding to risk.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So the first part of your comment I understand, the risk is low but also the reward if the price of the underlying is not at or above my break even price of my LEAP at the time of expiration, that would be the benefit of holding long shares on stock. That's the chance I'm taking, I'm a betting in over 400 days that these stocks will continue to grow. If the underlying rises above your strike price of your short leg you can do a few things, close out both legs for a profit, close out the short leg for a loss, roll out the short leg for a credit, or roll out the short and long leg for a profit.\n\nThe second part on why I go so deep ITM is the deeper you go, say around .80 delta, the more the LEAP acts like 100 shares of stock. If you are more conservative, you can go around .90 delta, if you're not risk averse you can go lower to a .70 delta, it's all about risk tolerance.\n\nYou could sell puts against the underlying there's nothing wrong with that strategy to increase premium, but I'd recommend CSP rather than naked puts.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I mean if I was going to sell CC this is the way I\u2019d do it. One other thing I forgot to mention is that if your underlying drops too much your locked into bag holding just like stock, but with a finite expiration for it to rebound.
