Market open I was making a couple bucks on Tesla but down like $5 on Netflix and stupidly didn't take the time to calm down and think about it and sold off Netflix immediately... That call would have made me $500 in profit today... I only have $800 in my account.... that extra $1100 would have been an amazing return...

You have to remember that losses are part of the game.  If you\u2019ve never taken a loss, you haven\u2019t been trading very long.\n\nThe key is to trade small so that one trade doesn\u2019t blow up your account and stick to your max loss.  The key isn\u2019t the number of wins vs losses, rather it\u2019s the size of the wins vs the size of the losses.  The nice thing about options is you have a good amount of control over the probability of your trade winning.  So, unless you aren\u2019t trading often or doing lottery tickets, you should be able to get a decent win/loss ratio.  But the key is risk management.  You have to control your losses so they don\u2019t kill your gains and eventually your account.\n\nAs you learn to manage your risk, the nerves get better.  Having a good plan and sticking to it makes a huge difference since you should always know what to do regardless of what the market does.  And if your trades are proper sized, you can withstand the losses.\n\nI took a max loss this month.  While that sucks, I am still up and have a shot to making my monthly goal despite it.  That is what risk management and a solid plan do.  You won\u2019t get this overnight.

And my puts are devaluing quicker than my calls are increasing.  Which is normal for a small jump but with the jumps these stocks have been making I should have been profitable. \n\nWhen I do a straight call i get nervous because I know how quickly it can move and how quickly I can lose it all. So generally I stick to my strategy but again I am all flustered because it's not working as I am expecting and I don't understand why...

The Q4 -> Q1 tax credit decrease is the smallest yet so will have even less impact on sales than previous cuts. The Netherlands tax cut is a legitimate claim and deliveries will be heavily down sequentially in Q1. In Q4 deliveries in other European countries were sacrificed to meet Netherlands demand so overall European deliveries won't be down much, if at all.\n\nProposition 3: As has already been mentioned in this thread, California registrations lag deliveries by several weeks, if not a month.
