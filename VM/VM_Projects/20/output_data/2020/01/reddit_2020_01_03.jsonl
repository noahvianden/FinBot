{"title": "This Is The Chart You Need To Show Your Children And Grandchildren", "selftext": "Yogi Berra was quoted as saying that \u201cit\u2019s tough making predictions, especially about the future.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are times when one is able to at least obtain a probabilistic reading about the future, based upon an understanding of mass human sentiment and human psychology.\n\nIn fact, back in the 1940\u2019s, an accountant named Ralph Nelson Elliott identified behavioral patterns within the stock market which represented the larger collective behavioral patterns of society en masse. And, in 1940, Elliott publicly tied the movements of human behavior to the natural law represented through Fibonacci mathematics.\u00a0\n\nElliott understood that financial markets provide us with a representation of the overall mood or psychology of the masses.\u00a0 And, he also understood that markets are fractal in nature.\u00a0 That means they are variably self-similar at different degrees of trend.\n\nMost specifically, Elliott theorized that public sentiment and mass psychology move in 5 waves within a primary trend, and 3 waves within a counter-trend.\u00a0 Once a 5 wave move in public sentiment has completed, then it is time for the subconscious sentiment of the public to shift in the opposite direction, which is simply the natural cycle within the human psyche, and not the operative effect of some form of \u201cnews.\u201d\n\nThis mass form of progression and regression seems to be hard wired deep within the psyche of all living creatures, and that is what we have come to know today as the \u201cherding principle,\u201d which gives this theory its ultimate power.\n\nAnd, over the last 30 years, many social experiments have been conducted throughout the world which have provided scientific support to Elliott\u2019s theories presented almost a century ago.\u00a0\n\nBut, even before these more recent studies have begun to support Elliott\u2019s understanding of the market set forth 80 years ago, Elliott provided us with an extraordinarily bold stock market prediction.\u00a0 Allow me to present you with the following prediction made by Ralph Nelson Elliott in August of 1941:\n\n*\\[1941\\] should mark the final correction of the 13 year pattern of defeatism. This termination will also mark the beginning of a new Supercylce wave (V), comparable in many respects with the long \\[advance\\] from 1857 to 1929. Supercycle (V) is not expected to culminate until about 2012.*\n\nFor those of you that do not understand this quote, Elliott was predicting the start of a 70-year bull market in the face of World War II raging around him.\u00a0 Quite an amazing prediction, no?\n\nNow, the rally that Elliott was predicting seems to have gone well beyond his expectations from a timing standpoint.\u00a0 In fact, if we follow through with Elliott\u2019s original assessments, and we take into account the actual structure we have seen over the last 70 years, I believe the rally he was forecasting will last considerably longer than his expectations, especially when we now can fill in the wave structure of the rally he expected.\u00a0 You can see what I am speaking of on the attached chart compiled by Garrett Patten of Elliottwavetrader.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 [https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/202001/full-218eaee8c1261adf0336cb12c5c5c7ae2a163675.png](https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/images/charts/202001/full-218eaee8c1261adf0336cb12c5c5c7ae2a163675.png)\n\nSpecifically, what it tells us is that the market could very well be in the final stage of a multi-year rally, which in my work has an ideal target in the 4000 region.\u00a0 \u00a0But, as you can see from this much longer-term perspective chart, it even has potential to rise as high as the 6000 region in a blow off top.\u00a0 (I will have a much better idea of that topping target within the next year or so).\n\nYet, the main take away for those investing over the coming decade is that we are likely approaching a point in time where the market can enter into a multi-decade \u201ccorrection\u201d in wave \\[IV\\], as outlined on the chart above. \u00a0While that would likely be the next generational buying opportunity, it seems to suggest that the last half of the upcoming decade will result in a lot of pain for investors.\n\nAt a minimum, I would expect the next bear market would have us revisit the 1800SPX region in the second half of the new decade.\u00a0 So, enjoy the profits of this \u201clast hurrah\u201d over the coming several years, as we are likely setting up for a once in a century event, which can rival the Great Depression, as it is of the same long-term wave degree.\u00a0 Remember, while history does not exactly repeat, it certainly does rhyme.\u00a0 And, those that are unwilling to learn from history are certainly bound to repeat it. \u00a0", "id": "ejk57o", "created_utc": 1578078964.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Whatever", "score": 71, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05844038352370262}, {"body": "I\u2019m no economist but hasn\u2019t the defeatist event already happened in 2008-2009?

{"title": "War and Geopolitical crises can be Counterintuitive: Buy Calls", "selftext": "U.S. airstrikes in Iraq have killed one of Iran's most powerful generals, striking fear into the geopolitical realm. No one knows what exactly this means at the moment, but there is fear of escalating tensions in the Middle East, along with the potential for retaliation and further conflict.\n\nMarkets reacted accordingly as [oil and gold prices shot up](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/02/investing/oil-prices-iran-commander-baghdad/index.html) while the [stock market fell](https://www.wsj.com/articles/geopolitical-tensions-put-brakes-on-global-stock-rally-11578038726) and interest rates declined. Market prognosticators have an old rule of thumb that investors hate uncertainty more than anything, and there are few situations more uncertain than the threat of war.\n\nBut markets don't always care about rules of thumb, and uncertain situations don't always play out in stocks as many would have you assume. The relationship between geopolitical crises and market outcomes isn't as simple as it seems.\n\nIn the six months following the onset of World War I in 1914, the Dow fell more than 30%. Because the war basically ground the business world to a halt and market liquidity all but dried up, the decision was made to close the stock market that year. This lasted for six months, the longest such period on record. Making up for lost time, the Dow rose more than 88% in 1915 after it reopened, which remains the highest annual return on record for the DJIA. In fact, from the start of the war in 1914 until the war ended in late 1918, the Dow was up more than 43% in total or around 8.7% annually.\n\nWorld War II had a similarly counterintuitive market outcome. Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, setting off the war. When the market opened on September 5, the Dow shot almost 10% higher that day. When the attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor occurred in early December 1941, stocks opened up the following Monday down 2.9%, but it took just a month to regain those losses. When the allied forces invaded France on D-Day on June 6, 1944, the stock market barely noticed. The Dow rose more than 5% over the ensuing month.\n\nFrom the start of WWII in 1939 until it ended in late 1945, the Dow was up a total of 50%, more than 7% per year.\n\nSo, during two of the worst wars in modern history, the U.S. stock market was up a combined 115%.\n\nThe Korean War began in the summer of 1950 when North Korea invaded the South. That conflict ended in the summer of 1953. In that time, the Dow was up an annualized 16%, or almost 60% in total.\n\nU.S. troops were sent to Vietnam in March of 1965. The Dow would finish the remainder of that year up almost 10%. By the time the last of the U.S. troops were pulled out of Vietnam in 1973, the stock market was up a total of almost 43% in that time, or just under 5% per year.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis had the world on the brink of nuclear war in October of 1962 when the U.S. faced a standoff against Russia. The confrontation lasted 13 days. In that two-week period, the Dow remained surprisingly calm, losing just 1.2%. For the remainder of that year, the Dow would gain more than 10%. Veteran trader Art Cashin [tells the following story](https://ritholtz.com/2017/08/cashin-cuban-missile-crisis-north-korea/) about the advice he received from a seasoned trader during the Cuban Missle Crisis as he was worried about the impact on stocks:\n\n*Jack said \u2013 \u201cLook kid, if you hear the missiles are flying, you buy them. You don\u2019t sell them.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cYou buy them?\u201d I said, somewhat puzzled.*\n\n*\u201cSure you buy them!\u201d said Jack. \u201cCause if you\u2019re wrong, the trade will never clear. We\u2019ll all be dead.\u201d*\n\nThe terrorist attack on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001 saw stocks fall sharply, down almost 15% in less than two weeks following the tragedy. The economy was already in the middle of a recession at that point, and stocks were in a free fall from the bursting of the dot-com bubble. But within a couple of months, the stock market had made back all of the losses that occurred in the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nThe U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003. Stocks rose 2.3% the following day and finished up the year with a gain of more than 30% from that point on. Although it is important to note these gains were coming off the brutal 2000-2002 bear market.\n\nThe point here is the market's reaction to war and geopolitical crises can be counterintuitive. It's always difficult to know how investors will react to certain events because so much of the market's reaction to these events is context dependent.\n\nI have no idea what this Iran conflict will mean for the world at large, but even if you knew exactly what the headlines would be in the coming months on this issue, it probably wouldn't help you from an investing perspective. Markets don't always respond to geopolitical events the way you think.\n\n*Ben Carlson, CFA is the Director of Institutional Asset Management at Ritholtz Wealth Management.* *He may own securities or assets mentioned in this piece.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL; DR:\n\nWar ushers in 'rally round the flag' syndrome for the fucktards. \n\nAutists and gayboys must **Buy**.", "id": "ejmypd", "created_utc": 1578090718.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "I lost money today.
