I believe this company is highly undervalued and could sell for 1 Billion easy based on compacity and future contracts. PKE is both a growth company and dividend giant the earnings look strong and the balance sheet is clean 144 million in cash no debt. It is currently expanding the manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas. The facility expansion positions PKE to grow within its existing business. While PKE is actively seeking M&A candidates stated by CEO at Nedham Growth Conference January 15 2020.
