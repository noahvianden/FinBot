{"title": "Daily Recap - Tuesday, December 22, 2020.", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 22, 2020**\n\nStocks were mixed Tuesday as market participants weighed new concerns around the coronavirus against the approval of a long-awaited stimulus package in the United States. The Dow (DIA) fell 0.7%, the S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.15%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.5% today and reported a record closing high.\n\nDuring the weekend, the United Kingdom announced the discovery of a new strain of the coronavirus that is reportedly 70% more transmissible than the original strain. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific advisor to the UK government, said that over 60% of the new infections recorded in London were caused by the new variant. In response, more than 48 -including European allies- have imposed travel bans on the UK, with the duration of the ban lasting anywhere from a couple of days to months. \n\nHowever, with much yet to be discovered about the new coronavirus strain, the markets rallied after Washington finally passed a new $900 billion coronavirus package. The bill includes another round of direct checks to Americans, this time for only $600, enhanced federal unemployment benefits of $300 per week, and additional funds for small businesses and vaccine distribution efforts. The bill passed because some of the more contentious points of earlier stimulus negotiations \u2013 such as additional money for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses \u2013 were omitted from this deal. The [text of the 5,593-page bill ](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf)was released yesterday. Ian Shepherdson from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients, \u201cThe biggest single component of the new COVID relief bill is the re-funding of the Paycheck Protection Program, with a total of $284 billion. It worked -  and will work again - by offering loans to small businesses based on the size of their payrolls. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Justice Department sued Walmart (WMT) over its alleged role in the opioid crisis. The Justice Department alleges the company unlawfully dispensed the controlled substances through its pharmacies in America. Walmart operates more than 5,000 pharmacies in its stores around the country and noted it always empowered its pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions and said they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions.\n* JPM Securities raised its price target on Tesla (TSLA) to $788, the highest target by an analyst.\n* It was announced the NIO Day, an annual event where the company announces new vehicle launches and features, is scheduled for Jan. 9. Shares of NIO have been red-hot this year.\n* According to Reuters, people familiar with the matter have said Apple (AAPL) is moving forward with self-driving technology and are aiming 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle. The effort dubbed \u201cProject Titan\u201d has proceeded unevenly since 2014 but it seems with the recent EV hype Apple will be stepping up its efforts.\n* According to a new report, The global video gaming industry is expected to be worth roughly $159 billion in 2020. This surpasses the box office film / the movie industry revenue by an easy 4 times, AND almost 3 times the music industry has built up thus far. ( The music industry reached a $57 billion market in value). Keep an eye out for videogame stocks in the future.\n* Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $100 to $108 at Overweight. Stock currently around $88.\n* TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $200 to $215 Overweight. Stock currently around $200.\n* Cleveland-Clifs (CLF) target raised by Keycorp from $14 to $17. Stock currently around $13.50.\n* ArcelorMittal (MT) target raised by Keycorp from $23 to $28. Stock currently around $23 after recent monster run.\n* Nike (NKE) target raised by Argus from $140 to $165. Stock currently around $144.\n* Peleton with multiple target raises today after ripping more than 11% up after-hours. Consensus price target around $175 with BUY rating.\n* Paypal (PYPL) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $234 to $275 at Buy. Stock currently around $237.\n* uniQure (QURE) target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $53 to $61 at Outperform. Stock currently around $39.\n* Square (SQ) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $214 to $255 buy. Stock currently around $233.\n* Twilio (TWLO) target raised by Northland Securities from $340 to $390 Outperform.

{"title": "AAPL EV is good for Tesla", "selftext": "**Unless any of you guys think that another electric vehicle company is going to be able to produce higher quality cars at a lower cost than Tesla which I think is exceedingly unlikely, then all news of competitor electric vehicles should be treated as a positive. Here\u2019s why: **\n\nFor Tesla, **Dominating the electric vehicle market right now is far less important than hastening the transition to an electric automotive market.** Every electric vehicle that comes out , Especially if an Apple vehicle comes out, normalizes the concept and reality of electric vehicles for the American consumer. It makes them more comfortable with it. Big brand names with consumer trust like the legacy auto manufacturers and Apple instill confidence in electric vehicle purchases for the average American.  \n\n**Therefore, if tesla can retain the edge and remain the best electric vehicle manufactured at the lowest price, they stand up from facilitated American adoption of electrical transport.**\n\nCurrently, tesla enjoys that very same status. Tesla reigns supreme within the electric vehicle sector right now. I think that is likely to stay\u2026 \n\n- The manufacturing advances they are making with the model Y (casting machine) and the cybertruck, (folding chassis) and The new battery design, which is designed in order to enable very cheap, mass manufacturing, are unlikely to be challenged by any electric vehicle competitor from a cost basis. Tesla is going to source its own raw materials for batteries for the most part, whereas their competitors are going to have to buy from third-party. \n\n- unlike other car companies, Tesla doesn\u2019t have entrenched unions, it doesn\u2019t have colossal amounts of debt, it doesn\u2019t have an entrenched dealership network opposed to electric vehicle adoption.\n\n- unlike Apple and other electric vehicle start ups, tesla already has brand name recognition, a Pan-American repair and delivery network\n\n- Tesla technology lead to pack right now. People have been saying for years that a Tesla killer was on the horizon. Currently not exists. Tesla had the first mover advantage of moving from a luxury, to semi luxury, to main stream car in order to facilitate their growth. Other companies don\u2019t have this luxury, they have to produce a car competitive with the model Y and the model3 immediately, but without the strong internal engineering capacity while having to source parts including batteries and components from third parties. \n\n**I genuinely don\u2019t see a path to success for competitors outside of smaller niche market like small transport, vans, traditional truck designs, that sort of thing. I think Tesla has such a lead at the moment, that they are in the process of juicing the most out of capital expenses, their technology is so far ahead in terms of efficiency and cost, that they absolutely stand to benefit from competitor vehicles.**\n\nIn fact, I think the worst case scenario is that the entire auto sector ignores Tesla and continues business as usual, not normalizing electric vehicle ownership and letting Tesla be lord of a little kingdom rather than a prominent player in the entire auto sector.\n\nOne thing you guys need to keep in mind is that the current share price is, obviously, directly tied to future sales estimates. I genuinely think these are conservative. If the transition to an electric car market is hastened for the majority of Americans, and test the remains number one, the current number projections are exceedingly low.
