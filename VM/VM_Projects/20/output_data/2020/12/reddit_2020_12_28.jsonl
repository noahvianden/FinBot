{"title": "DD: Neo Lithium Corp : NLC.V:TSX", "selftext": "Hello Everyone, \n\nThis is my first post here, and I'm going to be explaining some DD on Neo Lithium Corp. You can read for yourself some of the information I have [here](https://www.neolithium.ca/index.php). **All of the $ values in this post will be in CAD - Canadian Dollars**\n\n**Fundamentals:** \n\nNLC is a lithium/lithium carbonate mining company headquartered in Toronto, and operating in Argentina. They are traded on the TSX, under the ticker symbol **NLC.V.** They are planning to operate in the Lithium Triangle, a region in Argentina/Chile/Bolivia **LOADED** with Lithium. Approximately 27% of the worlds Lithium supply is mined out from this region, and 12% of which is located in Argentina, where Neo Lithium Corp is operating. The area in which they operate is 100% owned by Neo Lithium Corp, which lowers external risks from competitors operating in the area. More info on the competitors will be included below in the risks section.\n\nNow, into the good stuff. Currently, NLC is priced at $1.56 / share (@close December 27th) with a market capitalization of \\~$187M. Yes, I know, the market cap is quite small compared to other big industrial companies, however this company is fresh and is showing great upside potential. Recently, they secured an \\~$8.6M deal with CATL, a massive Chinese lithium battery manufacturer, where 10.2M shares were sold to CATL. This is good news because it means that this company is getting noticed and people are buying in. NLC has a strong net cash position, approximately $35M, with little to no debt. The no-debt thing was mentioned in their investor presentation, but take it with a grain of salt. I believe they have little debt, but it would be foolish to assume that they are completely debt-free, however, they are in a great position cash-wise. Approximately 9% of outstanding shares are owned by company insiders, 40% belonging to institutional ownership, and the remaining 51% being publicly owned. The volume on average is \\~290k which is quite low, but is steadily increasing as the days go by. I expect to see a massive volume increase by the spring.\n\nSpeaking of the spring, the last peace to this puzzle is **to obtain the construction permit.** Once this permit is granted, the company will be fully operational and start generating revenue. As this happens, news will come out and with that, attract investors to this company. There is no definitive date where this permit will be granted, however I expect it to happen before Q3 of 2021. When this permit is granted, and revenue starts being generated, I expect the stock to rise by AT LEAST $3 by Q4 2021. The best thing about this is that the price currently is dirt cheap. Yes, I know, stocks that are priced this low are quite volatile and risky, however, it is up to you and your personal risk tolerance to decide if this play is right for you. I've included a risk section to detail every risk that could be potentially threatening to this company. Continuing on, you will be able to absolutely load up with shares on this company and by the time summer of 2021 comes around, you should be able to realize a large gain. Please note that this play will take anywhere from a few months to a year to actually make you some money, however if they are successful in operations then holding longer will prove more profitable.\n\n**MY POSITION (CURRENTLY) : 122 shares @ $1.50 / share.** I would like to say that while I would love to buy more shares, I'm a semi-broke college student with not a lot of money to invest, so I'm doing the best I can. I do plan on buying more shares with any money received over the holidays. Please refrain from making fun of my positions, lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TA:** \n\nRight off the bat I'm going to admit I'm no saint at Technical Analysis. I have watched quite a bit of videos, and gained a minimal amount of knowledge in TA. However, the rule of thumb stands, which is **to conduct your own TA**. This is simply DD.  I'm going to include my share of TA so that you guys can get an idea of how the stock is performing, however it's definitely best if anyone interested conducts further TA.\n\n[This](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=NLC.V) link is the link to the [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) graph of NLC. It includes the RSI, MA (50/200), and the MACD chart. Starting with the RSI, this stock fluctuates in between 50 and 70, and ATM is at 61.15. This is a decent rating as it indicates the security is neither underbought/overbought. It fluctuates periodically over 70, only to drop immediately after. It typically drops a few cents when it peaks above 70, but typically recovers once it hits \\~50.\n\nMoving on to the candlestick chart w/ moving averages. As seen in many other securities, the 50 day Moving Average acts as a support line, and you can see for yourself how it bounces after it comes close/touches the support line. Both moving averages are showing bullish symbols, so that is always good. \n\nLooking at the MACD indicator, as I'm writing this the EMA's are bottoming out after a bearish 2 weeks. I expect to see a nice, bullish 1-2 weeks coming. The indicator shows lots of people selling, but the number of which dropping each week, which to me is bullish. The candlesticks are currently showing a bullish uptrend above the support line but looking at how the stock has performed in the last 6 months I think it will continue to bounce, which is inline with what the MACD indicator is showing. \n\n**TA TL;DR:** Technical Analysis of this security is showing a bullish trend in the coming weeks.\n\n**Risks:** \n\n**Risk #1: Construction Permit Not Granted.**\n\nThe first main risk with this play is the construction permit getting blocked. This would be absolutely detrimental to the company as the future of NLC is entirely dependent on this permit being granted. There are 2 reasons that I believe would be the cause of the permit being denied\n\n* **COVID-19**\n   * Obviously, COVID-19 is a serious risk to tons of businesses this year. If COVID-19 continues it's rampage on the world we might see the local government in Argentina cancelling any concurrent operations. This could mean a delay in getting the construction permit, and if granted, a pause in the construction process. We also have to take into account that COVID-19 procedures in Toronto may cause delays in decision making/administrative related-decisions. Ultimately, most of the risk from COVID-19 is focused in Argentina.\n* **Argentinian government changes their mind.**\n   * I really do not see this happening, but I'm just including it juuuuust in case. Other companies already operate in this area and have been for quite a while, so the odds of this happening are quite slim. If it does happen, its not good news for NLC.\n\n**Risk #2 - Competition**\n\nThis is a risk that occurs in any industry. Competition is inevitable, and some may see it as a bad thing but I see an increase in competition as a sign of money to be made. Most of the worlds lithium is produced by \"the big three\": **Albermarle Corp, FMC Corp, and SQM (**Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile)\n\n* **Albermarle Corp** mines lithium in CHILE\n* **FMC Corp** mines lithium in ARGENTINA, however the lithium division of the company is a separate entity \n* **SQM** mines lithium in CHILE\n\nSince NLC is going to be operating in Argentina, the main competitor is FMC Corp. FMC Corp is a big company, however they operate in an area hundreds of miles away from where NLC is going to be mining. Also mentioned above, NLC owns 100% of the massive area where they operate, so it's almost safe to say that FMC Corp will not be a huge risk in terms of generating profit\n\n**Risk #3 - Switch from Lithium batteries to some other variant**\n\nThis risk is close to impossible from happening, however there's a sliver of a chance that some big, blockbuster switch from lithium batteries to some other compound occurs, where most lithium mining companies would be heavily impacted. I highly, highly doubt this is going to happen in the next 2-3 years, so its a very small risk.\n\nWell, this is the end of my DD.

Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner.
