{"title": "ABNB investment thesis - tell me where I am wrong", "selftext": "ABNB\n\n**What I like:**\n\n* As an upfront disclaimer, I\u2019m focused on investing vs. trading. I'm thinking about ABNB as a long-term hold, like 10-15+ years (think Amazon), so I'm not too worried about Covid and if anything I think the pandemic has given people a greater appreciation of travel/holidays/experiences - i.e. there is a real and underlying growing market for travel/holidays/experiences outside of things like Covid. By the way, I realise referencing Amazon as a benchmark is asking for trouble, but Craigs sent out an interesting email on the 9th of December showing that if you'd invested $10k in Amazon at the IPO then that $10k would be worth c.$2.5m today. Why? Probably because they 'cornered the market', had a strong brand and were well supported/capitalized. Is AirBnb that much different? I think the main difference is that Amazon have much more diverse earnings stream and larger addressable market, but even 10% of that growth rate is still quite attractive\n* ABNB have a large addressable market - $1.5T apparently. With \\~$5-6b of revenue in 2021, that would be less than 1% of their SAM (serviceable addressable market) of $1.5T. I\u2019m always a bit cautious/sceptical around calculations of SAM and TAM, but it is hard to disagree that it is a large market and that ABNB is probably taking market share and growing the pie\n* A very strong brand - 91% of all traffic to ABNB is direct to their website or unpaid. 91% is pretty impressive and very powerful (again, Amazon?)\n* Prospectus risks - having had some experience writing prospectuses, AirBnb's comments read more like standard boiler-plate disclosures. It is to be expected that their growth will slow by virtue of the law of large numbers, but none of the sub-points highlighted under risk section particularly worry me. For those actually interested in this post, best you read the risks section of the prospectus rather than me regurgitating them here. The two things that worry me most are (1) the unknown \u2013 what blows ABNB up? And (2) I\u2019ve overpaid and hence my returns will be moderated to the point where this isn\u2019t the best use of my capital in a relative sense.\n* Competition - look, it's not something I know enough about to be confident, but I think that is par for the course with tech companies. Who knows what Joe in Petone, Peter in Mumbai and Muhammed in Miami are doing in their mothers' garages but AirBnb do appear to have built their brand fast and turned their company name from a noun to a verb. Nobody has ever said \"I'm Hiltoning it this weekend\"\u2026 well maybe Paris does, but hardly a relatable reference point. I do think they'll face some competition around the edges (say, premium travel options, business, other) but the capital raised should help them invest to cement their position.\n* Their growth is relatively cheap - no need to fund large buildings and fit-outs/rent. I think they also have an opportunity to broaden their experiences offer and become a portal for experiences outside of accommodation... i.e. restaurant bookings, tours, etc.\n* Costs \u2013 without a huge amount of fixed overheads, the business does (and has shown that) it has the ability to moderate its cost base during periods of reduced demand.\n* Aging population and the rise of the tech-savvy \u2013 richer, old people are going to do what they've always done and book hotels, but the next generations are savvy and familiar with AirBnb's offer and concept. AirBnb are swimming with the tide here. The prospectus notes, \u201cWhile Airbnb is popular across people of all ages, we are particularly strong with younger travellers: as of September 30, 2020, the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the ages of 18 and 34.\u201d As the boomers roll-off, there\u2019s going to be plenty of millennials, gen-X, gen-Y and gen-Z rolling into ABNB\u2019s market. Only other comment I\u2019d make here, is that those within the newer demographics are fickle and tend to hop on the latest bandwagon as it emerges. I guess the question I ask myself here is, what could that new bandwagon be? And, if I knew the answer to that I wouldn\u2019t be writing this post! I am really struggling to see what could disintermediate or dissolve ABNB\u2019s relevance, but the limitations of my creativity are a serious handicap here\u2026 maybe in time we\u2019ll wake up, plug an IV in to get fed an optimal dose of nutrients, sit in a machine that moves our muscles and wear a VR helmet that connects us with everything. Sounds horrible to me\u2026 but in saying that, I didn\u2019t like the sound of Instagram much either.\n* Data - pretty clich\u00e9 observation, but there's got to be value in their data and ways to monetise it. At the current valuation, any upside is probably already captured, so I haven\u2019t attached a meaningful weighting to this.\n* Heavily weighted towards leisure travel, which is unlikely to be disintermediated by Zoom etc.\n* As a user \u2013 I have liked it. I have, and will, continue to use it over anything else when travelling internationally.\n\n**What I\u2019m unsure about:**  \nThe price I paid ($146)... and the fact that this IPO is effectively a massive transfer of wealth from existing shareholders who have funded the business to date (and taken real risk), to well-connected pigs that dine regularly at the trough with AirBnB's investment bankers\u2026 in saying that, the existing, pre-IPO weighted average share price was $6.77, so not much for them to complain about\n\n* Tied to the above, valuation \u2013 NB: high probability I may have mucked up some numbers. When there\u2019s so many zeroes floating around it\u2019s hard to keep track. At today\u2019s market cap of around $75b + $1b of debt the EV is around $76b. Assuming forecast revenue next year of around $5-6b, that\u2019s a forward revenue multiple of 15x. Eye-watering, but not entirely ridiculous in a relative sense in the current market (not to be construed as a view that current market pricing is rational/reasonable). Assuming ABNB could, say, get to 5% market share of their SAM of $1.5T, this would equate to roughly $75b in revenue, or 1x today\u2019s valuation. Rough numbers, but Amazon trades today at around 5-6x revenue. Time is of the essence here, but let\u2019s say it takes ABNB 15 years to get to 5% market share and $75b revenue and trades at \\~5x revenue. That\u2019d be a 400% return over 15 years. The math being:\n   * $75b EV today on $5b of revenue = 15x multiple\n   * $5b of revenue today grows at \\~20% p.a. over the next 15 years to $75b in revenue (for reference this is roughly equivalent to Boeing or Sony today - [https://fortune.com/global500/2020/search/](https://fortune.com/global500/2020/search/))\n   * At $75b of revenue in 15 years it trades at 5x revenue (a leap of faith), so an EV of $375b\n   * Annualised return (assuming no dividends, which are unlikely anyway) is only a 10-12%\n   * This is somewhat scary as 20% revenue growth isn\u2019t straight-forward and a 5x revenue multiple and 15 years may also be generous\n   * I guess this shows how important entry price is and why this is my biggest concern and why selling out and rebuying if it goes down and/or DCA down are going to be so important\n   * By the way, quite aware that this analysis is useful now in hindsight \u2013 but I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it had I not invested. So, question I have is whether it\u2019s better to sell and take my loss or go long\u2026 current sense is the former\n* Competition - I think ABNB is a trusted global brand, but is at risk from regional competitors. What do I mean by this\u2026 as a user, when I travel overseas I\u2019m going to use ABNB because I know it, but domestically I\u2019ll look at bookabach, TradeMe etc before booking. So I think you have to moderate ABNB\u2019s addressable market for regional/domestic competitors. It\u2019s probably not going to blow ABNB up, but it could eat away at their domestic travel growth and market share.\n* Growth strategy \u2013 for a company raising the amount of money it did, the growth strategy in the prospectus was pretty light and wishy-washy\n* Slowing revenue growth - I don't like the fact it's slowing, but it\u2019s still \\~30%. In saying that, hard to see it growing consistently at 30%+ over the next 10+ years given y-o-y revenue growth to 2019 was \u2018only\u2019 30%\n* Business travel risk from increased usage of Zoom etc.\n* Regulation \u2013 it\u2019s a bit of catch all but I do worry that the business\u2019 cost base expands with highly paid lawyers to manage the obligations within multiple jurisdictions\n* More minor risks, but I\u2019ll throw them out there for completeness:\n* One-off bad hosting experiences that create apprehensive potential hosts - you know the ones which hit the headlines where the poor host is standing outside watching Jock and his mates punch holes in the walls. A minor risk in the scheme of things, but a flurry of \\*\\*\\*\\*ty news stories may turn people off from becoming hosts.\n* I think there is a small risk that hosts try to disintermediate AirBnb and go direct or contract directly with repeat customers, whereby AirBnb don't get a cut - i.e. I went to 69 Knob Ave in Remuera last time, we had a good experience, I'll just contact Mrs. Knobette direct, but I think this is a very small risk and more domestic\n\n**So, where am I at?**\n\n* At the moment I\u2019m probably hoping \u2013 and that isn\u2019t a good investment strategy\n* The rough valuation numbers above don\u2019t fill me with a heap of confidence (I probably wouldn\u2019t have done them had I not invested, so a lesson nonetheless) \u2013 I think an ABNB investor can/will make better than average returns, but assuming returns are 15-20% p.a. on a good day, they don\u2019t really feel fair relative to the risk (still not bad, just not on a risk-adjusted basis). I think the only caveat/get-out-of-jail is that market pricing continues to go further away from fundamentals than it already is. Again, seems hopeful, but I\u2019ve been proven wrong over the last 10 years and can\u2019t see anything changing that in the near-term\u2026 but I guess that\u2019s the point\u2026 it\u2019s what you don\u2019t see that undoes an investment, rather than what you can reasonably predict\n* I haven\u2019t bet the house (and thankfully so) \u2013 so I guess I\u2019m still willing to gamble my $ on:\n   * Covid/vaccine recovery pushing the share price up;\n   * Higher/faster growth than expected; and/or\n   * Higher multiples;\n* I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll lose all my capital on this, but I\u2019ll probably pop it in the bottom draw where I keep my more speculative investments and forget about it for a while (much like I\u2019ve done with PEB, which has served me ok, albeit with plenty of dilution along the way)\n\nLooking forward to others\u2019 views.

{"title": "DD PSA: How to avoid getting fooled by a company like Nikola again", "selftext": "Alright, knuckleheads. I know this isn't school, so I'll try to make this easy to understand and impart some of my limited aCtUaL kNoWleDgE upon this community in return for all you've given me.\n\nNKLA happened, and NKLA will happen again. There's a million ways to slice, dice, and wife profits off a meme stock like that, but my favorite way to create a long forecast on a fast-rising techie company is to **look at the company's IP holdings**.\n\nCompanies (especially startups growing out of diapers and getting ready to shit the bed) have great incentive to patent anything and everything they can. Patents prove the company is working on R&D, hired competent people, and has legal chops hovering feverishly. It gives them license to wave their dick around in the market space. Nikola's IP portfolio can be likened to Trevor Milton's bulge: ^(it's) ^(tiny.)\n\nThere are three easy \"types\" of patents.\n\n1. Granted: \"real\". Legally sound. Valid for 20 years.\n2. Pending: not \"real\", can turn real, valid for like a year.\n3. Design: for design. Apple has many. Nikola needs none.\n\nNikola has like 9 patents (a minuscule amount for a company of its former stature) and almost all of them are design, or \"D\" patents. D patents are for Jonny Ive and the ghost of Steve Jobs' OCD. If a small company like Nikola or whatever goddamn meme stock you want to suck off this week has majority D patents, take a page out of Forrest's book and run. **You want a company with a history of turning pending patents into granted ones.** Even if it's a \"new\" company splooging all over the scene, I guarantee they've been producing IP for eons. If they haven't, that's a red flag big enough to cripple Lana Rhoades. If it breaks her, I fucking promise it'll break your margin account too. \n\nPatents should be\n\n1. of the same volume as comparable companies in your meme stock's size and market space and\n2. aligned with what the company says it's doing\n\nPatents are forward-thinking documents. Companies want them to be viable and maybe even cutting edge 5, 10, 15 years down the line. You know what doesn't stay current for that amount of time? The design of a semi. Vehicles get redesigned year-to-year and substantially about every 5. You know what Trevor Fuckton decided to patent? A bunch of useless design patents protecting the contours on his DOA load of gravity-defying shit. And guess what? His company is garbage. Patents are a huge tell. **Good news for you addicts: NIO has a normal-looking patent portfolio.** Are they good quality? I'm not gonna look. But maybe you can.\n\n**TL;DR since I know you want one:** My bidet's control panel is protected by more patents than Nikola has to its name. That's never a good sign. Do your dd.
