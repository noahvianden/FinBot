I'll summarize what I got out of it here, and try to put citations. I won't be summarizing the earnings presentation.\n\nThis will be interesting to look at and I'd love to hear some feedback before deciding whether or not to take a position! I'll also put my own opinions as well, as I frequent Kohl's for my Amazon returns. However, your guy's opinions would help me better form mine as I can only speak for the Kohl's I've visited around Los Angeles County. Hopefully, it's a diamond in the rough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Points from the PDF:\n\n* Sephora is to become Kohl's exclusive strategic beauty partner. (slide 5) [https://prnt.sc/vtuoza](https://prnt.sc/vtuoza)\n* Kohl's is trying to modernize their store experience and expand to become the most \"trusted retailer of choice for the active and casual lifestyle\". (slide 3) [https://prnt.sc/vtupme](https://prnt.sc/vtupme)\n* They believe this is a transformational partnership that'll help them significantly accelerate their beauty opportunities. (slide 3) [https://prnt.sc/vtupme](https://prnt.sc/vtupme)\n* They're hoping to become a beauty destination that's immersive, cutting edge, fully curated, and \"easy to shop\". There will be Sephora-trained beauty advisors. (From my experience being in Sephora numerous times with my lady, these people are pretty nice and helpful for the most part. Interesting to note.) (slide 4) [https://prnt.sc/vtuq7x](https://prnt.sc/vtuq7x)\n* They believe that there is \"minimal existing store overlap\", thus creating significant incremental opportunity. (slide 5) [https://prnt.sc/vtuoza](https://prnt.sc/vtuoza)\n* With respect to the in-store experience, they pretty much want to create a \"store-within-a-store\" type experience. (slide 7) [https://prnt.sc/vttb9d](https://prnt.sc/vttb9d)\n* With respect to the digital experience, Sephora will be the \"exclusive beauty partner\" on Kohl's website. Beauty Insider will indeed, be available here. (Beauty Insider is Sephora's loyalty program, and is used very frequently by many women) (slide 7) [https://prnt.sc/vtuqqj](https://prnt.sc/vtuqqj)\n* They also want to capitalize on their \"Omni capabilities\" - easy in-store pickup & curbside pickup.(slide 7) [https://prnt.sc/vtuqqj](https://prnt.sc/vtuqqj)\n* The economic structure is equal share in the operating profit of the partnership, which incorporates all expenses associated with managing the business and asset depreciation. (slide 8) [https://prnt.sc/vtur31](https://prnt.sc/vtur31)\n* Kohl's is hoping this partnership increases sales. They expect this to grow both gross margin as well as operating margin. Kohl's would own and manage the inventory, as well as fund capital expenditures to build out Sephora-designed shops. (slide 8) [https://prnt.sc/vtur31](https://prnt.sc/vtur31)\n* Sephora will curate assortments of 100+ brands across the makeup, skincare, hair, and fragrance niches. Sephora will also train beauty advisors employed by Kohl's. (slide 8) [https://prnt.sc/vtur31](https://prnt.sc/vtur31)\n* Kohl's wants this to also draw in new and younger customers. This would also fulfill Kohl's commitment to build a sizeable beauty business. (slide 5) [https://prnt.sc/vtuoza](https://prnt.sc/vtuoza)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My Thoughts on Kohl's Fundamentals:\n\nLet me preface this by saying I am a millennial, not a boomer, nor Gen Z.\n\nTo be frank, if you would have asked me a few years ago about Kohl, I would have told you that their store is crap. Nothing cool there. I'd lump it in the same category as ROSS, Marshalls, etc... Nothing too special. Cheap garbage, etc... But most importantly - not a \"cool place\" to shop.\n\n**This reflects my personal experience at Kohl's. Yours may differ or vary. I suggest you ask someone who frequents Kohl's, Sephora, or both for more information.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However, ever since Amazon started accepting returns at Kohl's - things have been significantly different.**\n\nWhen you return stuff on Amazon, you could pack your return into a box and drop it off at a drop off location. Or, you could initiate the refund online, then bring it into Kohl's. When you do it this second way, you don't need to package anything. You don't even need the original box. If you bring in your item without the original packaging, they will put it in a bag for you, and they will also give you a various in-store coupons to use, such as a 25% coupon (to try to get you to shop there).\n\n**A lot of people return stuff from Amazon at Kohl's.**\n\nThere's always, without exception, a line for returns whenever I go. Fortunately, this line moves pretty quick - but the foot traffic from working with Amazon to accept returns is absolutely immense.\n\n**After I return stuff, yes, I usually do browse around.**\n\nHowever, obviously Kohl's has a lot of space and a lot of offerings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My instinct is telling me that they'll keep reducing their offerings from their \"boring part\" of the store.**\n\nBy \"boring part\", I'm referring to the kitchen, dinnerware, cookware, appliances, and other non-clothing parts of the store. (Well, at least it's boring to me)\n\nLet's be honest here - to be frank I never shop these aisles, and I usually don't see that many people shopping there.\n\n**So in my opinion, that's excellent real-estate to build a \"store-within-a-store\" experience.**\n\nIt makes it more exciting. It makes Kohl's even more \"cooler\".\n\n(Note: I know it sounds weird, but by \"cool\" I mean like target, for instance. A lot of people my age \"love target\". It's just the experience in there.)\n\n**Yes, Sephora is \"cool\". Ask any girl you know if they'd rather buy their makeup/skincare/beauty items at Sephora vs Ulta vs Other Stores.**\n\nFrom my experience, Sephora has the significantly better experience. It's much more inviting, and women who shop at Sephora usually end up spending a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I've been in Sephora numerous times with my lady. I never buy stuff here, but I've always watched her spend an excessive amount of money. The Sephora experience does get you to buy buy buy.**\n\nI'm a straight male in his late 20's. I have an electrical engineering degree, and I run a few E-Commerce projects. I enjoy advertising, and I'd like to think I'm pretty passionate about business. That's why I go in with her whenever she goes shopping with me. (Just a little context about myself)\n\nYeah, I love the way Sephora lays out their stores. Besides how friendly the staff are and how \"proactive\" they are in trying to ask if you need help (because the customer is KING, or in this case QUEEN)... my next favorite part would probably be all the upsells that you see when you're waiting in line.\n\nTheir store, their loyalty program, and their experience is pretty damn good, if I may say so myself. It's pretty easy to shop, and their service is pretty good. I've asked my lady, and she says that she feels \"Sephora focuses a lot on making sure they maximize the order value of that customer's purchase\".\n\n**Hear me out here. What she's trying to tell me is that Sephora does \"audit\" or \"gauge\" customers to some degree. Here's what I mean by that:**\n\n* When you walk in the store, they usually ask you, \"Are you looking for anything in particular? Or are you just looking around?\"\n* \\^ If you're just \"looking around\" - everything looks enticing. You can try stuff, look at different brands, and they have all different price points for every customer. (A bit different now due to covid, but you get the point)\n* \\^ HOWEVER, if you're \"looking for something in particular\" - that means you're a customer with high intent to purchase. If their floor staff gauges that you're a customer with high purchase intent, you'll probably find yourself getting approached by a knowledgeable & enthusiastic sales person to help you out. **Yes, this is pretty cool. I don't know if they mention this explicitly \\~ but this has been the experience of my lady friend when I asked her to really analyze this. That passionate sales person will end up helping you much better, as well as (hopefully) convincing you to spend a bit more and have a better experience so you'll be back.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting point. One should note that they're always incentivizing you to buy more. **In other words, they've built their own community of people that are all interested in their products.** You walk in to buy something, then there's another sale a few weeks down the road, then there's another event another few weeks down the road, coupons, discounts, etc. - point being, they know how to make you shop and spend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Okay, let's talk about Sephora's app. I think it's relevant because Sephora does the shopping experience pretty damn well, and Kohl's would more than likely benefit from that in numerous ways.\n\n(Disclaimer: I don't use the app. I've made my lady, who is a Sephora shop-a-holic, give me the rundown - and I've reiterated to her to try to make it as unbiased as possible so that I could get an analytical perspective of it)\n\n* They've created their own version of a \"beauty community\" on the app.\n* Girls would go on there, and post about what they bought. What they recommended, upcoming stuff, etc. They're building conversation around certain products, launches, reviews and experience, and so forth.\n* \\^ That provides the **confidence in the specific brand in question**. I'd say that leads to upsells.\n* Also, because the app is so user friendly, it's pretty easy to end up clicking the buy button.\n* Overall, it's a good shopping experience that gets you to spend. Almost like \"virtual styling\" - in a sense. Yes, if you need help on the app, they will give you someone to help you.\n\n***On this note, Sephora has in-store pickup. I think that's the key right here - because otherwise I'd just say that \"why not buy it from Sephora's app instead\".***\n\nWell, a lot of girls actually do indeed use in-store pickup. (Well, a little bit less now due to covid, but it's still quite formidable)\n\n**My guess is that this would lead to much more foot traffic. This is a similar situation like how partnerning with amazon simply to accept returns already leads to a significant boost in in-store traffic. Plus, Kohl's incentivizes these customers to shop afterwards via coupon when you make your return. I'd only assume they'd do the same if you went in to the in-store Sephora. Don't forget, they are sharing the operating profit equally.** ([**https://prnt.sc/vtukar**](https://prnt.sc/vtukar))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Very interesting, indeed. Imho, this is added value for in-store shoppers. It differentiates Kohl's offerings from competitors. It'll boost foot traffic.\n\nIn addition \\~ hopefully, Kohl's also learns a few things from Sephora in terms of their website experience. Overall, I see this as a huge plus for Kohl's. Sephora is the more modern company \\~ it's always changing, always adding new brands, and trying to stay at the forefront of the beauty industry.\n\nIn my honest opinion, I think this is a huge win for Kohl's. More foot traffic. More shopping. And most importantly, more LEARNING. My guess is that Kohl's will be able to increase their average order values, customer loyalty, as well as customer experience by working alongside Sephora. In other words, now it becomes Sephora's incentive to help Kohl's accelerate in the years going forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, that's where my head is at so far.\n\nHopefully later on when I have more time, I can do a more in-depth fundamentals analysis on them.\n\nThere are probably a lot of other things I'm missing here, both good and bad - and so I hope that any discussions here could provide more insight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What's your experience at Kohl's?\n\n# What do you guys think about this partnership?", "id": "k4xqji", "created_utc": 1606867948.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "I was so happy about this. 3 weeks ago I got into KSS because I expected a climb due to holiday shopping.

{"title": "JPMorgan published the article that said Nikola\u2019s 25% dive is a good buying opportunity, let\u2019s look at that claim", "selftext": "***Papa Elon warned us on twitter about EV SPACs.***\n\nWhen someone tells you to buy a stock without a large DD to help their argument **do not buy.**\n\n **The 25% sell-off in Nikola on Monday represents a good buying  opportunity for investors as the company is no longer distracted by its  Badger pickup truck, JPMorgan said.** \n\n **\"We think this is a positive outcome for NKLA over the medium to  longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck  initiative,\" JPMorgan said.** \n\n**NIKOLA TRE**\n\n**Financial Times and Wall Street Journal** both confirmed the rumor that Nikola signed a contract with Romeo Power to use their batteries in the Tre \n\nThe Tre is the only way they have to get something on the road. They have NO working technology. They don't have a proper chassis, so the Tre uses an Iveco chassis. They have no battery so they are stuck white labeling Romeo modules in a horrendous pack design. \n\n So, a little background on battery design. When you are designing a battery you have two separate things that you have to account for: capacity, which gives you range, and voltage, which allows you to provide necessary power. You get both of these by connecting together cells. \n\n There are two different ways you can connect cells: In parallel, which increases capacity while keeping voltage unchanged, or in series which increases capacity AND voltage. An automotive scale battery will have cells connected in parallel and then those groups in series. \n\n The problem comes when, like Nikola, you are stuck using off the shelf modules: For these, the cell groups are already set for you and you are stuck with them. If it isn't what you need for your battery design, you're stuck. This is why custom battery design is crucial. \n\n In the case of Nikola, the Hermes modules they are using from Romeo Power have a capacity of 10 kWh and have a voltage of about 100 V when topped off.  To power their truck, they need 800V, so that's 8 modules connected in series. \n\n But this sets the capacity for them: 8 modules of 10 kWh each comes out to 80 kWh. While that is a great number for the passenger vehicles that Romeo presumably designed these modules for, it isn't nearly enough for a semi truck. The Tre needs 720 kWh \n\nSo they need 72 Hermes modules. But they can't just put them in series or the voltage will be 7200 Volts, far too much to be safe in an EV. So it is impossible to properly design a battery pack using these modules, and Nikola was forced to improperly design one. \n\n**NIKOLA TWO**\n\nIt has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph \n\nNikola Two For those who don't know, that's the two trucks that they had Bosch design and build for them a couple of years ago. \n\nHe claimed that it could do 0-60 in under five seconds, when anyone could see it took at least 10 seconds. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb_logo)\n\n1. The range extender power was dramatically reduced. \n\n2. The battery was made smaller, which not only decreases electric range but also available power.  \n\n3. Nikola most likely replaced the power cells of the One with energy cells in the Two.  \n\n4. They replaced the two speed transmission with a single speed.  \n\nTwo speed gearboxes are hard, so Nikola just dropped it. Now, you would be able to make up for the loss of the second gear by just cranking up the power (this is Tesla's approach) but instead Nikola REDUCED the power. The result is this hapless machine that can't go on the road. \n\nNikola spent two or three precious years making an utterly failed design that they can't do anything with except creep around the parking lot with guests while they shout above the howl of the radiator fans.  \n\nThe truck is worthless. Completely road unworthy, by their own admission. It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph. No wonder it's parking lot only. \n\nThere is ONE time we did see the Two driving kind of fast. It's in a video called, predictably, \"Nikola Two in Motion\". The video description is almost a word for word copy of that of the famous video of the One rolling down the hill. \n\n**TLDR:  Nio was trading at 7 dollars with actually technology and vehicle sales earlier this year, so nikola should be valued at penny stock status.  just my opinion due to risks of being** ***delisted due to defrauding investors.***\n\n***^(Disclaimer:  Above information was gathered from reliable sources, likely those whom provided short sellers information regarding Nikola.

{"title": "Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.", "selftext": "Image:\n\n[Root](https://preview.redd.it/8eu1y40uhs261.jpg?width=977&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=874bd5b0445835ea5333b36d153ed8d7fdf23f62)\n\n  \n\n**Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.** \n\n1) **Develop software for Grid for trading electricity** \\- \n\nName is \u201cAutobidder\u201d. The grid you\u2019re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn\u2019t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)\n\nTesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You\u2019ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **\u2013** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you\u2019ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you\u2019re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. \n\nSince Sun doesn\u2019t shine at night, and sometimes it\u2019s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla\u2019s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla\u2019s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla\u2019s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage \u2013** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you\u2019ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house that doesn\u2019t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. \n\n4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs \u2013** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It\u2019s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it\u2019s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who\u2019d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that\u2019s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they\u2019re building from scratch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that\u2019s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it\u2019s laughable generally to even think something like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make our own business software\u201d. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don\u2019t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   \n   \n \n\n**6)** **Selling Insurance Products \u2013** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance \u201can auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business\u201d. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you\u2019re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They\u2019re currently offering it in California only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines \u2013** As per Elon, he doesn\u2019t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they\u2019re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it\u2019s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They\u2019ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn\u2019t know anything about vaccines? Well, he\u2019s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac \u2013 a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   \n   \n \n\n**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles \u2013** Oh no\u2026Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren\u2019t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they\u2019re building. Don\u2019t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories \u2013** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn\u2019t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you\u2019ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla\u2019s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn\u2019t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won\u2019t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   \n   \n \n\n**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) \u2013** So we\u2019re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you\u2019re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla\u2019s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn\u2019t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with \u201cbetter chip\u201d next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla\u2019s range doesn\u2019t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let\u2019s not even talk about compute\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- \"Tesla Dojo\"** **-** So this is something the industry hadn\u2019t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   \n   \n \n\n**12)**  **Mine lithium \u2013** Hold your horses, it\u2019s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they\u2019ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they\u2019ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they\u2019ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries \u2013** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They\u2019re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won\u2019t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla\u2019s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won\u2019t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.\n\n**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.**", "id": "k5axun", "created_utc": 1606921824.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\"Short Tesla\"...\n\nFamous last words", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Aren't all your bullet points positive for tesla? haha are you trying to confuse the hedge fund bots or are you Gordon Johnson?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "If Gordon and I ever shook hands, we\u2019ll both disappear.

{"title": "SNOWflake's business explained, no jargon", "selftext": " SNOWflake earnings come out today! Regardless of results, I want to try explaining what SNOW does in layman's terminology so everyone can have an understanding.\n\nI work at a Fortune 100 company, leading a tech team. I've seen a lot of companies start investing in SNOWflake to scale their digital and analytical capabilities. Here's a summary of what they do:\n\n\u00b7 Snowflake solves for a really important problem in Corporate America's IT, where IT is constantly under pressure to deliver the most value with the least amount of work. \n\n\u00b7 Here's an analogy for what SNOW does - imagine you had important customer data that will allow you to figure out who are the most profitable customers (so you can tell your sales reps to focus on those leads first). However, that data is spread amongst multiple tables in different file formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF. You need a simple way to consolidate that data in order to make sense out of it. SNOW enables that - we can take data from multiple sources such as big cloud platforms like Amazon web services and Microsoft, and combine it with internal on-premise data so we can have one consolidated structured / semi-structured data set so all your data scientists can understand how one data point (e.g., age, education level) correlates with profitability.\n\nThis is why [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com/) and Warren Buffet invested in SNOW, because SNOW makes life easy, enable all the analytics that corporations are looking for, and allows partners like Salesforce to overcome any internal IT resource constraints that they are selling their services to. The buzzwords you all hear about from Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, are all reliant on having the right data infrastructure in place. Regardless of how earnings today, this is a long term play if you believe that all corporations are investing in this space. Earnings come out today! \n\nHope this helps, I'm curious if others have better analogies or simpler ways to explain the business!\n\nEdit position : my cost basis in SNOW is $28,901", "id": "k5cz1t", "created_utc": 1606927882.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "PLTR is trying to do similar things but they are focused on government clients.
