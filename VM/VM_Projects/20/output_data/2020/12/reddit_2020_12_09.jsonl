{"title": "Struggling with Options trading", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been trying to trade options for the past 6-7 months now. In the beginning I was just getting my feet wet with learning basics like the Greeks, what calls and puts actually mean, spreads and iron condors. I\u2019m at a point where I fell like I understand the definitions very well. I\u2019m having a tough time with my technically analysis and decision making. Today I did two stupid things. I had a put debit spread open for Apple because from what I saw on the daily chart it looked overvalued and I figured it would drop. Today it went to up over $125 which was over my stop loss and I panicked and immediately sold that spread. I was still in panic mode and feared a rally so I immediately bought a call debit spread. Well turns out my initial assumption was right and apple ended up falling to 121. I just feel like I\u2019m making dumb mistakes and getting my head about where to enter and sell. The point of this post is I\u2019m just looking for some advice and tips that you guys have used if you\u2019ve been in a similar situation before. I don\u2019t want to quit trading but days like today make me question if I have the right judgment for it to be worth it long term.

I warned him against it but he went in anyway and lost 90 percent on his picks. He had not retired yet, when he did last year, he asked me to take over managing his IRA account. I have been investing for him. It's not that I am a Wall Street whiz-bang but I feel like I won't be as brash as he would be so I told him I would. He sends me ideas he gets from his different stock tip newsletters that he buys. I mostly talk him out of investing in those things (he really wanted Beyond Meat and I felt it wasn't a great company for example a little while back). He wants to be very aggressive. He hears about all these people who bought xy or z stock in xy or z year and now they are millionaires. He thinks that will be him but I feel like he doesn't really have time for that, he is on a fixed income and he can't gamble what little he has at this stage of his life. We might need this money to take care of him. It is very hard. I had a financial planner helping us but my dad wanted the planner to just give him crazy stock tips. That's not really what they do. I am slowly moving his money into bonds (he has about 10 percent bonds now, and I am aiming for 50 percent bonds in the future) and index funds. I do this as I pull out profits from the stocks I choose for him. I picked a variety of value, growth and tech stocks. I never invest this way with my own money but it seems to be what my dad wants to do. I've lucked out getting him some good stocks - NIO, PLTR, QS, QUBT that have had nice returns. For the most part when a pick makes 20 to 25 percent, I sell all or part of it and move the gains to bonds, cash, gold or index funds for him. (CVS, AMEX, AMD, SPOT are some I did that with. But no matter how well I do with the picks - he thinks, why didn't I just put all of it in NIO or whatever happens to take off. Like I should always be doing better and he's not a millionaire yet so it isn't right. I try and explain, when I bought NIO, I didn't know that was the one pick that would do 200+ return in a few months. Hind sight is 20/20. It is a very hard situation. Get help!

Then watched it hit the resistance at $600 and come back. I repurchased at $615, triggering a wash now at $641. And it fell to $605 right after. Now it\u2019s around $609.\n\nI know TSLA is higher value, so it will fluctuate more than a few dollars at a time. I already realized that maybe I should have just bailed and saved myself the stress, but it is what it is. This is actually the second time this happened this quarter already. Last time I ended up holding for 2 months and sold for +25% in the end once balanced with that first wash sale.\n\nThe real question, where do we see this going? I know the bulls and bears are fighting, but realistically where do people see this going?\n\nAs a short term trader, I\u2019m thinking I want out no matter what by Friday the 18th.
