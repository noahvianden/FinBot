I reckon this is just the start.\n\n**UPDATED INFO:  CISA ISSUES EMERGENCY DIRECTIVE TO MITIGATE THE COMPROMISE OF SOLARWINDS ORION NETWORK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS** \n\n[https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network)\n\n **Emergency Directive 21-01** \n\n[https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/)\n\n*Someone asked me to provide a simple description of what this SolarWinds hack is all about. So for anyone who is confused by the technical details, here's a thread with a simplified explanation of what happened and what it means.*\n\n*The maker of software that is used in the highest echelons of gov, including the White House and NSA, was compromised by attackers who slipped malicious code into the software maker's trusted code without the software maker knowing it. The code got distributed to its customers*\n\n*That malicious code, once it infected customer systems, opened a backdoor into those systems and contacted the hackers to let them know the door was open for them to surreptitiously enter those systems and begin stealing sensitive data on those networks.*\n\n*The hackers did this back in March and their activity was only recently discovered - this means they have been inside gov systems all these months stealing data and spying on gov workers without anyone knowing until now. They also infected telecoms and other company networks.*\n\n*Here is a list of some of the customers who use the software made by the software maker  (their name  is SolarWinds). All of these were potentially compromised.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yf1rx6ku9561.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3fbca6fe66edb931cea54c7735e71c7ad7b166e\n\n[https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1338389130951061504?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1338389130951061504?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\n\n*SolarWinds has hundreds of thousands of clients in all; it said in a Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure on Monday that as many as 18,000 of them were potentially vulnerable to the attack.*\n\n*Both* [*FireEye*](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) *and* [*Microsoft*](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/) *detailed the flow of the attack. First the hackers compromised SolarWinds' Orion update mechanism so that its systems could distribute tainted software to thousands of organizations. The attackers could then use manipulated Orion software as a backdoor into victims' networks. From there, they could fan out within target systems, often by stealing administrative access tokens. Finally, with the keys to the kingdom\u2014or large portions of each kingdom\u2014the hackers were free to conduct reconnaissance and exfiltrate data.*\n\n*This sort of so-called supply chain attack can have dire consequences. By compromising one entity or manufacturer, hackers can undermine target security efficiently and at scale.*\n\n**If you're still reading this bullshit italics then congrats autronaut. This is where it actually gets interesting.**\n\n*The extent of the damage is also difficult to get a handle on because Orion is itself a monitoring tool, setting up a bit of a \"who watches the watchers\" issue. For that same reason, systems also grant Orion trust and privileges on user networks that have value for attackers. Victims and potential targets must consider the possibility that these attacks* [*also compromised*](https://twitter.com/mubix/status/1338502543635329028) *much of their other infrastructure and authentication mechanisms using Orion's pervasive access. The extent of the exposure at US government agencies is still unknown; the revelation that DHS was impacted as well didn't come until Monday afternoon.*\n\n**I'm just a humble lurker but this sounds like we haven't even seen the tip of the long dicking that SWI received.**\n\n*The White House National Security Council, which reportedly held an emergency meeting on Saturday, said via spokesperson John Ullyot on Monday that it is collaborating with CISA, the FBI, and the intelligence community to respond with \"a swift and effective whole-of-government recovery.\"*\n\n[https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-commerce-treasury/](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-commerce-treasury/)\n\n**Like I said earlier, I'm not an expert, but this situation is not going to improve for SWI any time soon.**\n\n**Cleary this isn't advice and as always, do your own fucking homework.**\n\n1/15/20 17.5P - all aboard the autistic express.", "id": "kdedm0", "created_utc": 1608005148.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "lol, i tried to call in for tech support at work today because of their breach.  my call went to a recording stating all systems were down and to try again later.  i fking bought puts after i hung up.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "he just said he BOUGHT puts...", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "reading comprehension level: retard", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "He belongs in here", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12106607854366302}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1750706434249878}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11636354774236679}, {"body": "Oof", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17092560231685638}, {"body": "Still learning to read too eh", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14346565306186676}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04956478625535965}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4644470512866974}, {"body": "I'm gonna go out on a limb here and speculate that between now and last March, some Russian hackers and their buddies also bought puts.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.441916286945343}, {"body": "So PLTR to the moon??????", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Obviously", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10303954035043716}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08518248796463013}, {"body": "You idiot.
