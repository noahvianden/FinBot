Luckily we aren't close to that state yet, but today was a start.  Hopefully this doesn't happen again actually. \n\nEssentially yes, there's a major problem with Tesla because it has the very unique combination of high options volume + high short interest + heavy upside call buying (call skew is abnormally high vs put skew). This makes it a receipe for disaster for market makers if we start going up through the short call strikes. Other names usually don't have that triple combination. If you look at the Tesla vol curve, you'll see it is a way different shape than typical names like AAPL for example. \n\nTo give you some perspective, and this is an approximation, but if quoting a name like BAC, a MM usually can retain say X% of the initial edge. Quoting a name like TSLA, you'll be lucky to retain 0.2X% of the initial edge. That shows you how hard it can be.

This analogy works in about half a dozen ways.\n\nThe roulette operator is a Union employee of the casino, it's not her money.

If they payout they payout, the cash cart comes around with more chips. Market makers neither bet against the players nor with them as a hedge. They just take the bets, it's not the end of the world. People will give them more Capital, either the government or the institutions.\n\nThe table pays a big jackpot. People get their picture taken with a big check and more people come to the casino. They make it all back eventually. Paying WSBGod 1 million in TSLA call money means that 200k people see it on r/all, and a new casino full of traders comes to YOLO their second mortgage. There is a sucker born every day, but outlier million dollar losses happen once a month.\n\nRoulette has a large house edge. If they spin ten times, payout twice, the bets collected from the other 8 rounds means there's still more cash in the drawer than at the beginning of the day. Market makers can afford to pay the losses because 78% of options purchased expire worthless. They take that 5% edge and wherever you buy a put that expires worthless, their loss cushion gets a little bit bigger.\n\nA casino doesn't have just one roulette table.

It's not just for delta hedging, but there's actually bullish information in the call buys. Market makers can't just set the vol whatever and have their inventory be whatever at all times. Just like Vegas can't set some ridiculous line like Lakers Hawks with Hawks favored -3.\n\nOtherwise imagine a situation (extreme I know but underlines my point) where the whole world only buys Tesla calls.

{"title": "Just a reminder...", "selftext": "Social engineering requires the correlation of great amounts of constantly changing economic information. Therefore, a computerized data-processing system was necessary to race ahead of the society and predict when society would arrive ready for capitulation. All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Therefore, the objective of economic research, is to establish an economy which is totally predictable. In order to achieve a this, the low-class elements of the society must be brought under total control. The quality of education of the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class is incomprehensible.\n\nTo use the method of shock testing in the economy, the prices of commodities are dropped and the consumer reaction is monitored. Then, the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animal with its reins under the control of a sophisticated bookkeeping system. Eventually, every individual comes under computer control through the system\u2019s knowledge of personal consumer preferences.\n\nIt is most interesting that, by observing economic modes by which the public tries to run form their problems and escape from reality, it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination of created events which will bring about a complete control and subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy.\n\nInflation is caused by printing money beyond the limit of the gross national product. This creates a false sense of confidence in the consumer, and we must eventually resort to war to balance the account. War is the act of destroying the creditor, and politicians are publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience.\n\nObjectives: keep the public ignorant, create preoccupation, limit public organization, attack the family unit, give less cash and more credit, enforce social conformity, execute proper timing, maximize control, collapse the currency, destroy the faith of the American people in each other.\n\n\\- Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars (1979)\n\nedit: this got more upvotes than my post in r/conspiracy haha I love you guys", "id": "g11pjh", "created_utc": 1586852505.0, "score": 141, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "This is a great read for anyone interested.

{"title": "Why nothing matters right now", "selftext": "It seems to me that whether you are a bank that reports earnings down 70%, a rideshare company that will be going on 3 months with no customers, or a retailer that has 0 customers coming into your stores, your actual business model and how much it has been hurt does not matter as of the last few weeks. Maybe it did when the market took a big hit in mid-March, but now, everyone is going up, whether it makes sense or not.\n\nWhat we got today with JPM was a validation that even when a hypothesis of how much a business can be hurt is confirmed by it's earnings, that doesn't matter. Some dickhead from Morgan Stanley this morning on CNBC said \"investors are pretty much just writing off 2020.\" Really? So earnings don't matter at all? The balance sheet damage that 2020 will cause doesn't matter at all? The truth is, no one is doing technical analysis to backup their investments. I wish these assholes would just admit that their entire premise and returns over the last few weeks were driven by the fed and Uncle Sam throwing them a lifeboat (and driving down interest rates so much that there's nowhere besides the stock market for money to go).\n\nBack to why nothing matters for now....It seems to me like everyone is getting a hall pass because \"we are going to open again soon.\" All the math nerds and economists saying growth will be down by this % or unemployment will get up to that %, it doesn't matter. All that seems to matter is that this will be over soon. That 1 variable seems to be all this comes down to: we are going to open back up. \n\nHowever, when we do re-open, there are a few potential outcomes: 1. Things go well, coronavirus doesn't spread again, economy turns around. 2. Things go poorly, the disease spreads again, and we reset. 3. Disease spread isn't an issue, but consumers are cautious, and spending habits take a long time to get back to normal.\n\nWhat I believe will happen before this is that pretty much every state with big cities (and Democratic governors) will push back on Trump when he says to re-open. CEOs of large companies (especially in tech) will tell employees to stay home longer. \n\nAs a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, I just have a hard time believing re-opening will go smoothly. And if you're a restaurant or a retailer and you re-open, but no one shows up, you're actually worse off than you'd be if you just remained close. Either pushing back the open or letting it happen and fail will move the market downward.\n\nSo until the opening date is announced, pushed back, and when the opening succeeds or fails, I think we'll keep seeing crazy things in the market. I'm betting on that re-open failing or turning into a political debacle. From a consumer standpoint, we are nowhere near ready for the mass testing, therapies, etc. that will drive a successful open and/or give people confidence to go out in public. \n\nCurrently 5/1 SPY and Uber puts, will likely push out expiration.

{"title": "Margin Call - Need advise", "selftext": " \n\nI had opened an Iron Condor last week on $TSLA expiring 5/15. The price went up so I closed out the short put for profit leaving me with the long put & call and the short call.

Yesterday morning I rolled the 2 long calls into a single June 19 580C for a credit. Not sure what I was thinking and the order should never have gone through since I didn't have the margin for that. But it did go through and then $TSLA promptly shot up to mock me.\n\nAs expected I woke up today to a margin call email they need $15K to cover the margin now. As of right now if this position is liquidated will I lose $7K (current market value - Long June 580C = 13K, Short May 600C x 2 =20K) . I'm thinking I can sell the June Call contract for 2 May 15th Calls in an attempt to reduce the margin requirement and then let it play out from there.

{"title": "The Corn-spiracy: Resurrection of the Corn", "selftext": "Alright guys, I know y'all don't talk too much about commodities, but I think I found the play of a lifetime. Let's get right to the point: I am long CORN.\n\nLet's start with the facts:\n\nCorn is used to make ethanol. You know who needs ethanol? Literally everyone, stupid. All the gas you waste \"racing\" your lowered mid 2000s honda civic with glass packs is at least 10% ethanol. Ethanol helps your engine run clean, burns more efficiently, and reduces emissions. If you just thought to yourself, \"Huh, no wonder the US subsidizes corn,\" then good, I'm glad you're with me. You know who ELSE just thought of this too? China. Fucking China, and they have much more buying power than the 1k your daddy let you play around with. China decided that even though they hate capitalism and donald pumperino, they do like living, and its time to burn oil a little cleaner around there. Long China? Long CORN. And guess what? You're in luck because CORN and CFD are the new SPCE, literally and figuratively. If you weren't aware, the aerospace industry uses ethanol based fuel, so if you're long SPCE, then you're long CORN too.\n\nRight now, US corn futures (CFD) are incredibly cheap, and the premiums go for even cheaper. For my fellow RH users, Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN) is the cheapest it has ever been, with every single OTM premium selling for cents on the dollar. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"This guy's name is raisinbrantflakes so he must be long BRAN.\" Well guess what, you're fucking wrong, I've been long corn way before you got your little bitch free stock on robinhood. Bran fucking sucks, and if you think bran is better than corn, you can fuck right off. Anyways, back to the facts.\n\nIf you look at the historical data, US corn futures always rise in the event of a recession. CFD skyrocketed in 08/09 as well as 2011, staying pretty high up there during the Obama administration. Corn inverses downward volatility, and guess what big guy? We are ready to POP again baby. Take a look at all the POPS on the five year chart for CORN. You see those POPS? Fucking straight up after months, if not, years of a downward trend, and we haven't had a POP for a long ass time. Like I said, I've been long CORN for years, and yeah I'm losing money, a lot. But those POPS have easily hedged my positions. Due to CORN, I have been able to retire at the ripe age of 94. Take THAT wsbGOD.\n\nWhere's that lizard that predicted SPY? Feed that fucker some corn and watch what happens. And for all you Elon Musk dick-riders, he burns way more ethanol than he saves. ;)\n\nTL;DR:\n\nCORN $13c 5/15 for unlimited tendies!\n\nLiterally can't go tits up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7k0mkx9rqss41.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5aa58f7a4e98cfa6a2f3089226f52b083305eb66", "id": "g16wc6", "created_utc": 1586875852.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "CORN is what my wife's boyfriend uses as a vibrator on her", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Tell your wife's boyfriend I said hello.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for saying hi!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26783400774002075}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2939835488796234}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3885376453399658}, {"body": "You misspelled \"advice\" on your sign, but shit this looks like it's about to Pop to me.

I've been saying for the past 5 years that ethanol is one recession away from imploding.\n\n35% of all corn in the US went to make ethanol, huge amounts of corn, 1 of every 3 rows for your autistic visual learners.\n\nCorn prices were/are held up by the ethanol industry and ethanol producers were already operating on negative margins when producing ethanol -$0.01 to -$0.02/gallon produced. So how were they in business???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDried Distillers grains, (the leftover after you have fermented all the starch). DDG was/is trading at a premium to corn on a ton/bu basis. The saying goes, ethanol keeps the lights on and DDGS keeps you green.\n\nEthanol prices are completely dependent on the price of gas, as oil tanked so did ethanol. Of the 10 plants I call on all are at or below %50 capacity and will likely go bankrupt in the next 6 months.\n\nThis is not much different than in 08-10 when several plants went under and Valero + Green Plains bought up the plants for pennies on the dollar. Same thing is likely to happen again in the next year.\n\nOn top of this, US is sitting on 60+ days of ethanol demand and \\~12 months of corn usage. For corn to come up it would take 5+ years of terrible harvest for the price to get back to $3-4/bu.\n\nAlong with being a scientist in the fuel ethanol industry, i also farm 300 acres of corn in the midwest, small peanuts. I say this in relation to the cost of seed, I pay upfront for seed in september for the following year and receive a 15% discount. guess how many neighbors have the money to pay for seed for the following year??? No they buy it on credit right before planting and pay interest until they sell to market at harvest to pay for their \"bought on credit\" farming equipment.\n\nSure you could make the argument, now that corn is so low, a bunch of farmers are going to go bankrupt so there will be less corn. Wrong, the small farms are being bought up by huge plantations who have capital and will over produce thus driving the price down further.\n\nI'm shorting Corn (actual cost/bu) and see it dropping to \\~1.50 to 2.00 EOY.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "What are your thoughts on biofuels for the next decade?

{"title": "April 14 Market Analysis - Canadian Names Edition", "selftext": "I write these up daily over on r/investing and someone mentioned people would appreciate here so enjoy.\n\nI have mentioned a couple rules over the past posts.  Last week I noted not to mess with the Feds who have a money printing machine to keep the stock market afloat.  In my [post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g0qgbm/market_analysis_april_13_canadian_names_edition/) I talked about riding momentum.  Today\u2019s lesson which many of you probably know - **the market is irrational**.  SPY was up 3% today putting it at August 2019 levels, close to October 2019.  Think about that, with tens of millions unemployed in Canada and the US, many companies closed, the stock market has only gone back 6 months, which is still miles above where it was a year prior.  Personally I chalk this up to two things:  1. People don\u2019t see this as a true recession and believe businesses will just hit the ground running when this is over; and 2. Fed throwing money to solve problem short term.  Both could be true and theoretically we could just be propped up, even if we start seeing terrible financials over next 3-6 months.   Before my analysis for today, I realized I talked broad strokes without identifying all the companies I am watching.  So I will provide a list of companies I am watching and then my analysis on the day.  Note:  I watch SPY, Gold, GDX, and USOil to get an idea of general market movements. \n\n**Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy\n\nOil is going to test the low ($19.25), especially after a brutal -7.5% today.  From a technical standpoint \u2013 4 hour RSI close to oversold, $19.25 will be right at bottom of daily Bollinger Band.  If I knew nothing about the current environment, I would look at that chart and say $19.25 is a good bottom fishing play, meaning I would buy around $20 for the psychological hold, $19.50 and just below the break at $19 expect the bulls to show up and protect that support.  With both a supply and demand issue for oil, it\u2019s a risky play.  Despite that, most names were only down between 0.5% and 2% with only Husky being down 5%. \n\nPeople may be wondering why the oil names didn\u2019t fall much today besides a couple percent.  Others may wonder why I am playing oil in this environment?  Why am I currently holding over 20,000 shares of MEG?  Isn\u2019t that super dangerous and clearly not working right now?  Yes to all of that.  Personally I see two factors at play here.  One, what is priced in?  Here is what we know \u2013 short term both supply and demand are facing issues.  Storage tanks are filling up, supply has been cut but people say not enough to meet the reduced demand.  So the question is, what have people priced in?  If you look at the fall on some of these names I have mentioned, we fell between 70% and 80% since beginning of March.  I see this as peak fear and pricing in worst case scenario, so although we could see more short term downside, I think the worst is over and that leads me to #2 \u2013 government aid.  Today, during his daily briefing, Prime Minister Trudeau was asked multiple times about a bailout for oil.  He said he expects to announce relief this week for sectors greatly affected.  Numbers of $20B to $30B were mentioned.  It will be interesting to see what sort of relief is given, whether it is priced in, and the overall sentiment.  I have already flipped CPG from $0.92 to $1.41.  I will take some short term pain on MEG for a potential of a huge spike.  \n\n**Gold Miners** -  Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold.\n\nAs mentioned, gold miners have been riding the bull break of gold to new daily highs or at least short term strength.  I said last week I did not expect this to happen because it has run so hard from the bottom without consolidation.  Look at this [weekly chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZKvsFFSi/)..  That 5 week bounce is over 90% from the bottom without consolidation.  Gold and gold miners were approaching a monthly resistance and it looked like people either sold or shorts got in to protect resistance.  Most of the names were up about 7% to 10% this morning but began pulling back, hard.  Names finished between up 3% to down 3%. I would expect a short term cool down before trying to break through resistance.\n\n**Marijuana Stocks** - I had only mentioned Canopy as that is the main one I trade because it is the sector leader and has enough liquidity for my trades but I also watch Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSO\u2019s.  Organigram (OGI) had weak financials and was down 11.5% today.  Canopy don\u2019t give a shit.  It was up 6.5%.  It is now within striking distance of two daily resistances that have acted as the highs since the flush of March.  It definitely still has a bullish chart.  Doesn\u2019t matter though as I\u2019m still watching for short term bearish opportunity with long term calls.  \n\n**Banks** - RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD\n\nI have mutual funds/ETF\u2019s that are banks because I believe there is long term safety in these.  As a short term trader I don\u2019t care much for them because their increases and decreases are not as volatile for me.  Case in point today, up and down 1% across board and in a sideways tight equilibrium.  These are for investing, not trading.\n\n**One Off Companies** - Bombardier, Air Canada, Blackberry\n\n**Bombardier** - It\u2019s holding between $0.53 (high of the bounce) and $0.455 (low of last pullback).  I would say $0.45 is the true lower end for the psychological factor, I think more people will load up there to try and hold that.  If $0.45 breaks I think lower $0.4x is likely.  If it holds I can see it pushing $.50 again.  Finished up 2% today.\n\n**Air Canada** - should of sold my puts when they were up over 50% yesterday.  SPY continuing its ridiculous run makes global markets strong which makes Air Canada and other names stronger.  It was up 1% today.\n\n**Blackberry** - see above, up 3.3%.

This is seriously the most boring post so far.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0sq2x/more\\_tea\\_leaves\\_less\\_palm\\_reading\\_long\\_boring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0sq2x/more_tea_leaves_less_palm_reading_long_boring/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo; My morning gap theory was correct, as were my movement timelines, though my assumption that we might get a minor gap down was reversed. This really should not have surprised me, given that the stock market doesn't operate on news, but rather expectation. What do I mean by this?\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-better-than-feared-news-morning-brief-111215949.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-better-than-feared-news-morning-brief-111215949.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply put, the market doesn't care about the dead, as long as they're predictable. Same for the earnings report, which is why we should have predicted a slight rise instead of a slight fall. We've been hearing about how bad the earnings report will be all week, which means the market has heard this too. If the models match, :stonks go up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPre-market we've seen quite a bit of what I believe to be institutional manipulation. The pre and post hours on the market are largely operated by the industry professionals and institutions. End of day, we typically see market order drawdown and consolidation, a 'cleanup' if you will This makes sense. In the mornings, we're seeing regular large gaps up and down. Jump to the 1H chart, and zoom out.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/trading-in-the-pre--and-post-market-sessions.aspx](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/trading-in-the-pre--and-post-market-sessions.aspx)\n\nMarch 24th: 8pt jump, 226-234 over night.\n\nMarch 26th: 9 pt jump, 263-254\n\nAPR 1: 254-249\n\nAPR 6: 247-257\n\nAPR  7: 266-274\n\nLast night, \\~2pt jump, so fairly small, in the scope of things.\n\nNow, there are plenty of nights without gaps, and plenty of gapping in the real world. What is questionable is what these frequent and consistent gaps might represent. Retail investors (thats us) are considered the 'dumb money' of the market, that is, we give away our cash for free because we're idiots. Largely, I believe this to be true. Operating on phrases like \"unemployment reportzzzzzzz\" and \"quarterly earningsssss\", its no surprise that we're often left surprised when the market barely reacts to bad news. How these gaps might be manipulation, is my speculation on artificial stock inflation. Stock price operates on a fairly simple concept, I offer/ask at X price, and you reject/accept. Generally speaking, these prices ladder up and down as we negotiate the new prices, and a record of how we got to a price exists. Where there are no records, is in a gap. We go from 247 one day to 257 the next day, based on nothing. That suggests there is no support for these numbers, but if we lock in the price a bit during pre-market, the market frequently accepts these new numbers without any reason other than 'group think'. After all, if that guy sells his stock for way more today than yesterday, and nothing new has happened since yesterday, seems totally legit that I made 10 million tendies overnight. Stonks only go up!\n\nWhat I believe is happening is a simple pump and dump, using small volume orders in the pre-market to inflate/deflate prices, and leave retail investors as bag holders.\n\nCompany A - Hey, I have 100,000 shares of XYZ. Buy 10k of my shit today at $10.\n\nCompany B - Ok, now you buy it back for $11.\n\nCompany A - Ok, now we do it again for $12\n\nCompany B - Ok, Now to 13.\n\nRetail D$ - Hey, look at this stock, its trending up! I better get in on this. Stonks only go up! $14.\n\nRetail M$ - $15! Stonks only go up!\n\nCompany A - Hey B, sell our extra shares at $15. We'll get mad tendies.\n\nRetail D$ - Oh god! it was a bubble, sell sell! $10\n\nCompany B - Hey, now that we sold, the stock is back to $10. What now?\n\nRetail M$ - Hrm. this was a shitty deal, I should get out before I lose more money.\n\nCompany A - I'll buy those back from you for $9 so you can cut your losses.\n\nRetail M$ - Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\nCompany A - Sell 10k more shares for 8.50.\n\nRetail M$ - Now they're only $8! Ok I'll sell.\n\nCompany A - Buys stocks back up to $10-11 dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompany A & B take long positions on a stock, inflate the price, and then take up a position shorting the stock.  The dumb money sees the run, and tries to get on board. The run was never real, and Company A & B use the opportunity to get out of their position for a profit. The bag holders eat the loss, and then company A & B can purchase back their original shares, netting a nice little profit from the retail investors without giving anything in return. Company profits on every leg of the interaction, retail is left confused about Quarterly earnings and dead corona numbers. Using the market to draw money out of 'dumb money'. Retail D$ and M$ were only really ever competing against each other, this is important to realize if the thesis is correct. You're not going to beat JP Morgan in the long run, but you might beat the other retail guys. That's the edge to play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reality is that the internet brings us faster and better communications everyday, so \"unexpected\" happens less and less. When things are operating within the bounds of expected, the market reacts as you'd expect. If you take our gap last night into account when looking at the days movements, we've barely moved, with a slight incline. This follows our original prediction to a tee, that there was no unexpected news, so the markets trended up in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis comment here, if I'm understanding correctly, suggests some interesting theories that support our thesis that anyone using this newer accounting documentation requirement will be more stable predictions going forward, which again will lead to less \"crashing\" than bears would like. I think this is probably the most important post of the day for understanding short term numbers.

This of course, continues to not include the fuckery that is \"under employed\" \"sorta employed\" and \"I gave up on this shit and started making meth in an RV in the mountains employed\".\n\nIf you need an idea of what the fed thinks, consider that there were 1.75t in federal spending to dig out of 2008-12, starting with an estimate of 700b. So far as we've gone thru this, I've eyeballed minimum 10 trillion estimated, as in, only whats being spent right now. Obviously we don't know what we'll have to spend next year, yet. Its not even comparable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets look at another good reference number. Number of corporate bankruptcies.\n\n[https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/current-trends-in-china-s-bankruptcy-49571/](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/current-trends-in-china-s-bankruptcy-49571/)\n\n[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3078581/coronavirus-nearly-half-million-chinese-companies-close-first](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3078581/coronavirus-nearly-half-million-chinese-companies-close-first)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, 8500+ in 2018, lets be nice and double it, call it 17k. 460k in the first 2 months of 2020? Someone told China that those were rookie numbers, so they got em up there. Remember, China is a manufacturing powerhouse in the world. They generate revenue by producing content, and manufacturing is \\*generally\\* more resilient, you know, as long as people can actually work. The service industry? How many of you have related in your life to \"Ok, got my paycheck, now I can pay last weeks bills, I'll just take care of this week with next weeks paycheck, and I can put friday night on the credit card\". This is in effect, how the service industry functions. This is also why nothing has hit yet. We're paying last weeks bills, but next week(metaphor)  we're boned.\n\nGDP By sector:\n\n[https://www.indexmundi.com/china/gdp\\_composition\\_by\\_sector.html](https://www.indexmundi.com/china/gdp_composition_by_sector.html)\n\n[https://www.indexmundi.com/united\\_states/gdp\\_composition\\_by\\_sector.html](https://www.indexmundi.com/united_states/gdp_composition_by_sector.html)\n\nComparison of Service vs Industry economies and their abilities to withstand shock.\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijfe.1658](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijfe.1658)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterestingly, the world as a whole is undergoing the same depression, at the same time. The implications from what I can tell will be that cash rich countries that don't care about people (Saudi Arabia, China) should weather this fairly well, and potentially come out better (in world influence ranking) than they were before. I would expect the United states and Large portions of the EU to weather this fairly poorly. As usual, no one cares what South America or Africa does (just kidding, sorta.)\n\nSo what does that mean for us today? Well, until we have reason, we stick to the model. Stocks should continue to rise slightly / slowly, with small retractions unless there is a catalyst. If the fed is able to slow the the housing market crash, it will likely be a long slow bleed. This is a reasonable goal for them that we have to consider in our future models, as we'd try and do the same.  Our assumption is that the mortgage default rate will outweigh the ability of the fed to keep it from crashing us, and we expect the Fed to let small to medium companies fail in large quantities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I wrote jobs report instead of earnings report because I'm dumb.

I do not believe the math will be there for a straight recovery, and I think the Fed will have to consider deliberately inviting stagflation to stave off a deeper (but shorter) depression.\n\nIt is my thesis that the unemployment shock, in combination with the means of recovery being damaged (can't go back to work if work is closed) will be the potential catalyst(s) that take this from a black swan event similar to 87, to a depression like 1930.

Remember that stocks have no inherent value, in that they only have value because their price fluctuates, and our ability to make money is based on that fluctuation alone. \n\nWhen a stock goes down, institutions can make money by encouraging retail investors to sell to cut a loss (stop loss) and then stepping in to buy the shares cheaper. They can also bet on the short of the stock going down, and then on the rise of going up. They can hedge out those positions in case you decide not to play the game, minimizing their risk. It's rather brilliant, and relatively unbeatable if you have the capital to afford the cost of the hedge indefinitely. \n\nFinally, you don't know at what point a position was actually purchased. If stock starts at 10, falls to 5, the Institution picks it up at 5, it goes to 8, and then falls to 6, they can still sell at a profit if they need liquidity for some other reason (such as the limitless hedging). \n\nIts basically a game of 4D chess.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19699826836585999}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3543006181716919}, {"body": "thanks for the great read.
