In the absence of these credits, Tesla would post a GAAP loss for Q1 2020. My questions are:\n\n1. Will regulatory credits be of this scale (\\~$300M) moving forward or was this a one time incident? I know Tesla had a $2B deal with FCA to sell them regulatory credits. What is the timeline and how will credits be distributed throughout each quarter?\n2. According to the Q1 2020 earnings report, in the absence of regulatory credits, automotive gross margin is 20%. For reference, Tesla's automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits last quarter was 20.9%. Given Tesla was ramping up Model Y and MIC M3 during Q1, I was expecting gross margins to be lower. Does that mean Tesla's manufacturing efficiencies significantly improved such that gross margin barely decreased?

The ramp-up cost does not yield a one-time hit for each quarter, rather depreciated in multiple quarters.

{"title": "DIS DD (repost) - Aronf32", "selftext": "I have received a lot of hate for this, so if you're going to hate, just leave.  If people had believed me, their portfolios would be up 40% in the hour that the market has been open.  This is not to exchange opinions, only to inform people of the financial state of Disney.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIS 5/15 $105 Call**\n\nHere's why I'm recommending this, if you wanna hear my backing. Walt Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world. To put this into perspective, they own ABC, Fox, FX, Disney, ESPN, Marvel, Pixar, Hulu, and a ton more. **The main things of this DD are Disney+, their upcoming EPS, and how they're undervalued during this coronavirus.** First of all, Disney+. Disney+ has been booming in numbers, before the coronavirus, and with the virus added on, it is literally exploding. Along with its other subsidiaries, Disney is one of the only companies in a better position because of this virus. Yet they lost 31% due to the virus. They should have benefitted. The beautiful thing is (my second point), their EPS is coming up on May 6th. 3 out of the 4 of Disney's EPS's over the past year have had a positive suprise, and this one will obviously have a huge one as well. Zacks estimates that they will have an EPS suprise of 14.7%, I believe it will be a lot more. And finally, combining all of this, they should really be up 30% instead of down, and this upcoming EPS will prove that, and I believe the week after their EPS will be as green as the Rockefeller Christmas tree. I'm getting excited just writing about this. This is no joke, seriously, don't know how I can be more serious, the best opportunity I have seen in my life. Trust me, and buy a new car later.\n\nMy reasoning for 5/15, is I want to not only capitalize off of the immediate response to the EPS release, but also the week after, as I believe the market will take time to realize that it made a mistake about Disney.\n\n**I picked $105 just to be super safe, but a $110 or $115 isn't a ridiculous target.

A quick DD on a possible earnings play", "selftext": "Tl;dr A lot of people have noticed the massive crowds at Home Depot and Lowe's of late.  This past weekend I did some Google Trends DD to see if that's really showing up numerically somewhere.  I found that HD and Lowe's are both at **all time highs** for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.\n\n\n[Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March](https://i.imgur.com/1YAZ8zK.png).  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.\n\n[Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer](https://i.imgur.com/H1F4Kn7.png), there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.\n\n[Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores](https://i.imgur.com/lO7oop7.png).  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.\n\nJust for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- [nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now](https://i.imgur.com/wBXgwgt.png), which is just as well since their stores are closed. \n\nBottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.
