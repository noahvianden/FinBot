{"title": "First Portfolio Review", "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nWith the stock market in freefall, I decided it might be a good time to purchase for the first time. Any comments about individual picks or the portfolio in general are appreciated. I may buy slightly more if there's another big dip. My goals for this portfolio are to be up 250-300% within 3-5 years at which point I'll consider selling enough to recoup the original investment, holding the remainder until retirement or later. A focus was given to relatively high dividend yields and areas hit especially hard by the market crash, of which I trust a recovery will begin to really ensue within 6-12 months. I am kicking myself for not selling off and rebuying the cruise stocks, but I missed that opportunity and am in this for a relative long-haul. I plan to add other stocks such as Apple & Amazon to this portfolio in the near future.

I\u2019ve only ever worked a few places in my life but one was in a pharmacy and another was for the US government.\n\nTEVA produces these drugs for next to nothing, made in a giant vat and chopped up into pill form for distribution. The cheapest place you can buy a bottle of 30 tablets is Walmart for around 75 dollars.\n\nTo do some quick math we have a few options: 8,000,000/30 per bottle= 266,666x$75 = 20 million dollars. That\u2019s the low end.\n\nKnowing the government, they\u2019ll pay more. Probably a lot more. An X factor to throw into the mix is that Trump mentioned \u201cdoses\u201d. Ordinarily for Malaria prevention/recovery a patient would take chloroquine for at least a week. A dose in this case could be 7-10 tablets per person. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re not talking 8 million tablets, that\u2019s 56 million. More math: 56,000,000/30 per bottle = 1,866,666 bottles at a MINIMUM $75 per bottle: $140 million dollar USG contract for something that probably costs them about tree fiddy to make.\n\nTEVA doesn\u2019t only make chloroquine, they also provide generics for about every old boomer condition you can think of: Statins, depression meds, thyoid meds, you name it. Considering the only places that are open right now are Wendy's drive thru, pharmacies, and some big navy boat hospital bois, they're still making money right now. \n\nOh, and did I mention their earnings report is 4/30?

If you look at thier performance last year they had a dip in the spring when they would usually have peak sales because of a very rainy spring. With social distancing and everyone losing jobs at least through april and most likely through their peak season in may, they will miss peak sales season on top of the dip that the market will most likely see from all of the lost jobs. Thats not to mention the early warm weather that we are hitting right now. This dip will come sooner than last year most likely. I won't be able to make money off this but you guys might. Buy options expiring at the end of may or later for a pretty sure bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The volume is a problem and I forgot to mention that. The major crash already happened and the recession is going to continue. There are now factors specific to certain industries that will tell where they are headed and how fast. If you look at their price history last year, they had a major dip in the springtime just because of heavy rain. They even had their major acquisition that was propping them up. Charles machine works(their aquisition)  was profiting heavily right after they bought it and the groundskeeping business was losing a ton. This year both the new aquisition and their main business will take a hit from the same factors and the new ones. This is wallstreetbets, I don't trade for a living or have any credentials.
