Wow, everyone got what they wanted and that money changed hands 5 times in a single day!  Business is booming!\n\nSo tomorrow you go to get your dick sucked again only there's a few people waiting in line and now this faggot's charging $30.  What?? Why is he charging so much?  Well, the economy is booming!  Everyone's getting their dick sucked, everyone's buying blow, everyone's buying food, everyone's giving their money to their kid, and everyone's shanking the farmer's kid for his allowance money!  The DEMAND for stuff is high, so the price goes up.\n\nAlso: the fed's buying bonds.  These are loans.
