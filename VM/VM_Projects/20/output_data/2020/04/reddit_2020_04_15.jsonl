I don't know about Spain, but France has extended the shutdown into May (and closed borders likely into September, judging by Macron's speech yesterday), Germany is expected to extend into May, and I believe many countries will follow.

Basically, the economy is not yet in a phase of recovery. I only know German numbers right now, but the estimates are that the economy will shrink by about 3-6% this year - based on a scenario where the shutdown is not longer than April, which, well, it will be.

You'd be foolish to charge ahead if it didn't make sense. \n\n>My plan with this, isn't to purchase the option, it's to sell the contract. So, is the downside that I could just lose the investment, 20 each = $1000.\n\nIf you did the JAN 23/30 bull call spread (AKA vertical spread), you would buy the 23 and sell the 27. The downside would be the loss of your original investment about about 2.93 per spread, or $293 since each contract controls 100 shares. \n\n>Also, it's buy/write?\n\nBuy/write refers to covered calls, where you'd buy stock and then sell a call. The concept is the same though, in your long option (the JAN 23 call) stands in for those shares so you don't have to own the stock. \n\nThe main downside with vertical is the max profit. The highest a spread can go to is the width of the strikes. So if I buy a $5 wide spread, the most I could ever sell it for is $5. If I have on a $10 wide spread, the most I could ever sell it for is $10. Theoretically, a single leg option could go to infinity / unlimited profits. \n\nHaving done plenty of both, I strongly prefer to stick with trades that have the higher odds of success with the known risk/reward.

If you see Intels roadmap they wont be able to compete up until 2022 when they launch 7nm CPUs. Performance gap will continue grow in AMDs favor. Have you seen reviews of Ryzen Mobile 4000 series APU that was launched last week? Crushes everything Intel has while having 40-50% better battery life. Remember mobile is a stronghold of Intel now AMD is beating them on all 3 fronts: Desktop, Mobile & servers.\n\nThis is what I wrote in other thread. AMD is far more attractive buy vs NVDA.\n\nRough times ahead for NVDA certainly in consumer computing and especially in Laptop space. APUs will start to eat entry level to mid level sales from NVDA. See the trend. AMD Renoir Ryzen 4000 series outclasses NVDA MX250 and comes close to MX350. Intel Tiger Lake coming later this year will be more powerful than Renoir (based off leaks certainly in synthetic benchmarks). Also, there have been numerous rumors of AMD Van Gogh APU and Cezanne Zen 3 APU with RDNA2 architecture. So all in all trend is clear. Much powerful graphics embedded in the CPU. NVDA does not have x86 IP and ARM just cannot take high performance x86 cores soon enough.\n\nOn the HPC space, NVDA is not found in any of the 3 exa flop supercomputer contracts. 2 was awarded to AMD and 1 to Intel (All Cray). Based off current NVDA offering for HPC, one would say they have superior products by far but none of NVDA product was able to make it in those super computers. Reason is simple heterogeneous computing. Based off rumors, Custom Milan (Zen 3) APUs will be installed in one of the supercomputer.\n\nSimilarly, AMD is developing architecture especially for data center HPC/AI workloads that will be placed against HPC volta/Ampere. Before AMD used to have same architecture for both gaming and data cente/AI.\n\nFor now I would say NVDA is doing great on the desktop and mobile front but there is a reason for it. AMD does not have high end graphics card to compete against NVDA. Tables will turn once AMD launches RDNA2 GPUs. RDNA2 will have 50% increase in performance per watt and is the same architecture that powers PS5 and Xbox One series X. And we all know How poor NVDAs strategy/ implementation for RTX turned out. Only handful of games featuring RTX even after 1.5years of launch.\n\nI bought NVDA in the $30\u2019s and AMD in the $3s but sold all NVDA in the $70-80s and went all in to AMD ($6-$7) due to my assumption of higher growth (%). AMD has paid off much higher what NVDA would have. AMD is more diversified. Has both high performance CPU and GPU IP.

Movie theaters offer the high market prices these studios bank on to sustain their hundred million dollar ventures. Look at the music streaming industry, artists make 80%+ of their revenue from concerts cause streaming is so cheap and piracy is so easy. Obviously music is different than movies: movies are more exclusive, unique, and difficult to make, and the streaming platforms for movies are harder to steal from but it will still scare studios enough to demand high premiums for streaming blockbuster releases. If Netflix accommodates both studios and consumers by offering a flexible set of plans and platforms, then NFLX will print. But it will take a lot of partnerships and deals, and likely a trial and error period where studios build their own platforms or continue with theater only releases. This of course assumes Disney doesn\u2019t buy all the household names and amazon video doesn\u2019t grab a huge market share with their already established on-demand type model.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx", "amzn", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "When the Office (and Park and Rec) is taken off later this year, the Netflix gravy train is over.

It's sitting at a multi-year low (around $1.60) due largely to us being in a shoulder season for heating/cooling demand combined with 'rona shitshow 2020 tanking industrial demand. All that being said prices are expected to rise towards the end of the year as the oil crash curtails oil production (and associated natty gas production) in the US. It's hard to say when prices will spike but I expect things to be volatile in the next couple of months. \n\nComing to this week's play. Natural gas storage numbers are announced tomorrow at 10:30 ET and the EIA is expecting a big injection (storage build). With this much uncertainty in the market I expect a big swing (at least 5%) either way tomorrow. If the build is more than expected we might be breaking a multi-year support and breakout hard to the down side. If it's smaller than expected we'll likely head up to at least the 1.7 level.
