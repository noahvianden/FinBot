Biden has made it clear this will be a big focus of his. If you think the Dems take the White House and Congress, this is going to be one of the best sectors to invest in during the coming years, IMO.  Even if the Dems don't take the helm, renewable energy is the future. A great long term investment, either way.\n\n**- Health Care.**  Here again, this is assuming you think the Dems take control.  I expect more money to be spent on health care, although I'd be careful where you put it.  Watch who gets in and what their agenda seems to be.  Excessive controls on drug prices could make stocks in Pharma a little risky.  A push towards Universal Health Care (which Biden has made clear is NOT part of his agenda) could affect stocks in companies like United Health Care.\n\n**- Cannibis.**  Marijuana stocks are something I've avoided up to now. I see no upside in investing in something that is still illegal under federal law, even if a number of states have passed laws to look the other way. However, if the Dems take control of Congress, I would be surprised if there isn't a push to legalize MJ nationwide.  If that happens, cannibis stocks should go through the roof.  Beware of a bubble if this happens and set trailing stops. I can see an over-reaction in buying followed by an overreaction in selling.\n\nWait to see the outcome of the election before you buy.\n\n**- Infrastructure.**  Companies like Martin Marietta (MLM) which specializes in construction materials like gravel, asphalt and concrete, are likely to do well no matter who wins. Both Biden and Trump have signalled that they want to increase federal dollars for shoring up the nation's infrastructure, which usually means roads and bridges.\n\n**- REITS.** Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were an unintended casualty of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nTrump's signature tax reform lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was great for traditional corporations. But it made special tax shelters like REITs less attractive by comparison. REITs are not required to pay federal taxes so long as they distribute at least 90% of their profits as dividends.\n\nJoe Biden's tax plan would raise corporate taxes back to 28% and would more aggressively tax foreign income. It also is specifically designed to force large, profitable tech companies to pay more.\n\nAll of this bodes poorly for the stock market. But it wouldn't be such a bad thing for REITs. Their special tax status might actually be appreciated again.\n\nOne REIT to consider is Realty Income (**O**). Although Realty Income specializes in retail properties, most of its portfolio \u2013 pharmacies, dollar stores, convenience stores, big-box retailers \u2013 is relatively COVID-proof. It's a conservative REIT with a long track record of rewarding its shareholders. The company has paid 600 consecutive monthly dividends and has actually raised its dividend for 91 consecutive quarters.\n\nShares are down by more than 25% from their recent highs, which has elevated the yield well north of 4%. A combination of receding COVID fears and a stricter tax regime might be just the right mix to send shares even higher.\n\n**Emerging Markets -** a Biden administration would likely preside over a less confrontational trade agenda that should generally be better for emerging markets.\n\n**- Gold.**  Joe Biden's policy platform is potentially expensive. And with the economy still in rough shape, the combination of increased government spending with sagging receipts could mean massive budget deficits for the foreseeable future.  If the Democrats control both Congress and the White House, gold would make sense as a possible inflation and dollar devaluation hedge.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Didn't think about reits behaving like that.

This topic has been hashed and re-hashed numerous times since April. It could happen today. It could happen next week. It may not happen for another 20 years. Literally nobody knows.\n\nI think everyone here is in agreement that the economy, in general, is not in good shape. Unemployment is still high. Retail businesses, airlines, theaters, restaurants, theme parks and many other businesses are suffering from slow sales. COVID is still taking its toll on the economy.  There are likely still many bankruptcies on the way:  everything from large corporations to small mom-and-pop businesses to individuals who can't find steady employment.  The real estate market has tumbled and may continue to do so.  Brick and mortar businesses will likely continue to close doors. Rental homes and apartments have tenants that can't pay rent.  The real estate market may not come back for years; if ever.\n\nStill, there are bright spots. Companies that have strengthened their internet presence are shoring up revenue.  New companies and companies like Shopify and Digital Turbine that support online businesses are growing at a tremendous pace. The Fed and the current government (both the executive and the legislative branches) seem determined to not allow the stock market to be damaged so badly that we have another 1930's-like depression. So they continue to pump money into the market and into sectors of the economy that will, in turn, prop up the market.\n\nTo some extent this is a \"house of cards.\"  It may hold long enough for retail sales to return. It may not.  This could all come crashing down in the next few weeks or months.  (September and October have historically been times when the market has struggled). But, again, nobody knows. If AstraZeneca and Pfizer announce success with their vaccines by the end of October, optimism (even without increased retail sales) could buoy the market long enough for things to start to return to a semblance of normal.\n\nI think money will remain tight for months or years to come.  It may take many months or years before airlines, hotels, restuarants, theaters and other businesses return to pre-Covid levels with regards to revenue. That doesn't mean their stock prices won't soar to all time highs.  It could take years or decades before the real-estate market adjusts, but I'm sure it eventually will.  It could take months or years before unemployment drops to levels that we saw a year ago.  Or it may never return to those levels.\n\nThat's a long way to say, your guess is as good as mine. Personally, I was expecting a large crash sometime this summer (before now). Obviously that didn't happen. It could still happen. But I see no signs that it's likely.  People are taking profits this week, it appears. The tech sector, which has soared for 6 months may have a difficult week of \"re-adjustment.\"  It might be a good time to buy.  Or maybe not.

Depends on your holdings.  I'm mostly a buy and hold investor.  I have a chunk in dividend stocks which weren't impacted nearly as badly as the tech selloff.  As dividend stock prices go down, the yield from DRIP goes up, buying larger fractional shares.  As long as prices eventually go back up and the dividend doesn't get cut, dividend stocks can actually benefit from red swings.  My indexes and tech certainly took a beating, but I don't think Amazon, Google, Apple, or Microsoft are going to be gone any time soon.

{"title": "A free hedge", "selftext": "Hey guys I found a study online of how effective hedging with vix calls is and and studied returns from March \u201806 to December \u201808 it determined the best hedge was 3% of your account into monthly vix calls 25% otm. \n\nI was wondering if this free hedge strategy would work/be effective. \n\nShort an ITM .80 delta vix call. Go long two further otm Vix calls such that they are consecutive strikes and you receive as close to a $0 credit as possible. hold the spread till 90 dte and then roll so it is 120dte. The only way the trade loses money money is if I hold to expiration and my long calls are otm or atm. If they are in the money by a decent amount I can hold to expiration and still make profit.\n\nSmall spikes in vix help me slightly but not too much. If vix falls off a cliff or steadily declines I can buy back the short call for a profit and keep holding the long calls since they\u2019ll be stupidly cheap and still have time to expiration anyways in case there\u2019s another spike within the next 90-120 day\u2019s. Big spike in Vix like a June 10 sell off makes me a ton of money since the short strike delta is already close to 1 and the long strikes would then become around .8 and I\u2019d have two of them. \n\nIs this is sound strategy to hedge?
