However, it is pretty clear that GM has halted or paused negotiations on the NKLA deal. This was reported today and GM stated they have not officially closed the deal yet. GM knows they have all the cards, without GM...Nikola is fucked. It is very possible that GM renegotiates for a massively increased share of the company since NKLA will cease to exist, I\u2019d imagine, otherwise. \n\nWho in the fuck would purchase an EV from GM when Tesla exists? Total retards, people more retarded than even us here retards. GM probably knows this and really wants a separate entity to promote their fresh lineup. \n\nWhat could happen: GM takes over/buys out NKLA, shakes up the brand or straight up renames it (maybe not) and releases their future EVs under this company. All in all this will pump NKLA shares massively in the short term at least when this is announced. GM can give a statement that they\u2019re overhauling the company and starting fresh and most retail investors and car buyers won\u2019t give a fuck", "id": "j26cal", "created_utc": 1601407713.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "GM could literally just create a new ev brand.

GM basically pays itself for it's own hydrogen tech, and can even mark it up as revenue to a degree.\n\nSomething bad will happen, and Nikola won't be able to make ends meet. At this point, if the Badger is relatively successful, GM might offer to convert their bonds to stock at the appropriate $1-2 mark (thanks to bankruptcy concerns). This conversion is a new issuance, which will devalue everyone else's stock, and will result in GM owning NKLA, or at least the pickup 'division'. At this point, they kick out all the execs, and pull it into the fold as THE GM EV TRUCK brand, kick the SEMI division to someone else, and/or roll it into their other successful line of trucks.\n\nIf the Badger isn't successful, GM liquidates the company through the bonds. Stock goes to $0. They take possession of all the IP they can, including the 'jointly developed' hydrogen fuel cell designs, truck designs, customers, etc. They roll it into their own truck divisions, hire former NKLA personnel, and Badger tech surfaces next year as part of the Silverado or something. They sell of everything else that doesn't align with their business objectives. This is written up as a bad debt on their balance sheet, but it's basically as if they internally funded R&D for a new pickup truck model.\n\nEven if Nikola is successful, GM can convert it's bonds to stock at a good time and cash out on a good stock price. They retain joint ownership of the IP developed together, including the money spent by Nikola on making their fuel cell tech more compatible with pickup trucks.
