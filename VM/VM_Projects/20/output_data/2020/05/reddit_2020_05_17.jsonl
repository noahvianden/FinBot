You\u2019ve got 18 DTE on a trade that\u2019s paying out 10% of risk with a 80% POP. That\u2019s a really bad trade statistically speaking. Why is payout so low? Because 1) this spread has already burnt a ton of theta with only 18DTE to go, 2) all that\u2019s left really in the extrinsic value is volatility, and 3) AAPL\u2019s IV is low (21% IV percentile right now), so there\u2019s not much there.

While Probability of Profit is useful as a \"guide\", one shouldn't only look at that, as it can lead to traders making mistakes as you have, which I'll cover below.\n\nOverall, different people have different styles of trading and my weekly posts have had a variety of trade types and I don't expect everyone to like every type of trade.

My assumption is that AAPL doesn't exceed its all time highs within the next 3 weeks.  I Want to keep it shorter in duration.  \n\nYou touch on Theta, vol, and extrinsic value.  You are also mixing/confusing terms a bit, I'll try to clarify with a few points- \n\nPlease note that in a spread, the theta and vol impact on the position are significantly reduced.  That's the primary reason the Net theta is so low from an absolute value perspective. \n\nHowever, it seems you are mixing theta and extrinsic value when you talk about the near term duration? \n\nIn fact, going further out Reduces your theta (just move the spread to 6/19 to see).  Remember, you have an Increase in theta when you're closer to expiration.  \n\nIf this isn't clear, please let me know.\n\nRegarding probability of profit - \n\nThe probability of profit is an Estimate and is based on the option's pricing and/or a given platform's calculations.  You can see this simply in that different brokers often have different probabilities of profit.  What does that mean?  While it is useful qualitatively, by definition, your calculation isn't \"right\" or precise although you use it as such.  Could go quite a bit deeper on this, but if it isn't clear, let me know.  \n\nLet's pretend that it IS right, you've still made a significant error that I'll help you with.  If you are regularly using probability in this manner (in trading or elsewhere), this correction alone can save you some money whether you like this trade or not!  \n\nWhile you didn't give me enough information to confirm, I suspect you may also be confusing \"probability of profit\" with probability of where AAPL ends on 6/5.  I mention this because if you use the probability analysis on TOS, you'll see the \"expected\" price \\~85% of the time is below 330 which is a higher percentage than the PoP you quote. \n\nEither way, you've made a classic error of assuming that there are two outcomes - Total win of $47 or total loss of $453.  You've failed to take into account the range of outcomes from 330.00 to 335 as well.  \n\nI think I covered everything.

The peak of theta decay for OTM options is 45-21 days, roughly.\n\nExtrinsic value is solely made up of volatility and time left. The farther out, the larger the extrinsic value.

The peak of theta decay for OTM options is 45-21 days, roughly. \n\nThe spread I selected as a higher **theta** than one a couple weeks out and it sounds like your first sentence fragment agrees.  Your rebuttal (after the \"but\") seems to be \"if you selected the same spread further out in time, you'd have more extrinsic value\"? \n\nOne of the nice (or not so nice) things about options is that one has to consider the timing of the trade to be Right.

I put the position on today, you probably wouldn't be happy with what expiration I selected...\n\nRegarding Peak of theta decay - that is true for a single short option, depending on how far OTM as well as the volatility levels.  I can easily construct an option that has much higher decay from days 21 down to 0 than 42 days to 21 days.

I caution people not to look at a number like that in a vacuum.  The implied Vol  (raw value)  is actually 36.41 (also on the chart - we can discuss separately TOS's vol calcs vs other platforms).  The 21 IV percentile includes the enormous run up in vol from the last couple months.  If you plot the actual IV and compare to the IV from the rest of the last year, you'll see it is relatively \"high\" and has room to come down - as it did today.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You've essentially setup a binary trade because there are only two ways this is going to go since your spread is so narrow (\\~1.5% of underlying), your DTE are so few and volatility is so low.

Doesn't change my statistically average payout more than a few pennies.\n\nThis seems to be the 'crux' of your argument, yet it was done incorrectly.  Already mentioned that the vol isn't low.  More importantly, if you actually look at the ITM probabilities of the two strikes (you can go back to Friday, look at it today, etc.), you'll see a significant 4-6% difference in probability of ITM between the two options.  If you perform the Actual calculations (including the range between the strikes), you'll see the trade varies significantly from your incorrect calculation by almost an order of magnitude at the close on Friday.  With the market open, the calculation of course changes and varied from a small negative expected value to near break even up to  positive. \n\nAs a reminder, the models tend to assume Constant volatility throughout the options's life, which of course isn't true as pointed out above and further assists the trade.\n\nI'm fine with people disagreeing, I enjoy a healthy discourse, but consider that others are coming to learn, so providing mathematically wrong results and then digging in (rather than checking work) isn't much help.\n\nI really appreciate when people provide their thoughts in a constructive manner - if you want to have a reasonable conversation on the above, let me know.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7800466418266296}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"]}

They talk of an FSD car in 2021 with BMW, but you know, here's a video that's aged like milk.  [President of GM saying full autonomy coming in 2019.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-01-12/gm-announces-fully-autonomous-vehicle-for-2019-video)\n\nFrom the mobileye site:\n\n>Mobileye is the leading supplier of software that enables Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS), with more than 25 automaker partners including some of the world\u2019s largest. Beyond ADAS, our technology has rapidly evolved to also support the three pillars of Autonomous Driving \u2013 Sensing, Mapping, and Driving Policy. **As a result of this broad and well-advanced product offering, we have achieved a partnership to develop production-ready Fully Autonomous Vehicles with BMW and Intel, with production launch planned for 2021, and another partnership with the Tier-1 supplier Delphi for a \u201cturnkey\u201d system to be productized starting from 2019 with customer OEMs.**", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No they are moving towards full autonomy\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Looks very promising.\nI guess the big difference will be that the $10k you will pay for fsd on a tesla will go to tesla.

Is he lying or just gullible?   Somebody knew it wasn't going to happen.   \n\nI did not sell all my INTC, but a full 100K chunk I sold and put into TSLA for this very reason.   Tesla is doing something, Mobileye is totally in the shadows as far as I can tell.    \n\nBut INTC isn't a bad holding at all.
