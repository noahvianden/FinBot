First of all Tesla have basics systems that can detect objects based on radar proximity and if you approaching a big object too fast the car should start emergency breaking. That's a \"dumb\" system though that won't really be able to tell a car from a brick wall. \n\nYou as a human person who has lived in this world for a long time and gained knowledge about the world, have a intuitive sense of what type of objects have the ability to move and generally the speed and in what patterns they can move. \n\nIf there's a stopped car in front of you, it's possible for the car to run the calculations, I'm moving at 22 m/s and my maximum retardation is 9 m/s^2, \n22/9\u00d722 + (22/9)^2\u00d79 = 108 m\nStopping distance is 108 m, object in front of me is 70m away, collision imminent. The car slams on emergency breaks, but that was just a car at a traffic stop that just turned green and was clearly accelerating, there was never a problem. \n\nIf you want to build a smart system to avoid things, then you need to teach a neural network the same intuition for what objects are capable of moving on their own and how they move. \n\nThe first layer is just a bunch of RGB pixel values in a tensor. It would be extremely difficult trying to predict how the RGB value of each pixel would change. \n\nWhat you can do is feed two binoculars images ( what the left, right eye sees) into a self-supervised neural network that tries to generate a depth value for each pixel, then manipulate and wrap the image slightly, ask it to predict depth again and feedback it's previous predictions and reward it to being able to stay consistent in it's depth predictions when slightly shifting perspectives. \n\nNow you have depth for each pixel. You can try to have it predict the depth of each pixel in the next frame, but the network have no idea what pixels are even related to each other, what group of pixels stay closely correlated to each other, like a car taking up 100x100 pixels always at the same depth. \n\nStep 2 after getting depth is building a network to identify objects. This is usually hand-labeled, like by those Google captcha things, mark in which area there's a car. Usually you have one network cropping the image of an object and feeding that to the network that figures out what it actually is. \n\nStep 3 is feeding a series of frames with RGB pixels, depth, object boundary/class, state of your car like velocity, steering wheel position all into another neural network which is to predict what group of pixels this object will occupy in the next frame and one depth value for the object. \n\nThis will work reasonably well. But the model really have no idea what the object is currently doing. Ideally it should be able to identify specific patterns like red pixels inside a car object means it's breaking and likely to slow down, be come closer to you in the next frame. However it doesn't hurt to have another model tasked with identifying what the object is doing. For a car there's some basic actions you can try to identify like \"changing lane\", \"stopped red light\", \"about to turn left/rigth\", \"accelerating/retarding\" and also traffic light states like \"green\", \"yellow\", \"red\". \n\nThat way you predictor net is now given that there's a car stopped at a red light in x meters away, there's a traffic light object that has been red but turned green in the last 10 frames, the car also started accelerating in the last 3 frames, you're moving at v speed. Ok now you can probably make a pretty confident prediction about the depth, position, state of all objects in the next frame. You can now re-feed that into the same network and ask \"if this happens in the next frame, what will happen in the frame after that?\" and repeat for a couple time steps into the future. \n\nSo finally we're on what, step 6? Now you have a action net that will actually decide how to control the car. You take everything you gave the predictor net along with it's prediction for a few frames and say, this has happened, this will happen, this was your past actions, what action should the car take now? \"gas pedal\", \"break\", \"steer left/right\"\n\nOk, if there was a car stopped at a red light that turned green, the car seems to be accelerating and distance should be fine, then probably just maintain the same gas as previous frame. \n\nThen you update that 200 frames per second. \n\nThat's generally the stack in a self driving car. Each part is needed and they all work together to figure out of if the car should stop because there's a group of red pixels in one of the camera feeds.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.00672239949926734}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6393303275108337}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "my 2014 car does it, so nice that Tesla can too!", "score": -7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06357807666063309}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12618297338485718}], "tickers": ["tsla"]}

DIS 120c 5/29 risky play. Safer play is 125c 6/19. The play is for reopening news. This week they were suppose to present to FL task force but they backed out. Parks are reopening, Disney is gonna come, if not next week then early June. So 125c 6/19 get it while DIS is still at 117-118. Wait for the news to get DIS to break past $120, could go as high as 125. Been coiling at 117-118 all week. The mouse is waiting to be let out of his fucking cage.    \n\n\n2. FB. FB is trying to break out past 240. It almost did today but stuck at 235 because it follows SPY. Market is lagging in general yesterday and today because of MDW and low liquidity. That and US China tensions. If market pulls back Tuesday opening, I'd get in FB 240c 5/29 or further out if you want safer plays. SPY rallies = FB will break out past 240. DON'T CUCK THE ZUCK OR GET FUCKD.    \n\n\n3. BABA. HUGE risk because of US China beef. Basically senate bill threatening to delist Chinese companies because lots of Chinese fraud. But today about 40m big money went into 210c 9/18. Meaning big money either knows something or thinks the beef is gonna settle. BABA smashed earnings today but it tanked. At its highest this week BABA was at 220 before the senate bill caused it to tank. I saw like 100k profits on my BABA calls but took 40k profit when it was tanking.
