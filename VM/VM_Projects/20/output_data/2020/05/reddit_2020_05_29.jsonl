The Company intends to enroll 600 healthy participants across two cohorts of adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300). Each participant will be assigned to receive placebo, a 50 \u03bcg or a 100 \u03bcg dose at both vaccinations. Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination. Given the 25 \u03bcg and 100 \u03bcg dose levels in the Phase 1 study showed neutralizing antibody titers at or above convalescent sera and were generally well tolerated, the Company has decided not to pursue the 250 \u03bcg dose level in the Phase 2 study.\n\nOn May 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [completed](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmoderna-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results-and&esheet=52228162&newsitemid=20200529005628&lan=en-US&anchor=completed&index=2&md5=7fac2c004126fb7db0389da4f6b21c82) its review of the Company\u2019s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for mRNA-1273 and on May 12, the FDA granted it [Fast Track](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.modernatx.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmoderna-receives-fda-fast-track-designation-mrna-vaccine-mrna&esheet=52228162&newsitemid=20200529005628&lan=en-US&anchor=Fast+Track&index=3&md5=87670c4149e5a919e3086a1d7bad5d8e) designation.
