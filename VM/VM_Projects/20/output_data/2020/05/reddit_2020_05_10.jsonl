{"title": "Minimizing the effect of Vega on ITM LEAPS I'd like to hold long term", "selftext": "I picked up a decent number of ATM LEAPs over the last few weeks. A lot of them are pretty deep ITM at this point (0.6-0.8 Delta). I originally purchased these to give me more leverage, as I would have had to buy several dozen instead of several hundred shares.\n\nI would like to treat these as close to stock as I can though regardless, and I'd like to hold for at least 1 year to get long term capital gains.\n\nThat being said, I'm considered about Vega and IV crush as the market gets more stable. One of them for example currently has a 35% IV  and a Vega of 0.89.  \n\n\nAt what level of IV and Vega do I still need to worry about it? I know that once we get 100 days out I need to be concerned about accelerating Theta decay (hence why I bought 2 years out) but I am getting very worried about IV crush.  \n\n\nIs my plan a bit of a folly, and should I just sell take the gains and buy stock with it? For new purchases I'm shorting puts at the same time (synthetic shares) I don't have the margin to do it for all of them, but would selling puts at the same strike price after the fact help, or would it not have the same effect given I didn't open at the same time? I think it would still work, as it would line up to the current greeks of my option.\n\nIs there any other strategies I'm not thinking of to reduce risk here? Maybe buy some VIX puts or something?

My familial patriarchs with much beefier portfolios than me seem to think Boeing is a \"can't go tits up\" buy. \n\nThem, knowing that I am new to the market and only had about $500 to play with, suggested SPR as opposed to Boeing, but said it would be more risk.

{"title": "Stock market - Where are we? Where will we go?", "selftext": "Hello everybody, I want to start of by telling you that this is a really long post and I don't expect anyone to take from their personal time to read it. With that being said the structure is at follows - a short summary is the first thing that you will read. You can find the arguments in the body of the post if you are curious. Thank you for your attention.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market\n* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction\n* How to **not** make a buying decision\n* Why covid is not that horrible\n\n1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**\n\nWill start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.\n\nWe will not see a new low due to a plethora of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.\n\nThe market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment. The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.\n\nWe will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.\n\nWe will see companies like Verizon or AT&T push higher due to 5G implementation.\n\nWe are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.\n\nAnd so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.\n\n**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**\n\nHere we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.\n\nGoing with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.\n\nThe majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.\n\nThe news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.\n\nInflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.\n\nChina trade war. If Trump cancels the agreement we are going to see a reaction for sure in the market, the only question remaining is how bad?\n\n**3. How to not make a buying decision**\n\nDo not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.\n\nDo not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.\n\nDo your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.\n\n4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**\n\nAh.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.\n\nI want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller. Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.\n\nSweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.\n\nThe death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.\n\nThe majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted.\n\nDo not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.\n\nThat being said, hope you have a nice day/night (depending where you live) and thank you, danke, merci, multumesc, kiitos, efharisto!", "id": "ggrcbm", "created_utc": 1589070976.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\\-reads thread  \n\\-checks your post history\n\nLadies and gentleman, we have found the dumb money.\n\nThis isn't valid take, this is your arguments consolidated from all of your recent comments, they form a narrative that is weak at best.
