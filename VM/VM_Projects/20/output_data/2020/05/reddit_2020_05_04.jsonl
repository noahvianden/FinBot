It also gives you the potential to get back some additional profit beyond what you got for selling the call if it goes above the strike you sold if you were to sell it at some point above the strike you sold. However, this does cap your potential upside. You do always have the option of buying back the call you sold if you think it's going to moon and the payoff would be better. If it continued to drop, you could buy back the call for less than you sold it locking in a profit and if it went back up again you could sell another call and have even more downside protection while still having upside exposure. You can do this infinite times throughout the life of a call or put option that you bought. Ultimately, the point of this trade is to sell above both strikes for a profit or at least minimize losses.\n\nYou could also sell at a strike below instead of above what you bought for an even greater credit back. This would be a credit spread and would reduce your losses even more, but it has to stay below the strike you sold or you will get max loss on the trade. Everything above applies, except in this scenario you want it to go down and let it expire worthless. You can still buy back what you sold and continue selling more if it went back up. Just like with buying calls, you will get more premium when its trending up and less when it trends down.\n\nFinally, you could take it a step further after doing the above and look into turning it into an iron condor to collect credits. Whatever you do, just make sure to sell calls on up days, sell puts on down days, buy calls on down days and buy puts on up days to maximize the trade.\n\nFinally, if you did something like above, you can always roll the position to the next expiry and slide your strikes up or down to collect more credits.

What I wouldnt suggest doing is just randomly opening on any given day a spread unless it's a debit spread on some random ticker.
