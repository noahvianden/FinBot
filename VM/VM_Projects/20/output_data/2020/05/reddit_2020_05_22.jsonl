That's what I don't understand.   \n\n\nThe calls on the other side to \"straddle\" it don't make sense because, well . . . they are so far OTM that it is very likely they expire worthless.  \n\n\nJust going through the scenarios here of what could happen by June 12  \n\n\n1) ECO labs goes up A LOT (doesn't seem likely): Calls gain value, puts lose value. This person is HEAVILY weighted on puts. So unless ECO smashes through 290 and hits . . . 370 range, the value of the position goes down. I think it VERY unlikely that this person is betting on ECL going up  \n\n\n2) ECL remains flat: I can see this, but again, why take this position if ECL is just going to remain flat? This is $120M of tied up capital.   \n\n\n3) ECL is going to TANK and when it does, this person (or hedge fund) will be buying up a ton of shares and exercising the contracts. It doesn't make sense to me that they are holding shares of ECL right now because why take a $130 position that only gains value if ECL goes down? If that's the position, why not just sell shares of ECL? Also, the contracts are already so expensive, that whoever purchased them is going to have a hard time finding buyers, which is why I think they plan on exercising the contracts at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI couldn't find any news on ECL that makes this play make sense to me. So it feels . . . insider?

I studied finance in college and I thought the same thing that following these strategies that the pros do will make you rich. Having worked in the industry, that\u2019s not true.\n\nThere is a theory called the efficient market hypothesis and it\u2019s largely true. Many on this sub will tell you it\u2019s always getting disproven- that\u2019s bullshit. Basically it says that information access is so great that all information available on a stock is almost immediately baked into the price. This might sound hard to believe, but consider that 80% of the money in the market institutional crisis and suddenly it makes more sense.\n\nThis is the foundation of finance curriculums at the college level and programs like the CFA. See these programs mostly teach corporate finance, practical application of statistics, and asset allocation.\n\nMeanwhile, bankers are on CNBC pitching stocks and hedge fund managers are convincing pensions to give them their money to invest. These are the same people who are taught that no one can out smart the market consistently. This is what things start to fall into place.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen an active manager that consistently outperforms the market. Never. The just don\u2019t exist. If Joe from Goldman on CNBC pitching Facebook can\u2019t beat the market, then you have to ask yourself- what is his job? Well, his real job is to make bold claims like FB $400 or FB $150, and justify it with a model and a write up. The sales team then blasts these ratings to fund managers who then trade on them through the bank\u2019s trade desk \u201cmarket makers\u201d. They\u2019re essentially producing commercials for stock trades.\n\nI know all the valuation methods and they\u2019re all biased as hell. I could build a model that says FB is worth $1000 or I could build one that says it\u2019s worth $50 all by adjusting my assumptions on sales growth, exit multiples, and costs of capital. This is why prestigious schools are so important on Wall Street- it\u2019s all bullshit deep down, just very well crafted and educated bullshit. That being said, someone will trust an analyst from Harvard much more quickly than one from a state party school. Both could do the same work, but neither truly knows what will happen and neither is truly better than the other.\n\nIf you want to get rich, you need to take the tortious approach. Learn about asset allocation (how much do I contribute per year and how do I divide that between stocks and bonds). That\u2019s really where people outperform others overtime. No, you might not do as well as the stock market every year, but over time, you\u2019ll do better than most people exclusively day trading.\n\nThat being said, I do trade, but I do for fun and I don\u2019t count on this money to retire. It\u2019s like going to a casino where I can make an educated bet against the dealer. I am happy to buy a deep out of the money option contract, but I\u2019m not risking the barn on it, or naive enough (anymore) to realize it\u2019s not gambling.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to explain that dude, I really appreciate it. It actually puts things into a lot of perspective for me. \n\nThe efficient market hypothesis - though I've never heard of this before, I sort of already figured this had to be a thing. But, as for your point, it seems to me like people trade more on market perception rather than actual value. For example, if people think Facebook is worth $5 and it's selling for that amount right now, but they also think other people are going to believe it's worth $10 tomorrow because they know X amount of people saw Joe from Goldman on CNBC and he gave a great speech tonight that will definitely drive the price up, they'll buy it, sell it tomorrow, and watch it drop to $5 again. It's part of the market ecosystem, like the market depends on those people pitching for their own profit. A commercial is a great analogy, I agree with you. \n\nGoing deeper into the hypothesis, these sorts of ups and downs, or lack of, become a part of the market or brand identity of the stock. Take Tesla. I think we can all count on Elon Musk tweeting something that drops the stocks value by 10%. But last time he did that, it didn't take long for the stock to recover. That 10 percent drop becomes a gain, buying the dip. The hypothesis is super relevant, and so is buying into those deviations.\n\nAs for your Harvard/Party State University analogy, it also has to do with perception rather than truth. People are investing their attention based on the success of branding for those schools. I see this in every industry, colleges are for networking and solidifying the market perception of a given brand name like Harvard.\n\nAsset Allocation - I agree with this principle, diversifying assets helps to ensure that any stock that tanks doesn't crush your portolio. And any stock that gains a ton, well I guess that depends on how much I trust what every one else thinks about the guy on CNBC.\n\nWould love to know what you think of all of that.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ups", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3425047695636749}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4703025221824646}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09113490581512451}, {"body": "I agree, I hear horror stories about day trading.

So pump and dumps to steal global speculative tendies, and one coin rules the tide (tech, natch).  I read here that in the old days, you sold more after the pump, on the way down, but in a volatile market, i think you sell the pump, then put the the price on sale...\n\nThe only difference between this run up and the last, this one mainly ran tech instead of the whole market.  Now I want to see markets pump the so-called value stonks and tank tech.  Or drag it all down a few notches.  The last dump lasted two weeks up to the TPH, which is when index futures expire.
