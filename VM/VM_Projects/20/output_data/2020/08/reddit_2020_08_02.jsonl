{"title": "am I understanding IV and VIX correctly?", "selftext": " 1- when a stock does not move, but IV rises, what happens is the market expectation is rising so more calls/puts are being bought or sold. The demand is higher, which increases the value of the options. This can all happen even if the underlying does not move a single dollar up or down. Is this correct?\n\n2- VIX is a fear index and measures volatility. The higher it is, the higher market volatility (more puts being bought typically). Is it common to use the VIX as a metric when deciding on vega strategies on **ETFS** **&** i**ndividual companies**? \n\n3- this is an extreme example but if a company options chain only has high activity on the call side, so there is no demand on the put side, theoretically would the puts just not move in value?", "id": "i2fu0z", "created_utc": 1596389064.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "1) If the underlying does not move, but IV rises it means that option prices across the chain are rising because the order flow is misbalanced to the \u201cbuy\u201d side. The rising IV thus incorporates a larger expected move, which is being priced into the price of the option by the market.\n\n2) The VIX is an index that measured the average IV across a variety of options and expirations on the SPX, and the portfolio of contracts changes by the minute. The VIX interprets the expected volatility (IV) across the market and is often used as fear indicator, yes.\n\n3) Well there are two ways looking at this. One is from a put-call parity aspect and the other is from a market price action perspective. Put-Call Parity states that the expected value of a PUT option can be derived from the price of the equivalent CALL option. The equation is below:\n\nct = St + pt \u2013 X/(1 + r)^T\n\n\nFor the above equations, the variables can be interpreted as:\n\nSt = Spot Price of the Underlying Asset\npt = Put Option Price\nct = Call Option Price\nX/(1 + r)^T =  Present Value of the Strike Price, discounted from the date of expiration\nr = The Discount Rate, often the Risk-Free Rate\n\nSo, theoretically speaking, if the spot price remains constant and risk-free interest rate has not changed, then a rising price in CALL options would cause prices to rise in its corresponding PUT option as well.\n\nHowever, this is typically for European style options only, but its important to understand because most of the time, American style options do trade close to parity.\n\nThe other way of looking at this would be from the price-action side, which is that CALL options would appreciate in value a lot, while the PUT options of the same strike and expiration would increase, but at a slow rate. Why? Because the IV would start rising across the chain. The probability distribution to the upside would stretch the distribution to the downside as well because expected move is a log normal distribution (according to BSM). \n\nEither way you spin it, you would have rising IV across the chain with a volatility skew to the upside.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "copy that, thank you for your in depth answer.

The EV market will grow as a larger % of new car sales due to them being a superior product compared to ICE vehicles. Period.

{"title": "TTWO and DIS next week.", "selftext": "**Monday 8.3 AH, Take Two earning. Tuesday 8.4 AH, Disney earning. Assuming Macro does not fuck up in next two weeks, both stocks are likely to go up.**\n\nDisclosure: I currently hold TTWO 3-week ITM call + Disney September OTM call at 120. Plan to hold them til expiration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why TTWO:** Let us face it. Economy sucks, virus is rampant, Fed Brrr will continue, stonk only go up, and investors is in maniac of any growth story...\n\nGaming industry will prosper for a long time with virus existence, and very resistant to economy downturn. EA earning is fucking insane last week, 30% beat on revenue and 60% beat on EPS and raised guidance. TTWO and Activation Blizzard are almost certainly a beat. Why pick TTWO? Fundamentally, Take Two has the best products --- Rockstar never disappoints & arguably the best studio in the world, and GTA & Red Dead Online will keep generating insane returns for years. Technically, it has highest PE ratio. And we all know what this means --- **so long revevue growth continues, high PE leads to even higher PE, and negative PE leads to even more negative PE!**\n\nFact: TTWO rises better than EA after EA's awesome earning!\n\nIf TTWO also beats earning / profit / guidance by >30%, stock will easily moon another 10% in a few trading days. The only caveat is stock already rises quite a lot during this quarter, which is why I feel ITM call (or selling put, or stock) is safer than OTM call, in case the beat is not that large & stock rises more gradually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why DIS:** the stock is technically in a turning point right now --- low volume and narrow trading range for weeks. Yes parks revenue will suffer, yes movie theater will close for a while. But does it matter???? People say the same negative things when SPY was at 220, and stock only rebound when all bad things are priced in. DIS is one of the rare stocks that is still very undervalued, but at the same time has strong growth potential. All bad things are priced in for DIS, and stock can easily moon for a blowout Disney + subscription, or virus treatment / vaccine outlook from now to year end.\n\nWhy buy before earning: they will disclose most up-to-date Disney + subscription number then. If the subscription number tops 80M or higher, that is a 150% increase vs Q1 number (Q1 3.31 has 33M or so; by 5.5 Q1 report they said 55M; so 80M at 8.4 seems likely). Revenue / earning / cash are not going to matter (so long it is not too bad). The Disney + growth is the real catalyst that may push stock back to 130 or even 150 during August / September.  All it matters is whether Disney + growth is strong enough, so the company can be viewed as a tech / growth stock --- when analysts started claiming TSLA is tech not auto, stock tripled from there....Plus, DIS OTM options are dirt cheap right now.\n\nPS: some may say NFLX didn't rise after ER, but NFLX rised >50% already during Q2; and NFLX is in fact still stable after issuing a bad Q3 guidance\n\nPPS: irrelevant, just a shoutout to this hidden gem I saw Friday in this sub --- big upside and low downside play as a Pharma company: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0mzmy/the\\_next\\_yolo\\_for\\_500\\_profit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0mzmy/the_next_yolo_for_500_profit/) ARK holds about 1% of RDHL. Enough said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nTTWO rocks. Hope you all enjoy the tendies. ITM call or selling puts absolutely prints. If OTM call, better sell tomorrow due to potential IV crush or pullback.\n\nTomorrow onto DIS. OTM call has a chance to print huge depending on market reaction to Disney + subscription.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nDIS is flying for now. Earning is mediocre, but people like its transition to streaming company. Disney + will offer premium access for Mulan and new movies starting September. Absolutely huge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth picks work great this time. Hope some of you make tendies.
