{"title": "How to value a company like CRSP?", "selftext": "CRSP did their quarterly reports two weeks ago and had wider than expected earnings. But the more I dug into this company, the harder it became to value them. This seems to be a common trend in ARK investments, as TSLA and SQ pose a very similar challenge.\n\nLet me get into it in my detail:\n\nCRSP is company that was created upon the technology founded by Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier. While at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, she was able to identify a way to target specific sections of DNA. This discovery was productized and is now known as CRSPR/Cas9. Not to be mistaken for the company which is Crispr Therapeutics.\n\nCRSPR/Cas9 is a combination of a RNA (the CRSPR part) and Cas9 (the enyzme that targets cells part). The combination of these two components enters cells and then specifically deactivates certain DNA sequences and replaces them with inactive elements. This allows the treatment to effectively \"cure\" certain illnesses. They can do this in-vivo (ie. on a live patient) or ex-vivo (ie. in a blood sample that is transfused into a live patient).\n\nRight now, CRSP has 4 areas of focus:\n\n1. Blood diseases - ie. Sickle Cell\n\n2. Oncology - ie. CAR-T treatment using stem cells\n\n3. Regenerative Medicine - ie. Type 1diabetes\n\n4. In Vivo Approaches - ie. MD and CF\n\n\nEach of these areas has different candidate solutions that are in various stages of clinical trials. The furthest along are the blood disease and oncology treatments. The results of those are proving to be promising based on the findings within the quarterly reports.\n\nNow here's the biggest problem I have with all this. If you read any of the articles about CRSP, they focus on revenues, earnings and profit. CRSP has no products on the market. They currently only make income through what they call \"collaborative revenue\". They currently partner with three companies to develop the treatments above:\n\n1. Vertex\n\n2. Viacyte\n\n3. Bayer\n\nTheir revenues year-over-year are exclusively based on these companies giving them money to continue their research. CRSP runs up significant debt, as any highly speculative pharma company would do as almost all their spending is on R&D. CRSP has no marketing team, no sales team, no quotas, no product. I would even venture as far as to say that the total-available-market assessment of their technology is nebulous as well. We could probably find the total number of individuals within the world with Sickle Cell Disease, but how many of them would be able to afford or receive such a novel and progressive treatment as CRSP is proposing? This is truly disruptive, so valuing this company becomes hard!\n\nIt brings me to my core question. How do you value a company like CRSP? Looking at current net income is completely worthless. Their revenue streams are basically funny money paid by their partnerships to continue research. As an example, in 2017 they made $40M in collaboration revenue. In 2018 they made $3M. In 2019 they made $290M. In 2019, they posted their first profitable year and had net income of $66M.\n\nIn comparison, their 2020 6months collaboration revenue was $201k compared to $646k last year. They're on track to post a HUGE loss this year as their research and development spending this year is 1.5x as much as last year with their collaboration revenue down by one-third.\n\nAnd again, this is funny money! If Bayer or Vertex or Viacyte wanted, they could easily just dump 250M into CRSP and make them profitable. One thing I did find, that could have an impact on the stock price, CRSP tends to see their largest quarter collaborative revenue cash infusion in Q3. In 2019 and 2018, thats when they got huge sums of money. In 2019, they made $211M of their $290M collaborative revenue in Q3. In 2018, they made $500k of their $3M collaborative revenue in Q3.\n\n\nSo getting back to my core question: Analysts seem to be focusing all their articles and price targets  only on revenue numbers. Which doesn't make sense for this company...\n\nAs a individual investor, how would you go about valuing a company like this to understand the \"right price to enter a position\"? Given this is all funny money, I feel the only way to enter CRSP is through pure DCA if you fundamentally believe in their technology. And then keep a close eye on their trial results, and watch the price action based on the results to create your own individual model of CRSP's valuation.\n\nAnyone else have any ideas?", "id": "i5qv5i", "created_utc": 1596851797.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah.

It\u2019s just the easiest target as proof-of-principle. We can remove someone\u2019s hematopoietic system, edit it, and give it back. You can\u2019t do that with any other organ.

Unfortunately, I think ARKG's performance speaks for the adoption of the technology. If you look over the past 5 years, ARKG has had middling performance, going from $20 a share to $37 share before COVID hit, and actually having underperforming VOO in the first 4 years and then only recently overperforming it during COVID lockdown.\n\nThis entire performance gives me pause as it makes me feel like maybe society isn't ready for genomic biotech quite yet.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

Analysts need a number to focus on and they picked revenue because it shows how much potential their investment backers think they have. The amount of money they give Crispr is probably dependent on what data they\u2019ve gathered at the end of each trial. In 2017 they proved they could edit genes in Vito and in 2019 they started human trials(the price increase going into 2020).  So the big companies that provide the money for them to keep researching are doing what you\u2019re last paragraph suggests just without regards to the market. Analysts just use that number to evaluate their stock. I\u2019d imagine one way to get a good price point is by trying to calculate how much revenue they could make when they are able to completely cure one of the diseases they are working on. That will be a lot higher then where their price is now. As their progress increases there will probably be more companies willing to collaborate with large amounts of money as well. \n\nEdit: Spending a lot on research and development would be a good sign. It increases the resources they have to work on the problems and increases the likely hood another breakthrough will occur.\n\nEdit 2: If I was a big company I wouldn\u2019t just dump a lot in to make Crispr profitable.

{"title": "Intel CEO bought $400k of Intel stock & upcoming Tiger Lake", "selftext": "Apparently he bought the dip with an average price of $50/share, which makes today price look like a good deal. This makes me wonder if he believes that Intel will recover from its infamous 7nm delay announcement. It\u2019s almost like he wants to get the worst news out first, and any good news after that will sound like a great news. There will be a presentation in Aug 13 by Intel chief architect about its new Tiger Lake, which is said to be launch in Sep 2. And it is said that they plan to ramp up production of Tiger Lake by 40% more than previously intended. It sounds to me that Intel is betting big on Tiger Lake. Based on recent benchmark, Intel i7-1165G7 10nm CPU is 20-35% faster than AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 4800U 7nm CPU in single-threaded workloads. Even though Intel CPU only has 4 cores (vs 8 cores in AMD CPU), it is only 6-17% slower than AMD CPU.\nSo performance-wise, Intel 10nm CPU still looks pretty competitive against AMD 7nm. With deep pocket, Intel can price Tiger Lake lower than usual to stop AMD from gaining market share.\nWill Tiger Lake become a hit? I think there might be a chance.\n\nUpdate (8/14): Intel chieft archiect believes Intel\u2019s new transistor making method will improve performance by 20%.

{"title": "MP Minerals, the Indirect TSLA play", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n**What are Rare Earth Minerals and why should I care?**\n\nThe Pentagon wants to end the USA's dependence on China for Rare Earth minerals crucial in most electronics. We all know that when the Pentagon wants to do something, they do so with excessive spending and gross oversight, ie anyone who found a shiny rock is getting Gov Money (Somewhat related article I didn't read but will use as proof - [here](https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-wants-end-reliance-china-160742301.html))\n\n**What Makes MP Special?**\n\nThey make a compound called NdPr used in magnets to power electric engines. Ie, your Tesla needs MP to be mad, so, you win no matter what whether NKLA isn't a scam, or TSLA moons even more. China makes 80% of the global, but Trump and China aren't doing so great rn so add in uncertainty there, the fact that MP makes 15% of global NdPr you can almost guarantee that they will have strong demand for their product.\n\n**When is this IPO? What are my plays?**\n\n\" MP Materials, owner and operator of Mountain Pass, the only rare earth mining and processing site of scale in North America, today announced a definitive agreement to merge with Fortress Value Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: FVAC), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (\"Fortress\"). Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will be named MP Materials Corp. and will remain NYSE-listed under the new ticker symbol \"MP\". \" - [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mp-materials-leading-producer-rare-110000962.html)\n\nSo they have a 200 million dollar fully committed Stock Pipe at 10.00 a share, so lets take an arbitrary number, like 15, and lets do long term options so like 2 months after IPO? So look out for MP, not sure when they will IPO, so I will make an update when I find out.\n\nTl;DR - MP $15 ???", "id": "i5s3o1", "created_utc": 1596857070.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Chamath already hyped the FVAC spac although no timeline for its acquiring another company.

The company mines from one of the only rare earth mines in the Western hemisphere and currently ships 100% of it's ore to China for processing. Processing is where the NdPr magnets are actually produced and sold to Tesla or whoever for their EV's. Processing is where the real mining money is and China dominates, controlling like 95% of the market. REE's should be huge as the predicted global demand has been increasing significantly. \n\nMP does have a 15% global presence of mining, but their claim to fame is that they are in the process of converting their mine into a mine and processing facility. When that happens they'll have a strong arm of some of the high demand REE's in the Western hemisphere and start to see some serious profit.
