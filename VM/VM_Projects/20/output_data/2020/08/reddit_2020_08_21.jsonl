If it goes up a little, your position should go up a little. If it goes down a little, your position should go down a little. This is true OTM, ATM or ITM, it doesn't matter.

Exercise is a last resort when things have either gone terribly wrong, or you fell asleep at the wheel and failed to close the position before expiration. What you should be thinking about is how much the spread cost when you opened it and what can you get for it by closing? When that is a sufficiently large positive number, you close for a profit. If on the other hand, it is a sufficiently large negative number, you need to cut your losses and close the position. \n\nDo. Not. Hold. To.

For all we know, the price you are seeing for your position is exactly what it should be by delta alone, with only a minor contribution from volatility.

Because the ASKs are quickly and perfectly mirroring what the underlying is doing and in a delayed order you may get execution only because the underlying dipped down, putting your limit order at ASK and making a market maker happy. I am sitting here looking at the ASK queue for the two exchanges above for all calls between 2270 and 2370 and even though this is 0-transaction asset the ASK queue is just flying - Bid Size is everywhere 16! (so we are probably looking at Susquehanna) but the prices at each strike on ASK appear and then disappear in less than a second while BID adjusts more slowly. Then the Bid size disappears and then returns after a few seconds. You are trading against big time market makers whose computers are calculating bids and asks pricing off of the underlying, for which they the see the price before you because they are on the second floor of the exchange or are using microwave.

But ironically, the pandemic might be saving them from themselves.\n\nHistorically, Netflix has been massively stupid with their spending.  Like crazy spending, more than any other studio in human history, with less discretion and less value testing.  If the stock weren't a dream machine, Netflix would have been mega-bankrupted years ago.\n\nThe best quip I'd heard was that if you took netflix's most (actually) profitable quarter and assumed it would continue forever, it would take 100 years to pay off the current debt, to say nothing of the new debt.\n\nYears ago they should have enacted practices that every other studio uses to avoid bankruptcy.  They needed to cut spending, actually negotiate their content providers down, and make decisions based on value instead of based on nothing.  They spend like an navy of drunken soldiers, but with less thought.  At the same time, they've never been able to get on a price increase trajectory.  Every time they even think about it, they get backlash.\n\nIn 2019 they piloted price increases in test markets to see how much it might slow their growth.  They were horrified and canceled the pilot early because it didn't just slow growth, it wiped it out and started to cause sharp net subscriber losses.  They canceled plans for any price hikes.  \n\nSo they have both a spending problem and a pricing problem, and they stubbornly do the wrong things.\n\nPandemic however has forced them to do what they would never do willingly: put a freeze on the insane spending, and take the time to figure out which pitches they should actually approve, and when they do, what they should pay.  They seemed like would never do that otherwise.\n\nAt the same time, Pandemic has helped with subscriber growth and retention that wasn't happening organically.  \n\nThey are in a race for their lives: run long enough that revenues can someone grow enough to stave off the massive debt monster that's chasing them.

{"title": "Stock Split Rationale", "selftext": "Just wanted to clarify stock splits with people that have confusion about its \u201creal\u201d value. \n\nWhen a stock splits, essentially nothing happens on the market cap side. It\u2019s taking what you have and dividing it up into smaller pieces, but the net value does not change. I\u2019m sure you all understand this. \n\nSo, the arguments about Apple and Tesla stock splits having no effect on the value of the company is effectively true. But here\u2019s what some of you that think this is missing: Retail buyers like us are not concerned about market caps. We care about price! The dollar value per share is what matters. \n\nJust think about the last time you purchased a stock and went to look at its market cap, eps, etc. I can safely assume most people in here are not about that. If you see it looks cheap, it\u2019s a buy. THAT, is the real value of stock splits. \n\nI get the analogy of breaking a pencil in half still yields only one pencil. I just read a retard comment about cutting up a pizza in 100 slices is the same as cutting it into 8. But is it really? If it\u2019s cut in 100 pieces, just about anyone has the stomach to eat it, but when it\u2019s cut in 8, there are significantly fewer people that can or want to eat the slices because of its size. \n\nPoint is, there stock splits broadens the market and makes the stock look much more attractive, and in this market, the \u201clook\u201d is more important than the actual value. \n\nTake it this way, if Apple went for a 100:1 split, and now it\u2019s at $4 a piece. Would you pay $5 to get a share? But you\u2019re paying a premium? Yeah. You would, because the look of it is too appealing and psychology we are made to believe that if anything, it can double. But would you pay $500 to get a share when the stock is at $400? You see the difference in scale?\n\nAnd for those that are talking about fractional shares negating the value of stock splits. Wrong. Fractional shares are significantly less attractive. Take for example, Berkshire Hathaway or any high cost ticker. Would you buy a fractional share and own 0.04 of a share or would you rather see a stock split and own 1 full share? It\u2019s pretty simple, no?\n\nTake tesla as an example: $2000. I have $500, do I want 0.25 of a share or would I want them to split and own a full share.

{"title": "Buy an actual money printer today (HPQ DD)", "selftext": "The world is working and going to school from home, and somehow we still love to murder trees. \n\nAn investor community I\u2019m a part of surfaced a potential opportunity to play HPQ\u2019s earnings on **8/27 after hours.** People are buying printers and ink. \n\nThis is, by all accounts, a boring AF stock, but there is significant mismatch between the stock price, and the amount of social information pointing to outsized interest in printers and ink over the past handful of months due to COVID-19. Pre COVID this stock climbed $20.50 or so up to $23.35 before tumbling. Right now it\u2019s trading at $18.19, having recovered slowly since 3/17. There is plenty of price displacement for us to play with here. \n\nI was going to find a ton of tweets and mom club subs talking about the difficulty of finding printers and ink right now\u2026but today is really the best day to enter this play, so here are some google trend charts instead.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24oloc5leei51.png?width=2332&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ef85797ed97ee615ba67300ee37060f9024302f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ofyc5leei51.png?width=2322&format=png&auto=webp&s=2364320fb705640603ea1d2652f4ac2879893fa0\n\nPosition:\n\n**HPQ 9/18 $19C**\u2026a tad out of the money\u2026but I picked a further exp to protect myself from theta. Will sell at least 65% of my position before the actual earnings call, as I expect analysts to be on this soon to help us take profits before the actual call. Also, IV crush and disappointing calls have been the flavor of this season of earnings.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI called 5 office supply stores in different areas of the US. The consensus is as follows:\n\n1. They are completely out of home printers but get more to sell each week. \n\n2. There are supply issues, but they are still selling more than ever before, and selling more ink cartridges as well.\n\n3.

The stock might run up after earnings, but I'm not convinced. They are likely taking heavy losses on the commercial side of their business. Personal computers are probably doing well, but this story isn't as compelling of a COVID-opportunistic play as say UPS, where drivers were required to rent delivery vehicles because of how many shipments they were handling.\n2. You should read about IV crush and how IV (implied volatility) works. Think about trading options as bets on upward and downward volatility. When you pick an expiration date, you're giving yourself X days of volatility. X being the number of days until expiration. However....some days are more volatile than others. Earnings represent an opportunity for the market to catch up to insider information. Once the cat's out of the bag, the remaining days until expiration have significantly less of a chance to exceed, or further exceed your strike. So the implied volatility  goes down, meaning the prices of your contracts go down.\n\nIf I'm so confident that the information gap is enormous before the call (like I was with UPS), I'll hold through earnings because the price increase will be so dramatic that it'll make the IV loss worth it.
