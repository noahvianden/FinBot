{"title": "Stock Portfolio Tracker and Research Tool made with Google Sheets", "selftext": "TL;DR: Google sheet that tracks your portfolio automatically, and gives you automated insights regarding fundamentals and financial performance for a given ticker symbol.\n\n\\>>[Stock Portfolio Tracker and Research Platform](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uE_BWPBlECgew2TfcM0d1klCljk7qSY22Dz0t84j8Pk/edit?usp=sharing)<<\n\n\\---------------------\n\nHey Everyone,\n\nWanted to share a small project I've been working on recently. Personally my portfolio is spread across a few different brokers and sites, and I didn't have a single place to view my entire portfolio's performance. Because of this I wanted to find a stock portfolio tracker and a way to combine it with a stock research platform for the sake of exploring potential plays.\n\nI was originally inspired by [/u/bobbabuffett](https://www.reddit.com/u/bobbabuffett/) whom created the original [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hngwm8/stocks_and_earnings_spreadsheet_tracker/) which filled 70% of my need, and from which I attempted to improve, mainly out of sheer boredom.\n\n[Stock Portfolio Tracker and Research Platform](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uE_BWPBlECgew2TfcM0d1klCljk7qSY22Dz0t84j8Pk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\\-----------------\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n* 'Portfolio' Tab:\n   * Added Index Performance, Krypto, and Commodity Price Tracking to the Portfolio Tab\n   * Added sparklines to individual stock performance in your Portfolio Holdings\n   * Totalled Cost Basis and Returns\n   * Calculated Total Portfolio Gains/Losses\n* 'Research' Tab:\n   * Added links to definitions on Investopedia for certain metrics (EPS, PE, PEG, RSI, etc)\n   * Added SMA20/50/200 Calculations for DJIA and NASDAQ\n   * Added VIX (Volatility Index) Tracker\n   * Added Dynamic Financial Performance Charts\n      * QoQ revenue and net revenue\n      * QoQ Asset vs Debt\n      * QoQ Free Cash Flow\n   * Added Dynamic Stock Headlines scraped via RSS Feed\n* 'Trading Ideas' Tab\n   * Removed, I personally didn't need it\n* 'Trade Log' Tab\n   * Removed, I personally didn't need it\n* 'Risk/Return' Tab\n   * Removed, I personally didn't need it\n* 'Financials' Tab\n   * Created - Meant to house scraped earnings report data and format it for use in charts on 'Research' tab.\n\n\\-----------------\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. 'Portfolio' Tab\n   1. The Commodities pricing is delayed by 1 week, just given the frequency of updates to the site I'm scraping from. If anyone has a better source, interested to hear.\n2. 'Research' Tab\n   1. I'd love to find other analysts rating systems that could be incorporated beyond Zack's but couldn't find a good source to extract.\n   2. Financial Performance Charts - This data is based on the seemingly only site that still publishes earnings data in an HTML table that can be scraped (All the big players have switched to Javascript to prevent scrapers from collecting data and thus harvesting site traffic). I don't believe this source is particularly accurate and they're delayed in reporting data by \\~5 days. **If anyone knows of a better source, happy to hear.**\n   3. Related Headlines: This is pulling purely from Yahoo Finance as they're the only source I could find that sorts news by ticker symbol in the URL. I'd like to include diverse news sources, but couldn't find others that structure news in such a way.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nThis was a really fun project and I learned a lot regarding the capabilities of Google Sheets, that being said, this same functionality is available through major stock brokerage accounts, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance with less work. This was merely a project to see what's possible.\n\nThanks and enjoy\n\n(PS If you decide to improve upon it, I'd love to see what you come up with - Share it back here in the comments)", "id": "i1irun", "created_utc": 1596241143.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "This is amazing.
