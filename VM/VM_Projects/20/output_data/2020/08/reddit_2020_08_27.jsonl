Then there's la-la land, the stocks that aren't suffering but aren't booming (most banks, coca cola, etc.).

No stimulus in conjunction with a high unemployment will hault retail sales. With a vaccine, mortgage rates will start to creep back up, with will hurt the housing market. Once a vaccine is available, if the economy doesn't bounce back instantly, you'll see the market react. That, mixed with the election, is when a crash will occur.\n\nSo enjoy the gains.

But since establishing that goal in its 2012 Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Fed has averaged inflation of only about 1.6%, touching 2% only briefly in 2018.\n\n>In 2019, the Fed launched a nationwide listening tour to see if it could tweak its statement with the objective of nudging inflation up toward its target.\n\n>On Thursday morning, Powell announced the conclusion of that review and said the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had unanimously approved new language that would allow for inflation moderately above 2% \u201cfor some time\u201d following periods where inflation \u201chas been running persistently\u201d below that target. \n\n>The strategy is known as flexible average inflation targeting, in part because the Fed will not use a particular mathematical formula to define a time horizon over which 2% inflation is achieved.\n\n>\u201cOf course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act,\u201d Powell said.\n\n\n\n>Powell emphasized in his speech that although the major changes address its Congressional mandate on price stability, the Fed still places a heavy priority on its other dual mandate of maximum employment.\n\n>The revised statement now says the Fed\u2019s policy decisions need to be guided by assessments of \u201cthe shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.\u201d\n\n>Powell\u2019s remarks, delivered virtually to the Fed\u2019s annual Jackson Hole meeting, describe the change as a reflection of \u201cour view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.\u201d\n\n>The Fed also added language that commits the FOMC to \u201cuse its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d The statement will now also require the Fed to undertake a \u201cthorough\u201d review of the statement every five years.", "id": "ihl05r", "created_utc": 1598534839.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR\n1.

{"title": "PSA for IB investors: TSLA margin rate currently at ~77% due to their Collateral Value Pricing (CVP) policy", "selftext": "TLDR (for real):  \n**The CVP margin rate (currently 77.9%) is actually just based on a cap on the $/share you can borrow. Which means the borrowable $ amount will not go down with the price. The cap on $/share is based on how low the stock has been in the last year.**\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nCVP = the lowest adjusted average price over 20 consecutive trading days in the past year\n\nCVP Margin Rate = Close Price \u2013 CVP / Close Price\n\nWhat's important to note here is the nature of this equation. It's very much different from the static margin percentage that is normally applied. With the static (currently 40%) margin rate, when the stock value drops, the amount you can borrow also drops, which obviously is what causes margin calls (or with IB, immediate liquidation :) ).\n\nBut with CVP, the percent is dependent on the current price. So the rate goes down when the stock goes down. It essentially acts as a CAP on the dollar amount you can borrow. That cap is the CVP which is about $490 per share right now. So you can only borrow $490 per share.\n\nIf the share price were to drop again, then eventually the CVP rate would drop below the standard rate, and then the actual dollar amount you can borrow against your shares would begin dropping with the share price (like usual). \n\nSo moral of the story is that the CVP margin rate won't actually cause any unexpected liquidation. It just caps the $/share you can borrow. \n\n------------------------------\n  \n  \nGot this response direct from IB:\n\n>IBKR continually reviews its margin requirements with the objective of striking a balance between reasonable leverage and prudent risk management.The leverage offered on TSLA shares has been reduced due to our Collateral Value Pricing (CVP) policy. \n\n>The collateral value pricing policy was put in place by IBKR's upper management team and has been completely vetted and reviewed on numerous occasions. As you note, the implementation of the collateral value price (CVP) calculation constrains the amount of margin loan value (MLV) that IBKR is willing to lend to an account based on a new collateral value price (CVP). The purpose of CVP is to protect IBKR from a scenario in which a stock has a run up in price, for which we then allow a client to purchase the stock at the top using the nominal margin rate and the stock subsequently returns to its prior lower price level in a rapid decline. If the descent is greater than the nominal margin interval the potential for loss to IBKR will increase. We seek to set CVP at a level which the stock can reasonably sustain. \n\n>The current CVP Margin rate for TSLA is approximately 77%. \n\n>Regards,  \n>Frank  \n>IBKR Risk Group\n\nUpdate:\nThey gave me some more information including TSLA's current CVP and how it's used to calculate the CVP margin rate. \n\n>IBKR's CVP Margin Policy has been in effect for a number of years. The CVP Margin Rate acts as a delta-based house charge. A net delta is calculated for your entire TSLA position which is multiplied by the CVP margin rate and stock value. This policy is not exclusive to TSLA. It applies to all equities. \n\n>Current CVP = 493.126  \n>TSLA = 2,235.890  \n>CVP Margin Rate = 77.9% \n\n>CVP Margin Rate = Close Price \u2013 CVP / Close Price. \n\n>(2,235.890 - 493.126) / 2,235.890 = 77.9%\n\nUpdate 2:\nFinally!!

{"title": "Thermo Fisher (TMO) DD", "selftext": "Thermo Fisher is a leading biotech company that supplies materials and reagents for numerous applications from diagnostics to basic everyday research. TMO has positioned itself uniquely to perform well and see terrific profits from Covid-19 testing. They have supplied kits for RT-PCR (acute infections of Covid-19) globally and these kits are increasing in demand. \n\nI am a researcher in the biomedical sciences working to develop novel diagnostics that will likely be used in the next 5 years (let's say 10 to be conservative). Currently, RT-PCR is the best method of detecting acute infections of Covid-19 and TMO is dominating the testing field. I collaborate with a lab that is currently running 6,000 tests a day at my university and they plan to keep this up throughout the fall. We are just one university and universities across the nation, as well as workplaces and hospitals, will continue to test their staff members or students until Covid-19 is handled and we have no clue when they will come. Since universities have begun bringing students back to campus and opening up operations expect a dramatic increase in testing using RT-PCR.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means the universities, hospitals, workplaces, etc. are spending thousands of dollars a day to test their personnel. Who is supplying the vast majority of these tests? TMO.\n\nTMO has earnings coming up mid-October and I fully expect that they will completely blow away earnings and there is currently no hype for a run up. Some time mid-September I expect a steady price increase as people begin to see the advantage TMO has in the market. Currently, I have no positions in TMO but I will pick up some Calls mid-to-late September to catch the run-up to earnings.\n\nTMO dominates the testing supplies, but there are some alternatives that you can look into as well:\n\n* Qiagen (QGEN): Supplies RNA extraction kits used to isolate patient RNA (FDA approved, CDC recommended).\n* Danaher (DHR): Supplies nucleic acids (IDT) just has blown up with current research and also owns Beckman Coulter which supplies plate readers that can read thousands of samples within a couple hours (news just broke).\n* BioRad (BIO): Supplies qPCR machines, which also analyze the patient samples.\n\nI'm focusing on TMO and QGEN and I see a serious advantage with TMO. DHR and BIO mostly supply machines with regards to Covid-19 and less money is made from that. I truly don't think the insane amount of testing kits TMO is providing is priced in yet.
