The issue is, say you keep writing covered calls as the stock skyrockets. And you keep getting assigned. Then you\u2019ve got 0 shares of stock for a period of time until you buy 100 more shares. You\u2019ve still got the long call. If you end up with 0 shares of AAPL during January 2021 and the put is ITM and exercised, you\u2019ll be short 100 shares.

It is not normal to make a ton of money by playing market fluctuations. It may seem so, but it is not. So I would say treat stocks like business ownership rather than a piece of paper. The low interest rate game may have another year or two left, or it could all end tomorrow. Either way, the long term outlook of the market is one of slower growth. I would just keep that in mind. Wait for your pitch, when you find your pitch, swing and swing big.\n\nAlso (and keep in mind I am old school), I never hold more than five or six stocks at one time.

I simply feel their business models aren't sustainable, or they are frauds (SRNE) (KODK)\n\nI know this topic is rarely discussed in this sub, as it is not directly focused on making capital gains % from utilizing theta decay. \n\nI'm curious if any of you have had any success short selling or playing long shorts. \n\nDo you have any examples of your success or failures?\n\nI keep asking myself. \"If I have to put up the capital anyway, why not try to be a little more opportunistic.\" Although the risk is a lot higher, if I do enough DD, and devote my time to enough research, I could in theory come out on top.

My suggestion/concerns about what you outline are more about your general thesis. For example, you list some stocks where you think their business may be unsustainable.\n\nSRNE: (disclosure... I'm long on this, though I do day trade some of it.) It's partly a COVID play, but at it's core it had value before COVID. Look at the company, at LinkedIn, etc. It's a real deal. Now that's not to say it won't go up and down. In fact, it's been amazingly volatile at times and you can make $$$ on either side of the trade if your timing is good. But... the basic thesis that it's fundamentally flawed and therefore a good short is likely false and could hurt you. (Note that the class actions you mentioned have largely disappeared and the Hinderberg stuff has been shown to be demonstrably wrong, with the company now taking action against. them) And, had you naked shorted SRNE before the weird, no good reason rise awhile ago all the way up to 20, you might have been deeply, deeply screwed, whereas if you shorted a week later when it tanked, you'd have done well. Would you have gotten the timing right?\n\nAAL: Just as with other airlines, they're trash right now. However, if you're short the day someone comes up with a real vax or therapeutic, that's the day airlines, cruise ships, movies, etc. etc. will rocket. Again, you can make money on either side, but your thesis about fundamental flaws is - I believe - likely incorrect.\n\nKODK: May very well have been some sketchy stuff going on there. But... still, it's kind of an outlier. No one could have known. Someone could have looked at the crazy chart and said, \"no way, I'm going short,\" and they'd have been right. But - as far as I know - it's pretty hard to detect fraud.\n\nSo you say you want to be more opportunistic and part of that apparently includes shorting. Fine. But what I'm suggesting to you - again - is that your core thesis for each of the examples you listed is a stretch. Perhaps adjust this thinking a bit and look for those businesses that you think are going to take hits, with. your intent - as Bill points out about sizing and stops - to have clear exits. For example, if news comes out with one of the COVID stocks has an apparent winning solution; if you're spring loaded to short 5 others that are not that stock, you may have a nice win there. (Assuming you get out relatively quickly before people realize that 'winner' only works X per cent of the time and there's room for 10 winners.) The risks to Uber may be greater than Lyft as they face legal issues with their contractor/employee issues. That's a thesis, (maybe right, maybe wrong), about that stock.\n\nSo finally, when you say, \"I simply feel their business models aren't sustainable, or they are frauds (SRNE) (KODK)\" I'm just suggesting to you that's not really a solid strategy. That's not analysis. That's maybe guessing/hoping. Sorry to hear you've had some struggles, but I hope that with whatever investing or trading decisions you make, you do so rationally based on solid individual beliefs about your targets that are based on a bit more research rather than apparently on instinct. Sometimes gut feelings are spot on, but they can also completely blow up a trading account. Best of luck.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey broski. I appreciate the response, but I have a few counterpoints I would like to rebuttal with. \n\nSorrento: My theory is fundamentally flawed? You might have confirmation bias brother.\n\nThe class action suits haven't \"disappeared\" class actions lawsuits don't just disappear brother. Two of them have scheduled court dates for 2021 respectively. Hindenburg's research wrong? Where has that been proven? With the share price now deflated down to $8 I see nothing but the opposite of your opinion. Sorrento has taken no legal action against Hindenburg other than a press release saying they are considering taking legal action. They won't because, they can't win that battle. The fact is, Sorrento doesn't have an actual product that has any value in the marketplace. Yale beat them to it with spit testing. Sorrento has in fact never actually brought a product to market and sold it in the market. This is a typical pump and dump scheme. Even today the share price dropped 20% because the U.S. government shifted its focus to convalescent plasma treatments, among others. Sorrento in fact has never actually sold anything other than media hype. If you're long, I would reconsider. Sorrento is Nikola is pharmaceutical form. Never made or sold a product, but hyped the market about them. So my theory is based on a very solid understanding that they burn cash like no other, and have no actual physical product they can ever deliver in time to be a competitor. I don't know how that constitutes as a gut feeling or just pure speculation, but I respect your opinion to think otherwise. \n\n\nAmerican Airlines - I can't agree more about them all being trash. Where I disagree is that once a vaccine is announced, it will take years to fully immunize the world populous to have any lasting effect on the travel sector. I know this to be relatively true, being I hold a PhD in neurology and minored in pharmacology. I believe it will be a good one to three years before the travel industry starts to experience any real relief from this pandemic. I'm doubtful they would rocket any time soon. American airlines in specific will likely go under, because of their burn rate. Today they announced their workforce will shrink by 40,000 including 19,000 involuntary cuts if they don't receive more gov aid, which is around 32% of their workforce in entirety. Based on current demand levels, American said it now plans to fly less than 50% of its normal schedule in the fourth quarter, with international flying reduced to only a quarter of 2019 levels. While I think they are likely to receive more aid because that industry will be somewhat pivotal to economic recovery in the future. I think involuntary cuts will still happen and if I'm being optimistic, their workforce will probably reduce by another 10%-15%, certainly not the full 30%+. Again, I'm not making assumptions, I'm assessing these businesses in a practical manner. There is very little guesswork here. No operating capital and no employees leads to insolvency. Much more, getting gov aid to simply pay employees and not improve the business, leads to chapter 11 sooner than later. \n\nKodak - What a mess. Man that thing is anyone's guess. I tend to think they won't beat that investigation even though that press release may save their ass. As someone in this business with a Series 7, I never have much confidence in the SEC doing it's job. They are just so understaffed and unequipped to deal with these situations now days. \n\nI just find it hard to believe that a company like them that went bankrupt back in 2011, and now makes Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, Software and Solutions, and Consumer and Film have any place in base ingredient vaccine manufacturing business. I'm quite convinced they do not possess the infrastructure to even make that happen. It would require them to sell off almost every piece of equipment they have, retro fit their print press factories, and completely restructure the business. It would easily take 5-10 years to even make such a feat attainable. I'm super confounded on how it's even possible for them.\n\nBack in January 2018, Kodak announced plans to launch KodakCoin, a photographer-oriented blockchain cryptocurrency, and that was going to be their new business model, which plainly put is retarded. They are a printing company trying to be vaccine manufacturers. It just doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. They sold off their biggest money maker years ago. Which was Pro-Tek Media Preservation Services, a film storage company in Burbank that catered to storing prints for Hollywood. Rather than develop server space to come into the digital age, they sold it, and decided to try and make a bitcoin for photographers lol. I don't think I'm off base in harshly judging their business model as being totally incoherent lol.\n\nWhile I appreciate the concern in your response, I just don't think I'm making irrational nor emotional judgments about these companies. I think I'm presenting solid arguments and counterpoints as to why they are likely to not be successful by doing exactly what you suggest. Fundamentals! To which I agree completely. Airlines will eventually get bail outs with share repurchasing restrictions and life will go on. Almost everyone else I put on that list, based on hours of research I think they are likely to fail. Shorting is speculation, and has it's risks, but with a case like Sorrento I feel very confident in shorting them. I will be posting my positions on the thetagang website so we can all revisit the topic a few months from now. I'm sure I'll be wrong in a few cases. I've have yet to short any companies on that list except FUV, which I made $220 so far lol. Not a lot, but that one was a correct choice. I'll definitely stay diligent. \n\nThanks for taking the time to respond.
