{"title": "Apple Hits $2 Trillion Market Cap, Is AAPL Stock Still A Buy?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nApple has just hit an incredible milestone. You may have guessed it. Yes, it became the first [tech stock](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks) to pass the $2 trillion mark. This comes ahead of a 4-for-1 stock split that will lower the entry barrier for prospective investors to buy shares. The iPhone maker has beaten the other tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft to reach this milestone. Of course, this is a largely symbolic figure. There\u2019s nothing significant changing fundamentally. But the bottom line is that Apple is doing very, very well. Maybe you are like many other investors who are contemplating whether to [buy AAPL stock now](https://stockmarket.com/featured/apple-heres-how-it-could-impact-your-investments-2020-08-13). Let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s ahead for the iPhone maker and why the growth is here to stay.\n\n## Ongoing Transition To 5G Network To Give AAPL Stock A Boost\n\nOne of the key drivers in Apple stock growth would be the next-generation 5G mobile technology. Technology analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush said that \u201cApple has a \u2018once in a decade\u2019 opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months as we estimate roughly 350 million of Cupertino\u2019s 950 million iPhones worldwide are in the window of an upgrade opportunity.\u201d\n\nMany experts believe the new 5G iPhone would be a game-changer and it will be a defining chapter for the world\u2019s largest tech company. Apple is slated to launch iPhone 12 in October. The question is, how important is the iPhone 12 to Apple? Ives said that Wedbush believes that many on Wall Street \u201care underestimating the massive pent-up demand around this super cycle for Apple, which remains the opportunity for the bulls.\u201d\n\n## Apple Services & Wearables Segment Continues To Outperform\n\nEven though the novel coronavirus continues to persist in the second quarter, Apple was able to generate growth, with revenue that increased by 1%. For the fiscal third quarter, Apple produced a record, with revenue up 11% year over year, while earnings per share grew 18%. This came amid the strong performance among tech companies. And investors have certainly been piling into tech companies that benefited during the stay-at-home orders. These include companies with products and services related to remote work, cloud computing, music, and video streaming, and digital payments, among others.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s not to say when the pandemic is over, the services segment would drop. In fact, before the pandemic, services have already recorded strong growth. Wearables such as AirPods and Apple Watch have also recorded strong growth. They could see a higher number of unit sales in the next quarter.\n\nThe pandemic only served as a catalyst to boost AAPL stock higher when the hardware sales were recording slower growth. As a matter of fact, the pandemic actually played to Apple\u2019s strengths. The company saw Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+ and the App Store all performing better during the lockdown.\u00a0\n\n## Is Apple Stock To Buy?\n\nApple is likely to see increasing retail demand for AAPL stock after the stock split. The company is able to leverage its massive user base to drive strong growth in its services and wearables segment. The highly anticipated first 5G iPhone will likely whet the appetite of iPhone stalwarts globally. These are some of the few areas investors might want to pay attention to see if AAPL can reach the $3 trillion mark in the near to medium term. With all these in mind, is it any surprise to say that Apple is still one of the [best tech stocks to buy](https://stockmarket.com/investing/looking-for-best-tech-stocks-to-buy-2-to-watch-right-now-2020-07-16)?", "id": "idfm4b", "created_utc": 1597947339.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I honestly think AAPL still has room to grow.

When it ran up, it was based on certain expectations. The fact that analysts raised their own expectations the day before earnings suggests that they are accounting for that run up. So when earnings still beats the updated expectations, it\u2019s hard for me to process what it is exactly that was priced in to begin with. I guess they\u2019re up a little from yesterday\u2019s close so it\u2019s better than how they were doing after hours yesterday, though.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ah, I see your confusion. Don't take analyst's PT seriously. These are 1-year PTs, meaning if the company continues to do what they are doing the PT set by the analyst is the expected value of the company at one year. These are wildly inaccurate, but do have a strong psychological influence over new investors. They can help you identify general price trends, but in general are not accurate. \n\nThe key to understanding when people will take profits, no matter what the earnings report says, depends a lot on the overall market. If the market is pushing into new highs (like recently), people question the value or want to lock in better-than-expected profits. However, if the market is considered undervalued, like it was late March and April, no one was willing to sell, and in spite of poor earnings prices continued to climb. ATH = \"I had better take my gains.\", ATL= \"buy the dip!\".\n\nIf you start reading how such-and-such a company is doing all these great things, and you can see the utility of what they are doing,  you will also notice a large creep in price as earnings approach. 10-30% is not unusual for highly speculative companies like tech and semiconductors (fintech is also in this category). You can bet that either the day of, or right after, earnings there will be profit taking, particularly if we are at ATHs in the market.\n\nThe reason why this happens is largely dependent on the psychology of expected returns and risk aversion. We have been indoctrinated with the idea that anything over a ~7% gain is beating the market. So if you just rode a 30% gain on the back of NVDA, you will likely want to realize that profit, which is why many people sell - fear of losing the money they just made. \n\nAn easy way to play this is to buy the sell-off dip. I commonly buy shares during the run up, and once the sell-off dips happens (assuming earnings were good, and I think the price is justified) I'll buy more shares. Sometimes I'll buy calls for a quick day trade.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Something small I would like to add in as well would be in OPs case, he may be wondering and honestly myself too, why did UPS run up so much and make me literally 1000s when everyone said it was priced in there already the same way.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That was a rare case of UPS being undervalued.

{"title": "SKYBORG GET HYPE LITERALLY GUARANTEED, AIRPLANES GO UP", "selftext": " \n\nAlright nerds buckle in.\n\nI see a distinct lack of defence contractors and in particular aerospace defence posted on here. Y'all are pussies. Guaranteed tendies as war is eternal. The big boys are set for the most part. LMT has JSF income for the next forever, NOC has B-21 which is going great. Boeing can't seem to unfuck itself which is good news for what I'm about to talk about.\n\nThe Air Force is sick and tired of procurement cycles that last multiple decades. They're feeling very burnt by the cancellation of F-22 production now that we need a modern 5th gen air superiority fighter. The F-35 is looking to finally be proving its worth, but the AF and DOD at large are looking to avoid that sort of 20+ year contract next time around. The murmurs about the \"Digital Century Series\" are indicative of this.\n\nIn the near term, we need to ensure air superiority and dominance, with our limited number of Air Superiority Fighters. The F-35 is good enough to partially bridge the gap, but we need to try new things to make it more effective. That's where Skyborg comes in.\n\nAF Big Safari, AF Research Lab, and the Rapid Capabilities Office have been spearheading programs lately designed to streamline the procurement process and get capabilities fielded in a fraction of the time it'd normally take. They have a huge role in the B-21 and they're a major reason why it's going so smoothly and why I'm so enthusiastic about Skyborg. They've had a project called \"Loyal Wingman\" in development for a little bit and it's been quietly making successful tests. Here's an old article about it. [https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10475/usaf-research-lab-has-released-this-image-of-its-low-cost-stealthy-drone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10475/usaf-research-lab-has-released-this-image-of-its-low-cost-stealthy-drone)\n\nLoyal Wingman is basically the idea of a sidekick drone that carries weapons, sensors, and is smart enough to mostly handle itself. A few would be paired with every fighter and they would be used to augment its capabilities, giving it better situational awareness and even being capable of suiciding itself to take out a target that might be too heavily defended for a manned aircraft. It's since been largely rolled in to a program dubbed \"Skyborg.\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtUxfFaYAPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtUxfFaYAPs) is a video.\n\nThere are three contractors who were awarded contracts to vie for the big skyborg contract. It's looking to be a $400M+ contract for the first winner. Only one will get it. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TENDIES.\n\n1. Boeing. Their product is probably pretty good and it's likely to win Australia's Skyborg contract. But it's ABSOLUTELY not going to win the AF's competition. Why? Boeing FUCKED their reputation with the AF. The KC-46 program is FUCKED beyond belief and big daddy AF is NOT HAPPY. Ignore the small F-15EX orders, they're political bones thrown to senators and congressmen. They were handed a SURE THING contract for the AF's next Tanker, and they went out of their way to fuck it up. Seriously, I can't state how much of an inconvenience this has been to the pentagon and how much it will continue to be for the next decade or so. For an AF program where rapid development and delivery is paramount, they're lucky they got this far. Their ONLY hope is Trump makes the pentagon choose them.\n2. Northrop Grumman. The winners of the B-21 competition are in a good position, but I've heard literally nothing about their Skyborg proposal, other than they're looking to team up with small startups. I do know that the B-21 program is eating up a lot of their attention at the moment, especially as we get close to delivery of the first few production models, and their unveiling. It's a hush-hush program. My understanding is AFRL is looking towards smaller contractors though, so I'd lean away from NG.\n3. General Atomics: Private company, who cares. They make the Reaper and Predator. Not exciting. Moving on\n4. Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. They WILL WIN the contract. They've got good relationships with the AF and DOD at large. They primarily have made target drones before and have a reputation as a company that delivers with minimal fuss. They've got their fingers in a bunch of low profile pies. [Lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/SEQ-3_Laser_Weapon_System), [Satellite management](https://www.satellitetoday.com/government-military/2020/05/04/kratos-receives-contract-to-monitor-space-force-bandwidth/), [Target Drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_Engineering_BQM-167_Skeeter) and more. Their Financials are [sound](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KTOS/financials?p=KTOS), they consistently outperform estimated eps and the shitty robin hood advisers say it's a 100% buy. Their proposed drone, the XQ-58 Valkyrie has been in testing for a little bit and has hit its targets smoothly, with their whole development going incredibly well for a defence program. [Their drone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26825/air-forces-secretive-xq-58a-valkyrie-experimental-combat-drone-emerges-after-first-flight) seems to be able to hit the AFRL/AF's cost targets as well, because it's basically a commercial target drone in a fancy suit. There was even an F-15 [spotted testing](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/34982/highly-modified-air-launched-loyal-wingman-drone-tested-with-air-force-f-15-eagle) with a Kratos target drone acting as a loyal wingman/skyborg testbed, reflecting how far along the program is and the level of AF involvement. They're going to win. Mostly because their product is the better one, but partly because the DOD doesn't want Boeing to win and NG is too busy to take this on.\n\nCompetition winner will likely be announced October, if my crystal ball isn't completely miscalibrated. I don't have insider info, but I do have a bunch of airplane nerd friends who all agree that the XQ-58 WILL WIN. A win for KTOS will likely see their stock price jump, possibly independent of the rest of the market as their market really isn't the civilian market. This will also position them well for future contracts and they are more than capable of picking them up.\n\nAlso, their name is cool.\n\nThey were in a dip today, buy now.\n\nMy play? 1/15/21 $30 Call.

{"title": "For anyone holding in TSLA and/or AAPL right now", "selftext": "Two speculations/questions struck me today that I'd really appreciate any input or feedback on that anyone may have.\n\n* TSLA obviously has been exploding this past week and AAPL growth has remained comparatively stunted. I've attributed these differences mainly to TSLA's seemingly endless stream of good news and AAPL's current bad news (the Epic battle & now DOJ antitrust unit oversight) which is showing the result of many people choosing to place their money on TSLA which appears to be the better bet.\n\nWhat intrigues me is that despite AAPL's negative press, it has still pushed substantially upward.. Could cautious investors have had a plan this whole time to ride the TSLA wave up all week and then bailout at the last minute, probably sometime tomorrow (possibly in after hours) and then pile funds hard into AAPL? It's price has proved pretty resilient to it's issues this week and currently I think it is comparatively undervalued to TSLA.....\n\n\\*AMZN is obviously an enormous stock and overdue for a split. They've also faced alot of inquiry and pressure about splitting now that AAPL & TSLA have stepped up, and it seems likely that AMZN will because they would almost definitely greatly benefit from such a move.\n\nI imagine most people will be frozen into their TSLAs & AAPLs next week so as not to miss out on the split action. Amid this frenzy, could AMZN see tomorrow as a tactical time to announce a split of their own? With the right split ratio offered and time frame (buy in deadline Aug 28), they could easily get many investors to reassign their funds, which would simultaneously be striking blows against TSLA & AAPL share prices and boosting AMZN's own.....\n\nSo I dont really know wtf to do right now other than place bets on all 3.
