{"title": "8/14 BIDU Earnings Play: 2x6 Short Put Ratio Spread (0 cost, $975 profit)", "selftext": "# The Trade:\n\nI sold a 1x3 ratio spread 121/116p for a 0.60 credit and a 1x3 ratio spread 122/116p for a 0.25 credit. I exited for a 8.90 credit for a total of 9.75 net profit. Collateral was \\~9k. Breakeven was 400 shares at $113.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvutue3r71h51.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=41ede4dd5ad110f5ab3d7c6491db75d80307fe2e\n\n# Strategy:\n\nThis strategy is identical to the [NFLX earnings play I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5ogh9/717_nflx_earnings_play_1x3_short_ratio_put_spread/). I saw that BIDU was consolidating around the 78.6% retracement level for a few days and noticed that it was able to close above it the day before earnings, but on the day of earnings, it sold off and closed well below it. I thought that if BIDU didn't meet earnings expectations, it would sell off. I wanted to make a long play to the downside, but I didn't want to pay to do it, AND if I was wrong, I still wanted to make some money. I chose 116 as my short strike because it was a little bit below the 200 period moving average, and I saw that buyers stepped in at that level a week before. If BIDU were to move to the downside, I was pretty confident that it would move down to the 200 MA, or if it gapped down past it, it would try and test it again or find support at the 50% retracement which is above my breakeven. BIDU closed the day at $116.74.\n\n[Daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/7g5oalp0c1h51.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=d392ea63017d9fd48741d0ec0ea63bd6480e8a69)\n\n# Managing the trade:\n\nMy exit strategy for if I was wrong was to roll the puts down and out as far as I can and keep the long puts. I was wrong if BIDU failed to get support at the 50% retracement level ($113.19). BIDU opened above the 200 MA (light blue) and got rejected from it early. I then drew a trend line (purple) from the earnings AH low to the next swing low to see if the market would respect it, and it did. Around 11 AM, BIDU busted through the 200 MA. I waited for a retest and sold the 122p to increase my delta in case it rallied for the rest of the day. I kept the 121p in case it was a false breakout and sure enough, it lost the 200 MA shortly after. I waited for it to get to the purple trendline, and if it lost the trendline, I was going to short shares. Instead, it bounced off of it and danced around the 200 MA before closing at $116.74. I closed my short puts for pennies before close, and exercised my 121p (was hard to get filled) and covered at $117.01.\n\nSomething to note was that I had to manage this trade very closely as my gamma exposure was very high. At one point my position was +500 theta and -150 gamma. I was ready to close at market if there was a sell off.\n\n[5 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/r7x5ozrja1h51.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ebf2dfdb48ac16646a2f0676cdfa0f4da30920)\n\nPositions and P/L:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtavtuqga1h51.png?width=1832&format=png&auto=webp&s=0243af3b4963ebd4c3935d5ce518d78c98543d06\n\nHope this was interesting!", "id": "i9v6d8", "created_utc": 1597441983.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Man these are higher level strategies.

Sold some here and there but I started with 5 shares and it\u2019s split several times since then. I\u2019m waiting for it to split again once it hits around 120 or so.
