But the fact that prices have dropped so *little* in spite of Covid-19 is *amazing*. That Tesla is able to offload every Model Y they make with minor price adjustments, a referral program, a few new markets and a private lease program is *fantastic* news, because none of those adjustments are enough to significantly impact Tesla's profit margins. I would in fact like to reverse the argument and say that if Tesla *wasn't* starting to see a demand problem by now in the current environment, that would be *very* clear proof that they were leaving far, far too much money on the table with the old price point for the Model Y and should have initially priced it at least $3k higher, which would have resulted in an additional $100M extra profit that could have been used to e.g. spin up Model 2 development.\n\nTesla are correctly balancing supply against demand, they know what they're doing, stop thinking Elon Musk is giving money away for no particular reason.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"]}

{"title": "News & Shit for Retards", "selftext": "Here's all the significant news and stories that fucked your FD's last week. \n\nSingapore started the week off by entering into a technical recession by reporting their 2nd quarter GDP had shrank to 41.2% marking its 2nd quarter of contraction. The construction industry was hurt the most with a contraction of 54.7% while the services industry contracted 13.6%. Despite the contraction and having some of the highest infection rates of Covid 19 in the region (46,200 infected, 26 dead\u2026 must be nice) they\u2019re expected to bounce back quickly due to 70 billion dollars of stimulus being provided which is about 20% of their GDP. \n\nDepending on which bank you are, you either had a great or terrible week when it comes to earnings. Wells Fargo $WFC reported a loss of 2.4 billion in the second quarter and cut their dividend payment from 51 cents a share to 10 cents a share. During the conference call they painted a grim picture predicting that the economic crisis will be significantly worse and longer than their 1st quarter prediction, resulting in them adding another 8.4 billion to their credit loss reserves. This is double the amount of 4 billion they added to their credit loss reserves during Q1. Bank of America $BAC also added an additional 4billion to their credit loss reserves. Other banks such as JPM, BAC, C, GS reported better earnings but only due to significant gains within their trading desk departments. (Good job guys) BAC saw a 50% increase in trading revenue, while JPM had an increase of 79%, and GS topped the list with a 93% increase in trading revenue. Despite the large increases in trading revenue, banks still face many challenges trying to generate revenue in other areas in a sustained low interest rate environment with mass credit defaults on the horizon. On many of the conference calls, banking CEOs expressed concern of a deeper contraction in GDP than originally predicted and high sustained rates of unemployment throughout 2020, with some predicting 2022 being the earliest chance of economic recovery. \n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order this week revoking Hong Kong's special status it had previously received from the US. The revoking was due to Hong Kong no longer being autonomous from China after the Chinese government's implementation of a new security law. As a result many Hong Kong passport holders will lose special privileges, Hong Kong will lose trade privileges it had previously enjoyed although exact changes have not yet been specified, and the US will also stop the sale of Defense equipment to Hong Kong. Chinese officials have vowed retaliation of similar nature towards the US. While this news was breaking, it was largely overshadowed by an announcement from $MRNA that phase 1 trials were able to produce Covid antibodies in each one of their 45 patients. They have also announced they will begin a phase 3 30,000 patient study on July 27th to further study the effectiveness and side effects of the vaccine. Meanwhile Russia continues to outsmart us all by hacking into companies that are developing covid vaccines rather than spend time and money on developing their own. \n\nAs Corona Virus cases continue to rise at a faster pace, states are beginning to roll back reopening measures and reimpose orders to keep businesses close. As a result more small business owners are choosing to shut their doors due to uncertainty of when lockdown measures will be fully lifted, unable to keep up with the mounting debt and costs of reopening only to be shut down again. In a startling report by \u201cYelps economic impact report\u201d, 41% of all closures reported on yelp have been permanent closures, with the rate of closures accelerating in May and June. A recent study by Goldman Sachs expects that 84% of PPP recipients will exhaust their PPP loans by the first week of August, and do not expect to be able to survive under current conditions without further government support or implementing layoffs after exhausting their loan. Many states are trying to avoid another full on lock down with even Dr. Fauci advocating that further lockdowns should be a last resort. Many Americans and businesses continue to wait in limbo while congress decides exactly how much money it will spend on a 2nd stimulus package. Democrats have voted to spend up to 3 trillion while republicans have countered with only 1 trillion in spending for a 2nd stimulus bill. With the recurring shutdowns, more business and economists are beginning to feel that 3 trillion is more inline with what would be needed to continue to support the economy. \n\nAlthough the 1.3 million initial jobless claims of this week was a new low since the lockdowns began, it marks the 17th week straight of over 1 million initial jobless claims. This does not include over 900K of federal relief claims which would make the total number of new claims closer to 2.4 million. Continuing jobless claims fell by 420K dropping the total number of people receiving unemployment insurance to 17 million. New jobless claims have steadied at around the 1.3 million mark for a few weeks now leaving economists to believe that the momentum of reopening has stalled, and may in fact begin rising again in the coming weeks.
