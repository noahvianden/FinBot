{"title": "Can someone convince me of why I should bother to learn fundamental analysis?", "selftext": "I don't really see the point. Suppose you're an aggressive investor who's trying to make a lot of money quickly. You can use fundamentals to determine which companies are undervalued, buy them, and then wait for them to reach their full potential. But even if you've identified a stock that's undervalued, you don't know when it will actually start to rise by looking at fundamentals alone. Technical analysis determines when a stock will rise or fall. The purpose of technical analysis is pretty clear: to identify signals that a stock will go up before it actually does, and to identify when a stock has reached its peak so you can sell and maximize your gains.\n\nBut suppose you're a different type of investor. Instead of aggressively chasing gains, you want to make safe investments, hold them for long periods of time, and grow your money that way. But if that's your approach, I don't know why you would bother spending time researching fundamentals when you can just buy broad ETFs that will be safer than any one company, and are as close to a guarantee of long-run gains as you'll find.\n\nAll that I've said so far doesn't even address the current climate. We're in the middle of a deep recession that's only going to get worse as unemployment benefits run out and landlords are allowed to evict residents again. But in the middle of all this, the market is challenging all-time highs! It's pretty clear that we're in the middle of an asset bubble that's being inflated by the Federal Reserve's willingness to continue printing money without end. The upshot of this is that the market is completely divorced from fundamentals. In my research, I've come across rules like \"don't buy if the P/E ratio is above 20 because that means the stock is inflated.\" But all the big stocks, AMZN, TSLA, and NFLX to name a few, have P/E ratios so high, they make a ratio of 20 look downright conservative. And they keep growing with no signs of slowing down.\n\nTo recap, fundamental analysis doesn't help you if you're looking to aggressively make money because it doesn't tell you when to buy. It doesn't help if you're trying to make safe investments and hold them, because broad ETFs are safer. And right now, stock prices have nothing to do with fundamentals. I don't get it. I know Warren Buffett and plenty of other millionaires made their money using fundamentals, so I'm more than willing to admit that they're right and I'm wrong if someone can make the case.

There is also systematic active investing strategies which firms like AQR, Renaissance Technologies and many others use. But systematic investing can be done by retail investors on a basic level. In terms of the use of P/E if someone gives you a hard and fast rule of \"don't buy over X\" they don't have a good grasp on how this work is actually done. P/E is a proxy for the DCF process and if a company is in a large and growing industry you can justify a valuation well over 20x and say the company is cheap.

There is a massive red flag right off the jump in the study when you look at the number of years analyzed and this is a real challenge to overcome in some studies just from lack of data. You need a backtest that spans multiple cycles no matter what you are analyzing. Most studies in the US are 40 or more depending on the data. I just evaluated a bunch of factors for our screening process and had to throw out R&D % of sales I believe it was because even though it had a great alpha, high minus low was good and a high t-stat the sample size was too small so you have to toss it and it was much longer than a year to 2 years. The other thing you need to do is you need to have a real economic rationale for why the inefficiency exists which  you might be able to do with technical analysis. \n\nThis is something you theoretically should be able to do for TA because it's price and volume derived so those metric should be able to be scientificly analyzed if tou define specific criteria for being long or not.

You mentioned in your first post that part of using fundamentals is identifying buy points, do you know any good online sources that go into that in more detail? It's definitely something I'd like to learn more about.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes catalysts is how they are referred to. So taking a step back the first thing is on a specific position as a fundamental investor you need to at least think about how you are able to identify a mispricing that other investors are not seeing. And mispricings are the exception not the rule so when you perform due diligence on a company you think is mispriced, you want to approach it as though the market is right and you are wrong and you need to figure out what you are missing that the market is saying you are wrong about. If you've done all the work you can think of and you still can't convince yourself that the market price is right you can then conclude that there is a real mispricing through process of elimination. \n\nIf there is a mispricing how do you see it and others don't? You need to identify what your edge is on other investors. There are 3 real edges that are generally accepted. 1. You have legal information that others don't have. And if they had your information they would realize the stock is mispriced.  There is a lot of attention today on alternative data such as satellite imagery of parking lots and you compare them over time and you can figure out sales more accurately than people without that data. Or using tracking data for private jets to see if one company is visiting another's HQ which may suggest an acquisition. 2. Is you have all the same data as everyone else but you process it more accurately than they do. This is a bit of hubris but does happen. There are many hedge funds that specialize in niche areas such as being an all biotech firm and their strategy is that they have PhDs and experts in the medical science and they process the public data better than aggregate market price. It may also be a combination of #1 and #2. The 3rd is a structural inefficiency that everyone sees but not everyone can trade on it. For example when a large cap company spins off a small cap. The way the money management business works is the large money managers will have a specific investment mandate. A common part of that mandate is market cap size so if all of a sudden they get a small cap spin off they have to sell regardless of the actual fundamental merits of the business. Because virtually the whole shareholder base will have the same issue there will be massive selling of the spin off in the first week or so for non-fundamental reasons and that causes the mispricing. \n\nWhen you have a catalyst it needs to fit with your perceived edge. So for the biotech investor they may say the market is pricing the stock as if it has a 40% chance of FDA approval for a major drug but we know the therapy is better than that and we say it has a 80% chance. The catalyst for them is the FDA approval and you may not know the exact date but you know the month or the quarter that will be announced in and that becomes the way you can time the investment. That would be an example of a \"hard\" catalyst because the date is known in a somewhat accurate way. There are also \"soft' catalysts where there is no date but there is something that will force analysts to confront your reality. This could be that there is too much dead weight costs at a company and margins are materially below peers and a new CEO comes in and promises to work on margins and trim the fat. Your soft catalyst is undefined in terms of timing but you believe margins are X they can be 2*X and as they move up the stock will get repriced. These are things that analysts work on at many firms and the purpose of most activist hedge funds is to force the catalyst by getting on the board, replacing management, selling an undervalued asset the firm owns, etc. Some fundamental firms don't use catalysts some will never buy a stock without one.

After reading what passes as DD on this sub I am frankly surprised that anyone here makes any money at all. That is why I have decided to share some analysis that I have been conducting and hopefully inspire some of the higher-functioning people around here to share ideas with me.(Note that I know very little about finance^please ^help ^me and you need to do your own DD).  \n  \n**Investors might typically use movements in volume to confirm trends in the movements of a stock\u2019s value. For our purposes we will define a breakout event as one in which the volume exceeds the 10-day moving average and the stock price moves up by at least 0.5%.** it is very arbitrary but it seems good enough for me. A substantial price movement combined with larger than average volume should reflect positive investor sentiment and thus continued upward movement which will be measured by the equity price 1, 5, 15, and 25 trading days following the 'breakout' day. We will look at MSFT, JNJ, and SPY.  \n  \n**METHODS:** Scrape Close Price and Volume data from(07-10-2019 to 07-02/20202) with python and yfinance. Identify days in which a breakout occurs(volume > 10-day moving average AND close price >0.5% from previous close) and then check ahead (1,5,15,25) days to determine price movement. I will tally up all the 1,5,15,25 day differences to calculate avg and std deviation growth following breakout. To account for general upward price movement of a stock I will calculate the baseline percentage of trading days which are higher than (1,5,15,25) days ago and subtract it from the breakout only percentage.  \n  \n**KEY**  \nCorrected Green Prob = Percentage of days following a breakout that were green minus the baseline percentage of days that just end up green. For instance JNJ logged  36 breakout days. Of those 36 days 20 had a higher price point 15 days later results in 55.55%. However, if you were to select any random day and compare that to the price 15 days later you would find that 52.46% of them were higher 15 days later. Therefore the Corrected Green Prob would be equal to 55.55-52.46 or 2.22%.   \nAvg Growth = The average difference in price between a breakout day and (1,5,15,25) days later.   \nStd Dev Growth = Standard deviation of the differences in price between a breakout day and (1,5,15,25) days later.   \n  \n**SPY**   \n[SPY breakout summary](https://imgur.com/CMh5FGD)  \n21 of 244 days were classified as a breakout. \n  \n**MSFT**   \n[breakout summary](https://imgur.com/3K6vrMu)  \n47 of 244 days were classified as a breakout.  \n  \n**JNJ**   \n[JNJ Breakout summary](https://imgur.com/TMV5a73)  \n36 of 244 days were classified as a breakout. \n  \n**Discussion**   \nResults are pretty mixed. I could definitely clean up my statistical methods and would like to run some hypothesis tests to make anything resembling a confident statement on what effect breakout days have on an equity. Looking at the corrected green prob values, you might say that the day after a breakout is more likely to be red(maybe traders locking in profit?) but generally a week or two later that stock is more likely to be even higher. The numbers are close enough that I can't really say for sure. I will probably run this same analysis on low volume, dump days and see how the price recovers.  \n\ntl;dr buy calls the day after a breakout", "id": "hlxp9r", "created_utc": 1593995917.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Sir this is a shopify", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1319459229707718}, {"body": ">I feel bad for you guys, I really do.

{"title": "SLM - Everyone else makes money off students, why shouldn't you?", "selftext": "SLM is one of the remaining pieces of the old Sallie Mae. They originate and service loans for college students. Hey, everyone else is making money off students, why shouldn't you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I get into the nuts and bolts of why I took up a sizable oct16 8 call position, don't be a moron and bet your uncle's farm on this. I obviously think I'm picking a winner, and while I generally do much better than Buffett, the market, most autists, I have my share of losses. The goal is to win more than 50% of the time, and live to play another day when a streak of losses hits. I win more than 50% of the time, but if you YOLO this and this is one of my epic losers, that's your fault. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow some key points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) I believe SLM's stock price is depressed for a couple reasons. They still have the cloud of the old Sallie Mae's missteps hanging over them, and the question of what will happen to higher education in the era of the coronavirus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Sallie Mae split into SLM and Navient the latter in theory assumed all the liability from previous issues, which you can and should research on your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of talk in the news about rising COVID cases. That scares a lot of people, and it should give you pause, but in the end cases don't matter... deaths do. Death rates have come way down and they are still going down. Treatment protocols have come a long way. We have a rapidly rising amount of immunity in the country. Sure there will be young people that tragically die from COVID, but if you are 20 years old do you put your life on hold when the chances of dying from a car wreck are way greater than from COVID? While it may be a bit of a bumpy ride, students are going to go back to school... some of them for 15 years living in mom's basement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) SLM's P/E is around 4. For comparison AMZN is 138. Some of that is justified, but not that much. The fundamentals look pretty good to me. Pull it up and look for yourself. Too much to post in what is already going to be a long post. My objective is to point you to an potential opportunity, not to post 20 hours of research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) SLM has a tendency to have very nice price spikes after earnings. I cashed in on Jan 22nd earnings report with a huge gap up, and I hope to do it again. Even after Apr's earnings it trended up despite being in the middle of the coronavirus mess. Next earnings is July 22nd and I want to be in a few weeks early in case, hopefully positive, news, interest, and speculation take hold before the actual release.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow far will it rise? Right now it's trading around $7 and it seems to have a pretty solid historical ceiling around $12.  Buying strikes at $8 has a very reasonable chance to be well in the money if earnings are once again solid and there isn't bad news about defaults. I never set hard sell targets, because I think it's stupid to not assimilate new data and re-evaluate the situation, but I would probably take at least some profits with any move about the underlying price of $10-11. If I don't get a big bump after earnings, I will probably start reducing part of my position over the next couple months to limit downside risk.  Which leads me into why an Oct expiration?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to play these calls longer than I normally would in case if the earnings don't provide a pop I potentially have a second chance of a bump (call it a second place raffle) with the school year resuming and hopefully the concern over covid fading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again don't bet uncle's farm. Don't take my word for it. I know less than the insiders, and the insiders and RH autists rule the kingdom. If for some reason SLM takes off and goes to some inappropriate value, don't be a bag holder. Be happy with your profits even if it still may have some remaining tendies some lucky fool will eat this time.
