It's also very volatile, typically going through significant sell-offs and rallies every year.\n\nAt $800 TSLA could have either rallied or tanked. Investing in TSLA at all time highs is effectively a coin flip -- in 3 months you could be 50% up or 50% down. And if you think you knew it was going up, you didn't, because TSLA isn't trading on fundamentals or anything that can be reasonably predicted. No one saw this coming, including you.\n\nWhat worries me is that I'm seeing a lot of people flipping coins in the markets at the moment and thinking they're geniuses because it happened to work out. But the reality is we've just seen one of the most aggressive market rallies in history and people are mistaking reckless risk for genius.\n\nUnfortunately most investors need to learn this the hard way, but risk management is the only thing that matters long-term.\n\nRisk/reward in TSLA today is simply ridiculous. Given it's now trading with a market cap of over $260B does anyone realistically see this stock going up another 20-30% anytime soon? But even if you did see it happening, what's the risk to the downside? 50% downside risk almost seems too low at the point. I wouldn't be at all surprised if people investing in TSLA today lost 60% of their position over the next few years. These just aren't favourable odds.

I understand people have different investment thesis. But there is no reasonable argument for TSLA being a $0.5T or a $1T company any time soon. The people pushing this narrative are equally as deluded as those who invested during the dot-com bubble thinking they were geniuses because valuations kept going up regardless of fundamentals.\n\nAs I said originally, there is no fundamental justification for TSLAs valuation. Stocks can trade with a rich valuation for a long time, but never have I seen a stock trade at such an aggressive valuation as TSLA without a correction at some point. I have no idea when that correction will come, but I'd be stunned if it doesn't.\n\nI'm not saying TSLA can't be a trillion dollar company at some point, but those betting on that at this moment in time are playing an extremely risky game. Investing is about balancing risk/reward. TSLA is so heavily weighted towards risk right now that even if you think it's theoretically possible they could reach a $1T valuation at some point you also have to accept theres a risk that at any point TSLA could be valued like a typical car company again and you lose most of your investment.\n\nBut to your point, if you invested in AMZN or MSFT during the height of the dotcom bubble it would have been extremely foolish. Most dot-com companies got wiped out completely, and of the few survivors (some of which you listed) took many years to recover their previous valuations.

Not just for Tesla but SpaceX talks as well.  \n\nGiven what he's accomplished so far, I absolutely would not bet against Elon achieving all 12 TSLA compensation tranches by 2028.
