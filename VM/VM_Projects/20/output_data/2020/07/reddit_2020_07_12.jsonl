Figure out a target price for Amazon, meaning, your estimate of what Amazon is worth, and sell the option when the stock hits that price. \n\n\n2. If you can't be confident in that, get out now and sit in cash until you come up with a viable strategy and a plan before you enter the trade. The NASDAQ which is tech-focussed isn't going to outpace the S&P 500, which is a more accurate picture of the broad big-business economy, forever.  People were just pouring money over the last few months into tech stocks, Tesla because of its sales growth, vaccine stocks, Facebook because people need social messaging even more due to isolation, Amazon for obvious reasons, people have less choices to shop at, but that rally will fizzle.  And this near-vertical rally in the NASDAQ has been driven to simply won't last. It will collapse in a matter of months if not days or weeks. That doesn't matter if you are very confident in your estimate of how much AMZN is really worth in dollar terms, and it's trading well underneath that figure....but are you? \n\n\nCompare the NASDAQ chart to the S&P 500 from 1999-2002, ^GSPC vs. ^IXIC on yahoo finance and you'll see what I mean. Have a look at that divergence now. See anything repeating? \n\n\nThen once you're out and you have your money, decide on an investment strategy.\n\n\nBasically what I do is Buffett style value investing. That's based on buying something you think is worth X, for 1/2 X, and then just sitting on it and only getting out if I decide I was wrong about the economic value. \n\n\nBuffett has a famous quotation. \"I don't care about the price, I care about the value.\" So he uses straight stock and doesn't use stoplosses.\n\n\nYou have to care about the price with a deep-in-the money long-term option but not much.
