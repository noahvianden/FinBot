MSFT shifted its attention into much more important markets like cloud computing. And instead of fighting Linux head on they embraced it. Because of those changes MSFT has been able to reap those rewards in the past 10 years.\n\nIn short, just DCA into MSFT.

Since the March 2020 lows, the market, especially the Nasdaq, has gone crazy to the upside. There are several reasons for the gains, the main one being the unprecedented actions of The Federal Reserve. I won't go into details on all The FED has done. I think that it important to remember that The FED has promised to continue what they are doing with no deadline to stop, plus they are ready and willing to do even more! \n     Some other reasons for why it has become too easy:\n1) It's an election year. Trump does not have much left to brag besides the stock market so he will instruct Mnuchin and Powell to keep the money flowing.\n2) The FAANG stocks along with Microsoft and a few others are leading the market higher.\n3) Investors have no where else to put their money so they are piling into stocks. You can't make any money holding cash, and even Junk bonds don't pay much interest.\n4) The Herd Mentality. As the rally continues, some of the people who stayed on the sidelines are jumping in because they see other people making money from stocks.\n5) Some investors are so confident that they are buying stocks on Margin. Been there done that, about twenty years ago. Nothing like a \"margin call\" to ruin your day.\n6) \"Buying on the Dip\" seems to work every time. Each time the market has suffered a setback those who have bought on the dip \nhave been rewarded.\n    We are living in strange times so what is happening with the stock market should not have surprised me but it did.
