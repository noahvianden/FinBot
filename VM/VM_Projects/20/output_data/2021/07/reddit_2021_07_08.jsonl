{"title": "Wow what a huge sell off today! I'm scared!", "selftext": "Omg we're selling off lol!  It seems like the sp500 is not holding up as well as the nq.  Is there a reason?\n\nI think all this is healthy though and I've gotten to where I could care less.  I'm tired of always panicking and selling (at loss most of the time) every time CNBC tells us to.  Let me guess.  Tonight they're gonna have on Mohammed El-Erian? Screw em! Even if I lose screw em! I know in 5 years I'll have more money. If not then oh well I'll survive somehow! \n\nI think as long as you hold mostly FANMAG stocks you should be ok for at least the next 5 years and I don't care what anyone says, that's how I feel.  If I end up homeless, then who cares.  In the end we die anyways.  At least I did it my way.\n\nI just really get tired of the CNBC talking heads saying to rotate to this and then rotate back to tech etc etc every other day.  I now just have a balanced portfolio with total market also although I am 50% FANMAG stuff.  Mostly MSFT AAPL (20%), which seem to be holding up ok today.\n\nIn the words of Cramer .... BOTTOM LINE ... Have a balanced portfolio, stop panic selling and trying to time things, select good stocks like MSFT AAPL PYPL GOOGL AMZN LRCX SHW HON UNH some total market, small caps, value and sit back and accept what happens more or less.\n\nAnd understand that, while educational, CNBC is mostly entertainment and about ratings! They can't just say \"Buy QQQ or VTI\" or they wouldn't have viewers.  So they constantly have to tell you something new everyday.  Also understand that, although educated in finance, they're mostly guessing also.\n\nIn the words of Cramer again .....

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 8, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 8, 2021**\n\nStocks dipped across the board today, putting a stop to the recent record-setting rally that has seen both the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) reach countless fresh intraday highs in the last six weeks or so. The SPY and Dow Jones (DIA) both fell roughly 0.9% while the tech-heavy QQQ fared slightly better, closing 0.65% down. It seems there a few differing factors that contributed to the drop today, including but not limited to, (1) rising coronavirus fears outside of the US due to the highly contagious Delta variant, (2) the Fed\u2019s June Meeting Minutes, which showed members are increasingly talking about accelerating the timeline to taper quantitative easing, (3) a disappointing weekly unemployment report, and (4) general profit-taking after such a monster rally in the market. In positive news, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank for the fourth straight day, hovering around a multi-month low at 1.29%, a sign that inflation fears are further tapering. \n\nIn a sign of rising concerns over the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant, the Japanese made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve released the June Meeting minutes, which are notes about what was discussed in the latest meeting, which helps market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery \u201cwas generally seen as not having yet been met\u201d, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, \u201cParticipants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee\u2019s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals\u201d. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.\n\nIn other news, after a strong run of outperformance in reports about the labor market, the most recent weekly unemployment report showed new jobless claims unexpectedly tick higher. According to the Department of Labor, there were 373,000 new jobless claims filed last week, higher than the 350,000 expected. While it is slightly disappointing, jobless claims in the US have been continuously declining for months, a sign that the labor market continues to improve as the US continues to reopen.\n\nIan Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \u201cThe consensus ignored the tendency for unadjusted claims to rise in weeks when July 4 falls on a Sunday, so the risk was always to the upside. But this is noise, not signal. The seasonal adjustments are struggling simultaneously with the July 4 holiday period and the annual automakers\u2019 retooling shutdowns, which can make the headline numbers even more volatile than usual. The noise will persist through late July, but we have no doubt that the underlying trend will remain downwards.\" I agree and remain encouraged by the pace of recovery in the labor market. \n\nAnother potential explanation for today\u2019s pullback, coupled with the other reasons listed, may be general profit taking after such a monster run by the broader market. Since mid-May, the Nasdaq and SPY are up 12.3% and 6% respectively, a great run by any judgement. Nothing ever goes straight up, sometimes dips are needed for the market to recharge for another move higher. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported\n* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. \n* The NFL and Twitter (TWTR) are extending a media partnership that will leverage Twitter Spaces, the social-media network's live-audio feature. The NFL says it has more than 20 Spaces sessions planned for the upcoming season; they will include participation from players and other NFL personalities. Other aspects of the partnership will include postings of curated videos, Twitter polls and other content.\n* Airbus delivered 297 airplanes in the first half of the year after a surge of handover activity in June, the European planemaker said on Thursday. US-rival Boeing (BA), on the other hand, has more orders in the books for planes but only managed to deliver 111 planes so far this year.\n* Tesla (TSLA) introduced a cheaper version of the Model Y in China, as the company is facing increased pressure from Chinese regulators and local competitors. \n* Beyond Meat (BYND) is expanding its product portfolio by launching plant-based chicken-tenders.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Ameriprise Financial (AMP) target raised by UBS Group from $285 to $300 at Buy. Stock currently around $241\n* BlackRock (BLK) target raised by UBS Group from $890 to $984 at Buy.
