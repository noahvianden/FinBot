{"title": "Massive Upside Potential With HVBT", "selftext": "I think the crypto bull run is only in the middle of it's cycle. There is plenty of time left to make money on crypto miners. One in particular stands out. HVBT (HiveBlockChain), is a Canadian company with miners running in Canada, Iceland, as well as Sweden. We all know RIOT and MARA but little attention has been given to HIVE. They are a ***100% clean energy*** play which is attractive given today's battle of the changing climate.\n\nPersonally, in the crypto world, I think ETH is the greatest thing since sliced bread. So much potential for so many use cases with the Ethereum platform. It will certainly be worth a few T in market cap in due time. The flippening from BTC to ETH is also unavoidable. Don't get me wrong they will both have their certain roles in the crypto world, but ultimately Ethereum reigns supreme. BTC can keep its role as a decentralized currency where ETH on the other hand will continue to be the best decentralized platform. There's no competition between the two in their respective roles so they ***will both thrive***. Regardless, HIVE stands to ***gain from both*** as it mines both of the backbones of these systems. Their mines are located in strategic areas with climate that will optimize the conditions needed to operate at maximum efficiency. Here are a few benefits to each location from their website:\n\n**- Canada, Quebec (BTC Mining)**\n\n\\- Competitive costs for green energy and skilled labor + taxes\n\n\\- A significant capacity to expand and flexibility for future operations\n\n**- Sweden (ETH Mining)**\n\n\\- Stable political system which is looking into blockchain opportunities other than justcryptocurrencies\n\n\\- There is an excess of green and renewable energy that will let the company lessen theenvironmental footprint it leaves behind\n\n**- Iceland (ETH/ETC Mining)**\n\n\\- Milder year round temps means less energy needed to cooling down the facilities\n\n\\- Electricity is provided by geothermal and/or hydro resources to lessen the environmental footprint they leave behind\n\n**Bullish Catalysts**\n\n1. The company recently announced they bought over three thousand new miners which immediately increased production by ***46%.***\n2. In October of 2020, they reported their ***best ever quarter***. This further strengthens my belief that crypto is gaining more and more traction than ever before, prolonging the bull market.\n\nIf you are into that technical analysis shit, there's a few things my admittedly untrained eyes see. For one thing, the price action is nearing a possible breakout point upon testing the down channel resistance line if that so happens. I believe that this will indeed break out from there as the ***20 SMA*** is curling up and over the ***50 SMA*** indicating a possible move to the upside due to the Golden Cross forming.\n\n[20 SMA = Pink, 50 SMA = Orange](https://preview.redd.it/an28ir6vavd71.jpg?width=3192&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=828b7a6d205f25338e38d80bd20f3c0406e32741)\n\nThe cherry on top for me is their HODL like mentality. They will be keeping what they mine to produce longer term shareholder value as they create ***the very wave they ride*** in this continuing bull run. They are mining their own investments.\n\nThis is not financial advice and is just a personal and individual opinion/idea that came across my high ass mind. Invest at your own risks and be aware of the risks associated with investments especially those in the world of cryptography.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Positions\n\n775 Shares and planning to buy 1225 more within the month\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "ot18s2", "created_utc": 1627440672.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 28, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**\n\nThe market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.\n\nToday, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. \n\nMoreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nShares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nImportantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects \u201cyear-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the \u201cShop Module\u201d that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. \n* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.\n* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It\u2019s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn\u2019t spend billions to produce and acquire content. \n* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel.

{"title": "Long DTE Protective Puts on top of covered calls.", "selftext": "Using NVDA after hours on 07/27 for my examples. Current price of NVDA: 192.08\n\nTLDR: Adding in a Long Put with a 365+ DTE is a cheap insurance for your covered call position and you can roll covered call profits into the put to \"lock-in\" the profits long term. Note, this is a set up that will lower your risk but will also lower your reward.  \n\n\nRoR = Return on risk. Easier term for these examples than ROI. Just means how much money you earn divided by your maximum loss regardless of probability of that loss.\n\nTotal Account Debit = what is actually coming out of your cash balance. Includes all credits and debits.\n\nPrevious poster was asking about using protective puts as insurance, and I thought it might be valuable to add in a post about using protective puts with long DTE as a form of insurance for your covered call positions (or assigned CSPs). If you use this with a non-assigned CSP you are basically just doing a debit/credit put spread which is not as ideal but can still work. \n\nAssumptions:   \n1) you own 100 shares of a stock (NVDA for this example.)  \n2) you are starting this position as a buy-write  \n3) your risk profile is compatible with <30 delta puts/calls  \n4) you are long term bullish on the stock and would hold the stock for years, but your time horizon wouldn't allow you to take the additional risk of a non-protected position  \n5) you aren't going to be using the wheel or CSPs upon assignment of your CC. you can probably use this for the wheel, but I'm not factoring that into my math.  \n\n\nNVDA price: 192.08  \n28 delta 9/17/2021 $212.50 short call bid price is 4.90  \n28 delta 09/16/2022 $165 long put ask price is 19.10\n\nNormal covered call would debit your account $19,208 - $490 = $18,718. If the stock goes up your maximum profit is $21,250 - $18,718 = $2,532 for a 13.5% RoR. Max loss is your full $18,718 if NVDA nosedives and stays low for your entire time horizon and IV crashes to the point that you can no longer sell covered calls to continue to pull in premium. Odds of this are pretty low, but they exist.\n\nAdding in a protective put, your account is debited $19,208 - $490 + $1,910 = $20,628. If the stock goes up, your max profit is now $21,250 - $20,628 = $622, maximum loss is now $20,628 - $16,500 = $4,128. This means your RoR becomes $622/ $4,128 = 15.06%, so your RoR is higher on your maximum profit and your maximum loss is a LOT lower.\n\nIf you are assigned, you would want to do a new buy-write with your cash on hand. If your total account debit is greater than $21,250 than you'll need to pull money from other investments or margin to fund a new buy-write and will add any difference to your max risk, the $4,128. But if your total account debit is less than $21,250 than you'll be able to roll that difference into one of the three options:\n\n1) you can choose to keep it in the account and \"pay off\" your protective put, this functionally acts like a hedge in case of a debit trade one month. This adds to your total reward, the $622.\n\n2) you can look to see if you can roll your protective put up and out with the credit thus giving you more protection and less risk. This will reduce your max risk by however much you are able to raise the strike price. If you have >6m left in your put you'll probably want to focus on raising your strike price as the theta decay hasn't really started to occur so you'll get more bang for your buck on raising your strike. If you have between 3-6m until expiration it is really up to you on which you want to do depending on if you want to wind down your trade or not. I usually default to increasing the DTE at this stage personally. If you have less than 3m you will either need to increase the DTE or start planning to liquidate the trade.\n\n3) pocket the difference and put it towards other investments or life expenses. This doesn't change the risk or the reward profile of your portfolio for these purposes.\n\nOn the flip side, if your covered call is not assigned, you can sell a new covered call for the next month and do any of the above three.\n\nSummary, you are functionally paying $4.58/day for insurance to protect $16,500 and lower your maximum risk. It does decrease your maximum reward in return, but you can keep using premiums from covered calls and large green days to continually roll your protective put up and forward to lock in more and more profit over time.", "id": "ot0iqw", "created_utc": 1627437953.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "[Just buy calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ln5qsj/the_leaps_are_a_lie_and_the_truth_behind_pmccs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "opposite goals.

But I have not seen any write-ups since last month's run-up to $17.88.\n\nHimax is a unicorn growth and value play.\n\nIn recent weeks, short sellers have hammered down the Taiwanese fabless semiconductor company's share price, aided by volatility in the Asian markets wrought by enforcement actions from Beijing. After hitting a low of \\~$12.25 yesterday, today showed signs of a reversal. Several factors support this reversal. Most critically, Himax is expected to announce record earnings on August 5. Expect shorts to cover over the next few days. Currently priced at $13.45/share, I believe potential profits exceeding 30% - 40% over the next four business days are well within reach. I've put my money on it.\n\nThis is not just a short-term play, though. The forward P/E on this stock is currently ***8.23**. Current P/E is 12.37\u2013before their Q2 earnings announcement. (Note: as of Q1, Himax had full orders through Q2.) Run the stock screeners if you like: I have struggled to find a better value *and* growth play than Himax. Growth outlook looks fantastic continuing into at least 2022. I have been day-trading this due to the volatility with some good results, which I believe is the best way to maximize profits until the share price stabilizes. Otherwise jump in and enjoy an up-and-down ride to analyst price targets of $20-25.\n\nPosition: long and highly leveraged.", "id": "otjz3p", "created_utc": 1627509261.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|20 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12746098637580872}, {"body": "I have 2022 15 calls.
