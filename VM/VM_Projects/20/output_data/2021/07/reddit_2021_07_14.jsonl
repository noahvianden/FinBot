It also will become a major player as a provider for the chip industry and will rule the world of AI.\u00a0\n\nThe stock split had nothing to do with the fundamentals of the company but the stock is up 12% over the past month, a whopping 47% over the last six months, and close to 100% over the past year. I am bullish on NVDA stock and had recommended a buy when the company announced a stock split.\n\nIf you had purchased the stock based on my recommendation at $700, 0n June 9, you would be sitting on gains today. The stock is changing hands today at around $860. There is no stopping the momentum of NVDA stock.\n\nIt is hitting new highs every week and the sooner you buy in, the better your chances at making money. With that in mind, let\u2019s dig deeper into my investment case for NVDA stock.\u00a0\n\n**Red Hot NVDA Stock**\n\nThe pandemic has not been kind to many tech companies but Nvidia is not one of them. It is enjoying red hot business with data centers, gaming, cryptocurrency mining and AI that drive the revenue growth.\n\nKeep in mind that the industry was fighting a chip shortage and this has had an impact on every company but the revenue numbers of Nvidia show that it can sustain the growth in any business condition.\n\nYou name it and Nvidia has it. Right from the date centers to the gaming industry, electric vehicles, and cryptocurrencies, the company has products and services that will thrive in the future. These sectors are only expanding with time and your investment will grow along with them.\u00a0\n\nThe company recently launched\u00a0[Cambridge-1](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/07/ceo-unveils-cambridge-1/), the most powerful supercomputer in the U.K. This technological marvel will allow healthcare experts and scientists to use AI and accelerate the digital biology revolution. It is a $100 million investment by Nvidia.\n\nThe market for AI is massive and Nvidia remains at the forefront of the technology. It is constantly working on building powerful productions around AI and it could drive massive sales for over the next five years.\u00a0\n\nI am not the only one bullish on NVDA stock. KeyBanc analyst [John Vinh](https://thefly.com/news.php?symbol=NVDA) has an Overweight rating with a price target of $950. The analyst believes that the gaming demand will remain robust and will drive sales.\n\nFurther, Rick Schafer, an Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $925 with an Outperform rating. Truist analyst [William Stein](https://thefly.com/news.php?symbol=NVDA) has raised the price target of NVDA stock to $910 and has a buy rating.\n\nThe analyst believes that the data center will generate high revenue as the demand checks are tracking higher and the market will continue to grow.\u00a0\n\n**The Bottom Line on NVDA**\u00a0\n\nWhether you buy NVDA stock now or wait for the dip, the stock is only going higher. There is no doubting the fundamentals of the company and it is only going to grow its market share over the years. Once the ARM deal is settled, there is no looking back.\n\nNvidia is making its presence felt across several industries and the demand for its chips is only increasing each quarter.\n\nThe company will soon announce Q2 results and it could push the stock higher. Now is the right time to add the tech giant to your portfolio.\u00a0\n\nThe company announces Q2 results in mid-August. This will give a perspective about the remaining two quarters.\u00a0\n\nBuy NVDA stock and hold for the long term.\n\n*On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.* *The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com* [*Publishing Guidelines*](https://investorplace.com/corporate/investorplace-publishing-guidelines/)*.*", "id": "ok2zd2", "created_utc": 1626264438.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I believe there will be a -XX% correction after the stock split like with Tesla a year ago.

{"title": "I analyzed the performance of companies in the \u201cbest places to work list\u201d over the past 10 years and benchmarked it against S&P 500. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.\n\nI wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions\n\na. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work\n\nb. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.\n\nI feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.\n\n**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.\n\nFor this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.\n\nAll the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work\n\na. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year\n\nb. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it\u2019s a good long-term investment)\n\nReturns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&P 500 returns \\[1\\] over the same period.\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5krr494ep6b71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79b47975082c92c61f09cf169df626486b03ea9\n\nThe companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \\[2\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zqbo7nkfp6b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f5d1c7ed8783fd74c24a04541281bf6cdd9238)\n\nThe difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.\n\nNow that it\u2019s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/faluhbvgp6b71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b5ca46ebefe2b5e0fa5e438acf1e31fea51f35)\n\nThe best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.\n\nFor our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gpce6e1ip6b71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b3e2139de6f53334bad5770447c5c70474801c3)\n\nI think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.\n\nI think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.\n\nNow you know what to do when the next year's results come out!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing the data and my analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NF48A0p6L4V_79XkJVdOCT_jAdP1vKlC3ix5e44xXXM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the benchmark as S&P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.\n\n\\[2\\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.\n\nIf you found this insightful, please share it with your friends :)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=) | [Facebook](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=) | [Twitter ](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=)| [Reddit](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=)", "id": "ok4wtp", "created_utc": 1626271140.0, "score": 215, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Nice analysis, thank you.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22561004757881165}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah.

Adjusted for inflation that's $1.5billion. The original degenerate gambler, who was banned from every bucket shop in the nation as a kid before he went legit, became rich as fuck, went bankrupt, got rich again, went bankrupt again, made it all back, lost it all for a third time, and finally blew his brains out. I think I got that right. Was a long time ago when I was reading up on him.\n\nOn another occasion, one of his degenerate friends tried to get his wife to baghold his pump n dump, but Livermore caught wind of it before she placed her bet. He couldn't have been more livered, so he shorted the hell out of it on margin before his mate could sell, and made himself a huge profit. His wife came home crying at her loses, but was surprised to find that he wasn't too upset with her for going behind his back.\n\nOne of his lessons was never lose more than 10% of your account on a single trade, because with a 10% loss you only need 11% profit on the next one to make it back. But if you lose 25% you need 40% to make it back, and it only gets worse as the number grows. Sadly for him if you lose your mind your edge goes with it, and those 10% losses wipe you out very quickly when you don't scale down. Hence the commonly accepted 2% rule that everyone in the billionaire class espouses today.\n\nTLDR: Jessy Livermore, the godfather of degenerate gamblers, would've been jacked to the tits on puts right now. They didn't have options when he was trading, so his oldtimie method of choice would be short the weakest stocks with zero protection till your eyes start bleeding on 2:1 margin, all because everyone is pilling into a smaller and smaller number of massive winners.", "id": "okfy1d", "created_utc": 1626303688.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|464|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmhf3q/natural_gas_summer_blitz_crk/) \n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37127527594566345}, {"body": "There is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. \n\n- The degenerate godfather", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It's the sitting and the waiting that makes you the money, before you enter the trade. \n\nEntering a trade is the easy part.
