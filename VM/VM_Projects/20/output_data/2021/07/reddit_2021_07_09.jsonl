{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 9, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday\u2019s declines with the S&P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it\u2019s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.\n\nIn recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. \n\nIn other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China\u2019s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.\n\nKen Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said \u201cThe PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China\u2019s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week\u201d. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nWhile these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. \n* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. \n* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.\n* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. \n* Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I\u2019m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. \n* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV\u2019s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, \u201cFoxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $170 to $182 at Buy.

{"title": "$MLCO - Melco Resorts and Entertainment - Casinos + Bottom of Channel = Tendies", "selftext": "Hello there autists of all shades and creeds, today I'd like to talk to you about **$MLCO**.  Lets start out by getting this out of the way - this is a CHINA stonk.  If you don't want to play with the CCP, stop reading.  Now, if you'd like to make tendies, please continue.\n\nOk, so the basic shiny points of **$MLCO** or Melco Resorts and Entertainment is that it's one of only 6 companies which is allowed to run casinos in Macao, the only region in China which allows gambling.  Basically think of Macao as the Las Vegas of Asia.   On top of that, they own City of Dreams in Manilla and City of Dreams Cyprus, dipping their toes in the Mediterranean.   This company was hit hard during the pandemic, because of obvious reasons, but that's looking to change as vaccines continue to be rolled out, and the CCP lightening up on travel restrictions.\n\nSo now you're like great, how do I make money off this stock?  Well, this puppy looks like it's in the bottom of an upwards channel, and has just bounced off the low point.  Using STD it shows support at 15.75 and 15.12 of the 6mo and 1Y chart respectively.  Yesterday, it managed to hold and today bounce off those levels.  If you look at the yearly chart, you can see it has touched the 14-15 region multiple times since the March 2020 crash, and each time has bounced back.  It's trading lower than prepandemic levels by a significant margin, and only recently touched that region of 20-23 before plummeting back to these levels after Delta variant fears.  Analysts price targets are a high of $30 to a low of $14, so at this price, downside is limited.\n\nLastly, a few days ago a huge whale bought a large number of $18 Jan 2022 calls.  This is what first put this company on my radar.  Do what you want with this info apes, this isn't financial advice.   Look at the chart, read up on **$MLCO** and make decisions for yourselves.  This isn't a short squeeze, it isn't some meme stock, it's just very undervalued compared to it's peers and has a beautiful technical setup.  This post is just to shine a light on the ticker, so you can decide for yourselves.  I personally think this could be a 2x bagger with just shares, and easily more with options within a 4-6 month timeframe.  \n\nPositions: 500 shares @ 15.95 and 20x $18 Jan 2022 calls", "id": "ogxy4y", "created_utc": 1625844542.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|526|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ogxy4y/mlco_melco_resorts_and_entertainment_casinos/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[screen shot of my position ](https://imgur.com/a/uspkvHL)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15925255417823792}, {"body": "Hey u/Raspilito please attach a screenshot of those positions either to the end of the post or as a link in a reply comment to VisualMod \ud83d\udc46", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21546056866645813}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40131875872612}, {"body": "Love it, I\u2019m in", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Ty, just been getting down votes.
