If you set your targets, you need to respect them, despite your emotions.*\n* *You cannot time the market if you do not know the characteristics of the asset over correction, or full bear market scenarios. (Does the asset respect the 10, 50, 100, or 200 day Simple Moving Average.)*\n\n\\*\\*Summary of the above:\\*\\*Even if you are correct, short term movements may still be random, and so your price targets will need to account for that by being conservative. That is to say, if you think the price could reach $6000, then you should \u201csettle\u201d for, say, 30% less depending on the asset held.\n\nSo now I\u2019ve established that I am only timing on yearly trends, let\u2019s take a look at an example. Taking the most recent downturn in the markets we had 3 factors working against us:\n\n* *Tax loss harvesting.*\n* *Omicron*\n* *Tapering*\n\nA **tax loss harvesting** phenomena happens every year, but **is not going to result in a downturn every year**, and as such I believe it to be minor influence on price action.\n\n**Omicron**. Everyone is debating right now the full impact. All we knew was there were a lot of mutations on the protein spike. Delta had 18 mutations, while Omicron was reported to have 43.Given that Delta was able to infect \\~15% vaccinated individuals we can assume the same or worse for Omicron given vaccines are monoclonal. **The biggest factor is how policy makers react**. If lockdowns are even considered, we can expect a 2020-esque downturn. (*You had to piece all this together within 5 days of the news coming out by the way.*)\n\nThe last bit of news was **tapering**. You would need to know a couple things here:\n\n1. First you need to know the [risk curve of asset classes.](https://quaystreet.com/-/media/quaystreet/images/content/articles-pages/risk-profile/riskreturnchart.gif)\n2. Second, you would need to know **how yields on bonds affect the right side of the risk curve** negatively, (cr\\*pto, vc, and small caps.) This is a decent predictor that things will be pretty bad for any \u201crisky\u201d asset.It was my assumption that taken together all 3, we have a decent chance that we would see a modest correction at best, to 2020 style correction at worst if policy makers try to lockdown again.\n\nIn summary. Putting this all together took a lot of time, every day, an hour at minimum and **unless you\u2019re thinking about it all and know how everything works, you would not have gotten out in time.**\n\nLastly, if you did short, buy puts, or hold cash, is there anything you saw not listed that moved you to do so? If you did, what was it?\n\nAnd for fun, predict the correction. I\u2019ll start with it\u2019s now entirely dependent on policy makers.

What this means is that **from a statistical vantage point (keep in mind this is the gold here) you cannot make an educated decision of action**. So in statistics 101 there is this concept of \"P-Value\" which is the idea that you can calculate a random series against an outcome and say with some certainty that the observations are significant. A good example is if you turn your faucet and water comes out. \n\nThe p-value for your faucet turning and water coming out is probably 95% at least; you're pretty confident that today if you went and turned your faucet water would come out. There are times when that result does not occur and conditions that prevent that result from occurring but that is the point; it's not that inverse cannot occur but that you are confident that given a normal day of operations there's a strong likelihood that when you turn your faucet water will come out.\n\nMarkets are the opposite. What makes them \"seem\" random is that there are so many factors in play that you can't determine them; they are actually *pseudo-random*, that is, market prices are deterministic (and discrete) but there are so many participants with so many of their own incentives and devices that if you tried to truly trace back why the price of security X, including the indices, was Y you would pretty much never get there in a single lifetime. \n\nThis is a required preface to talk about what you're saying.\n\nYou've listed three causes and each one has a built in variance in variance, or said another way, each one is a pseudo-random impact that is also affected by it's internal pseudo-randomness, and for one of these it's got real randomness as a \"third\" layer (we are keeping it simple).\n\nA: Tax-Loss Harvesting\n\nThe problem with this as an impact is you can't tell exactly what, in any given portfolio, is being harvested. What this means is that you can't effectively state which stocks, market, or even securities will be impacted or how. The reason why TLH doesn't \"appear\" in the market every year is because not all holdings are in the index of question; that begets the problem of survivorship bias. You basically never see when it happens because either it's so slow you miss it (TLH starts in September actually) or it just doesn't hit your book.\n\nIt's not a random process at all but your outcome is pseudo-random relative to the entirety of the world and it's holdings.\n\nB: Acts of God. Omicron, earthquake, tsunami, hail storm, whatever you want to deal with this is where this goes. This is pseudo-random at the second layer as stated but also has a real random layer such as the outcome for a hurricane's damages and it's path or the virulence of an infection and who it impacts. You may have noticed that every layer of randomness *adds volatility*. That's correct. So Acts of God are worse than manmade decisions such as policy because policy relative to AoG is reactive. I would say that this is the only thing that really matters.\n\nC: Tapering. This is only a single element, it is not really random, and thus only one level of determinants. How people react will be complex but that's it. Yes, there are elements that you can pose that will change this, and yes there are economic policies, but it's all known. There are no unknowns here really. \n\nSo, to time the market, you have to play only on the things that are highly volatile which are noisy which effectively means that the conclusion of not timing the market is sound *if* you're bad at keeping tabs on global events and their scope and the levels of those events and their natures.

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but it seems like you don\u2019t have much experience shorting  going short based on the thought of using a leveraged vix fund instead of just shorting the futures on either the Es or the nq. The waves of a selloff go as follows. \n1. Sharp money sells just before the top (obviously this has happened already)\n2. Large funds start to run out of money/start to lighten up (11/8-11/24ish)\n3. Active traders start to bail (this was the first day of decline)\n4. Margin orders come in and accelerate\n5.retail starts to panic and sells (12/1 \n6.dead cat bounce as retail who has recently learned that if there\u2019s a dip because they believe that smart money is saying coast is clear and once it\u2019s up you you just buy it and sharp money sells it to you (12/3)\n7. Starts to go down again and while all scared money is out already the slow retail looks into how to go not only short but leveraged short after an exceedingly violent move. I specifically check the volume of vxx (retail that doesn\u2019t have the experience loves leveraged etfs because they don\u2019t usually have the margin and belief in their plan that they won\u2019t use leverage. And this if they have the ability for futures (Robinhood traders LOVE VXX)\n8. After the initial drawdown of the final leveraged trades come in (how many times do you make a move and then the market almost immediately swings against you)\u2026 the sharp money buys and the whole process occurs again but to the buy side.

The reason for this is that there is a widespread belief that the data will not be game-changers, with policymakers likely to accelerate the tapering of asset purchases in the face of elevated inflation.\n* The stock market's weekly decline has been extended. Tesla fell about 6.5%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms approached a bear market after a 19.7% drop from a recent peak. Apple fell after news broke that the phones of a number of US State Department employees had been hacked.\n* China's companies listed in the United States fell amid plans by ride-hailing giant Didi Global to exit American exchanges and regulators' plans to force foreign firms to open their books or risk delisting.\n* The US Treasury once again stopped from labeling any foreign economies as currency manipulators, while maintaining that Taiwan and Vietnam met all three criteria for the designation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxkef2nzzl381.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5cbd881d58cea67d9b42887e029fb8922f1d620\n\n[\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA - Friday Dec. 3, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/r7npug/i_spy_ta_friday_dec_3_2021/)\n\n## SPY - Recap - Dec. 3\n\n## Price Action\n\n* *Open: 459.17*\n* *High: 460.30*\n* *Low: 448.92*\n* *Close: 453.42*\n* *Volume: 129,153,600*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7nlier30m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f8a7f07ff48cbb4a8b7eff3d96888f5962ee1a\n\n# SPY - Dec. 6 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (12/3)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 3,195,655 **(28.40% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Call Volume Total: 2,056,247 **(28.66% increase from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.55 **(44.44% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Put Open Interest Total: 13,376,648 **(3.64% increase from yesterday)**\n* Call Open Interest Total: 7,240,937 **(2.79% increase from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.85 **(1.09% increase from yesterday)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4doovrv50m381.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=de83dec0f8f7cc1cd68f1862a6c557b55f14cf30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg3jvop60m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f85bb8036a40986946b552ab4a87960443b2da\n\n# Technical Analysis - 65 min\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2gxlcu80m381.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=81adfd7bc87a12505c39b2e5bc22f2b6c9ebee38\n\n## Commentary:\n\n* Reclaiming 450 support on the false breakout to the downside was the only positive for the Bulls to another brutal week.\n* The 9 SMMA (450.77) has acted as a perfect dip buying opportunity (minus Sept.) throughout the year so it will be interesting to see how that plays out next week.\n* I believe that the Bulls will attempt a run to 459-460 resistance level (pending more FUD news about the new covid variant, taper talks, etc.) early next week.\n   * The first test will be the pivot at 455.67. Best case - they gap above the pivot level on Monday.\n* If Bulls establish support above 462 resistance (on monthly chart) the Christmas rally will be back on the menu and we may test 470 and ATH.\n* If 459-460 holds and Bears clear the 455.67 pivot they shall see 450 again. This would make it a triple bottom from Dec. 1.\n   * I believe the third time will be the charm and they will finally breakthrough support (just too many macro headwinds IMO.)\n* We have a pivotal week ahead of us!\n\n## Levels:\n\n* Support area: 449.67\n* Pivot: 455.67\n* Resistance - 460.04\n* Bullish Targets: 463.39 - 466.98 - 469.68 - 471.21 - 473.78\n* Bearish Targets: 446.88 - 443.43 - 439.88 - 436.39\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n* If Bullish - play to Resistance (460.04) and watch Pivot (455.67). Wait for Resistance break and successful Support test at 460 for more calls.\n* If Bearish - short at Pivot (455.67) or Resistance (460.04) and play to Support, keeping an eye on Pivot for reversal to upside. Wait for Support break and successful Resistance test  at 449.67 for more puts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0p6acnb0m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a222cf46e7f5b496919268870236f31d1714100e\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Bears want to 33.91 - 26.83\n* Bulls want to see 56.89 - 63.65+\n* RSI slightly favors bears.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3wc7l9d0m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5ed4f87b3f41d80a82d13c5c80fdcc81b51bf89\n\n# SPY - Dec. 31, 2021 - The Month Ahead\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8c6xvr9f0m381.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a96399bde3c1d77b2d3ce6b60450668bb8480b\n\n[Old Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cley7jh3l8381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e884d5cf8b53ab4c9225cf2b7b87039b6e5ead2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Support: 448.11\n* Micro Pivot: 453.96\n* Resistance: 470.90\n* Micro Resistance: 462.36\n* Bullish Targets: 481.60 - 488.27 - 496.41 - 503.71\n* Bearish Targets: 443.3.62 - 437.28 - 428.32 - 419.24\n* Currently below Micro Pivot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iurdnzk0m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=5920d7803fcd94ad4662c244309207c799500825\n\n## RSI - 1 Day\n\n* Bulls need 58.76+ for breakout of downtrend.\n* Bears need 33.05 (sept. low on RSI) - 28.54 - 19.71\n* RSI favors Bears\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qt3nc1pm0m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=857bed22813880b1f43af634a7964135b80e04b2\n\n## SMMA Study - 1 Week\n\n* Held the 20 SMMA for the week\n* 20 SMMA is at 450.77\n* The week of 10/4 we nicked the 15 SMMA at 426 .36\n* **If we dip below 450.77 and and establish major resistance below that level we may test the 15 SMMA in the weeks ahead.**\n* **The 15 SMMA is currently sitting at 440.33**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pkjtzco0m381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e23db651097b0a7291224a348379d9e065b9a0\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\ud83c\udf1dNightMan\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.", "id": "r91zcs", "created_utc": 1638660262.0, "score": 215, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07365432381629944}, {"body": "Thankyou for this i enjoy the read alot.

NeRFs are very slow, but can run offline in Dojo. Using a slightly modified NeRF, you can make make the task of the NeRF: \u201cGenerate a 3D model of a road surface such that when viewed from this angle, it matches the reference image of the real road.\u201d You can do this with entire scenes to do 3D scene reconstruction.\n\nThe problem with scene reconstruction is that the 3D scene will not have labels at first. It will just look like a mesh of 3D points. To actually label these points, you can do the following. Here is an example for a dog:\n\n1) Run a standard image recognition on the 2D image to identify the where the dog is in the image. The wonderful thing is that your classifier doesn\u2019t need to be 100% accurate. If it drives closer to the dog and gets a better view that it\u2019s not a dog, it can backtrack in time and undo its classification of that object as a dog.\n2) Run image segmentation to get a mask of only the dog, to avoid any other noise.\n3) Apply NeRFs to generate your best guess model of what the dog looks like, and now that dog model is actually labelled in 3D. This 3D model of the dog will be the dog alone without any other objects.\n4) Slap this dog onto your reconstruction of the scene. Now you have perfect label that\u2019s independent of the actual environment.\n\nThe reason these masks are so important is NeRFs trying to generate a road don\u2019t want to be bothered by noise of other objects like the dog. Let each object generate one by one to get a better reconstruction.\n\nWill this ever run online in the car? Haha, no. These are very very slow and compute heavy. Also not necessary. The actual car runs a lot more coarse Voxel Space filling which recreates the world like minecraft blocks.
