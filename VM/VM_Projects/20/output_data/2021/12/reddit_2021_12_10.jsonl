After a weak sale of 30-year bonds, treasuries pared their rise. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index crept closer to 22.\n* The cost of containing the omicron strain is being calculated, as there is growing concern that it would stymie the economic recovery. According to Bloomberg Economics, new work-from-home guidance in the United Kingdom might cost the country's economy \u00a32 billion ($2.6 billion) per month. According to one study, the omicron variation is 4.2 times more transmissible than the delta variant in its early phases.\n* The global share rise could be derailed further by US consumer inflation data on Friday and a Federal Reserve meeting next week, which could provide indications on the pace of tapering and interest rate increases.\n* The dollar strengthened on Thursday as a report showed that applications for state unemployment benefits in the United States had dropped to their lowest level since 1969. However, economists have raised concerns about the seasonal adjustments required to arrive at that figure. Initial claims increased on an unadjusted basis.\n* Stocks in Europe reversed early gains to trade marginally lower. Among the individual swings, electricite de France sa dropped as the government considers a cap on regulated power rates to help reduce growing electricity prices. Meanwhile, Unicredit spa increased after announcing that it will return at least 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion) to shareholders by 2024.\n* In Asia, China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. officially defaulted on their dollar debt, while the People's Bank of China boosted its foreign currency reserve requirement ratio for the second time this year, following the yuan's highest level since 2018.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uj27gb87xl481.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0e2c4a71447a138beb07b0132148efbf73608e1\n\n[\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA - Wednesday Dec. 8, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/rbf9um/i_spy_ta_wednesday_dec_8_2021/)\n\n## SPY Price Action\n\n* *Open: 468.15*\n* *High: 469.63*\n* *Low: 466.14*\n* *Close: 466.35*\n* *Volume: 57,072,142*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzdigffcxl481.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=8256e42cf219197c75175acefc90119fb9fe88b3\n\n# SPY - Dec. 10 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (12/9)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,651,352 **(13.26% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Call Volume Total: 1,258,868 **(18.284% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.31 **(5.65% increase from yesterday)**\n* Put Open Interest Total: 12,895,480 **(0.19% increase from yesterday)**\n* Call Open Interest Total: 6,658,400 **(2.93% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.94 **(3.19% increase from yesterday)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn13vsbexl481.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca0a8b536c2da634309ccb118736f53cd00de6bb\n\n* 12/10\n* IV: 15.63\n* Dvol: 0.98\n* 461.72 - 470.90\n* Key: 468\n* Crossover: 467\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvpb6tzfxl481.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd0c43e0e4ab3ebf2d1ae46344ff2daa78e0d8ad\n\n# Technical Analysis - 65 min\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kps8tm0ixl481.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=728dcafeaa447a8f0f1d4f401ec47fcbf66c58d0\n\n# Commentary:\n\n* Bulls held 466 into close.

This is not profitable in an uptrending market. In an uptrending market, the most profitable thing to do is to invest the whole lump sum immediately. The tricky part is that no one knows when a market will be uptrending or downtrending, in the short term. We do know that the market will be uptrending in the very long term.... so just invest it all now.\n\nAlso, some people get DCA and perioding investing confused. DCA is when you spread out your lump sum of money over time (most people dont have a large sum of money sitting around though. And if you have a lump sum of money and dont immediately invest it all then there is opportunity cost of the uninvested cash; maybe the market rips higher while youre sitting on cash and you actually miss out on big returns!). Perioding investing is when you take a bit of newly earned money and invest it every few weeks or months... this is what the vast majority of people do. Periodic investing exists because we are all constrained in our monthly cash flow because we all work and get a limited amount of money over time. \n\nIf you are lucky enough to be holding cash while a market crashes then you have to decide when to get back into the market... and no one knows if a particular 5% drop will turn into a 20% drop which will turn into a 60% drop.. what we do know is that over the very long term the markets will recover. What we do know is that a 5% drop is much more common than a 20% drop, etc. So if you try to get into cash after a 5% market drop then you are more likely to end up missing the rapid recovery.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "wow thank you for the advice.  \n\n\ncan i ask, do people usually go something like 10% cash and 90% stock?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thats a loaded question.

{"title": "DocuSign ($DOCU) V-Shaped Recovery IMMINENT", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards. As we all are aware, DocuSign ($DOCU) plummeted from the $230s to the $130s last Friday due to their mixed earnings report. However, their earnings report was not even that bad. They beat expected revenue, but missed expected billings by 3.7%. The market overreacted and sold off the stock like crazy. Most people think DocuSign is just another stock that suckled from the tits of the covid pandemic, but I believe its relevance and use are here to stay. I've had to use DocuSign on several occasions, even before the pandemic, to sign forms for housing and jobs.\n\nNow, I believe what we will see happen with this stock from now into early next year is a huge buying frenzy. It's actually already begun. Here's the reasons why:\n\n1. Cathie Wood bought the dip last Friday (12/3).\n2. Their CEO (Dan Springer) disclosed to the SEC a purchase of 33,675 DocuSign shares ($4.8 million).\n3. The RSI is currently at 24.07 (heavily oversold). This indicates the perfect opportunity to \"buy the rumor, sell the news\".\n\nMy recommendation to is buy in on Monday when the market opens. If you're skeptical, at the very least, put this on your watch list. Pay attention to the volume trends. This will give you a good idea of when to establish a position and let it run up. This stock is meant to be stay above $200. We will see it return there very soon.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n21 DOCU 01/21/2022 $180 Calls @ 2.46 Avg Cost\n\n20 DOCU 01/21/2022 $250 Calls @ 0.25 Avg Cost", "id": "rdirad", "created_utc": 1639170667.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "The days of ludicrous valuations for wildly unprofitable companies is over - higher rates are coming, and it'll deflate all these balloons.\n\nDocu is still too expensive, imho.\n\nAnd ARKK going after it only makes it seem like an even more dicey proposition.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "First and only OF I'd subscribe to", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.051777444779872894}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5006869435310364}, {"body": "Unless mama Cathie starts an OnlyFans account, I ain\u2019t following.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Username does not check out.
