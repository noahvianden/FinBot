{"title": "DeJa'Vu possible FED Day repeat \u2026 Warning. 12/16/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY.", "selftext": " \n\nGoodmorning traders, Yesterday I said the rally does not have legs and here we are. Today is really important as to how next we plays out. It is expiration Friday,\u00a0so big moves are likely. Picture the market being a runner and that you can only run so far before you are out of breath. When you run out of breath and got tired instead of putting your hands on your knees or walking to cool down you consolidated or walked/ran backwards to cool down. Also like any runner you build up your distance and endurance each time you run. This is the market right now; it is building up endurance to run (longer sell offs) and these sharp rallies are cool down periods. Which brings me to a conflicted moment. There is a level that if we fall below it opens up the pandora\u2019s box of sell side activity. That level I believe to be around 450 on the spy. Can we build up enough endurance to run that far, will large fund managers join the selling to get us there? I have said that large fund managers are doing everything they can to hold on to getting their bonuses for this quarter by piling into a few mega cap stocks to window dress portfolios (can\u00a0they hold it together thru the year end?).\u00a0 \n\nKey levels to watch... Resistance 465, 467/468 and 470-472 area. Support 462, 460 and 458-456.\u00a0 I see this shaping up just like the fed day we start pushing lower and when you think we are going off the cliff we reverse with a sharp bounce. Look for bounces in Apple, Nvidia, Tesla,\u00a0Microsoft to be the start of the turnaround on the day. Todays close is important, if we fade going into close, we could come into next we with a huge gap down so be careful. \n\nvideo explanation on my personal thread", "id": "rii4gp", "created_utc": 1639749857.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Why do you post every day to let us know SPY might go up down or sideways", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "And why do the mods allow it?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Because readers have not previously called it to the moderators attention in quantity, using the \"report\" button.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The words \"death spiral\" come to mind.

Those options give Musk the right to buy shares of the electric automaker's stock at $6.24 each. At Tesla's Wednesday closing price of about $976 a share, then, he'd realize around $22.2 billion from exercising those options.\n\n\nSo, my question is, let's say he does exercise these and purchases 22,900,000 shares for $6.24, is someone (or many people) taking a massive hit of selling him shares at that price? Are the shares created out of thin air or does Tesla have these in 'reserve' for when options are exercised?\n\nAt first I thought that there were 22.9MM put options to sell Tesla stock at $6.24 expiring 2022, and this sounds insane to me, but puts are not an obligation to sell at that price, only a right to. So what's not clear to me that while Elon has the right to purchase at that price, no one has the obligation to sell at the same price.\n\nTherefore, who exactly are you buying or selling shares from at the strike price with an exercised option?

What I mean with this is that this gives the opportunity for expansion, new projects, repurchase of shares (which they are doing), and pay their debt (they have debt).
