{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Dec 30, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 30, 2021**\n\nAfter starting the day green, stocks closed modestly lower, slipping in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested newly released labor market data and surging coronavirus cases across the world due to the Omicron variant. \n\nGiven we are in the last few session of the year, volume had dried up considerably. For example, in the last four or five trading sessions, the S&P 500 (SPY) has traded roughly half its average volume. The fact that stocks are holding up so well despite volume drying up is very encouraging going into next year.\n\n**Notable Numbers** \n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.28%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.35%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.24%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.04%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): +2.36%\n* Sea Limited (SE): +4.86%\n* SoFi Technologies: +10.02%\n* Upstart (UPST): +4.97%\n* Affirm (AFRM): +5.63%\n* Biogen (BIIB): -7.09%\n* DraftKings (DKNG): +7.07%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant \u2014 found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains \u2014 comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nIn response, airlines canceled thousands of flights, both domestic and international, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially advised people to avoid cruise ships regardless of vaccination status. As a result, both airline and cruise line stocks underperformed the market. On a personal note, after the last two years, I couldn\u2019t get paid to go on a cruise. \n\nDespite this, the CDC eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained \u2014 generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\n\nIn other news, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report, showing initial and continuing jobless claims continue to come in at historic lows, signaling a tight labor market.  First-time unemployment filings fell further from last week\u2019s reading, coming in at 198,000 \u2014 below the expected 206,000. Earlier in December, jobless claims fell to 188,000 \u2014 its lowest level since 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, in a regulatory filing on Thursday, Samsung BioLogics denied earlier reports that Samsung subsidiary was in talks to acquire U.S. drugmaker Biogen (BIIB), which was in the spotlight on Wednesday after shares of the drugmaker surged during intraday trading following a report by the Korea Economic Daily, which cited investment banking sources. The report said Biogen approached Samsung to buy its shares in a deal that could be valued at more than $42 billion.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the ability of members of Congress and their spouses to make stock trades, the California Democrat disclosed several major purchases. Here they are \n   * 130 $CRM $210 calls 01/20/2023\n   * 50 $DIS $130 calls 09/16/2022\n   * 10 $GOOG $2000 calls 09/16/2022\n   * 100 $MU $50 calls 09/16/2022\n   * 100 $RBLX $100 calls 01/20/2023\n* This is actually insane\u2026 Twitter (TWTR) is now a favorite stock among institutional investors, who now hold a 79% stake in the company. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings)\n* JetBlue (JBLU) said it will cut around 1,280 flights while Delta (DAL) announced it was canceling another 250 flights, following thousands of cancellations during Christmas weekend.\n* Foreign automakers have indicated an interest to the government of India's Tamil Nadu state in acquiring Ford Motor (F) plant there, after Ford announced it was winding down operations in that factory\n* Tesla (TSLA) needs to recall over 475,000 Model 3 and Model S cars after the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said rearview cameras mounted on these units are in risk of malfunctioning. \n* Amid the intense regulatory crackdown, the top 10 richest tech executives in China have lost a combined $80 billion. Pinduoduo Inc. founder Colin Huang lost the most this year -- $42.9 billion, or two-thirds of his fortune -- as shares of the e-commerce platform plunged from a high of $212 to just $54\n* Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group will cease operation of its online crowdfunded medical aid program Xianghubao on Jan. 28 citing \u201csignificant changes\u2019 amid the government\u2019s regulatory crackdown.

I really like my current setup and would recommend OP and others explore something similar. I have two taxable accounts with Schwab, one just has VTI and that\u2019s 75% of my portfolio. The other 25% (about 100k) is in a stocks and options account, and no stock is more than 5% (and those are fairly established companies), and the hyper growth companies I would get made fun of for mentioning here are never more than 1% in terms of cost basis at least, If they do well I\u2019ll let them run.\n\nFor me, this is a great way to maximize long term income and take advantage of compounding while also feeding my severe gambling addiction. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m unlikely to have the stock account outperform VTI most years, but I\u2019m ok with that. As long as I\u2019m not getting slaughtered I will keep the same setup. \n\nAnd I only deposit into my VTI account. So hopefully in a couple years the ratio will be 90/10. One benefit of no deposits in stocks account is its easy to track how it\u2019s doing versus the market, whereas when I just had one account I would make 30+ yearly deposits, which made tracking my performance tedious and imperfect. \n\nTo OP: personally I would throw a lot more in VTI and do separate account for the rest. Depending on the amount you have invested, your \u2018percentage of account\u2019 rules may need to be different from mine. For example, If I had less than 20k invested, I think having 10% in a single stock is fine. But as your portfolio grows you may want to consider lower allocations to decrease your risk. Best of luck next year!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Just to be clearer sorry..this is my individual brokerage account.

I find I\u2019m unable to care about my retirement account since I can\u2019t touch it for some time, and I know that compounding in the same etf is the smart thing to do for my individual account, but I really like picking stocks, so I just allocate 25% of my individual account to that. \n\nThat is just my 2 cents though. You\u2019re in solid stocks honestly, but the problem is creating a taxable event even every couple years will put you behind the ball. That\u2019s why I like depositing everything into separate VTI account that compounds but having some to play with in another (also taxable) account.

So you\u2019ll pay taxes eventually, but not til you\u2019re 65. \n\nThe $ you put in VTI, if you don\u2019t touch it until you\u2019re 65, will do the exact same thing as a retirement account.
