{"title": "Selling a leveraged covered call", "selftext": "Looking for some advice to try and abstract my intentions, strategy, and set some framework for what I want to grow into.\n\nI use Fidelity so if someone can relate, please advise.\n\nI feel the market conditions may warrant the limited use of a leveraged covered call. I feel I may be more comfortable introducing myself to margin through a leveraged covered call than through naked puts, as I need to do things to understand how to do them, rather than abstract them on paper, and naked put assignment risk versus house surplus/house call seems to be a larger risk if I get the assignment risk wrong.\n\nI figured the leveraged naked call, while having the expense of margin interest, has less room for error, because I can more easily track how leveraged I am and not make an easier mistake messing around with margin buying power versus house surplus leading to a poor understanding of how leveraged I am.\n\nFor instance, if I have a house surplus of $100,000 and I buy $30,000 in a single equity that now is 20% of my portfolio - then I know my margin maintenance is such that my house surplus is somewhere around $60,000.\n\nAnd I then know how much at risk of a margin call I am.\n\nAnd I can sell calls on the shares bought with that $30,000 without any worry that changes to the price of the options is going to dramatically affect my margin buying power and exposure to a house call.\n\nThat being said - I believe the market conditions are entering a bullish phase. I have selected some underlyings I may want to trade this with.\n\nI might go more conservative and buy something I'm familiar with and very bullish on, such as GS - and sell a covered call at the money.\n\nFirst: Do I have to do anything or am I correct to assume, having margin on my account, that I just choose to buy 100shares @ market price, in margin. And it will add the deficit (cost minus cash) to my margin amount?\n\nSecond: Can I just sell a covered call and it doesn't matter which shares are called away because the proceeds of a sale pays off the margin and margin has nothing to do specifically with the shares bought but with the amount owed for the shares?\n\nIf those two considerations are correct.\n\nWhat else should I be considering on stop losses? A break even price (Share price minus premium?)? Or a price a little below that?\n\nWhen it comes to trading with Cash I'm fairly high risk appetite.\n\nBut when it comes to leverage I've been very risk averse, so any walk through thinking about this would be much appreciated.\n\nAgain, the biggest reason I'm not just wanting to dive into naked puts is that I feel like it would be a less harsh lesson to buy shares on margin and see how the margin works. It's a very short leap to selling covered calls on those shares while dabbling in the risk of margin.\n\nAs I grow in the use of margin I basically want to restrict its use to after corrections. I feel December has been a sufficient downturn in the last year to warrant a use of it for not more than a month or at most 6 weeks depending on market conditions.\n\nContinued bearishness would mean closing the margin out entirely.\n\nAnd any continued bullishness means letting the margin ride only for about 6 weeks at which point I wouldn't consider it wise to chase a running bull with leverage.", "id": "rn9r10", "created_utc": 1640306382.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe it's because I'm really high, but I have no clue what you are talking about...

On a one to one basis, the main difference is the number of transactions involved and the margin requirement.  \r  \n\r  \nIt makes more sense to utilize naked puts on margin rather than covered calls on margin because you'll avoid the cost of margin borrowing to buy more stock.
