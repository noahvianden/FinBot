{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 5, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**\n\nStocks reversed from yesterday\u2019s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. \n\nThe sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, \u201cIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.\" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, \u201cLet me be clear, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.\u201d\n\nWith the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, \u201cI do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it\u2019s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it\u2019s consumer confidence, whether it\u2019s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March\u2019s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday.

A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a \u201cmistake\u201d. He said, \u201cPeloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset.

CC income can help you generate small alpha, and if you manage your trades properly and don\u2019t chase premiums you can usually avoid assignment indefinitely. Holding LEAPS long term also gets you better tax treatment than wheeling, which has you paying short term tax whenever your shares get called away.

Of which there is only one approved treatment. No, Not (Hydroxychloroquine) its Remdesivir. If they get a treatment for Covid-19 this could be another major catalyst. They are researching Mrna uses in many other areas now. Not just Covid-19. The CEO has recently said they will be in development for other uses.\n\nPFE is trading below 52 week highs and under 5 year highs.\n\nMy position is small.

{"title": "Inflation, Commodities Supercycles & Broken Supply Chains: Why macroeconomic conditions have aligned to make $CLF America\u2019s number 1 steel company (and perhaps trigger a short squeeze in the process!)", "selftext": "Not Financial Advice Disclosure: I am an idiot. I have negative net worth due to student loans. I couldn\u2019t tie my own shoes until I was 8 years old. If you are taking financial advice from me, you\u2019re in deep shit. That said\u2026\n\nHi everybody! Cleveland-Cliffs (Ticker: CLF) is an American steel company and in this post I will explain why I made it my biggest position since the MVIS short squeeze.  In short, $CLF is a vertically integrated steel company:  It mines ore (the largest ore producer in the country!) and turns that ore into steel and sells that steel. Steel is used to make a gazillion different products, from cars to forks to buildings. \n\nNow that a supply chain crunch has hit, steel prices are skyrocketing literally everyday. It closed at $20.36 yesterday. The stock has significant short interest - Ortex reported 11.26% a few days ago. These shorts are probably screwed soon, because CLF is a great long-term hold & the market is waking up to it. \n\nCAVEAT: I was hoping to have a few more days to write this post, but $CLF started ripping upwards yesterday. The media began reporting more heavily on steel prices and commodities super cycles over the last week, perhaps because steel prices have gotten too obscene or because Warren Buffett mentioning steel this weekend. So I am rushing my writing of this a bit, because I want to get this out while I believe the getting is still real good.  I will try to hit the main points, both bull and bear. \n\n### OK OK gimme the juice: Why did $CLF break upwards yesterday?\n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Macroeconomic conditions have aligned for CLF to become the top steel company in the USA for decades to come. \n### **1. Inflation \ud83c\udf4c**\n\nHave you heard about how [the price of the stuff that makes everything is surging](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)? Inflation is in full effect.  Michael Burry, one of the few guys who called 2008 right (and was played by Christian Bale in The Big Short) warned about hyperinflation months ago (Here\u2019s one of the top DD posts all-time on WSB about this: [Why Father Burry is calling the big short 2.0 - I have translated his message into a language you autists may, with effort, be able to understand. Three words: Inflation.](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/)).  Burry actually got visited by the SEC after warning about hyperinflation and deleted his Twitter account. \ud83d\udc40\n\nMany factors are driving this inflation. One of those factors (it\u2019s a feedback loop, really\u2026) is that steel prices are surging: **[US Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel Futures Contracts](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-contracts) \ud83c\udf4c CLF is (as of 2020!) the largest producer of hot-rolled steel in America and stands ready to benefit from this inflation. \n\n### **2. American supply chains are fucked. \ud83d\udd73**\n\nAs a result of tax incentives, lax enforcement, and \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements, American industrial/manufacturing capacity has been devastated over the last 40 years (politicians love to talk about how \u201cjobs have been shipped overseas\u201d, but not fix it).  Well, the chickens came home to roost during Covid-19, which I would argue accelerated many timelines, including a supply chain crunch. America is being forced to come to grips with the importance of being able to produce essential goods internally. Steel is a pillar of the economy. President Trump supported the industry with tariffs, and President Biden has continued them.\n\n### **3.  China has stopped dumping steel on the market. China is now competing for scrap metal. Both of these things make the price of steel rise. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\udcc8**\n\nFor years, the Chinese government supported steel production as a jobs program for its citizens.  This resulted in China having way too much steel, so they dump it into the international market at a discount. This drives the price of steel lower. \n\nChina\u2019s methods of steel production have  been an unmitigated environmental disaster. But it\u2019s 2021, baby! China is now committed to cleaning things up & is revamping how it makes steel. This has multiple implications that affect the international steel market. \n\nFirst, China is making less steel \ud83d\udc49 They\u2019re no longer dumping it into the international market, which _was_ driving prices down.  So now steel prices are going boom boom.  \ud83d\udcb8\n\nSecond, China is using a different steel-making process, one that is more reliant on scrap metal.  That means China is now buying up scrap metal. China is great at getting its hands on raw materials \u2014 it\u2019s government generally acts more quickly to developing macroeconomic conditions than the American government.   They have been buying up commodities for years. [Bloomberg: China\u2019s Commodities Binge Makes America\u2019s Future More Expensive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/u-s-infrastructure-plan-faces-problem-china-s-commodities-copper-binge)\n\nThere is a very good video of the CLF CEO talking about all this called \u201cChina, The Environment, and the Next Decade\u201d that you can find, but I can\u2019t post here due to automod. :)\n\n### **4. A Squeeze is beginning in the American scrap metal market. \u26d3**\n\n[Nearly 70% of the Steel used in the US is recycled from scrap. Steel used in construction has a 90% recycling Rate.](https://www.bir.org/publications/facts-figures/download/643/175/36?method=view).  \n\nAs explained, scrap prices are soaring. This is going to eat into those scrap-dependent steel companies\u2019 bottom lines (Nucor, US Steel) . \n\n### **5. CLF is not reliant on scrap. CLF will have higher profit margins. \ud83d\ude80**\n\nCLF mines its own ore. It does not need to buy scrap to make steel. In fact, it can sell steel iron ore to other companies if it chooses.  \n\nThis means CLF is going to have increasingly large product margins from the insane steel prices.  \n\n### 6. **CLF is gonna be able to deliver product - essential to American infrastructure. America needs steel during the current commodities supercycle & it will turn to Cleveland-Cliffs. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8**\n\nCLF is American as fuck. Its roots go all the way back to 1847, and it was founded by a member of the famous Mather family (remember the Cotton Mather guy who presided over the Salem Witch Trials?). It is traditionally a mining company, but in 2020, they acquire AK Steel and also ArcelorMittal\u2019s US holdings (in a down market!). Now they\u2019re vertically integrated, mining iron and spewing out high-quality steel.\n\nThis mining history and very recent acquisitions are two reasons why so many analysts have overlooked CLF until the last few weeks. The acquisitions are not priced in, except insofar as everyone has ragged on CLF for taking on a lot of debt to do this. Fair, I guess, but have you seen those steel prices? CLF is going to be able to pay its debt down in record time, then start sloughing off cash.  The steel price surge is not yet priced into many steel stocks, and I think CLF has the most room to run out of all of them. \n\nCLF is also highly likely to benefit from any big infrastructure bill. They have a unionized workforce, and are likely to benefit from government largesse in big construction projects. \n\n# \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b The main risk points\n* How did CLF find itself in such an amazing position at the early phase of a commodities supercycle? It\u2019s CEO, the Brazilian Lourenco Goncalves, is a luminary in the steel industry. He engineered CLF\u2019s takeover of Arcelor-Mittal\u2019s US assets and AK Steel in 2020, which put them in this perfect position . He\u2019s also famous for telling a Goldman Saches analyst (with a \u201chold\u201d rating\u2026) that he was going to embarrass them so badly, they would have to kill themselves.  If Lourenco continues to guide CLF to a preeminent position in steel, a commanding height of the economy, then books will be written about his reign, a la Lee Iacocca. The man is a mastermind \u2014 it would be a blow to lose him.   \n* A horrendous balance sheet from their 2020 acquisitions. CLF financed last year\u2019s takeovers with expensive debt. However, _this is exactly what the famous CEO said he is fixing first_.  With the enormous steel price increase locked in for the next year, he should be able to pay it down rapidly. This is one of the main reasons this company is still so cheap, imo. The market is cottoning on rapidly, though.\n* Biden repeals steel tariffs.\n* Commodity prices historically moved in cycles, with occasional \u201csuper cycles\u201d, which are more extended periods of high demand. Analysts are increasingly reporting that we\u2019re moving into a supercycle. The risk here is that something kills the supercycle. For example, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 killed the last supercycle. \n* High short interest. With all of this positive news, you may be shocked - shocked!! - that there are a lot of folks on Wall Street who have decided to short this all-American company.  [Ortex reported short interest at 11.26% the other day](https://u.teknik.io/vR4rH.png) What idiot shorts a vertically integrated steel company when steel prices are surging out of control, I don\u2019t know, but this is apparently the situation.

It operates Wish, an ecommerce platform that connects merchants and consumers. The company was founded in 2010 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.\n\n\nWhat is great about them:\n\n* Wish is a global brand operating in 100 counties and its mission is to bring affordable and entertaining mobile experience to billions of consumers around the world. \n\n* They work with 500k merchants and has shipped 640 million products main focus is mobile where they are the number 1 most downloaded app in the world.\n\n* So there is strong brand recognition as they spend a lot of money onto advertisement. They have clear mission and focus.\n\n* The potential is huge, Most e-commerence focus on convenience vs price but wish does the opposite they focus on price.\n\n* Over 75% of europe and 44% of us households have an annual income less than 75 k and that exactly what wish targets. People that care about more about saving money \n\n* They can really grow as more developing countries gain access to the internet like africa middle east and latin america. The average income there is 18k you would think these people will care about time or cost more? \n\n* They want value oriented costumers.\n\nTechnology:\n\n* Most people see wish as a simple buy platform. But its way more they have deep learning meaning the company has software that studies the costumers behavior and proposes to them products. This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.\n\n* They use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.\n\n* They collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion . \n\nGrowth\n\n* They grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services. \n\n* They refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds. \n\n* For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.\n\n* In terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient. \n\n* They have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later. \n\nMerchants\n\n* They are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored\n\nWhat's is not so great about them\n\n* They grew to fast and have some problems with logistics \n\n* There have been some serious delays and even packages missing. They will need to use money from going public to solve this matter and get better at serving costumers. \n\n* There business model is to expand advertise and get new costumers. But their problems in logistic could cause them problems with visitor retention and i want to see improvements here.\n\n* Competition is brutal of course and they will need to utilize their competitive edge to outshine the rest. They don't really compete with amazon but more with alibaba and JD and it will be hard to prevail.\n\nBottom line\n* Potential  9/10\n* Health  9/10\n* fundamentals  7/10\n* Competition hardship  11/10\n\nAlmost everywhere the price target is in the mid 20 range.
