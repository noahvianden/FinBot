{"title": "Nvax DD (7x potential, 10-15 billion in revenue in 2022, low float)", "selftext": "Edit: taking my advice on July $200 call would have netted 300%+ since one week ago when I posted this.\n\n-\ud83d\udd34Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook \ud83d\udd34-\nNvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the \"DD literature section\" at the bottom\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\udd34 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines\ud83d\udd34 -\nProtein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...\n\n             \n                           \n-\ud83d\udd34Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work\ud83d\udd34 -\nImagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\udd34Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  \ud83d\udd34-\n Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be \"harmful\" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. \n\n\nAdjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down \ud83d\ude4c Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.\n\n\n Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.\n\n\n-\ud83d\udd34 Logistics and Storage.\ud83d\udd34-\nNvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.\n\n                 \n- \ud83d\udd34 Scientific conclusion \ud83d\udd34  -\nSo far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).\n When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. \n\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\udd34Investment Thesis & Financials  \ud83d\udd34-\nNvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for \"operation warp speed\" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said \" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success\"\n\n\nThey're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. \n Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. \n\n\nA link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\udd34My Positions \ud83d\udd34 -\nAs far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well \ud83d\ude48 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. \n\n\nAlso below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. \n\nI expect this to squeeze hard in June.

The FDA would be compromised of they let that into the US. I could talk to you four hours and have a great DD on what's going on. Ocgn has a deal to produce 100 million vaccines in a market that is looking for boosters and is only by the time they need to roll out not to mention saturated. 175million Americans to split between 5 companies. Say even split is even between the 5 (which would never happend) that would be 35 million vaccines. \n\nSay a generous 50 million . 50mill times (x)say $15 a vaccine  times(x) generous industry of 7 is the 525 is the million market cap. At full 100 million vaccines I still like 1.1 billion. Now not to mention Baharat never correctly did their phase 3 trials in India. They will have to to a phase 3 first on their adjuvenant. Which isn't licensed by the FDA. Then they a phase 3 us trial. That's going to be really tough to do because now everyone's looking to get vaccinated nobody wanted to get a trial they want to be able to have their vaccination card from the CDC. Nvax just closed this Gap and the doors shut right behind them. \n\nBaharat thats licensing the vaccine to ocgn, his head violations for having live virus in its vaccines they never fully killed it. So ocgn will be looked at very strictly. Since it's an interactivated vaccine they have to grow it in a level 3 lab. Ocgn has the retrofit for a level 3 which is no small task and it requires a lot of bureaucracy for approval. To do all this could be up to a year worst case best case 6 months. \n\nNow to top it off factor in that ocgn has been pumping its stock like crazy versus no effects which is very reserved they could do the same thing too but it's very trashy to do it's usually something when you're pumping means you're on your way out to cash the money out. Ocgn is a scam like INO was pimping their stock back in the summer and diluted their invested over and over while cashing out stock. Ocgn and Baharrat are all selling. They just boosted a bunch of cash for their company and able to now to survive another couple years because they just gave off the image that they were going to save the world their product. Baharat will actually do fine their major company in India which India is nothing to brag about they have the lowest standards  in the world they approve to approved medicines in the last years was only  a single 40 people trial. \n\nThat was all speech to text so there's prob mad grammar errors. \n\nSo yeah i say $0 because there no way ocgn will want to commit to spending all the money to retrofit to a level 3 lab once trials take for ever for Baharats adjuvenant. As it will be a booster market and ocg and then has to still wait for Barat to do another trial for their booster after the fact and at that point there's going to be major market dominance between the Solid 5 companies. At this point nobody's going to want to take a vaccine from India the place with the lowest standards. If they're smart and they recognize this they'll turn the deal down and keep the money from their stock being high that they just pocketed for themselves and for their company. \n\nEither way no matter what happens and they sell all 100 million vaccines they're only worth 1.1 billion and like we talked about even if they did sell evenly split between all five companies that would only be $350 million market cap. And that's even being generous because you know it's not going to be an even split in what ppl will prefer a lot of people are going to prefer Moderna visor nvax and even j&j believe it or not\n\nUnless they make a break through in an eye related manner. they have been negative every quarter and burning cash until Corona hit and they got a deal. So but they're going to do is they're going to keep pumping the stop and keep diluting over  and over and over to find raise a scam. \n\nMaybe not all that happeneds but it's severely under prices as it was trading at 30 cents before this deal. Meme hype will hold it at $3-5. Still interest slowly fades and it keeps dipping lower and lower until some kind of more money comes in.\n\nThis all could take a while because there's a lot of dumb people investing in that company that no idea what's going on and they keep buying more for some reason so eventually the bubbles going to burst when I have no idea but it's going to happen just a matter of time it's like watching a train wreck in advance. \n\nIf you ask anyone of them anything about their company they can tell you everything I just told you they just berate you and call you names which is cool you do whatever you want but it shows how much they actually know about the company which shows why it's going to be great for sure it's to come in I'm planning on running a short full disclosure.
