{"title": "T Leap of Faith", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3jf88t4zky61.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d856d6c27b417a45da99fde290c67039bb9b636\n\nI'm posting this on a down day because I have major conviction in this position. I have been following T for years and have decided that the time is right to go very heavy into T LEAPS. The company is at an inflection point in their business with HBO Max gaining serious traction in the U.S. and the leaps are still very cheaply priced due to investors being lulled to sleep by the company's track record of poor market performance. However, due to the low IV on the leaps, there is currently a very attractive risk/reward ratio. The stock only needs to increase by 20-25% by Jan 2023 (when the bulk of my contracts expire) to end up with a multi-bagger hit. Here is why I think there is a good chance that will happen:\n\n* Management has significantly simplified their business, which will allow them to focus more resources on key growth areas.\n   * AT&T spun off their dwindling TV business (DirecTV, Uverse, and AT&T TV) into a separate entity and sold a 30% stake to a private equity company. This resulted in a cash infusion of \\~$7.6B that the company used to pay down more debt and reinvest in their other growth businesses. I could easily see the rest of their TV business being sold down the road, which would result in even more capital relief for AT&T.\n* New CEO John Stankey (stepped into role in July 2020, but has been an executive with the company for decades) is laser focused on three main businesses:\n\n1. AT&T Fiber and 5G\n2. HBO Max\n3. Warner Bros. Studios\n\n* Management has been turning things around as evident by their strong Q1 results; however, they have had a track record of disappointing Wall Street for many years - the company now seems to be in a phase of underpromising and overdelivering as they finally start hitting their goals.\n   * This makes leaps very attractive because growth is not priced in (i.e., very low IV on the options)\n* There are many tailwinds that will continue to allow T to beat their conservative guidance\n   * HBO Max has been gaining strong traction in the U.S. and a cheaper ad-version of HBO Max will be launching in June 2021 - this opens up HBO Max as a streaming option to more people with a lower price point.\n   * In June 2021, HBO Max will launch internationally in 39 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and will be launching in Europe in Fall of 2021. I think T is purposely hedging their bets by keeping guidance relatively muted (currently guiding to have 120-150 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025, they already have half of that today at \\~63M). With the cheaper ad-version of HBO Max as well as the upcoming international launch, I think they will achieve that number well before 2025. AT&T, through their acquisition of Time Warner, owns the rights to very popular franchises that should draw subscribers. These franchises include Batman/Superman and the rest of D.C. Comics, and The Matrix just to name a few. See here for a more complete list of the franchises that AT&T owns ([https://movieweb.com/att-merger-time-warner-movie-franchises/](https://movieweb.com/att-merger-time-warner-movie-franchises/))\n   * AT&T has very strong cash flow and continues to have no trouble paying their dividend and paying down their debt.\n      * T has also taken advantage of historically low interest rates by refinancing and lengthening maturity dates of existing debt. As they continue to pay down their debt, it will put Wall Street's minds more at east and likely benefit the stock price.\n      * Management is finally seeing cost synergies from their Time Warner investment pay off. On the 1Q '21 earnings call a few weeks ago, the CFO said that there was such a large savings from cost synergies that they were able to increase their capex forecast by $1 billion without bringing down their EPS guidance at all. Stankey is making a conscious effort to ensure that business units are working in sync and that the competitive advantage from owning one of the biggest studios in the world is taken advantage of. One obvious example is that Warner Bros. studio is producing great content that also goes on their HBO Max platform.\n      * I believe that management will continue to find ways to reduce costs by cutting out redundancies and we will see these savings flow through to their EPS.\n   * AT&T continues to expand their Fiber footprint bringing extremely fast internet into peoples' homes. That is an easy bundle with a service like HBO Max. Because of this, they are starting to see customer churn rates go down, and it should benefit all of their businesses by creating deeper relationships with customers.\n* From a technical analysis perspective, T stock looks like it can run all the way back up to the high 30s with virtually no resistance. The stock was at $38-39 prior to the COVID crash and will likely make its way back up to those levels based on the reasons mentioned above.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/398dd2kezky61.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f63aa9ba831b6a6f445213f99ff2ac76ad755745", "id": "nabmy5", "created_utc": 1620778065.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Why LEAPs on a low growth stock with a dividend yield of 6.5%?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "My first thought was, LEAPs on a dividend aristocrat?!

After this spinoff, AT&T will have a much stronger balance sheet than Verizon (i.e., they will no longer be the most leveraged telecom company).\n\nIMO, the only reason the stock is selling off right now is the dividend cut. The intitial news caused the stock to pop yesterday, and then the income investors started selling. I'm expecting the momentum to start shifting the other way again as people start crunching the numbers on how much this new WarnerMedia/Discovery business will be worth. With the international launch of HBO Max in 39 countries next month (and launching in Europe later this year) the subscriber growth from HBO Max will beat Netflix's current subscriber growth (since they're already so large). So I expect growth investors to get excited about that. In the near-term, the income investors will sell off - if you want an opportunity to invest in the new WarnerMedia/Discovery streaming giant, now is probably a good time to get in. I expect AT&T to head back into the $30s again as we approach Q2 earnings.

This causes an increases demand for goods and services as people tend to spend. Increased demand means price points increase (Supply/Demand from Econ 101). We call this rise inflation. The increased demand increases the cost of almost everything, including raw materials and commoditys. If companies have to spend more for raw materials this increases inflation further. All this is happening simultaneously. This increases the costs of doing business.\n\nIf the supply of money remained high, eventually this would lead to runaway inflation. Currencies would become devalued and more and more money would be needed to bay for even basic items like bread. The extreme version of this is called hyper-inflation, e.g. Germany's Reichsmark in the 30's where workers were paid with wheelbarrows full of almost worthless cash. If a currency is so devalued, it means that other countries won't see value in it and won't take it. This is bad for any country.\n\nTo counter these effects, central banks tend to increase interests rates. This encourages consumers to save, not spend, and removes excess cash from circulation. This increases the cost of borrowing money, as banks and other financial institutions have a greater incentive to keep cash and not loan it out. This reduces the amount of money flowing through the economy, and the speed at which it's flowing. Inflation rates reduce because there's less money available to drive up prices.\n\nEventually a new market equilibrium is reached, where inflation is either at a low and controllable level, or where prices/demand for goods falls (recession).

I have cash to buy if I find something selling for a large discount.\n\nI think there is a pretty good chance we will see a market slump that lasts into summer.  People will likely freak out about inflation.  The experts can explain inflation is transient, brought on by supply chain problems, labor shortages from people unwilling to work, whatever, but people will believe their own anecdotal experiences combined with an unease with the consequences of politicians giving out free money to anyone with a pulse.  I just got off the phone with my parents.  They just returned from a grocery run to \"stock up before prices increase.\"   It looks like toilet paper hoarding all over again, and this will cause further prices increases that are already being driven by supply shortages.  That sort of pessimism is not good for the market.\n\nOn the plus side there is a really good chance we will see some great buying opportunities.  Buy the dip does not mean buy when the market goes down 2% for the day; it means buy when the stock significantly declines, usually over a course of weeks or months.  Some of the growth stocks that were trading at obscene valuations may become attractive. \n\nLooks like hunting season just opened, boys.", "id": "nb2jl5", "created_utc": 1620861978.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Spoiler alert, all red.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "same here bro!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Spoiler, more red today", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10554524511098862}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.030635185539722443}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15184718370437622}, {"body": "Don't worry, I can promise you I lost a lot more than you.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Are you in ARKK like me?

But all eyes are on Q2. We'll assume these Q1 numbers stay true. Regardless, I think this earnings call will boom or bust $COIN because listeners are more curious about Q2 and 2021 forecasts. It could bust if management underestimates Q2 (and maybe 2021) purely for risk mitigation and \"under promise, over deliver\" bullshit\n\nSo far Q2 USD trade volume has risen 7%. Running the analysis everyday, I've seen it fall -5% (vs. Q1) before the recent surge in volume. So naturally we can possibly expect Q2 revenue guidance to fall in the range of $1.71B - $1.92B (we can estimate Q2 profits will be $710 million - $920 million). We'll see how accurate this estimate is come Thursday evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my 2021 forecast, it really depends on how you think volume will contract.\n\n50 forward PE is aggressive when Paypal's is 54 forward PE. 40 forward PE is a bit more conservative if coinbases's growth opportunities aren't as substantial\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ynz9o5pzoy61.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bcf8f40960736e520dbdf29c2f2b04a738a5482\n\nPositions:\n\nHave moderately scaled my position since previous DD.
