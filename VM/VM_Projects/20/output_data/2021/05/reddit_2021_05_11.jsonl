If you're selling CSPs for example, you'll have the same EXACT risk as if you were buying the underlying without the potential profit that goes with it. If you're selling CCs, you're capping your returns while having the exact same downside risk as the buy and hold strategy. For the low steady returns, it's true ONLY if the underlying goes up or trades sideways, if the underlying gets really volatile, your options get volatile as well.\n- **You're selling those options to WSB members** : While some people say that jokingly, some people seem to think it, so let me clarify something : 90% of option volume is for hedging purposes. For example, you're scared of inflation, you buy puts to cap your losses while keeping the upside potential. Another example is holding the S&P500 and not liking the risk of Tesla or Apple, so you buy puts for those companies relative to your exposure to remove this risk. Now if you were to sell those options to WSB members, not only you would make much less money because those are for the most part OTM options with short expiry but you would also take A LOT of risk for not that good returns.\n\n# And the bad!\n\n- **Taxes** : Pretty self explanatory. The buy and hold, you pay only when you withdraw, but for this one (or really any active form of investing), you'll pay taxes every year. So it's not enough to outperform the S&P500, you have to outperform enough to cover the taxes as well.\n- **Same downside risk as buy and hold without the upside** : I've touched on that above but basically, by selling CSPs or CCs, you're capping your gains while having the same downside risk. If you're using any other classic option selling strategies, you're either taking a lot more risk or having much less returns than the S&P500.\n- It takes more of your time than the buy and hold.\n- Since you're capping your upside returns, you'll not profit off the big upside move of the market which constitute most of the S&P returns (couldn't find the source for this but you can check it).\n\n# The wheel strategy\n\n- Whenever there's a big volatility, you'll buy close to the top and sell at the bottom. That's because you've initially sold your CSPs before the volatility and exercised at this unfavorable price. And worse, if you sell CCs at a lower price point to collect more premium, you might get exercised and essentially sell your position at a loss so you will not profit off of the recovering of your stock. And if you wait, you'll not be able to sell CCs or CSPs for a while.\n- You're really dependant on the volatility/implied volatility of the market or your underlying. That means that if we're in a big bull market, the volatility will be low and premium will be low as well. And if we're in a bear market, the premium will be high but your returns will be shit due to the point above. \n- The main point of using the wheel strategy is that it outperforms the S&P500 in a bear market. Except, in the last 30 years, we were mainly in a bull market, so you'll underperform the market most of the time on the off chance that there's a bear market at some point.\n\n# Selling credit spreads\n\n- Your returns will be very low. If it's higher than the S&P500, probably check the risk-adjusted returns and you'll see that you're taking an abnormal amount of risk.\n\n# Other strategies \nFor any other strategies, there are probably other upside/downside of doing them, but the main ones were probably already mentioned above.\n\n# Treat options like insurance\nI'm going to copy-paste a comment that I've made recently about that :\n\n> People that buy/sell those high IV options should see options as what they are : insurance. They're not speculative products even though WSB uses it solely for that. They're mainly used for hedging purposes.\n\n> So the same way insurance companies make money, you should be making consistant money on that and occasionally lose a lot from one or two positions. That means a few things :\n\n>- Don't sell risky options because that's like selling insurance to a drunk driver.\n>- Don't sell options on too many correlated stocks because that's like selling insurance to only one city.  If there's a earthquake in there, you're screwed.\n>- Keep your options size relatively small and you'll find you can make consistant money with this.\n>- Don't expect to make 100% to 200% returns a year. That's not what it's about.\n\nHere's another comment that I've written about that. It complements it pretty well :\n\n> Part of it is true part of it is them encouraging any behavior that makes them as much money as possible.\n\n> The true part is that by selling options, you're basically selling insurance therefore to mitigate your risk, you'll have to trade small on different and uncorrelated assets.\n\n> See for example insurance company that sells home insurance. They will get a little bit of money from a lot of people and if something happens to one of them, they'll cover the cost thanks to all the money other people without problem gave them. Now if a lot of people have an accident at the same time, the home insurance gets fucked. That's why they try their best to not get concentrated in one area only.\n\n> Well... apply the same principle to your option selling strategy : sell options to assets that are as uncorrelated to each others as possible and trade as small as you can with as many different companies as possible so that if one go down a lot, then you'll be able to cover thanks the other companies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo do I think thetagang is dead and you shouldn't do it? Yes and no.\n\nIf you expect steady returns, you will have a nasty surprise when a week like this one happens. If you expect lower risk than buy and hold, I've explained that this is not a good strategy for this.\n\nHowever, if you manage to assess correctly the risk (just like insurance companies do), trade small, hedge when necessary, you'll get *meh* returns. Outperforming the market? Nope.\n\nOne way to do it, maybe, is to compliment your buy and hold strategy with this strategy. So for example, you'll have 100% of your money on long term investing and separately, on margin you can do the wheel so that you have the long term returns plus another additional returns while not using a lot of margin power. To be clear, I'm not saying to sell CCs on your long term stocks, I'm saying you could do the wheel with the margin without touching your longterm investing.", "id": "n9uivf", "created_utc": 1620731386.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "How does selling CSP have exact same risk as buying and holding?
