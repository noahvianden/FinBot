{"title": "APPLE INC. Technical Analysis Due Diligence", "selftext": "I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because \"time in the markets, beats timing the market\" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as \"shrewd\" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. \n\nIf I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.\n\n\n\n\n#Apple Inc\n\n\nTicker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. \n\nThe [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.\nAt **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the \"pause\" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors \"_bought the dip_\" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). \n\n\nAt this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.\n\n\nWith the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.\n\nBut since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher\n\n\nThis is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a \"big mistake\" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.\n\n\nAn investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners \"bought low and sold dear\"  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. \n\n\nOnce the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we \"buy the dip\" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.\n\n\n\n**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? \n\nPrice is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. \n\n\nWhile this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). \n\n\nThis would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the \"ceiling\" that's been keeping it low.\n\n\nThis level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. \n\n\nOnce price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. \n\n\n\n**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards\n\nI would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes\n\nTL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months.

Its just as likely we bounce off 120 and head back up as we do head down.

{"title": "Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**\n\nThe stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week\u2019s price action.  \n\nLeadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. \n\nThe Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that \u201cparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals\u201d and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)\n\nHowever, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed\u2019s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed\u2019s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.\n\nAs the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures \u201ctransitory\u201d. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d \n\nMoreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it\u2019s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn\u2019t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, \u201cVirtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they\u2019re not real currencies\u201d. It\u2019s important to note the statement doesn\u2019t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. \n* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight\n* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. \n* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a \u201cLite Hash Rate\u201d or \u201cLHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. \n* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan \"proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States\u201d and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories \"to build advanced vehicles and parts.\"\n* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry\u2019s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.\n* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\\*\\***\n* L Brands (LB) target raised by Barclays from $66 to $82 at Equal-Weight.
