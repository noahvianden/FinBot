{"title": "Risk management & riding out the apocalypse", "selftext": "Hey,\n\nGiven the recent market shake-up (bad time to hold an all-tech portfolio, eh?), it is time to have a grown-up talk on what to do when your portfolio (stocks, funds, etc) is bleeding. If your outlook is still bullish on the underlying, it's a great time to buy the dip.. assuming you have any cash left. You could tap more into your margin, but if the market falls even further, you're just risking loosing even more. Auch. So what else is out there?\n\n1. Panic sell, at least some of your holdings, and hope to buy back again later\n2. Try to ride it out & pray to Cthulhu it works out\n3. Be like the big boys and try to manage it (unlocking advanced mode)\n\nLet's talk about number 3. You need to hedge, preferably *before* shit hits the fan. But let's be honest, most of us don't bother with that (stonks only go up). So let's do what we can with the tools we have.\n\nSimple setup: say we hold 1000 ARKK, that we bought at 160$/share (just to really really feel the pain). It is now trading at 117$/share, down 27%. We are still bullish, and expect it bounce back by January next year or so, but we can't buy more: no extra cash, family heirlooms, or stimulus check for us.\n\nThe plan: sell *some* of the shares, and make option plays to take on additional leverage.\n\n**Basics**\n\nOption pricing follows the Black-Scholes formula, adjusted a bit for tail-risk and market demand. It assumes that on average, it's 50% the stock will go up vs down. Option pricing reflects this belief whether the underlying is at its all time high, or all time low.\n\nTo visualize this, here's the [implied probability distribution](https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/en/assets/pdfs/Options_Probabilities_Exhibit_Link.pdf) for the January 21, 2022 ARKK option chain. \\[figure&algo is mine; and unlike those crazy kids at Morgan Stanley, I use both put&call spreads instead of silly butterflies that are noisy as f\\*ck\\]\n\n[ARKK \\(implied\\) probability density function from January 21, 2022 option chain](https://preview.redd.it/vwkrkca1kol61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=4234968cffe63a2973d81d0ec3c26ec477b347ef)\n\nLot of uncertainty about where it will end up in January next year, with a mean at roughly todays closing price.\n\nBut we are bullish, and feel that the *mean of this distribution should be at least 30 points higher*. Just imagine shifting the whole thing to the right a bit. That puts the mean, expected ARKK share price by January 2022 at $147, with some huge potential swings on the up or downside. Why +30 points? Just an exercise. It expects some recovery, but far less than hitting the $160 ATH again.\n\n**Optimal moves**\n\nUsing this updated probability density function and brute-forcing a series of possible option plays, here are the optimal plays \\[this step means running an algorithm that tries every spread, short strategy, long plays, etc and filtering the ones with the highest risk-adjusted returns; much science goes into it, too long to explain\\].\n\n*Explanation: quantities +/- mean going long/short on the option; P/C for put/call; expected returns assume buying at market prices (so Bid or Ask - whichever is least favorable for us) & updated pdf; strategies are normalized for 1 option contract only;*\n\n|Option play|Expected return|Sharpe ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\+1C $42.96|$2610|0.44|\n|\\+1C $42.96, -1C $200|$2392|0.53|\n|\\-1P $42.96|$82|0.83|\n|\\+1P $42.96, -1P $65|$185|0.58|\n|*holding on to 100 shares @ 117$*|*$2798*|*0.47*|\n\n**Closer look A: buying the LEAPS call**\n\nLet's dig into buying $42.96 calls at $76 Ask price. It has a delta of 0.969 and it's deep ITM. It's basically buying shares on leverage. The expected return by strike price + probability of these outcomes are shown here:\n\n[$42.96 Call expected return by strike](https://preview.redd.it/eu1zq1sxyol61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc7194da0ea74ce2d963bf9e5151341f9e08f2b7)\n\n[$42.96 Call expected return adjusted for likelihood](https://preview.redd.it/7jkjf6x2zol61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7be11bc2ef0b954a8ea695da177d26ae8f5ffcb)\n\nEasy, right? So one play would be *selling* 100 ARKK shares for $11.700 total, *buying* 1 $42.96 Call deep ITM January 2022 LEAPS for $7.600 total, with the same expected return as owning the shares (but taking on more risk if the stock drops below $43), and keeping $3.100 cash for further interventions if necessary.\n\n**Closer look B: bull put spread play**\n\nBull put spread 1P $42.96, -1P $65 looks interesting, for net credit of  $2.50\\*100 ($3.80 - $1.30) per contract. Max potential loss is $2.200 per spread ($65-$43 \\*100). Or, with pretty figures:\n\n[+1 Put $42.96, -1Put $65 Bull Put spread return by strike](https://preview.redd.it/j3vox1od0pl61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6950260ec9eb99f1f5c1df4078711765503afb5c)\n\n[+1 Put $42.96, -1Put $65 Bull Put spread return adjusted for likelihood](https://preview.redd.it/c2lfzsni0pl61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=14d0feac4c5ba41954e209ba735f2ad3b469461a)\n\nSo one way to play it would be *selling* 100 ARKK shares for $11.700 total and using it as cover for our put spread. At 25% margin requirement, that gives us a buying power of $46.800, so we can run 21x bull put spreads for a max potential loss of $46.200 and instant credit of $5.250. The credit gained can be used for whatever purpose (say, spending it on LEAPS). You should *not* however touch the proceeds from selling the shares, it is meant as cash protection for your spread until you close the position. The expected return, as per the previous table, is 21\\*185$=$3.885 (thanks to the margin play).\n\nIn this scenario, we give up on the potentially higher gains of owning the shares/going long on calls for quick cash in return that we can deploy more efficiently.\n\n**Risk management**\n\nYou do not want your LEAPS getting anywhere near expiry. With, say, one month to expiry, if the market drops, you loose everything, which wouldn't happen if you own stocks. You want to close your LEAPS when the underlying hits your target forecast. If you still like the stock, buy back shares or even deeper, further dated ITM calls.\n\n**Lessons learned?**\n\nYou can ride out the dip in many ways. You could hold on to your shares, or you could take on additional risk by making intelligent option plays and trying to capitalize on this dip/your long term recovery hypothesis.\n\nChoosing the right strikes, expiry dates, rebalancing ratios, etc isn't straightforward (unless you programmed your own tools, you nerd), so do the math & don't rush it (ie: no weekly yolo's to make back all the losses). Deep ITM LEAPS are a good start, and even those can be rolled for higher strikes in case the underlying dips further (doubling down on your position by taking even more risk).\n\nSo if your portfolio takes a beating, re-asses your situation and try to make the best of it.

(Gamma Has an Bipolar Sister)", "selftext": "\u201cGamma squeeze\u201d tends to be thrown around like a very bad pick-up line these days by everybody\u2019s grandmas, uncles, and third cousins, once removed. Under my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/lzdroj/gamma_squeeze_indicator/gq2e0pp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) thread on a post in another sub, a random user shared a link to a write-up on dealer exposure to optionality and how it translates to the implied order book of the underlying.\n\nHere is the link to the page: [https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The\\_Implied\\_Order\\_Book.pdf](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf)  (Note: I am not affiliated with sqzme, and I am not promoting their services)\n\nGive it a read.\n\nI love how the author presents the dealer gamma exposure (GEX) as the implied order book. It really drives the point on how relevant dealer gamma is to the market\u2019s liquidity.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more important is how the dealer vanna exposure (VEX) can overwhelm the dealer GEX. This is almost never discussed.\n\nThe author\u2019s approach to explaining vanna can be improved to avoid unnecessary confusion. The \u201ccheat sheet\u201d provided needs to specify absolute delta for puts (or correct the effect of IV change on the put\u2019s delta), because (for example) it states that a rise in IV decreases the delta of an ITM put. IV rise *increases* the (negative) delta of an ITM put by *reducing its magnitude*. Vanna is positive for an option with a strike above the spot, whether it\u2019s a call or a put (whereas strikes below the spot have negative vanna). I\u2019m also just not a fan of the distribution curves used to explain the concept. This is not how I conceptualize options, but if it helps others, then I\u2019ll back off the bell curves \u2014 we can keep them.\n\nTo summarize the counterintuitive dealer VEX effect:\n\n* Dealers start pouring liquidity into the underlying when their positive vanna turns negative on a downward move paired with a rise in IV (their negative vanna overwhelms their negative gamma).\n* A chain-reaction crash happens when the dealers\u2019 negative vanna turns positive and overwhelms their positive gamma on a downward move with a rise in IV.\n\nThis brings us to GME, everybody\u2019s favorite ticker to squeeze. The covered call writers from r/thetagang may actually be contributing to the squeezes without realizing it. Look at the last squeeze on 24 Feb. If the dealers had a large inventory of long C60s, then a rally only had to bring GME just above 60 (flipping the dealers\u2019 vanna from positive to negative) for WSB to get excited with FOMO once again and start buying OTM calls, raising the IV and starting the chain reaction upward.\n\nOf course this is just speculation without actually knowing the dealers\u2019 inventory, but I find it helpful to think about how we as retail traders may be contributing to the market\u2019s liquidity by forcing the dealers to hedge our whims.", "id": "m06dd9", "created_utc": 1615172821.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Caveat emptor.

This is primarily from an index options traders perspective, I've never managed a SNO book. \n\nFirst, there is strong linear component to that exposure due to spot/vol correlation and that can be somewhat neutralized by my delta lean. As you have rightfully figured out, most of that lean is not going towards neutralizing my slides but rather towards neutralizing fixed strike vol changes due to spot-vol correlation. However, some of it will go towards my rtVega slides, for example I'll be holding excess delta against any OTM puts and reduced delta against the calls (the latter has been a known widow-maker trade on many instances when vols start to re-strike earlier than expected).

Is this where the dealers just eat their liability, averaging up on the premiums to offset their losses as vol rises?\n***\nSo back to the topic of the post \u2026 is the implied book really essentially controlled by gamma? Is vanna not hedged because the delta change caused by vanna is a mirage that vanishes when the dust settles?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Thanks for stepping up, man \n\nThat would be \"ma'am\", but you are welcome :)\n\nIn real life you will consider the whole book exposure unless you have a large position close to the expiration, but for simplicity let's consider simpler case. \n\nSo first imagine that you have an empty book with a short longer-dated ATMF-ish straddle in it (longer dated so we don't have to consider gamma). It's a position that's roughly neutral BS delta (you will be slighly short because of the ito correction), but you do have short vega exposure. So, until you can cover it you gonna lean your delta short to account for spot-vol correlation - i.e. your modified delta will be a sum of your black scholes delta and vega times vol-beta (expected change in fixed stirke vol for a percent move in spot or whatever way you want to define it). Even though you have no vanna exposure, your vega exposes you to spot-vol correlation which can be somewhat offset by having a correct delta lean. So in a sense, delta and vega are \"sister-greeks\".\n\nNow imagine that you have an empty book with a single 25 delta risk reversal in it (long calls, short puts, vega neutral at inception). Again, you are exposed to the spot-vol correlation, but this time around your first order exposure is somewhat muted since you are vega neutral at inception, though you will have some delta to the fact that your vega will change at the same time as your spot moves. Since both vol and vega will go up as spot goes down and vice versa when it goes up, you have a convex position similar to a straddle - assuming that the market is fair, cost of this vega convexity and cost of spot convexity should be equal and you can hedge one with the other. That makes vanna (i.e. skew convexity) and gamma (i.e. spot convexity) also \"sister-greeks\".\n\nThe point I was making is that whenever you are holding delta against a skew position, some of that delta will be due to the  change in vega as the spot moves (i.e. you shock spot down/up, vega goes up/down and it gets accounted as vol beta exposure). On the good side, that extra bit of delta is going to help on the way down or on the way up as the skew realizes and helps a lot in offsetting your vanna exposure unless it's really far OTM. On the bad side, as the spot rallies at some point volatility will start to re-strike - i.e. vols will start going up with spot and if you are holding short delta against your short vol position it will hurt (a lot).\n\nFinally, skew (because of the dealers incentives and the prevailing flows) is priced in such a way that it's very hard to make money buying it. In order to pay for your skew theta skew has to realize at least 2x of the slope and don't forget that meanwhile you are somewhat short gamma on the underlying. \n\nSo, back to the topic - yeah, unless we are talking about very specific cases where outstanding downside positions are very large (like the stuff that cause moves in march of last year) it's gamma that matters the most. Even there, it helps to remember that we are talking about the market impact.

This *would* add liquidity to the underlying on the way down. However, if the sell-off continues, then the skew will potentially hurt them even more, causing even less liquidity in the underlying. Perhaps a high OI on shorter-term ITM puts (assuming majority of them are owned by retail) would motivate the dealers to increase their deltas in anticipation of retail closing the puts for profit and the short hedges getting bought back. Ironically, this dealer anticipation (by slowing down the sell-off) can serve as a catalyst for the closing of the ITM puts owned by retail.\n- Just average up on the premiums paid by retail in the vol spike? The reduced gamma would reduce the liquidity taken by the dealers, giving the underlying a chance to breathe and recover. VIX 85 seemed to do the trick in March 2020. However, the amount of notional liability to pull this through is insanely high, but the unrealized vol seems to eventually compensate the dealers through this ordeal.\n- Buying convexity at this point appears like a losing strategy \u2014 low gamma at high premiums.\n\nPlease correct me if you see mistakes in my reasoning, or if I\u2019m missing something.\n\n> So, back to the topic - yeah, unless we are talking about very specific cases where outstanding downside positions are very large (like the stuff that cause moves in march of last year) it's gamma that matters the most.\n\nFrom the dealer hedging perspective, what matters more than gamma when outstanding downside positions are very large?

Unless I\u2019m overlooking something, perhaps a strangle would have been a better option for this example.\n\nVanna of a straddle will naturally be very small - you can deduce it this from the first principles. ATMF straddle has negligible delta regardless of the level of vol (if you ignore the Ito correction for a second), so you dDelta/dVol is very small. Same goes for a strangle, as you rightfully point out, though there your vanna will depend on the level of the skew - imagine an extreme case where you have a strangle composed of 1-delta options, one at 50 vol and one at 10 vol. \n\n> I\u2019m curious about what the dealers would do here \u2026\n\nYou are making it too complicated. If you can see the flow its fairly easy to pivot towards owning vega in a rally while there are still plenty of eager sellers.

Do they? Does that flow even matter? I mean, a single autocallable issue can probably supply more vega than a lot of retail option sellers, so it's all very questionable. The guy is making a lot of assumptions about directions of the flow. Even for someone who's looking at the market and sees a lot of flow, it's very hard to figure out what the actual positioning is - there is just way too much stuff to account for. \n\nFWIW, most of the volume in SPX options are not retail, it's is heavily dominated by the institutional flows. It reasonable to expect that it will remain so. Think of it this way - someone like Bridgewater can go out and spend 500 million in SPX premium since it's under 50bps of their portfolio. It takes a lot of retail traders to add to that size. The only real exception to that was the Volmageddon when most of the outstanding vega was on the retail side via VIX ETPs (oh my God, what a great day that was). \n\nMost of the institutional index flows are either hedging or monetization of volatility - as you can imagine, once you know the players, a market maker can play games around their positions.

In a hypothetical scenario, where your skew convexity is much greater than your spot convexity, do you still keep your delta leans neutral to the skew, or do you let your skew neutrality fluctuate, given the mean reversion tendency of vol and imperfect spot-vol correlation (especially with vol re-strike potential)?\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, then the vanna-hedging premise of the squeezemetrics write-up is incorrect.\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking your time and sharing your experience from the dealer perspective.

First, \"can retail sell so many puts that it seriously skews the dealer position?\". My weed-adjusted prior belief would be that it can easily happen in single stocks, much less so in ETFs and probably never in index options. Second, a far more interesting one, is \"in a major index, can a dealer vanna be so big that combined with a big volatility change it could cause a sell-off due to market impact?\". My thinking is that you can back into the outstanding vega necessary to make it happen and it's going to be very very large.\n\n> Also, since you mentioned it in one of the comments above, do you mind shedding a little more light on root-time vegas?

Obviously, in SNO you get all sort of wacky stuff so it's an approximation at best. Most people use a simple version, i.e. root-time vega is BS vega divided by the square root of time to expiration.

Amazon, for one, is well aware that the nat gas engines can utilize RNG. This strategically puts them in a position to meet zero emission standards.

What many who think competition is coming and will only get better fail to understand is the upcoming changes to Tesla's EV's. Namely the single casting and the 4680 cells.\n\nFor example, if you were to compare the Tesla to the Porsche Taycan, the main differentiator in terms of EV aspects is sustained performance, where the Taycan seems to take the lead (ignoring the price difference). Porsche put a lot of effort into designing a battery cooling system to do this. They also use different types of cells, but that is not that critical. With the 4680 cells, Tesla will have a battery that has better thermals naturally then the prior cells, due to (1) the tabless design will allow direct cooling or heating of the cells and (2) the lower electrical resistance of the tabless design means less heat produced. The 4680 cells here are key as they are designed for mass production, which keeps costs down, which means Tesla will be able to use them on a scale and at a level of profitability that there will be no competitive product for a few years.\n\nOn top of the thermal aspects, which alone will put Tesla above the best performance levels in terms of EV's, the 4680 cells can be made structural. This is a huge deal and will allow for reduced weight and improved handling. The reduced weight provides numerous benefits, such as longer tire-life, better handling, etc. The structural aspect also makes the car stiffer and allows the weight to be more centrally concentrated thereby improving handling.\n\nThe single-casting, which no one does anything close to, is a major benefit as well. It (1) reduces the cost of making the cars, (2) it reduces factory space needed to build cars, (3) it results in an inherently more consistent build with overall tighter tolerances, and (4) it reduces weight. The improved tolerances means that Tesla is setting themselves up for being able to improve or eliminate panel gap issues or any other build issues. One of the big complaints Tesla gets is due to these quality issues, but they are doing some material stuff that will reduce these issues (on top of that the new factories in Texas and Berlin, with new lines should allow them to address these issues better then the current production lines allow).\n\nIt should be mentioned that both the single-casting and 4680 cells via weight reduction mean improved range, a key aspect of any EV.\n\nI am not going to get to price targets as a result of all this, but Tesla is on a path where later this year they are putting out their next generation of cars that will significantly change what people expect from an EV. Other manufacturers, including VW, will be scrambling to play catch-up but it won't be easy. The only reason that Ford or others will still have a significant market for their EV's will simply be because of production constraints on Tesla. For companies like Lucid and Porsche,  they better hope that Tesla does not make a serious effort on the luxury front, because the angle of their stitching will be the main thing that sets them apart from Tesla.\n\nThe  dirty secret and this has been noted by many with experience in the auto industry is that Tesla is years ahead of everyone else and it is not getting better. I would be very careful about any EV investments you make later this year as Texas and Berlin come on line and people experience first-hand the new cars that they put out.

VW will hold market share in Europe right now because they\u2019re selling cars locally.\n\nWhy would you sell a good overseas for lower margin due to shipping and docking fees and import tax when you can sell the same good which is in high demand in your own backyard.\n\nthis is why Tesla decided to invest $1.5B in building a giga factory in Berlin, once this factory is online - we should be able to gauge market share since the cars will be produced and sold in Europe and not shipped overseas.\n\nHope this brings a different perspective.

No, fucking destroyed them. The same way **RKT** did.\n\nThe numbers were picked up by algos and reported via media outlets *AHEAD of the company's earnings call where they revised GAAP.*\n\nThis has created a ticking time bomb. They might be unaware that they've just shorted one of the most aggressive growth stocks on the market today. FUBO is the #1 sports streaming service out there, by far. Now they've partnered with MLB, NBA, and Caesars Entertainment to bring to life **SPORTS BETTING** via Fubo Sportsbook.\n\n( [https://bit.ly/3kUQ21O](https://bit.ly/3kUQ21O) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDetails on the reporting error:\n\n*\"Remove Impairment charges (write-off of Goodwill from Merger) and also Change in Value of Warrants (theoretical BS charge when stock rises), then $FUBO BEAT estimates on Revs and Net Income.* ***The Problem is not the analysts - it's the wire services*** *that move too fast to look at the detail - they don't see accounting adjustments, or differences in share count, and they report the numbers as Filed - institutions take time to see detail; Yahoo does not\"*\n\nThe EPS should not be a factor at this time because of two outliers:\n\n1 The total share float taken into account based on GAAP rules is actually lower than the actual number \u2013 which means the \u201cper share\u201d number is elevated\n\n2 Acquisitions \u2013 with the move to incorporate synergies between live sports and online gaming, they acquired Balto Sports, which offers fantasy sports betting platform and then Vigtory. Both of these moves were expected to lead to a higher cash burn and lower EPS, but this should be considered an \u2018investment\u2019 rather than a spend.\n\nSauce: [https://twitter.com/JohnTextor/status/1367569184083890176?s=20](https://twitter.com/JohnTextor/status/1367569184083890176?s=20)\n\n\\^\\^ largest FUBO shareholder\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see how this reporting error was overlooked, the entire market was bleeding this week.

The company's core business is under-valued \n2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes \n3.  Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized \n4.  Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to include several more points on my bullish view on ($MO)\n\n1. NJ just legalized marijuana. Other states are likely to do the same. I don't know about you guys, but almost every millennial that I know has no problem weed legalization. Sooner or later, the younger crowd will definitely outnumbered the older conservatives' opinions in marijuana legalization. It doesn't matter if you are in a more conservative state. Sooner or later, people will become more opened to it via media.\n2. MO is mainly down due to 2 causes: fear of government completely banning vaping & newer gens are smoking less. People are pricing $MO as if smoking rate will keep going down or flattens. Smoking has existed since before BC. However, smoking popularity has a more of a cyclic behavior. There were historical periods where people smoked a lot, and there were periods when people smoked less. \\*\\*(I forgot the name of this statistic phenomena, if an object has existed for a long time, it will continue to exist. How many books or movies were only celebrated for a short period? Twilight? No one talks about it anymore, because it fucking sucked.  Seven Samurai? It is a 1950s movie, but any film student is still required to know this film. It withstand the test of time. SMOKING? This thing has existed for centuries. It is here to stay.\n3. High dividends. \n4. With the fear of recession, a lot of people are restructuring their portfolio. Guess what? Tobacco sales is recession proof. People are likely more stressed out, and had continue to buy tobacco during financially tough times.\n5. Well, people are becoming more concerned about their health. Bullshit. Yes, this is true for the general public. But big tobacco's main customers aren't the people who smoked once every few weeks. Their main customers are the ones who can't control their addiction. Addiction will always be in our DNA.\n6. Many people started smoking during COVID out of stress. Tobacco sales fell 7% during 2019, and was expected to fall 4 to 6% during 2020. However, it only fell 2 to 3 %. \n7. It just broke 52 week high today. This stock may gain some short term momentum and go to 48/49.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: 3-12 $47 calls & 3-19 $47 calls\n\n**Disclaimer:  This post is not intended to be investment advice.
