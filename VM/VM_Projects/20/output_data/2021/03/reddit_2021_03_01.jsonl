Companies with outstanding debt should probably never pay dividend. And neither should you want them too. It's basically an annuity on your stock that you yourself paid for.

Not financial advice, really just me sitting at home over the weekend with nothing to do. Perhaps someone can chime in and help me see a different picture?\n\nSo...\n\n**Call OI is much higher for April Futures and March Calls - A Short Term Outlook**\n\nIf you look at the Open Interest on Crude Futures options for April (expire the 17th of March), there are a load of calls that are expiring ITM, this large OI will trigger the buyback that I think OP in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lt1tj4/oil_price_crash_anniversary_energy_squeeze_play/) is referring to. These options on futures expire on the 3/17th while calls on XOM and other oil expire the 3/19th.\n\n[Crude April Futures Options](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLJ21/options?moneyness=allRows)\n\n[XOM March Options](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/XOM/options?moneynes)\n\nNow, If you look at OI on XOM you'll already see quite a large OI in ITM calls, but with major interest at 55c which is only several dollars away. It's important to note that valuations for XOM and Crude index are tied closely. If crude goes up, XOM goes up. Since these futures options expire 2 days before options contracts. If crude squeezes as a result, it's going to accelerate the squeeze in XOM, especially at the 55c mark.\n\nXOM has a announcement on wednesday although the nature is unknown it could have something to do with the sale of some of their old production assets which could increase price\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts to watch**\n\n* Key date is on the 4th of March when OPEC announces if they are going to continue at the same output or increase output with signs of global recovery in sight. If they do it would have to be a small amount (like under 500k or 1M extra) This will surely drive the price down however global oil consumption is still hard to predict since consumption is lower than forecasts so its really riding on vaccine distribution, reopening, and general spending to increase which means logistics sees a surge in fuel needs. It's unknown what the current crude reserves are in certain countries, the US is starting to exhaust strategic supplies but OPEC doesn't want to increase production if overall demand does return as quickly as expected.\n   * Something to keep in mind, OPEC has to decide if they want to capitalize and raise oil prices at the cost of accelerating the switch to EV vehicles\n* Another thing to note, when the Dollar Index goes down, crude goes up since every transaction is based on the USD. Since it looks like we're printing more USD this means crude prices will continue to rise, further feeding into a possible squeeze.\n* Closing price of crude on 3/17 to see if futures fall in the money. Currently the larger OI contracts are in the money so a squeeze is probable. This will push all oil stocks up. XOM and Marathon have the strong correlation to Crude price movements and will be strongest with these two followed by Oxy and BP.\n\n**As far as April Put movement:**\n\n* This being said, the OI on puts could be ITM if Opec decides to increase supplies lower crude prices\n* Valuations have been rising in anticipation for the meeting on the 4th. If a considerable raise in barrel output is announced for the month of April then we see a downward prices on crude and petroleum companies.\n\n**Im rather bullish but again, the OPEC meeting on 4th is a big factor**\n\nI am eyeing starters in high OI calls so liquidity isn't as much of an issue:\n\n[XOM 3/19 55C and 60C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/XOM/options?moneynes) \\- Huge OI compared to MRO\n\n[OXY 3/19 30c and 35C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/OXY/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-03-19-m)\n\n[BP 3/19 27.50C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BP/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-03-19-m) \\- It should be noted that BP does not move as tightly with crude movement like ZOM and MRO but it certainly does move.\n\n[UCO 3/19 60C](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/UCO/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-03-19-m) \\- (high risk!) Proshares 2x Crude the daily movement (could be huge on the 17th/18th going into the 19th - Low liquidity (OI=287) but return could be excellent\n\n**Hedging**\n\nI may also pickup some XOM 3/19 50P starter as a hedge just in case ZOM's announcement is negative, but will still hold the calls mentioned above in the event crude surges.\n\n**Inflation figures from stim**\n\nAlso another note, lower USD index values usually correlate to higher crude barrel pricing and with this 1.5T stim plan that was announce we may see another possible driver.

{"title": "Thoughts? Market crash?", "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019ll keep this simple. I expect a market crash before 2022 is over. And will be investing in Precious metals as-well as Bitcoin. Now just a heads up I\u2019m a 19 year old college student with only 10k in the stock market so take everything I say with a grain of salt. Would also love to hear your thoughts!\n\nThe biggest reason I expect a market crash is people not being able to pay off mortgages. Here\u2019s why.\n\nDo you know someone who has bought a house during covid? Well I do. In fact I know A LOT of people who have bought houses during covid due to various reasons. The housing market is just on fire and so are bidding wars. Not only that, the prices of homes have also sky rocketed due to inflation. Unfortunately, this causes people to spend a lot more money on a house then they usually would. And as we all know one thing that comes with buying a house is mortgage. However, due to a covid relief bill passed last year, your mortgage can\u2019t be foreclosed upon until 2/28/2021 or 3/31/2021. When those dates near, I expect a market pull back as people will be forced to pay their mortgage. In my opinion many people won\u2019t be able to pay their mortgage due to covid and also the fact they had to pay such a high price for the house. Most likely causing the housing market to slow down, echoing the 2008 stock market crash. This is not the whole story because if you can\u2019t pay your mortgage you can file for two 180 day extensions. Meaning that we could be living in a bubble for 1 year and when that bubble pops it\u2019s not going to be good. \n\nNow personally, what I hope happens is that by the time those two 180 day extensions expire covid will be mostly over and people will be able to go back to work safely and therefore they will be able to pay off their mortgages and everything works out for the best. \n\n*Originally posted on 2/14/21 but decided to repost to get more thoughts", "id": "lvfcry", "created_utc": 1614620679.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "why would you invest in bitcoin if the market is going to crash lol", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "As a hedge?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Are you seriously saying Bitcoin is more stable than cash?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you believe in the thesis that the digital world will have a store of value similar to how fiat uses gold than yeah, I think BTC will be that store of value.

{"title": "GOEV (Canoo) a Good Options Play?", "selftext": "GOEV is an EV play that's mostly known for its unique \"skateboard\" technology. It's a platform that allows the company (and anyone who licenses it) to custom build their own EV vehicle. This tech and its plans to sell a subscription model of its cars in the future are what differentiate GOEV from the tons of other EV companies. In a world that is hot for EVs, having proprietary tech that allows others to get in on the EV building game easily is an extreme advantage.\n\n**Here are the key points:**\n\n1. This stock originally spiked in January when it was reported that AAPL had been in talks to invest in or possibly buy GOEV back in 2020. For whatever reason, nothing came of the talks back then.\n\n2. AAPL then went on to have talks with Hyundai-Kia, which had partnered with GOEV to develop an all-electric vehicle based on the latter's platform. Whatever reason was for failure of the talks in point 1, it sure doesn't look like a problem with GOEV.\n\n3. GOEV has hinted that there would be partnership announcements sometime in Q1, which we are approaching the end of right now.\n\n4. Due to the overall market correction and EV slaughter over the past two weeks, GOEV has dropped from $19 to a cheap roughly $13 right now. Twice in the past when this stock hit the $12-13 range, Cramer has pumped it on Mad Money. From a technical point of view, we have BOTTOMED. Unless EVs continue to get killed or the market crashes more, I don't see this name going down further. The only real risk for me is that it continues to go sideways for some reason.\n\n**Mechanics of the trade:**\n\n1. Right now, March 19 call options are CHEAP. The 15 strike traded at an average price of 0.55 on Friday, which is crazy for a $2 OTM call on a stock that moves 50 cents to $1 every day on NO NEWS. These options have an expiry THREE WEEKS OUT. The April calls are about twice as expensive, but they are a good deal as well.\n\n2. The above is insane for a stock that moves this much on nothing and is one catalyst headline away from immediately popping to $17+. If it's anything AAPL-related, I can't begin to imagine how high it might go.\n\n3. As of 2/15, the short interest is 15.4%, which is honestly not much compared to the meme stocks, but this will provide more fuel in the upside direction if anything positive is announced.\n\nMy position: 5000 shares and 400 MAR19 15Cs\n\n(None of this is financial advice.

{"title": "Molson-Coors Beverage Co. (TAP) -- DD -- Re-opening play! (YOLO 34K)", "selftext": "This DD isn't filled with memes, calling you all autists and retards (which you are) every other sentence, or wife's boyfriend references.  Might be too bland for you all, and, whatever, fine.  But, at least it's something that isn't another GME post, right?  I miss the days of lots of different DDs.  Feels like ages ago.  ONWARD....\n\nDisclaimer:  I'm just a casual investor and only using data available in google searches so who knows if I'm right on everything below.   Consult your financial advisor before making investment decisions :D\n\n**Summary:  Molson-Coors (TAP) is poised for a significant comeback, with core brands (Coors Light, Miller Lite, Blue Moon) providing a floor valuation that minimizes downside risk, and new products and distribution deals in Seltzer, THC/CBD, and Energy drinks will drive potential double-digit annual growth, contrary to the conservative guidance provided by their Q4'20 earnings call.**\n\n# FINANCIALS\n\n**1.  REVENUES**\n\nDuring a pandemic where they lost a huge majority of their on-premise beer sales in restaurants and bars, TAP Revenues only went down 9%.   Their core brands - Miller Lite and Coors Light -- actually saw increases in revenue in the USA, which offset major revenue losses in Europe, where their products are primarily focused on-premise sales.\n\nMolson-Coors Beverage Annual Revenue  (Millions of US $)\n\n|2020|$9,654|\n|:-|:-|\n|2019|$10,579|\n|2018|$10,770|\n|2017|$11,003|\n\nIt is my prediction that we see revenues grow in 2021 and 2022 to the point where they are surpassing their performance in 2017-2019 by a healthy amount.  I have numerous reasons for this prediction which we'll get into below.\n\n**2.  EBIDTA**\n\nHere's where things get a little confusing.  \n\nMolson-Coors Beverage Annual EBITDA  (Millions of US $)\n\n|2020|$521|\n|:-|:-|\n|2019|$1,637|\n|2018|$2,502|\n|2017|$2,514|\n\nAt first glance, it appears TAP is going bankrupt.  Right?  Holy crap! They're barely making profit!  Quick, SELL!  Hold on now....\n\nIn the 4th quarter of 2020, they slid in a \"Goodwill Impairment Charge\" to the tune of a $1.5BILLION write off.   This is a loss on PAPER -- not in real life.  They're saying their brands aren't worth as much in Europe, so they're booking a loss on their Brand name asset lines.  What does this mean?  Well, lets just say this -- that $521M  EBITDA would have been $2,021M had they not taken this impairment charge.  Whaaa?  yep, that's right, they were technically more profitable in 2020 DURING A PANDEMIC than they were in 2019.\n\nSo why did they take that charge? Well, besides ruining their investor's day when they reported Q4 earnings?  To put it simply - TAXES.  TAP basically did $2B in pretax profits in 2020, but thanks to their impairment charge they wrote off, only have to pay taxes on $521M of it.  The actually booked a loss in 2020 overall, which means they'll be carry forward those losses into 2021.  So they'll be able to avoid a lot more taxes in 2021.\n\nSo what the heck did they do with all that money??  on to the next section..\n\n**3.  DEBT**\n\nOne of the bear cases against TAP was debt.  They have a lot of it.  Alright, so, lets take a look at their debt history.\n\nMolson Coors Beverage Annual Long Term Debt (Millions of US $)  \n\n\n|2020|$7,208|\n|:-|:-|\n|2019|$8,110|\n|2018|$8,894|\n|2017|$10,599|\n|2016|$11,388|\n\nWhat's this?  Holy smokes -- could it be?  So THATS where all that profit went.  Yes, TAP paid off $900M of debt in 2020.  Think about that.  TAP has so much money that they're paying off debt in an environment where loan interest rates are historically low.  In fact, right now, their Debt-to-Equity ratio is hanging in at 0.60 or so.  So, their Market cap is \\~$11.5B and their debt is \\~$7B.  Might seem like a lot - until you look at a competitor like $BUD - Cap: $127B  Debt:  $112B     Oh, shit.  Starts looking a lot better in a hurry, doesn't it?\n\nAlso, something to consider - TAP was trading at over $100/share in 2017 -- when they had 11M in Revenue, and over 11M in debt.  By 2022, TAP will likely have similar revenues ($11M) and less than $7M debt.  This puts them in a much, much stronger position.\n\n**4.  BOOK VALUE**\n\nEnding December, TAP's book value was $57.03 per share - that's if you added up ALL the assets and cash the company has and subtract all the debt and liabilities the company has.  The share is currently trading under $45.  I have no idea how this is even possible.  Look at some comparisons in their market segment:\n\n|COMPANY|BOOK|SHARE PRICE|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|TAP|57.03|45.xx|\n|BUD|33.90|60.xx|\n|STZ|68.88|214.xx|\n|HEINY|13.30|50.xx|\n|SAM|77.91|1028.xx|\n\nTAP is trading at less than what the shareholders would end up with if you liquidated the entire company tomorrow.  this is seriously the equivalent of buying a dollar for $0.79.  Doesn't make sense (of course, lots of stuff doesn't make sense in the market).  Even if we were conservative and assumed their stock should be trading at 1.5x book -- that puts the stock price at $85 - an 88% gain from where it is today.\n\n**5.  FORWARD P/E**  \nSo, here's just one metric you can go by to determine what TAP should really be priced at - but, it doesn't really matter what you look at, nearly ALL of the metrics you look at show that TAP is horribly undervalued.\n\n|COMPANY|FORWARD P/E|\n|:-|:-|\n|TAP|11.24|\n|BUD|18.12|\n|STZ|20.92|\n|SAM|52.63|\n\nAgain, we find that TAP is priced like it will not experience ANY growth, and is a dying company.  Again, even conservatively putting TAP at 18x forward PE, the stock should be trading at $75.  Not 45.xx!\n\n**6.  EARNINGS**\n\nThroughout 2020, TAP released impressive earnings, beating 3 out of 4 estimates - with the 4th only missing due to the goodwill impairment charges I talked above above.  Despite these impressive numbers, the stock struggled, revisting 12 month lows in late October.  Since October, there has been a 36% recovery -- however, we are still not at pre-pandemic stock prices, and as I'm about to outline, I think we're going to be hitting them very very soon.\n\nAlright, I'm done with the financials section.  Hopefully everyone recognizes that this thing is very, very undervalued, even if the company just stays the exact same size as they are.\n\n# FUTURE GROWTH POTENTIAL\n\nThe bear case over the last 5 years was basically that they were too heavily dependent on their core brand beer sales, which were slowly losing market share to craft beer and the hard seltzer frenzy.  As other brands like SAM heavily invested into hard seltzers, TAP was admittedly slow to join in the party.  With their CEO change in 2019, this all changed.  A well defined plan was put into place to turn the company around.  While they do need to play catch up in some areas, TAP is now LEADING in others.  In addition, they are making deals left and right to use their distribution network to partner with various beverage makers to deliver their product to millions of shelves around the country.  Some of these deals are getting them a slice of revenue in the markets they were too far behind in -- but for others, they're going to be market leaders in the near future.\n\nTheir Q4 report indicated that they have a plan for $1B in non-alcoholic sales by 2023.  Personally, I think that's coming far earlier - and here's why:\n\n**1.  CBD and THC drinks**\n\nTAP have teamed up with HEXO, and through their partnership have a 60% stake in \"Truss Beverages\".  Truss Beverages is currently making and selling CBD, THC, and CBD+THC beverages throughout Canada, and recently expanded into Colorodo.  They are slated to be a market leader in the THC/CBD Market, as there are very few competitors with the logistical means and infrastructure to deliver these beverages across the entire country.  With recreational THC becoming widespread across the USA, it's just a matter of time before these drinks end up available nationwide.\n\nBeverages are projected to end up comprising 20-30% of the recreational weed market, and what better than a beer company to be able to distribute these products.\n\nTheir earnings call was very telling -- \"by December, they (Truss Beverages) jumped to the number 1 dollar share position with four of the top five cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada\"  They overtook Canopy's position in the cannabis beverage market in only 4 months from launch in August. TAP is sitting on a goldmine with Truss.\n\n**2. Can you smell what the Rock is cooking?**\n\nIn March, ZOA energy drink will hit the shelves.  Sure, it's a little gimmicky, but, fact of the matter is, Dwayne \"Rock\" Johnson knows how to sell shit.  Dude has 219M followers on Twitter, and hes pushing this stuff hard.  TAP is the one distributing this stuff.  I think it will be bigger than most people expect.\n\n**3. Further expansion into hard seltzers**\n\nTAP quadrupled their production capacity for hard seltzers in 2020, and are rolling out new VIZZY multipacks in March, and Vizzy Lemonade a few weeks after that.  They have a marketing plan in place for Coors Seltzers in 2021 to grow the awareness of the brand.   They're also launching Topo Chico Hard Seltzers and Proof Point Seltzers in 2021 as well.  Each will likely find their home in the Hard Seltzer market, stripping market share from Truly and White Claw as people continue to try new things and find what they like.\n\n**4.  Existing Beer Brand expansion**\n\nBlue Light Sky was the #1 new beer in the USA in 2020, and will likely continue growth.  On top of that, TAP will be bringing Yuengling to new geographic locations across the country (as a Michigander, this pleases me!).  They're also going to be heavily investing in marketing in 2021 as part of the USA re-opening strategy which I think is a wise investment as they can capture a larger slice of pent-up demand.\n\n**5.  The Re-open**\n\nDoes anything really need to be said here?  Yeah, it's happening.  And everyone is going to go out.  And they're going to drink.\n\n# OTHER MARKET FORCES\n\n1.  Eventually, the market will need to come back to reality and price stocks based on fundamentals.  Not to say that it will happen fast - especially as long as there are stimulus packages and QE, but, IMO there is definitely a case where Growth stocks trade sideways until fundamentals catch up to their prices.  If people do rotate out of growth, they're going to look for solid companies with good fundamentals.  There's a lot of room in TAP for the stock price to rise and it STILL be a good deal for these people seeking a stable investment.  Beer is a fairly recession-proof stock as well.\n\n2.  TAP will likely be re-instating a dividend in the second half of 2021.  This should help fuel that rotation; potentially before the end of Q2 2021.\n\n3.  Michael Burry opened a position in TAP in Q4 2020.  He was holding 150,000 shares as of Dec 31, now worth around $6.8M.  This info was made public around Feb 18.  We may see some people follow him into the stock if there is a large migration out of growth.\n\n4.  Around 90% of the public float is held by institutions and they've been slowly accumulating over the past 6 months.  This means a relatively small amount of retail volume / demand could easily drive the share price up quickly, under the assumption that institutions are likely to be holding this stock long-term.\n\n# TLDR; IT CHEAP AS HELL, WEED DRANKS, VALUE ROTATION, STONKS ONLY GO UP\n\n**POSITIONS**  \n150  SHARES  \n50c  Apr 16/21 (37 contracts)  \n50c  Oct 15/21 (30 contracts)  \n55c  Apr 16/21 (195 contracts) - this one is slightly retarded, I don't recommend  \n55c  Jan 21/22 (10 contracts)", "id": "lvb868", "created_utc": 1614610636.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Nice DD, but I can't invest in beer that sucks.", "score": 33, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5500285625457764}, {"body": "Really good write up.

So you are getting the stock at a 10% discount largely due to a non-cash goodwill impairment. \n\n2) In late 2020 TAP added a new sleek can production line capable of producing 750m sleek cans annually. Why does this matter...sleek cans are sexy af and the default packaging for any new brand. These cans are also impossible to procure unless your name is RedBull. Big competitive advantage for TAP having manufacturing of these cans in house.

They also did a large good-will write-off last year. If you look only at the earning before taxes excluding unusual items (restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill,...) you get:\n2017: 1,481.90\n2018: 1,161.00\n2019: 1,230.00\n2020: 1,098.70\nso there is a similar drop in income, and not an increase as you suggested.\n\n2. While their long term debt situation looks good. Short term things do not look as well. Their current Quick ratio (basically total easily acquired or held cash, divided by short term debt) is at x0.4, with ~$1.45b of cash and receivables and ~$3.9b of current liabilities.\n\nThat being said, even if they won't be able to pay the current liabilities, the low price/book ratio is incredibly unusual, so might still be worth it as a long term hold. I won't get any options though.\n\nEdit: I actually messed up. Their long term debt situation an \"real\" price to book are actually bad. Out of $27b on the balance sheet, $19.5b is intengible assets, even after the goodwill write\n-down. That leaves them at -$7.5b in debt over their assets. That's pretty bad.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Great catch RE the \\~19.5/27 b of total current assets being from intangibles/goodwill, or roughly 72%  \n\n\nLooking at a couple of comparisons in the industry:   \nBUD: \\~170/237m total assets from intangibles/goodwill, or 72% (from last 20-F)  \nSBZ: \\~10.5/27.5b total current assets from intangibles/goodwill, or 38% (latest Q)  \nSAM: \\~215M/1.4b total current assets from intangibles/goodwill, or 15% (latest K)  \n\n\nSo although the intangibles are definitely a high % of total assets for TAP, this does at least seem comparable to the situation for BUD (though much higher than for SBZ or SAM). \n\nDoes anyone have a view on whether it is justified for large companies such as BUD and TAP to allocate so much asset value to intangibles/goodwill? \n\nLooking back at the price/book ratios above, it does seem like SBZ and SAM have much higher P/B ratios than both BUD and TAP, so perhaps the market is already pricing in a discount for both BUD and TAP due to the relative high % of their assets coming from goodwill/intangibles.   \n\n\nStill, I leave a bit uncertain about whether TAP is a good \"value\" objectively speaking, or only in comparison to BUD.

{"title": "PRLB$", "selftext": "Protolabs is (Currently..) a short run\\prototype manufacturing business. As a person who has worked in manufacturing\\engineering\\CNC fields my whole life, IMHO this company is on track to BLOW tf UP! \n\nNow, let me break this down for you diamond polished \ud83e\udde0 gorillas...\n\nPRLB has recently been in the spot light for it's 3D printing abilitys, but we must look past that, that is but sauce on the side of your 60 piece tendie meal. PRLB has been expanding, and expanding BIG. They have warehouses across the country and a few dotted across other countries. Why is this significant? Because it is! These warehouses are packed with state of the art CNC Lathes, Mills, injection\\Erection Molding Machines, and yes you retards fav..3D printers as well as Metal 3D printers.   Alongside a team of engineers and operators. These warehouses are all tied together in an ever expanding network.\n\nHow does it work you ask?\n\n[protolabs](http://protolabs.com) \n\nLet's say you have an idea for a body warming dildo. You say hey, if I make a heated dildo it will prolly warm me up when I'm cold way better then a costly heating system and I kill two birds with one stone... Great!\nSo you grab what's left of your crayon set and scribble down a very crude drawing of your idea. You then go on the protolabs website log in to your account and upload your crudeness to the site which then sends it to an engineer sitting in a wearhouse 100miles from your cold self. After the initial shock, the engineer begins drawing up your dildo in CAD software and sends it out to the waiting metal 3D printer and injection molding team. Within a couple hours your prototype is finished and on it's way to your door. (Yes they are known to some times do same day delivery.) You get your dildo and it works just as expected! You think yes! I must sell this! So you go back on protolabs.com and order 200 more.\n\nNow that you children understand what they are currently doing, let's talk the future! This is where things get good IMO..\n\nNow, protolabs is looked at by the majority of the world as a niche business.. Prototypes\\3D printing. And they would be right, up until recently. Protolabs has low key been using the Amazon method of gradual domination. Yes prototype and 3D printing work has made them alot of money but that is just stage one. Like amazon, as protolabs brings in profits it reinvests it into more warehouses, you would say why? There can't be that much prototype work.. Exactly, PRLB has been slowly setting themselves up for something bigger. \n\nIn my estimates in the next 5 years they will have enough infrastructure to be the DOMINANT manufacturing company in the country. There are thousands and thousands of small machine shops and manufacturing plants across the country. From first hand experience (owner of a machine shop\\stamping plant) since the rona american businesses have been leaving China in droves. We have never been more busy. Now think what happens when PRLB has the capacity to do long run manufacturing on top of what it's already doing now? Not to mention the quick turn around times. It will be the defacto one stop shop for manufacturing of ALL kinds. \n\nThis is where you smoothies come in, I'm an engineer\\buisness owner not a stonk stonkerson.  From a business model stand point, I see tendies.. Lots o tendies. \n\nI am looking for some DD on the market end of this tendie manufacturer. All discussion is welcome, good bad and otherwise.
