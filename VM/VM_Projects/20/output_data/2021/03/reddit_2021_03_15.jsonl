{"title": "(3/15) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, March 15th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-15-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Stocks set to rise after record closes for Dow and S&P 500\n\n> * U.S. stock futures pushed higher Monday even as the 10-year Treasury yield held around 1.63%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Nasdaq fell modestly as recently slumping tech stocks continued to fight rising bond yields. However, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all posted strong weekly gains. Ahead of Monday\u2019s open, the Nasdaq was up more than 3.3% for the year. The Dow and S&P 500 were up 7% and almost 5%, respectively in 2021.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Bitcoin takes breather after surge to over $60,000\n\n> * Bitcoin dropped 6% on Monday, after jumping Saturday to another all-time high \u2014 this time above $60,000. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency has just about doubled this year. It\u2019s soared more than 1,000% over the past 12 months. Bitcoin\u2019s market value climbed back above $1 trillion last week. The incredible rally has been driven by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms as well as speculative demand.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Treasury yields near 1-year highs ahead of Fed meeting\n\n> * While the 10-year Treasury yield was actually a bit lower Monday morning, it was only slightly below its more than one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. The rapid rise in yields this year has traders wondering whether the Federal Reserve may be losing control of the direction of interest rates. The Fed\u2019s two-day March meeting begins Tuesday, with questions about how long near-zero rates and extraordinarily easy Covid monetary policy can last.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Biden and Harris to sell $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan\n\n> * The Fed is expected to forecast better economic growth after last week\u2019s signing by President Joe Biden of the $1.9 trillion package of fiscal measures designed to help Americans, U.S. businesses and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the road this week to sell the Covid stimulus plan, which includes up to $1,400 in direct payments to many people.\n\n> * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland\u2019s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world\u2019s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday\u2019s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Fauci warns against lifting U.S. restrictions right now\n\n> * White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning state leaders that the nation\u2019s battle with the coronavirus is still \u201cnot in the end zone.\u201d He urged Americans to adhere to public health measures despite the ramp-up of vaccinations, pointing to new infection spikes in Europe as a cautionary tale of relaxing too soon. As of Sunday night, the CDC reported that nearly 37.5 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated \u2014 more than 11% of the nation\u2019s population of over 330 million.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://i.imgur.com/FAhhnsR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/jzI7nmQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yj4c66b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/DeotZjy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/sSD4nkM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/GnLXyAH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BtbQK1p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7Wcl6PV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TEJAfPF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wnSTJ2O.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* RIDE\n* ALGO.X\n* AMC\n* EBON\n* NGA\n* NLSP\n* DKNG\n* GNRS\n* BB\n* HOGE.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-genmark-diagnostics-amc-entertainment-eli-lilly-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK)** \u2013 GenMark will be bought by Swiss drugmaker Roche for $1.8 billion in cash, or $24.05 per share.

Average over 150yrs has been 16.7 and the only two times it has been higher than the current level is Black Tuesday, 1929 and the Dotcom bubble of 2000\n* US and UK inflation levels continue to rise. Federal stimulus packages and Federal Reserve injections into the stock market to keep it afloat from the Covid collapse is bringing concerns for the US Dollar. Inflation drives up Treasury Bond Yields. This in turn, drives up mortgage rates and causes suspension of some oil output, driving up oil and gas prices. \n* International investments to the US plummeted 49% in 2020 while that same metric rose 4% to China.\n* Covid Varients are throwing a wildcard into the overall recovery. \n* WallStreetBets has opened up another wildcard about investor confidence in the stock market. This has also coincidentally caused money to flood into the formerly well known \u201chighly volatile\u201d market of cryptocurrencies (once only known as a market that would \u201cnever be as stable as the stock market\u201d). \n* Recent round of stimulus payments are expected to not be spent the same as previous rounds were. Surveys are already showing that individuals and families intend to simply save or pocket the cash rather than inject into the economy as intended. \n\nNow for the charts: \n\n[SPY: Increased Flattening of the last 90 day resistance line along with a significant spread of the increase spread of the 90 day support line creating a rising and broadening wedge, a textbook bearish pattern after a rally \\(in this case 9mo recovery.

Volatility is anytime the market is experiencing extreme rising or falling in price. Prior to the Covid meltdown last year \\(VXX:78.77\\), the VXX was already at record lows \\(13.15\\). Too low is not safe, too high is not safe. All time lows \\(and highs\\) are almost always indicative of an imminent reversal looming. In just a year, the VXX has dropped back down to 13.95 as of today, March 12th. Typical correction cycles are on average of 1 every 1.87yrs. This is .87yrs too soon to be at that level, indicating too rapid of a recovery \\(overcorrection\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/jvft6rl2h7n61.jpg?width=957&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18642fa006a3af0b382f45028494b4f7c0d05704)\n\nAt this rate, the VXX is expected to be at or below the pre-Covid Meltdown (by around March 19th) faster than SPY will reach its projected 405. This puts SPY at around 400 if the VXX all time low triggers the correction. Either way, the target date range to keep an eye on is March 18th-March 26th. Fridays (in this case, March 19th and March 26th), are typically a weekly selloff. If SPY meets 400 by March 18th, watch Friday the 19th during the \u201ctypical selloff\u201d as it may be a triggered larger correction in disguise. Even if SPY remains at 400 going into the week of the 22nd be on alert because any bad catalyst or news could trigger an imminent correct. If SPY reaches the secondary target of 405 by March 25th, again watch the Friday selloff for a potential correction in disguise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, **NONE OF THIS IS INVESTMENT ADVICE OR SUGGESTIONS**.", "id": "m5mm6j", "created_utc": 1615820586.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe we\u2019re at a shifting point in the market where everything is made up and the points don\u2019t matter.  \n\nShiller of 35 looks scary compared to 1929 and 2000, but what if that 35 becomes a new low permanently?  \n\nDo you not think investors will keep paying high prices for stocks and potentially the Shiller could keep going to 40, 50, or even 100+ in 20 years?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "All good points.

This will spur other automatic advancements in all STEM fields and seep effortlessly into our every day lives, assisting us at work and making us more valuable then ever imagined. \n\nQuantum Computing (Infinite computing)\nhttps://youtu.be/kEJBxotcxRw\nWith quantum computing we can transform medicine, break encryption and revolutionise communications and artificial intelligence.\n\n Let\u2019s talk about that for a second. AI and quantum technologies go hand in hand. The quantum computers of the next decade will have the potential to rapidly accelerate the development of artificial intelligence. \nFrom improving self-driving cars to modelling chemical reactions.\n\nRight now, supercomputers can only analyse the most basic molecules. But quantum computers operate using the same quantum properties as the molecules they\u2019re trying to simulate. They will have no problem handling even the most complicated reactions, unlocking many secrets hidden in our universe. \n\nMore efficient products like new composites for structures or even batteries in electric cars, better and cheaper drugs, or vastly improved solar panels. \n\nQuantum computers will find a use anywhere where there\u2019s a large, uncertain complicated system that needs to be simulated. That could be anything from predicting the financial markets, to improving weather forecasts, to modelling the behaviour of individual electrons. \n\nQuantum encryption keys could not be copied or hacked.

The implementation of hardwired interfaces like Neuralink, which full capabilities are still off in the future, the more readily available smart glasses and AR systems such as Hololens will allow us to interact with the digital realm giving us real time information for work or personal time. \n\n3D Printing\nhttps://youtu.be/NZSWFHslzE0\nManufacturing of new devices, chips, equipment and machined parts will completely change how we buy our products.

Even if energy efficiency continues to keep pace, our increasing population and the proliferation of technology to the underdeveloped world will put vast strains on our electrical output. This is complicated even further if we increase production with sources that produce destructive waste like coal or uranium. It will only be sustainable if we can produce a scalable clean source of power. Enter fusion! With an estimated cost of .06\u00a2/kWh of clean energy, the scalability of adding many devices,  and the miniaturizing over time... we are on the threshold of endless-clean-affordable energy.

People have also started to realize that if we want to reduce climate change, virus outbreaks and animal suffering, eating less meat is a hard requirement. On top of that, plant-based food will become a lot cheaper to make as companies develop the technology and reach mass scale, while meat will only become more expensive as we start taxing carbon emissions properly and animal welfare requirements become more strict.

I personally run a business that makes video games and the amount of high quality talent you can work with online nowadays is amazing. Not just individuals but even other studios. The enterprise future of freelancing is huge. Stocks to watch: UPWK.\n\n* Weed: Obvious story with all the legalization happening around the world. Eventually the space will mature and a few winners will emerge to become large multinational companies, but it's difficult to predict which ones. Stocks to watch: Heard some good things about HITIF and GTEC, but haven't researched them enough yet.\n\n* Space: SpaceX has made commercial space companies a reality.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 15, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.\n\nLast week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\n\nWashington\u2019s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cThe pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.\u201d \n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nSeveral countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union\u2019s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.\n\nIn other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Electric\u2019s (GE) stock rallied more than 5% today after its worst week in around a year.\n* Volkswagen (VWAGY) plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe by 2030 to expand infrastructure for charging electric vehicles. \n* Tesla Inc. said Chief Executive Elon Musk has changed his title at the company to \"Technoking of Tesla,\" and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn will have the title of \"Master of Coin.\" \n* The Chinese government wants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to sell some of its media assets, including the South China Morning Post, because of growing concerns about the technology giant\u2019s influence over public opinion in the country, according to Bloomberg who is citing a person familiar with the matter.\n* AMC finally gets to reopen in Los Angeles on Monday after nearly a year of shutdowns because of the pandemic.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price is written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Adient (ADNT) with a host of target raises.

{"title": "CDX almost at an all time low. Have we learned nothing from 2007..", "selftext": "I spoke to Moody's Chief Credit Officer today on Zoom.\n\nHe told me indirectly that variable rates on credit is not accounted for/weighted heavily in their rating assignment , nor has it become a more significant part of their rating model process since the pandemic - citing that interest between the 0-2% bound is a structural certainty over the next 3 years and reaffirmed by the FED.\n\nI have a problem with this. Because corporate credit in the US alone ballooned more than 10% last year, and those on variable rates will get crushed if yields continue to move higher DESPITE the fact that they're still being rated top notch investment grade (BECAUSE THEY DONT TAKE VARIABLE SQUEEZES INTO ACCOUNT!)\n\nIn my opinion this missrating then of corporate credit is why CDX index is positioned exactly where it was July Pre-COVID and you can't use the inflation argument because so much of this debt is variable rate.\n\nSo if yields keep moving higher, despite what Mr Moody might think about the 0-2% bound, then the credit ratings this corporate credit has been assigned is going to look awfully difficult to justify, and more often than not, the market follows the rating agency downgrades.

{"title": "Hedging Fundamentals - Hedgefunds bad, hedging good!", "selftext": "Dear apes and monkeys, I've loved the fundamentals series you had posted before it got absolutely drowned in animal adoption posts, you truly don't leave any ape behind!\n\nSo here's my part to hedging and why YOLO might be fun but a little bit more care when investing can help you to buy the dip and profit greatly!\n\n## Why Hedge?\nIt's always tempting to go all in on one very promising bet to take the most profits possible with the available bankroll. Always hitting the perfect timing for entry and exit consistantly is impossible, period. And it's even more complex than buying at the lowest point and selling the peak.\n\n\nAknowledging this fact is vital to understand why hedging does not only reduce the risk to the portfolio but in the long run leads to a higher return on investment.\n\nThis guide uses $100k as a baseline not because that's what everyone has, it just makes the math a little easier to read.\n\nFor convenience I'll use a price of $100 per share of your favorite stock.\n\n## Imagine this scenario!\nYour favorite stock has been doing well so far. Excluding events such as GME recently with factor x2 swings within a week or two minutes of trading, such as last wednesday, are more of an exception. But let's say it's been doing exceptionally good with +20% in a brief period of time. \n\nIf one has put 100% of its portfolio, $100k -> 1000 shares, into that stock the total value of this portfolio would now be $120k.\n\n\nAnd now a market correction hits, pushing the price down 30%.\n\nSome quick math (100%-30%) * $120k = $84k puts the portfolio value down -$16k in total.\n\n\nHedging in general would have cussioned that a lot. Let's use 20% of the portfolio for hedging and the 80% (800 shares) for your favorite stock.\n\nThe runup: $20k+(80%*$120k) = $116k\n\nThe dip (after rebalancing, discussed later): (80% * 116k *(100%-30%)) + (20% * 116k) = ~$88k, a dip of -$12k.\n\n\nThe hedging decreased the profits from +$20k to -$16k and the dip from -$16k to -$12k.\n\nBut that \"rebalancing\" is key here and makes all the difference.\n\n\n## Rebalancing\nIf your strategy is to use 20% of your portfolio for hedging those 20% might represent different dollar amounts with time. After that runup from $100 per share to $120 the value of the hedged portfolio was $116k.\n\nInitially $20k were used to hedge, now those $20k represent only 17.2% of the $116k. To get to 20% again some shares need to be sold in order to rebalance the hedge to $23k.\n\nStocks after the runup: 80%*$116k/$120 -> ~773 shares (27 sold, started at 800)\n\n\nBut the same goes for the dip. Now those $23.2k represent 26% of the portfolio so you'll have to buy the dip to get it down to 20% again. So to rebalance you'll \"have to\" buy shares for $3.2k. \n\nTotal stocks after the dip rebalancing: $3.2k / $85 = 38 shares (811 shares in total)\n\n\nSince you're bullish on that stock you and I both assume the price will bounce back. But this time you'll have more shares than before, giving you an edge over the plain YOLO.\n\n\nBriefly:\n\n### Whenever the stock goes up, this strategy takes some profits without ever exiting the position.\n### Whenever the stock drops, this strategy buys the dip but never goes all in\n\n## When to rebalance\nThat's not easy to answer. If you're asking r/investing folks monthly is more than enough but we're not investing in super stable low volatile ETFs here.\n\nMy rule of thumb is to rebalance when the planned allocation exceeds 10%. Want to use 20% for hedging? If your hedge goes below 18% or above 22% a rebalance could make sense. Since we're on WSB here people might hit 10% swings every single day and that's WAY too often.\n\n\nSo rebalancing maximum once per week and only if the allocation is off by 20% (so 16% or 24% with a 20% hedge) could be a sensible strategy.\n\nBut you'll have to see what works for you. Rebalancing too often means paying the spread every time for both the hedge and the bet and that adds up.\n\n\n## What can be used to hedge?\nThere are a lot of ways to hedge but as a rule of thumb everything which is pretty stable can be used. Low volatility, tried and tested in the last few corrections and recessions.\n\nYou should, however, still be able to quickly liquidate your hedge. This puts most if not all physical hedges out of the question.\n\n### Options\n\nOptions are the most powerfull hedge but are a lot more complex and won't be covered in depth here. It also throws off the math above a bit but can be used very effectively. \n\nBooks have been written about using options to hedge and a short summary would probably confuse more than help. I _highly_ reccommend reading \"The Greeks and Hedging Explained\" by P. Leoni for that.\n\n\nVery, very briefly and basic: You can use a PUT, preferrably a bit OTM (10% is common), to hedge your massive bullish position. Worst Case you'll lose 10% plus your premium which can vary wildly (Don't do this on GME. Just don't it's way to expensive).\n\n### Currency\nThis is the easiest hedge. Just leave some cash in your trading account without it being allocated in some stocks.\n\n### Precious Metals\nPrecious metals like gold and silver won't yield much returns if any but they usually go up when the stock market goes down. This will help you have the cash on hand you need to buy the dip.\n\nI don't reccommend buying physical metals as a hedge since the spread is massive, taxes are much more complicated and finding a buyer can take some time.\n\nThere are some theories on several funds not allocating 100% of the metal in vaults so if you're afraid of that Sprott not just promises to have that metal, they check regularly and prove it. Symbols are PHYS for gold and PSLV for silver.\n### SPACs (No, really!)\nSPACs are very interesting! They have a hard floor at $10 per unit (units contain a share and a fraction of a warrant) because they are required to have that amount of cash per unit issued at hand.\n\nThat's not just a pinky promise, those funds are monitored. They have two years to akquire a company or they get dissolved, distributing the funds or $10 to every shareholder, whichever is higher.\n\n\nSo why SPACs? Those funds yield some interest and if they do find a company to akquire the stock price may go up a lot. 50%-100% are not uncommon and using them as a hedge is almost riskless.\n\n\nWhat to look out for / type into google: Near NAV SPACs.\n\n### Stocks or stock based ETFs (not very good)\nYou _can_ use less volatile stocks or ETFs as a hedge but when the entire market goes down they will go down, too.\n\nSo if you want to hedge against a market-wide correction they might be the wrong hedge.\n\nIf you really don't want to miss out on general market growth and only want to hedge against a correction on your favorite stock but not the entire market, say right before earnings, stocks may be useful.\n\nI really don't like stocks as a hedge but if you really want to, some infrastructure / telecommunication companies (Not NOK or BB, they are too volatile due to WSB publicity) could be stocks to use here.\n\n### Inverse Funds\nThanks to u/A_KY_gardener for brining these to my attention! Inverse funds don't exist for every stock or index but they can be used as a hedge on these, too. \n\nBasically whenever whatever they invert goes up, they go down and vice versa. \n\n\nThey are a bit awkward to use since they're inherently as volatile as their underlying stock/index, but whenever the entire market goes deep into the red they're going to shine bright and green, offering some tendies to buy the dip.\n\n\n\nThere is one boring reason you can use them, depending on your local tax law, and that's to create losses on paper. If you bet both long on a stock or index and the same amount into these inverse funds then one of them will be up roughly whatever the other leg is down. If you realize the losses in the end of december then you'll have realized losses but unrealized gains going into the new year. That can delay the taxes to pay and you get to gamble with that tax money. \n\n## TL;DR\nWant to buy the dip but don't have any cash left? Well then your hedging sucked and you should read this guide again.\n\n\n## Afterword - Hedging and Hedgefunds; know the difference!\n### Hedgefunds bad\nYes.\n### Hedgefunds hedge?\nThey used to. Hedgefunds used to protect cash by utilizing complex financial instruments.\nThe goal was to protect the cash, not to increase it.\n\n\nThis has changed. Now they're exclusive to the ultra wealthy and trade anything and everything to beat the market.\n\nArt, stocks, weather, insurance, whatever. \n\n\nThey do hedge their super risky bets but recently it's become clear that these hedges are by no means allencompassing.\n### The shorting meta\nYou've seen kids build sandcastles and other kids coming around, give that castle a kick and it's all gone.\n\n\nImagine that's a company being built in years or decades and some piece of bad news leaving the company in shambles. They might be rebuild but that's going to take time.\n\nSince both the buildup and the teardown can be used to make cash and it's much, much easier, less risky AND FASTER to damage a company than spotting a good company with great potential.\n\nThat's why hedgefunds love shorting so much and why they talk about them identifying fraud so much, _\"They're the good guys\"_ and all that. Once they have spottet a target they'll dig up any dirt they can find or otherwise make sure the company is viewed as a bad investment to profit greatly.\n\n\n\nFound some wrong information? Please let me know and I'll edit it in with the appropriate credit!\n\nAny questions are very welcome but finding the time to answer them in depth could take a while.\n\n\nEdit 1: Added Inverse Funds\n\nEdit 2: Added rebalancing timing", "id": "m5kgcq", "created_utc": 1615814194.0, "score": 164, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Im eating these up.
