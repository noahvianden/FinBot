{"title": "Let\u2019s Talk About \u201cMarket Makers\u201d", "selftext": "  \n\nLet\u2019s Talk About \u201cMarket Makers\u201d\n\nGetting Straight to the point. \n\nThere are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a \u201cMarket Maker\u201d.\n\nHowever each license does not make you a market maker.\n\nThere are three different types of license holders:\n\n\\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs), \n\n\\-Floor brokers\n\n\\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)\n\n1.) The DMMs, formerly known as \u201cspecialists,\u201d act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.\n\n2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.\n\n3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE\u2019s goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.\n\nExample of DMM Role:\n\nOn the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.\n\nEach of the counters is a DMM\u2019s post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs\u2019 posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.\n\nImportant: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.  \n\n\nExample of DMM Role:   \n\n  \n\nYour clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM\u2019s post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM\u2019s post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer\u2019s representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to \u201cwork\u201d the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM\u2019s post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM\u2019s bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 \u00d7 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.\n\nFor a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM\u2019s post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the \u201ccrowd.\u201d In such cases, the DMM\u2019s responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM\u2019s post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution.", "id": "mf8nnt", "created_utc": 1616961708.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I don\u2019t understand how this is done for every stock.

{"title": "A DD on Cango Inc $CANG - A solid player if you are betting on China's EV boom", "selftext": "This DD is on Cango Inc and I will be breaking this down into parts that analyse the company's main functions, competitors, financials, management and potential catalysts. TLDRs can be found at the end of this post. Please do your own DD before investing I'm not a financial advisor. \n\n\n\n# What does this company do?\n\n3 main businesses: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Automotive Financing Facilitation: (Clear market leader (see \\* below) )**\n\n* Helps car buyers complete car purchase procedures more efficiently and provides loan solutions.   \n \n* Cango goes to the car dealers to explain content and terms of the car loan while providing assistance to the customers by completing online application and subsequent landing services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Automotive Transaction Facilitation : (No Competitors in addressable market as per IR team)**\n\n* Connects auto producers, individual consumers, and offline physical network channels through transaction service platform.\n* Helps make automobile circulation simpler and more efficient. Cooperates with mature logistic infrastructure service providers, whose parking space are rented on a variable cost basis.\n* Helps car dealers increase turnover rates, and improve logistics and warehousing financial services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**After-hours services facilitation** \n\n* Covers diversified insurance such as auto insurance, non-auto insurance and health insurance. It dedicates personnel to provide follow-up to guarantee professional services. \n\n\\* I have been in constant contact with their IR team and since it was hard finding data online on their competitors in China, they said there is only one directly comparable competitor (Yixin Group (2858.HK) ). But, better profitability in Cango\u2019s business, and it operates its own sales team while Yixin relies on third party agents. (more on this later)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMission: Work with car buyers to make car buying simple and pleasant. \n\nVision: Become the preferred car buying service platform for consumers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Key Facts and Figures\n\n1. Autofinancing solutions covering **ALL TESLA STORES** in Shanghai. \n2. Strategic Investment in **Li Auto** with **2.2%** equity interest. They invested in Li Auto pre IPO and this has netted them **$3.3 billion** since then, a considerable cash influx to strengthen their already formidable financial position. \n3. Strategic Partnerships with Li Auto, Weltmeister Motor, Aion, \n4. Strategic Partnerships with China's **biggest bank (ICBC)** and 13 other financial institutions. \n5. Backed by Tencent, Warburg Partners\n6. Partnerships with 48,000 dealers\n7. Have assisted 1,700,000 + car buyers.\n8. Partnered with other 36+ industry participants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**. If Chinese consumers buy more cars, it is likely that there will be more auto financing. Moreover, car dealers will need more logistics solutions and efficiency if they want to get ahead of other car providers. Cango solves both problems without having any direct competitors and a robust financial position (see later). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Cango invested in **Li auto** which has returned $3.3 billion in 2020 after Li\u2019s IPO. Cango is still holding about 19.6 milllion shares which accumulate to a total unrealized value of $568.4 million, whilst the majority has been realized and acts as a bonus to their short-term investment assets.   \n \n* They have partnered with ICBC (China\u2019s biggest bank) and 13 other financial institutions for their auto financing business. \n\n**They are building a technology-based dealership management system to provide multilevel integrated guidance and services for their dealers to cover the entire car transaction process.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Industry Metrics\n\n1. Cango has maintained market share despite the fallout in car sales due to the Covid pandemic. This is a great sign since 2020 was guided as a \u201cslow year\u201d for Cango but we saw new peaks in financials. (see later) .Car sales volume declined by 6.6 % YOY in 2020, yet Cango's market share stayed put at around 1% of total revenue / total cars sold in China. This is not a metric for their particular industry but for the entire China's car sales. \n\n2. Cango is the dominant player in the auto financing field. However, this field is yet to plateau. It   \nonly has a tamed market penetration rate when compared with US\u2019s 80% penetration rate.   \nWith auto financing as their core revenue driver, it can be safely assumed that this area is yet t   \nto result in diminishing revenues and the next few years will be key for Cango to continue   \nexpanding and maintain resilience in the market. With its key partners, it won\u2019t be a stretch to   \nassume this can be achieved. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey have an end-to-end technology enabled auto platform. Cango is making sure their technology keeps up with market trends, which is crucial for surviving in China as an emerging business. \n\n**Automotive Financing Facilitation**\n\n\\- Data Insights\n\n\\- Digital Application\n\n\\- Credit Risk Model\n\n**Automotive Transaction Facilitation**\n\n\\- Digitalised trading platform for registered dealers \n\n\\- Dealer Training system \n\n**After-hours services facilitation** \n\n\\- Telematics Insight \n\n\\- Paperless repossession\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why would a consumer choose Cango instead of just buying loans directly from banks? \n\nCango removes bureaucracy and increases efficiency. This graphic speaks a lot in terms of consumers\u2019 search for ease-of-use technology. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/0BymFSt](https://imgur.com/a/0BymFSt)  \n \n\n\n\n# Why you shouldn\u2019t worry about investing in a Chinese company.\n\nBut, investing in China comes with an awful lot of caution for investors, with government regulations that are often disclosed without warnings, resulting in overnight losses in value. However, Cango is structured in a way that takes advantage of government policy. Governments in China want to transform the automotive industry by removing pollution, yet Cango only deals in cars and doesn\u2019t produce them. Moreover, the recent crackdown of Alibaba and Alipay exemplifies the loyalty the government places in state banks. Cango has only partnered with state banks. \n\n\n\n# Awards and Recognition \n\n\n\n1. For the third year in a row, Cango was awarded the **Best Auto Finance Service** \n\n2. Cango Ranks among \u201c2020 China\u2019s Top 10 Innovators in Auto Marketplaces, Platforms and Services\u201d \n\n3. Cango was awarded the Innovative Auto Finance Service Enterprises award by China \n\n \n\n# Financials\n\n\\- Blowout year, 43% increase in revenue. Both core businesses have accelerated even though this sector is cyclical and was hit due to Covid.  \n\n\\- Important thing to note is that in q4 50% of their revenue came from car trading transactions which is a drastic change since auto financing was their core revenue driver. The good thing about this is that it shows they are expanding outside of auto financing since auto financing revenues did not decline. However, we have to note that this business has lower margins, is fairly new and yet to be completely integrated. After emailing their Investor Relations team, the conversation transcribed as follows: \n\nMe: Thank you for your informative email, I really appreciate it. Everything is clear for me now but I have one final thing to clarify: Your network of offline dealers interact with each other through Cango and \"trade\" cars while inventory is stored at warehouses which are rented on a variable cost basis. This helps car dealers be more efficient and solve logistics problem while Cango receives commissions on this car trading business. Am I right to think along these lines? \n\nIR Rep: Your understanding is correct.  \n Just to be clear, our car trading business is in the early stage, the business model is that we generate the demand from our dealers, then we place orders with OEMs. We just earn the spread, not commission. The gross profit margin of car trading business is around 1% now. When we reach a certain business scale, we will optimize the profitbility and will make the model lighter by increasing the proportion of facilitation(no inventory), at that time, we can earn commissions from both dealers and OEMs side. \n\n\\- Though Cost of revenue has increased, the cost of revenues as a percentage of relevant revenues was the same as before, cost increased to the boom in their car transaction business. \n\n\\- They got a $3.3 billion cash influx from their investment in Li Auto which is such a bonus to their already strong balance sheet performance. \n\nCurrent Price = $8.43\n\nP/E = 1.2 (criminally undervalued, they just announced a crazy special dividend of $1 per share)\n\nDividend Yield = 12.5%\n\nBook Value = $17\n\nPrice / Book = 0.5\n\nPrice / Cash = 1.65 \n\nQuick Ratio = 3.6 (wtf)\n\nCurrent Ratio = 3.6\n\nDebt / Equity = 0.3\n\nLong Term Debt / Equity = 0.12 \n\nEPS Q/Q = 1386.50%\n\nSales Q/Q = 173.80%\n\nInstitutional Ownership = 30.80%\n\nROA = 34.10%\n\nROE = 51.70%\n\nGross Margin = 46%\n\nOperating Margin = 15.50%\n\nShort Float = 2.25%\n\nThese numbers speak for themselves. It doesn't take an accountant to realise how undervalued this company is. If you want an in depth analysis of their balance sheet and income statement, message me because r/stocks is really annoying photos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Management Team\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RgoJHRP](https://imgur.com/a/RgoJHRP)\n\nSolid Experience from top universities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Price Target\n\nI have tried to assess their fair value and revenue prediction to create a simplified future cash flow analysis of a conservative price target (assuming 15% growth in revenue and increases in costs) and a bullish price target (assuming 20-40% growth). You can find both if you message me. But from my very simplified calculation the price should be anywhere from **$16-$30.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \n\nCango is a company that captures the behind the scenes of the entire Chinese auto market. They are the leaderrs in providing auto financing solutions and auto trading transactions. They are criminally undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of 2. They have grown EPS and net revenue every year at 40% growth. They also got a massive influx from investing in Li Auto which netted them $3.3 billion in profit. They are the top solutions partners for Tesla stores in China, VM motors and Aion and have a registered network of 48,000 car dealers. They are also on the right side of government policy since they have partnered up with the biggest bank in China and 13 other financial institutions which are state-run. \n\nOverall, If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth.

{"title": "Tesla skew slopes diverging across time", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nA few people liked my last post on selling steep PLTR skew for a long-decay, low risk, high upside spread. As it was the first time some people saw that kind of trade, I wanted to make a post on another opportunity a little more complex with a little more explanation.\n\n**TSLA June/Sept Risk-Reversal Calendar Trade**\n\nHere is $TSLA vol smile of bid/asks across strikes:\n\n[$TSLA Vol Smile June and Sept '21](https://preview.redd.it/cf7m25tw8up61.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c998a0f23c877b4dc6147ff6bd86d0d64017722)\n\nNote that June skew is pretty steep in comparison to Sept. This has been driven up by a large seller of the June 1000 calls; a big player dumped 20k+ over the past two days, along with sellers of the 850 call causing June upside vols to basically implode. Market makers simply don't want to hold that much call skew in that area, so they begin to mark it fairly low as they accumulate more. As it stands now, these are the cheapest vols on the TSLA board.\n\nTL;DR SO FAR: June 850 call area is the cheapest vol across the TSLA surface.\n\n**How steep is June skew relative to Sept, and how different is that slope across tech names?**\n\nLet's take a look at the 1stdev down put vol, minus the 1stdev up call vol, across the term structure.\n\nAt the top (purple), we have QQQ. Because of implied correlation, the ETF's surface should have higher skew and lower ATM vol than the average of the components. The next highest June skew is TSLA (note that the skew is normalized by ATM vol. If it weren't, TSLA would seem to have a much, much higher put skew).\n\n[Tech Stocks IV Skews](https://preview.redd.it/aoqllozp9up61.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f4415ca8edcb6688ea0769c4bfb64577f01d85)\n\nIn red, I've marked the skews we should want to sell. In green are the months we should want to buy skew. Although I've only executed the trade in TSLA, I think it would be fair to hedge the trade with a similar but opposite spread in QQQ; selling the risk reversal calendar hedges out some of our skew term risk.\n\n[More TSLA Vols](https://preview.redd.it/reha4zwaaup61.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=128dcf8f7d27343d5da8924f21ea51d197fefe40)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The trade, visualized](https://preview.redd.it/buz3kzfmgup61.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff3f5bb69fc0a82bb84663dd31abe5ded01072c1)\n\nThe premise of the trade is this: **Due to recent June upside vol sellers, the June skew slope is too steep relative to the months around it in TSLA. We should sell the steep skew and buy the flatter skews, with the prediction that the June skew will revert & flatten out more, relative to other months.** Based on other tech stocks, the June/Sept skew slope is fairly flat. My fair value or target IVs for the June RR will be the Sept RR vols.\n\n**The Trade**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Option|Qty|Delta|Vega|Spline IV|Target IV|Edge ($)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|June 400 P|\\-5|\\-9|.53|79.2%|74%|$2.75|\n|June 850 C|\\+5|\\+16|.70|63.2%|66%|$3.36|\n|Sept 350 P|\\+5|\\-9|.68|73.8%|73.8%|\\---|\n|Sept 1050 C|\\-5|\\+16|.99|66.8%|66.8%|\\---|\n\nThe trade here is to buy the Sept Put in the June/Sept Risk-Reversal Calendar: buying the RR in Sept and selling the RR in June. I collected $2.88 in premium for putting this on, I'm long a tiny tiny bit of gamma and collect about .04/day. There's $6 of theoretical edge in this spread. I have no opinion on the direction of Sept skew, only that it's a fair hedge vs the June skew. If skew goes higher or lower across the board, I shouldn't have too much risk on here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exit Plan**\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, I'd like to take this off for $5 profit. Gamma position won't get too bad unless TSLA crashes to 500-450 area. In that case, I would be fine with buying in gamma as we downtick, by way of rolling the short to a lower strike. It's also possible that we downtick favorably, as this spread is locally long gamma and the June/Sept vol spread could tighten on a dip. Selling the QQQ June Sept RR Calendar would also provide an even tighter hedge on tech stocks crashing. If HFs dump more of the June skew calls, I would consider putting more calendars on, as long as the RR Calendar edge is becoming more favorable. If the vol spread doesn't tighten back by at least $3, I am also fine holding this over earnings, although I will look to recalc my earnings move exposure once we get closer to end of April.", "id": "mfbn0x", "created_utc": 1616970592.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Wish I was smart enough to learn stuff like this.

{"title": "QNX hypervisor will be in all future connected EVs (possibly including Tesla as self-driving and vehicle software becomes more regulated)", "selftext": "Running multiple OS-es in a single vehicle is going to be a major trend forward (one for instrument clusters, one for infotainment, one for autonomous driving etc.), so hypervisors will be the most foundational software component for connected vehicles. This is why industry experts don't see connected vehicles as \"smartphones on wheels\", they see them as \"data centers on wheels\".\n\nBlackberry's QNX hypervisor is currently the most widely-adopted virtualization platform (arguably the industry-standard) among vehicles that need to run multiple OS-es (instrument clusters: QNX,  infotainment: Automotive Grade Linux/Android Automotive/QNX/Windows Embedded Automotive/AliOS etc). \n\nThe other commercial alternatives in the RTOS hypervisor space (OpenSynergy's COQOS, SysGO's PikeOS, Wind River's VxWorks hypervisor, Green Hills' INTEGRITY) did not find much success in the automotive industry, showing that Blackberry's QNX hypervisor indeed has some stickiness among automakers. In fact, the only 2 hypervisors that currently support VirtIO are QNX hypervisor and COQOS. VirtIO is the upcoming standard that makes the deployment of Android Automotive on vehicles easier by hosting them as virtual machines. \n\nIn other words, if an automaker wants to use Android Automotive as their In-Vehicle Infotainment, the path of least resistance is to either use QNX hypervisors or COQOS because this way the automakers no longer have to implement the Hardware Abstraction Layer required for Android Automotive to work on bare-metal. Android Automotive will likely dominate the infotainment space due to its robust media apps development ecosystem and cross compatibility with the smartphone ecosystem. IVY will provide an interface for Android Automotive app developers to access vehicle sensor and localization data (possible monetization opportunity?). Any forward-looking automaker who wishes to compete with Tesla will definitely choose the Android Automotive + QNX hypervisor (+ Blackberry IVY possibly) stack. Recent examples include Volvo Polestar 2 and Ford. \n\nQNX also has the largest market share in the digital instrument clusters RTOS space currently. QNX uses a microkernel architecture so it is designed to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements which are essential for instrument clusters and vehicle control. Nobody wants to see their speedometer or brakes lagging behind or their digital dashboard crashing in the middle of the road because this poses safety risk. QNX is ISO 26262 ASIL-D certified, the highest possible safety rating for automotive RTOS. \n\nAGL is no match in this space due to its monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements. Some automakers may choose to use AGL/Linux for now (eg. Tesla), but this is really an unsafe practice and should hopefully be regulated soon. I remember hearing [horror](https://insideevs.com/news/342908/tesla-autopilot-software-crash-while-driving-what-you-need-to-know/) [stories](https://youtu.be/OnJ0jPGmrmM) about Tesla's dashboard crashing and blacking out when the car is still moving on Autopilot on the freeway. Hopefully, as ADAS/self-driving becomes more mainstream, traffic authorities will make ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety certification a legal requirement for all connected vehicles.\n\nOn the security side, Blackberry's integration of Cylance into QNX will also be a key differentiator. As vehicles become more connected to the internet, hacking is inevitable and security will be a major requirement for all automakers. To see how scary it can be, see this [Jeep hack](https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs) video.

Congrats not hard to not patch your servers.\n\nI feel like your statement is unfair towards the entire cybersecurity industry in general. It's a thankless job, you get all the blame when your customers get hacked while nobody thanks you for keeping them safe. There's a lot of technical work that goes into prevention and early detection. If none of Cylance's customers got hacked in the SolarWinds incident, I would consider that a success. Otherwise, how else would you evaluate the effectiveness of a cybersecurity product?\n\n>Also what car would need multiple different OS types?\n\nIf you have done the basic dd, you wouldn't have asked this question.

But based on my observation of their products and their career page (https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034), Tesla does not use hypervisor, their custom OS is based on GNU/Linux running directly on baremetal. This is probably why they can run Tesla Arcade in their infotainment system (it's very likely they plan to run the Linux ports of Witcher 3).\n\n\u201cBlackberry\u2019s QNX technology has built in concepts for hardware and software trust validation, hypervisor to maintain a separation between the safety critical and infotainment systems,\u00a0 and a core operating system which passes all the functional safety standards,\u201d said John Wall, Sr. VP\u00a0 SVP, Head of QNX at Blackberry.\n\n\"With modern over-the-air updates one can turn a fleet of cars into an army of adversarial robots.\u00a0 If you believe this cannot happen,\u00a0 \u00a0the story \u201cHackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway\u2014With Me in It,\u201d by Andy Greenberg may be eye-opening.\u00a0Over-the-air updates are the classic double-edged sword. The capability is incredibly useful to update and fix functionality for automobiles in the field. However, with a very small amount of work, one can also cause a great deal of havoc in the field. There are at least three levels of risk which must be managed in order to prevent bad consequences:\n\nSecure Platform: The hardware and software pieces which make up the critical pieces of the over-the-air infrastructure must have well understood and secure supply chains.\n\nSecure Run Time: The operating system which manages the automobile must have secure interfaces and be hardened for cybersecurity issues.\n\nSecure Physical Security:\u00a0The operating centers of fleets (ex: Tesla\u00a0TSLA\u2019s software update center) must be secure. One imagines a modern version of the popular AMC series \u201cThe Americans\u201d running counterintelligence operations on fleet control centers.\n\nThe concepts of secure platforms, run-time systems, and protecting critical assets are well known within the industry. As an example,\u00a0Blackberry, transformed from a cell phone provider to an enterprise software company,\u00a0 is a leading supplier of secure operating systems for automobiles.\"\n\n(https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulrazdan/2020/05/02/is-automotive-cybersecurity-a-national-defense-issue-/)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01744520291686058}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/linux-wants-future-automotive-software-open-source-automotive-grade-linux/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11302001774311066}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01744520291686058}], "tickers": ["tsla", "crash", "tsla"]}
