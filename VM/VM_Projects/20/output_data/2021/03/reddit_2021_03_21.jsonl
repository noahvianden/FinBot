{"title": "Cathie Wood: Inflation vs Deflationary forces", "selftext": "In a recent video, Cathie goes back in time to the end of 2016 - Early 2017.\n\nQuantitative easing was on its way out and the FED was going to start raising the interest rates. The market was very nervous...\n\nTrump won the election and the odds of a cyclical burst increased because of his promise to cut taxes and that's exactly what happened!\n\nIn the beginning the equity market was very nervous around the idea that interest rates would be going up. When Trump was elected - value stock took off just like they're getting off now - responding to this idea that economy is developing ahead of steam so the value stocks have taken off.\n\nIf you look at year to date: energy stocks are up 27%, financial stocks 11%, tech stock 1% and health stocks are actually down. So basically traditional value stocks are having a nice run! So right now we are in a 2016 like scenario, value stocks are up and growth strategy stocks are down (Take ARK ETFs as a perfect example)\n\nCathie thinks this is great because the bull market is broadening out to other sectors and this - can only be a good thing for \"disruptive innovation\" stocks investors.\n\nWhat would be negative instead? It would be a negative thing if the bull market continues to narrow\u00a0and only innovation strategy worked, because that's what happened with the .com tech bubble in 2000. (And we all know how bad the consequences have been).\n\nCathie actually likes the fear that ARK is experiencing and that there's a reality check, in terms of the speculative moves that have taken place within the innovation space.\n\nWhat happened post Q4 2016 after the market had broadened out? Well\u2026 2017 was a fantastic year for the equity market in general with cyclical value and growth.\u00a0 And she believes we're now moving towards a similar scenario.\n\nNow let's find out what Cathie's said on Bitcoin being speculative, not sustainable, not environment friendly and heavily used for illicit activities. With a lot of respect Cathie says that Janet Yellen doesn't understand the crypto space, simply because it's not her main focus.\n\nRegarding the environmental issue: comparing the energy required for BTC mining to the energy required to mine gold you can clearly see that the first is a fraction of the latter. It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC.\u00a0\n\nShe also reports what an FBI agent told her. According to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets. BTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.\n\nTalking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases. So it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech. Regarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction\u2026 it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin. And the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.\n\nCathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation. ARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other. Good vs bad deflation. Good deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.\n\n* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.\n* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly. And according to ARK forecasts\u2026 EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.\n\nConcluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:\n\n* Robotics\n* AI\n* Blockchain\n* DNA sequencing\n\nAnd these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect. Think about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.\n\nOn the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned. The disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change. Financial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around. Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.\n\nSo we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.\n\nNote: I\u2019m not a financial advisor", "id": "ma3ueh", "created_utc": 1616354326.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "damn that\u2019s so surprising! personally, i expected her to announce that inflation is going to be a huge issue, stocks in her portfolios are going to suffer and everyone should take their cash out as fast as they can...", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08437900245189667}, {"body": "Good one, there might be a chance somebody putting that much trust in Cathie might not get the /s tough.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24763450026512146}, {"body": "If you mean sell the ETF shares, that has no impact on the underlying and ultimately no realized impact on the ETF.

From what I gather, it\u2019s very well positioned, well  managed, profitable, and its vision of where the energy sector is going  corresponds very well to my own.\n\n**From insidermonkey.com:**\n\nIberdrola  has grown to be the number-one producer of wind power in the world. The  official website of Iberdrola also boasts its high installed renewable  capacity. With the value being over 31,000 MW, Iberdrola is regarded as  one of the cleanest in the energy sector. The company supplies energy to  over 100 million people across several countries, its subsidiaries  including Avangrid in the USA, and Scottish Power in the UK. Iberdrola  has also made a commitment to \u201creduce its emission intensity to 50  gCO2/kWh globally by 2030, thus achieving an 86 % reduction in three  decades, in addition to being carbon neutral globally by 2050.\n\nSo is it a buy? Here's my breakdown, let me know what you think.\n\n\n**Metrics (2019 and 2020):**\n\n- PE ratio: 19.88 (very reasonable compared to other companies in the renewable / clean tech business)\n- Share price went up 22% YoY as of March 21st 2021 (again very  reasonable all things considered) \u2013 please let me know if I\u2019m missing  something and we haven\u2019t seen Iberdrola go the way of say, Orsted\n- Assets: 122 billion EUR\n- Liabilities: 35 billion EUR of financial debt; maturity comes in at  between 3.5 and 5 billion EUR yearly up to 2025 which seems should be  easily manageable (I can\u2019t find the word \u201cliabilities\u201d anywhere in the  report \u2013 please let me know if I\u2019m missing something \u2013 as stated below,  Iberdrola owns 5 nuclear plants in Spain where the decommissioning bill  should be due in the period between 2027 and 2035)\n- Over 1 million EUR revenue per employee (more than e.g. Microsoft)\n- Operating profit margin of 16,6% (IMO very, very good for a large and  diversified company in the middle of a complex pivot to new  technologies, business models and regulatory frameworks)\n- Pay-out ratio has been around 70% of the net attributable profit in recent years, translating into \\~5% dividend yield\n\n\n**Leadership:**\n\n- Jos\u00e9 Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Gal\u00e1n \u2013 CEO since 2001, executive chairman since  2006; also holds roles with JPMorganChase, World Economic Forum and two  other organisations; visiting lecturer at two universitites; received a  ton of awards in his career and seems well respected\n- Francisco Mart\u00ednez C\u00f3rcoles \u2013 Business CEO since 2017; also member of  the Board of Directors of the Spanish  Electric Industry Associatio\n- Aitor Moso Raigoso \u2013 Director Liberalized Business since 2016\n- Armando Martinez Martinez \u2013 Director Network Business since 2018\n- Jos\u00e9 Sainz Armada \u2013 CFO since\n- Xabier Viteri Solaun \u2013 Director of the Renewable Energy Business since ?\n\nAll  in all, this seems a very experienced team with experience from the  power industry and others (banking, finance \u2026), with lots of trained  engineers who\u2019ve come to hold top management positions. Quite some  recent appointments. It\u2019s all rather old white men, so zero points for  diversity, not sure if that matters in this case.\n\n\n**Ownership structure:**\n\n- Qatar Investment Authority 8.69%\n- Blackrock 5.25%\n- Norges Bank 3.43%\n- Wikipedia also cites Norges Bank, Kutxabank and Bankia as large shareholders, but that info might be outdated\n\nSo all in all, very diversified ownership structure. Not sure that\u2019s good or bad.\n\n**Some important subsidiaries:**\n\n- Scottish Power (UK)\n- Avangrid (US)\n- Neoenergia (BR)\n\n\n**Market position and outlook:**\n\n- Strong presence in some markets with high renewables potential (and  sometimes a favourable market environment) - Spain, UK, US, Mexico,  Brazil\n- Likely the biggest  renewable power generator in the world (although I couldn\u2019t find a  source confirming this); the biggest wind power generator in the world;  strong presence in the power grids segment; also present in power sales  and energy services segments\n- One of the cleanest power generators with ca. 60% renewables in its portfolio\n- The rest of Iberdrola generation portfolio is mostly combined-cycle gas  power plants which is the only fossil-based generation technology that  makes sense in decarbonising power systems for the next 20 to 30 years;  only trace amounts of coal\n- Iberdrola also owns 5 nuclear plants in Spain with 3GW of total  generation capacity, which could come with a substantial decommissioning  bill when the power plants reach the end of life, but that should only  be between 2027 and 2035\n- Iberdrola intends to double its clean generation capacity by 2025 by  investing 75 billion EUR; considering some of its shareholders and  generally positive environment for clean energy, financing shouldn\u2019t be  an issue\n- Iberdrola has also made  decisive strides into offshore wind, including floating; investments  are planned on storage business which I also think has some potential;  the importance of digitisation is stressed; on the other hand, Iberdrola  is entering green hydrogen business cautiously which I think is smart  as I think a lot of hype right now is only that\n\n\n**Bull case:**\n\n- Iberdrola continues as the biggest renewable energy major, maintaining  leading position in onshore wind, expanding its solar and grids  portfolio, while not bleeding too much cash with gas power\n- It makes a splash in the offshore wind and successfully enters the  green hydrogen game, all of that while staying nimble and digitising\n- That leads to increasing the turnover while maintaining high revenue  and profit margins, maintaining the dividend yield while substantially  increasing the market cap\n\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n- If I had to find one, it would be that multiple of these possible  developments materialise concurrently: Iberdrola starts losing market  share in the onshore wind, never manages to become a major player in  offshore wind, gets wrong-footed by regulatory changes in the grids  segment, overreaches on hydrogen, and starts bleeding cash in the gas  power segment\n- Oh and it becomes  apparent in the next few years that the Spanish nuclear plants  decommissioning bill due in 10 years or so will be huge and no one\u2019s  thought of setting aside funds for this over the last 40 years (I should  check this, actually)\n- IMO, none  of these developments on its own is very likely, some are actually very  unlikely, but overall, we should expect at least one or two to  materialise\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nAll  things considered, Iberdrola seems like one of the best bets in the  clean energy sector that is very likely to grow. It\u2019s well positioned in  the key segments such as onshore wind, solar and grids, and has hydro  and gas power assets to provide backup power to it its variable  renewables portfolio. It also has a very good position in the nascent  offshore energy wind segment with huge potential, and if hydrogen  becomes a thing, there\u2019s no reason Iberdrola shouldn\u2019t be a player. Its  gas power plants might be a minor liability but also might be a net  positive. Iberdrola is well managed and should have no problem financing  its ambitious investment plan that aims to double its renewable energy  portfolio by 2025. It has 3x as much assets as liabilities, and debt  maturation in the coming years is in the range of EBIT which is very  comfortable. All this says BUY.\n\nEDIT: Grammar and lots of formatting", "id": "ma1vvk", "created_utc": 1616348795.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "I mean Iberdrola is up 40% in the last year.

On 2/25, they reported 2020 earnings, which were slightly down from 2019, going from a $2.438B adjusted EBITDA to $2.199B. However, it seems likely the pandemic hit the home security business pretty hard, as they likely saw a reduction in new installations and possibly cancellations from people who were stuck at home and had limited need for a security system. They have also announced partnerships with DISH Networks and Alphabet, the latter investing $450MM, to help close the gap between ADT and its more techy competitors.

{"title": "Cathie Wood: Inflation vs Deflationary forces", "selftext": "In a recent video, Cathie goes back in time to the end of 2016 - Early 2017.\n\nQuantitative easing was on its way out and the FED was going to start raising the interest rates. The market was very nervous...\n\nTrump won the election and the odds of a cyclical burst increased because of his promise to cut taxes and that's exactly what happened!\n\nIn the beginning the equity market was very nervous around the idea that interest rates would be going up. When Trump was elected - value stock took off just like they're getting off now - responding to this idea that economy is developing ahead of steam so the value stocks have taken off.\n\nIf you look at year to date: energy stocks are up 27%, financial stocks 11%, tech stock 1% and health stocks are actually down. So basically traditional value stocks are having a nice run! So right now we are in a 2016 like scenario, value stocks are up and growth strategy stocks are down (Take ARK ETFs as a perfect example)\n\nCathie thinks this is great because the bull market is broadening out to other sectors and this - can only be a good thing for \"disruptive innovation\" stocks investors.\n\nWhat would be negative instead? It would be a negative thing if the bull market continues to narrow\u00a0and only innovation strategy worked, because that's what happened with the .com tech bubble in 2000. (And we all know how bad the consequences have been).\n\nCathie actually likes the fear that ARK is experiencing and that there's a reality check, in terms of the speculative moves that have taken place within the innovation space.\n\nWhat happened post Q4 2016 after the market had broadened out? Well\u2026 2017 was a fantastic year for the equity market in general with cyclical value and growth.\u00a0 And she believes we're now moving towards a similar scenario.\n\nNow let's find out what Cathie's said on Bitcoin being speculative, not sustainable, not environment friendly and heavily used for illicit activities. With a lot of respect Cathie says that Janet Yellen doesn't understand the crypto space, simply because it's not her main focus.\n\nRegarding the environmental issue: comparing the energy required for BTC mining to the energy required to mine gold you can clearly see that the first is a fraction of the latter. It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC.\u00a0\n\nShe also reports what an FBI agent told her. According to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets. BTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.\n\nTalking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases. So it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech. Regarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction\u2026 it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin. And the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.\n\nCathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation. ARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other. Good vs bad deflation. Good deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.\n\n* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.\n* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly. And according to ARK forecasts\u2026 EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.\n\nConcluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:\n\n* Robotics\n* AI\n* Blockchain\n* DNA sequencing\n\nAnd these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect. Think about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.\n\nOn the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned. The disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change. Financial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around. Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.\n\nSo we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.\n\nNote: I\u2019m not a financial advisor", "id": "ma41nz", "created_utc": 1616354875.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I remember when the pandemic hit in March and everyone ridiculed Cathie for calling for a V shaped recovery.
