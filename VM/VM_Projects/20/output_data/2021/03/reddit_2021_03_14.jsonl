{"title": "Implied Volatility is Fun (no really) - RKT example of getting the direction right and the vol so very wrong...", "selftext": "Implied Volatility is fun.  Really.   I have mentioned [before](https://optionsalary.com/which-greek-are-you) that I think beginning option traders focus on delta, then find out about theta (after long calls expire worthless) and start selling options, and then more advanced traders learn about volatility and incorporate it and all the Greeks (Ok, not Rho) in their trades.\n\nOne fun thing about implied volatility is that you can be completely right on other Greeks yet still lose on a position because of changes in volatility.  Let's look at a recent couple of trades we took in Rocket Companies, Inc (Ticker: RKT) and see how the change in vol completely overwhelmed our position.\n\n## The Trade\n\nOn Monday March 1st, with RKT trading near 22.75, we\n\n* Sold the April 1st 19 PUT for 0.30.  IV was at 81%\n\nShort puts are long delta, short gamma, long theta, and short vega (again, ignoring Rho...)\n\n## Implied Volatility is Fun...\n\n... just look what happened the next day:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RKT 3\\/1-3\\/5\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/o6xzak1152n61.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1201990e4586549dc65208ad1fd2c00f272e577)\n\nRKT took off like a ... um ... well... Rocket.  My put sales (unfortunately with no call kickers) make me look like a genius!  I struggle to think about how to spend all the money. Except...\n\nThe position is down.  Quite a bit. \n\n### WHAT?!\n\nBut the stock went up, that's what we want it to do when we sell puts!  True, but look what else happened.  Implied volatility Really took off as well.  From 81% to 166% around 2:30 PM on Tuesday.  Remember we said we were Short Vega on this trade and that greatly overshadowed everything else.  \n\n### Implied Volatility is (still) fun\n\nThe stock moved in our direction and IV took off and we're losing on the position.    I still liked RKT below 20 and so I sold More puts:\n\n* Sold the Apr 1 18 puts for 0.43 at 166% IV.   Stock at \\~37.85\n\nThat's right, the stock went up 66% and I sold puts at a Lower strike for More money.  And that's what IV is awesome. \n\n### Later that week...\n\nRKT came back down to earth (last one, I promise!) later in the week and volatility also came in.  The result to our position, despite the stock going Down?  We were up money on both positions...\n\n## TL;DR - Know your Greeks and understand Vol\n\nMany treat options as leveraged substitutes for stock, focusing solely on Delta.

{"title": "How the United States government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon", "selftext": "# DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE OR 100% BASED ON FACT(S). THIS IS SIMPLY EDUCATIONAL AND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION.\n\n# TL;DR: Capital gains tax, easing and even erasing debt, financial stimulus to peoples all over the world, a happier and more compliant population, tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in 2008 brought to justice in the only way that matters, and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster.\n\nWe all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes, and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money.\n\nHowever, when looking at the bigger picture, there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run.\n\nLet's take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning;\n\n# 1.) Capital Gains Tax\n\nWhen people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur, governments will attain taxes off these investments. Considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money, that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy.\n\nThis is especially considering how 40% of America's money has been printed in the last year due to COVID-19. Instead of raising taxes on the American people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run, the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary.\n\nAlso, with more money gained from stocks, many will likely re-invest some (or even most) of their money back into the stock market; leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped.\n\n# 2.) People being more willing and able to spend, further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population\n\nIt's no surprise that when times are tougher economically, people tend to spend less and save more. Yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable, this makes economic times rougher, which in turn...\n\nLeads to a potentially endless economic recession/depression.\n\nWe've seen this in Japan in the late 1990's and early 2000's, and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in 1980. They've gone backwards in terms of their financial progression.\n\nWith the general population in possession of large sums of money, however, this allows the economy to be stimulated; which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes, but also creates a happier population overall.\n\nImagine it; after a year of prolonged quarantine, job loss, future inflation and economic instability, all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes...\n\nSuddenly get served justice...\n\nThen their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them, fought the fight to the end, and helped make the world a better place.\n\nThis is practically the script to Endgame; heck, most action/heroic movies. And the American people get to be a part of it.\n\nSpeaking of \"bad guys\";\n\n# 3.) The gains also won't be in the hands of large tax dodgers\n\nWe all know that tax dodging is practiced by many, especially those in large positions of power and wealth. \n\nSo is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big Wall Street players are dodging taxes?\n\nFor the U.S. government, this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt, fortifying infrastructure, improving medical and educational institutions, and many more benefits for Americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individual's bank accounts filled with zero's. \n\nWith the money in the hands of the average citizen, however, the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud (if at all) on a massive level. \n\nOf course, they won't go out quietly when the squeezes happen, yet that can still be a good thing because;\n\n# 4.) The stock market needs a correction\n\nMany have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the American economy, and that a correction is inevitable.\n\nWhen the squeezes happen for meme stocks, however, after the new DTCC rule comes into effect, that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions.\n\nThey'll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes; causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market.\n\nYet once the dust settles, people can finally reassess the market(s) and determine where everything should be.\n\nStocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again, while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down.\n\nThen, the economy can become stabilized again, and everything can continue as it should.\n\n# Whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me, and only based on the information I currently know. \n\n# There's far more that could and could not happen based on if/when meme stocks skyrocket and force many shorters and market makers to buy stocks at higher prices.\n\n# But most importantly, I wanted to start a potential discussion on the aftermath of meme stocks going to the moon, and allow others to also and and correct my statements as well as share this info with the overall community.\n\n# So what do you think?", "id": "m4j5s5", "created_utc": 1615680554.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "You only have to pay capital gains tax if you sell", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "If you lose it all within a tax year, you don\u2019t have to.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "$3000 capital loss max.\n\nLosses to eternity.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4267879128456116}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5584044456481934}, {"body": "What\u2019s an exit strategy?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I think it\u2019s when your stuck in rush hour traffic and gotta poo really bad", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16697409749031067}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11797113716602325}, {"body": "What if I sell, and then just put it in the S&P before withdrawing from my broker?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You still sold.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2461182177066803}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.333096444606781}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2255810797214508}, {"body": "> NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE \n\nBut is it medical advice?", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s *friendly* advice", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3658273220062256}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04372372105717659}, {"body": "I feel like we\u2019re living in a goddamn simulation.

{"title": "The Return of Reliable Mediocrity - Uncertainty You Can Trust", "selftext": "Dear Member,\u00a0  \nHello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on March 19th?\u00a0\n\nFirst things first, I'm going to keep using the sorta-kinda-gold-but-on-a-computer and banned tickers as recommendations because they make money. If you don't like it, find a different newsletter and I'll keep napping on my piles of virtual cash sitting in my\u00a0SPAC\u00a0bed. This is my return from ban by WSB for it and most of those degenerates are better at making memes than they are at investing so I guess I kind of had it coming. Sooooo here we go again!\u00a0\n\nWe're going to pick up right where we left off with some serious consideration of the wants/needs of people who are leaving the pandemic lockdown with hopes and aspirations of having a good time again. We got Carnival Cruise lines for a smash hit a few weeks back and we're going to find more (full disclosure: I'm definitely going to play them again). Our other acknowledgement is that virtual cash is tearing right now. That isn't going to stop. Grab a ticket for the tendie train and ride it until the wheels fall off. If you're not in already, just get what you can. Imagine you're buying and holding a super special magic version of SPY shares.\u00a0  \nCRWD - 3/19 $220c  \nMy weekly pick is going to be CRWD. They've had a terrible week/month and are sitting $53 under their 52-week high. They've been wildly successful at beating earnings and continuing to improve their per/share outcomes. Here is the deal, everybody loves a good ramp up to earnings report, but the earning report itself could screw everything up. My take is this: the stimmy is getting delivered and they're going to beat earnings while trading at \\~80% of ATH. Will it return to ATH? Doubtful. It will more than likely take a serious upturn and hopefully push for $220. I'm going to grab the $220c for 3/19 and hopefully dump within a day. Maybe before the earnings even deliver...\u00a0  \nCCL - 7/16 $40c  \nI have to do it. The goal is open season for ALL adults in the US by May 1st. Give that 4 weeks and we're looking summer travel dead in the eyes. We all know your redneck cousins in Nebraska are excited to get back on a boat for fake vacations to the carribean. They've got Facebook posts to catch up on. I'm looking at the July 16th $40c for movement back to $10 under their pre-pandemic numbers ($30 under ATH). As always, do NOT hold these when you hit your profit goal %. Dump that\u00a0  \nNVDA - 5/21 $610c  \nHere is the wild card for you. Nvidia is trading at $100 under ATH and their progress as a companies shows absolutely no signs of slowing down at all. Given the landscape, they've had a terrible month, but the company is not only solid, but they're increasing demand with the need for GPUs related to mining. The 5/21 date is paired along with the earnings report that will happen then. We all know they're going to produce an insane amount of profit and when that hits, we're going to cash in big time.\u00a0  \nSNDL - 3/19 $1.5p  \nIf you're a real degenerate gambler looking to get yourself high blood pressure, play this one with me. Sundial Growers delivers earnings after close on Wednesday. We all know the future legalization of marijuana is going to make them a huge company, but right now they're trash and we all know it. They're the penny stock of weed companies. They've had a GREAT week leading up to earnings. I'm going to wait until the end of the day Tuesday or Wednesday to watch it go up more. When it hits $1.50+, I'm going to grab some puts. Here is the delicate part: it doesn't move much at all in comparison to those option prices. So what we're going to do is grab $1.50 puts for 3/19 that are already almost ITM. Then hold those babies when they flop on earnings. Full disclosure: this is an absolutely STUPID play, but it's going to be hilarious if it works.\u00a0  \nGood luck this week! May the power of J-Pow be with you in Tendie Land.\u00a0  \nSincerely,\u00a0  \nLehman Brothers' Risk Management Department\u00a0", "id": "m51y2d", "created_utc": 1615749578.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "**I am a bot and identified and tracked the following options picks within this post:**\n\n|**Ticker**|**Strike**|**Type**|**Exp**|**Recorded Premium**|**Recorded Stock Price**|**OI**|**Volume**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CRWD**|**$220**|**BUY CALL**|**2021-03-19**|**$3.05**|**$199**|**3062**|**491**\n|**CCL**|**$40**|**BUY CALL**|**2021-07-16**|**$1.84**|**$28.46**|**9971**|**89**\n|**NVDA**|**$610**|**BUY CALL**|**2021-05-21**|**$10.05**|**$514.24**|**116**|**17**\n|**SNDL**|**$1.5**|**BUY PUT**|**2021-03-19**|**$0.27**|**$1.42**|**32977**|**3996**\n|**SNDL**|**$1.5**|**BUY PUT**|**2021-03-19**|**$0.27**|**$1.42**|**32977**|**3996**\n\n[Realtime ROI](https://www.pickmojo.com/pick/ckm9jlgne8auo0746s2l6k79j) | [Track Record](https://www.pickmojo.com/user/EchoWxlf/) | [Bot Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/pickmojo/comments/he9ghu/options_picks_tracking_bot_information/) | Leaderboard: [Week](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-week-reddit), [Month](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-month-reddit), [All](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/top-reddit) | [Exit this position](https://www.pickmojo.com/reddit_redirect)\n\n**^(*Recorded after market close, will be recorded at the next market open if the premium is within 10% margin.
