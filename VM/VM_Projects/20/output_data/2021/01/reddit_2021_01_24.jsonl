{"title": "Understanding Blackberry: Part 2 (No knowledge of soccer required)", "selftext": "  \n\nIn 2016 Mckinsey issued a report called Monetizing Car Data. The report estimates the potential revenues when the cars are connected online. They said that the overall revenue pool from car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 - 750 billion by 2030.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the possible revenue streams as per the report: \n\nIn-Car Sources of income (QNX Income):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. OEMs selling the service to customers and advertisers paying for the data are among the business models that might contribute to the value of the data-enabled social driving experience, which is expected to have an estimated value of USD 7 - 8 billion by 2030.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. High-tech giants are positioned to provide the fundamental car data analytics services that car OEMs and advertisers are willing to buy. In addition to being the IT backbone, they can offer front-end applications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Start-ups are the smaller counterparts of the high-tech      giants, entering the car data monetization space from a variety of angles,      such as developing new apps, engineering innovative hardware/interfaces      (e.g., retro-fittable gesture-activated controls)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Retailers and service centers are using car data      analytics to optimize their sales network and get the messages about their      offerings directly to drivers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Automotive OEMs. In addition to selling connectivity-related options and services (e.g., infotainment,      navigation), OEMs are already becoming active in-car data analytics to better understand how customers use their cars, shape their repair and maintenance choices, and improve the link between dealers and customers      (e.g., allowing for real-time, remote booking of vehicle check-ups).\n2. Insurers are able to capitalize on car data by offering      usage-based insurance contracts, exploring occasion-related policies\n\nBig data and Cloud Sources of Income (IVY Income):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Service providers offer data management services \n2. Regulators/government institutions are setting the standards regarding the collection and sharing of car data.\n3. Automotive suppliers are developing the software and      hardware that are forming the infrastructure capable of capturing,      analyzing, and selling car data\n4. Roadside assistance providers can collect and process      distress calls in real-time from vehicle sensors and automated alerts\n5. Infrastructure operators, including      billing/toll road operators and recharging/refueling players, are      analyzing car data to optimize the geographic deployment of their      respective services\n\nCustomer willingness to pay for features \u2013 as opposed to a preference for free, ad-supported features \u2013 varies across use cases and geographies. To make it easier for us to have an early estimate of QNX potential revenues, we need to know their market share geographically too.\n\nGermany (As per 2020 Sales):\n\nQNX Clients: VW + Mercedes + BMW + Audi + Ford + Toyota + Kia= more than 62% of the Auto Market \n\nChina (As per 2019 Car sales):\n\nQNX Clients: VW+ Honda + Hyundai + Mercedes + BMW +Kia= 42.7% \n\nUSA: \n\nQNX Clients: More than 70% \n\n\\*\\*New EV Clients of QNX are not included and not projected in any figures \n\n\\*\\*GM and Porsche signed deals with Android Auto and Apple to be the operating systems of the car despite these cars running with QNX system. We can exclude them as QNX clients for now. \n\n**Back to customer willingness to pay per product/service:**\n\n**1.Predictive maintenance services:**\n\nGermany: 73% \n\nUSA: 73%\n\nChina: 78%\n\nQNX Market share: 45% of Germany Revenues +\n\n53% of US revenues+32% of China revenues \n\n**2. Time-related use cases, such as networked parking:**\n\nGermany: 71%\n\nUSA: 72%\n\nChina: 76%\n\nPaying customers for networked parking in a QNX powered car: 43% of Germany + 51% of USA + 31.9% of China \n\nThe majority prefer a One-time price at time of vehicle purchase of USD 300\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Predictive maintenance, and vehicle usage monitoring and scoring:**\n\nGermany: 72%\n\nUSA:71%\n\nChina: 78%\n\nPaying customers for predictive maintenance, monitoring, and scoring in a QNX powered car: 43% of Germany + 51% of USA + 32% of China\n\nWillingness to pay for connected navigation:\n\nGermany: 45%\n\nUSA: 28%\n\nChina:35%\n\nPaying customers for connected navigation in QNX power car: 28% of Germany + 20% of USA + 14.7% of China \n\nThe majority prefer One-time payment to activate the service of USD 20\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FOR IVY solutions and products:**\n\nWillingness to share data:\n\nGermany: 92%\n\nUS: 93%\n\nChina:98%\n\nAs the report said, car data monetization at a global scale might add up to USD 450 by 2030. If we take a look at Goldman Sachs report about expected car sales by 2025 \n\nEmerging Markets: 78 Million cars\n\nDeveloped Countries: 34 Million cars\n\nIf we assume that by 2025 every car powered by QNX would have the new QNX system ( They said the first one will launch in 2023) and if we apply the QNX market share above. \n\n**QNX would power:**\n\n32 Million cars in emerging markets  \n\n22 Million cars in developed markets\n\nIf QNX offered a bundle of $15/month (and $10 in emerging markets) tailored package for parking assistance and maintenance and other services in developed countries. and If we apply the willingness to pay numbers from the Mckinsey report\n\n**QNX Potential Revenue from basic features package:**\n\nDeveloped Countries: 22M \\* 71% \\* 15 \\* 12 = $ 2.8Bn\n\nEmerging Countries: 32M \\* 78% \\* 10\\* 12= $ 2.9Bn \n\nIf you add up an estimate for the rest of the products it might provide and potential contracts it can have for IVY with several governments, It would be easy for Balckberry to reach 8-10 Bn in Sales by 2025.", "id": "l493p2", "created_utc": 1611526662.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "I posted this earlier. \n\nIf you look at the chart we have a few things happening.

This model allows for a lot of optionality and diverse revenue mix.\n\n**Note:** I do not think this is the only option available to GameStop, nor the right one, just throwing it out there as it shows how much potential there is to re-think this business, on a fundamental perspective there is a lot of upside if they can execute on something compelling.\n\n## Summary\n\nA digital platform that offers both a subscription service for all-you-can-eat cross platform titles plus a digital games store where you can purchase cross-platform titles that are able to be traded-in for a credit.\n\n## What revenue would it create?\n\nAt the moment, GameStop has over 50 million PowerUp Reward members. This program is largely limited to USA, whereby this digital platform can be global. As a benchmark, Xbox Live Gold is over 90 million subscribers, World of Warcraft has somewhere around 10-20 million subscribers (@ $15/month) - that's just 1 game. GTA 5 has sold over 120 million copies and Take Two makes $350m in micro-transactions in a quarter.\n\nIf this service cost $169 per year, cheaper than Microsoft's GamePass Ultimate, this is roughly the recurring revenue it would bring in. Maybe they could charge a lot more than this. $19.99 per month or $239 pa. $24.99 per month or $299 pa.\n\nThis service may just sit alongside GamePass, or Microsoft may choose to just integrate into GameStop's service so they are getting their Microsoft owned studio titles on more systems. See this article: [Microsoft wants Xbox Game Pass on PS4.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-on-ps4/)\n\n|Subscribers|50 Million|100 Million|150 Million|250 Million|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**$169 pa**|$8.5 Billion recurring|$17 Billion recurring|$25 Billion recurring|$42 Billion recurring|\n|**$239 pa**|$12 Billion recurring|$24 Billion recurring|$36 Billion recurring|$60 Billion recurring|\n|**$299 pa**|$15 Billion recurring|$30 Billion recurring|$45 Billion recurring|$75 Billion recurring|\n\nIt's possible too that this model does not simply provide a catalogue of games, like Game Pass does, but could work more like a library system where you can check-out something like a few games at a time. Any games. And turn them back in. Given the potential for license revoking, the opportunity of how the model could work on a subscription basis is only limited by your imagination. This kind of new approach would be different to what we've seen to date out there.\n\n## Digging deeper: More like Spotify for Games\n\nIn some ways this model could operate similar to music and movie streaming services (e.g. Spotify & Netflix) where you have the ability to choose from the entire catalogue, and the publishers are paid based on what is being consumed/streamed/used/played. Play hours could be monitored and factored in.\n\nBenchmark: Netflix has around 200 million subscribers, Spotify around 150 million, Disney+ around 85 million.\n\n## Classic Buy/Trade-In model\n\nOn top of this, purchased games would be sold in full, generating more classic sales revenue. These digital purchases could work in a number of ways:\n\n1. Games sold generate commission/profit per sale (just like selling a retail disc now) and could be integrated into existing digital stores across Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo eShop.\n2. Games purchased through the console stores or other stores could be \"traded-in\" with GameStop for a small credit. It would be some minor work to integrate ability for the existing platforms to disable/transfer the digital license.\n\nTraded-in games would encourage more purchasing than what happens currently where they rot in your catalogue never to be played again, so publishers are incentivized to be involved and contribute to this.\n\nDLC and other digital purchases in-game could generate a similar commission for GameStop, in the same way that the current Microsoft revenue share model has. See below.\n\n## Couldn't _________ do this instead?\n\nMaybe. But, GameStop has advantages over every other player who might want to become the \"Netflix\" of gaming, if you will. They are neutral compared to other companies in the gaming sector, and neutral to the other major tech companies such as Google/Amazon/Facebook when you put them up against Microsoft in particular.\n\n||Microsoft|Sony|Nintendo|Steam|GameStop|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**PC**|X|||X|X|\n|**Xbox**|X||||X|\n|**PlayStation**||X|||X|\n|**Nintendo**|||X||X|\n\n## GameStop is well connected across the gaming world to act as the global carrier for digital gaming\n\n1. Steam might be able to pivot into this area, but GameStop has something Steam doesn't have: the console market. Primarily this means capturing Nintendo & Sony into this future.\n2. GameStop has Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 (former President at Nintendo of America). This is a huge card in terms of getting Nintendo of Japan to agree to some kind of involvement.\n3. Game streaming is something that can be built in now or down the track. Again, being platform neutral is a big bonus here, as the offer they provide would not be limited to other ecosystems such as what would be through XCloud or Stadia. Microsoft may even want to develop a deeper partnership to provide the technology/infrastructure (e.g. license/transfer XCloud - like an AWS style relationship) and allow GameStop to operate it as a neutral party. At the end of the day, Microsoft may get slightly smaller cut of a much larger pie through a model like this - and not be accused of anti-trust/monopolization.\n\n## Understanding the Microsoft Digital Revenue Share\n\n>Domo President Justin Dopierala told Ars that GameStop Investor Relations representative Eric Cerny sent an email with the statement: \u201cWe are allowed to state we will receive a portion of the downstream revenue from any device we will bring into the Xbox ecosystem.\u201d  \n>  \n>Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed what Dopierala said, adding that **GameStop will get a percentage of the revenue from every full game and DLC download, every microtransaction and every subscription made through an Xbox Series X or Series S it has sold through its stores.** And since the original line in the PR mentions \u201clifetime revenue value,\u201d it means the retailer will be receiving money from Microsoft throughout each console\u2019s lifetime.\n\n1. Microsoft want to do these things, but know they would never get Sony onboard. They probably wouldn't even get Nintendo onboard.\n2. Sony has been known to bow to pressures in the gaming industry, so would come on board with something like this if Microsoft and Nintendo are hooked in. [Sony caves to the fans: Fortnite cross-platform play coming to the PS4](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/cross-platform-play-fortnite-ps4/)\n\n## Plus all the other options available for revenue\n\n1. Physical media will likely still exist for a long time. Case in point: We're still buying up Vinyls. Hell, there's probably still a case for retaining some stores over the next 2 decades in some capacity.\n2. There's a waft of physical items that GameStop can continue to sell: Collectibles, hardware, pc parts, consoles (both outright and subscription based hardware), apparel, peripherals, toys, books, etc.\n3. eSports: Tournament platforms, leagues, streaming.\n4. Private label brands: GameStop can expand into its own house brand of gaming accessories.\n5. Game studio development: They can start to make their own games, ala. what Netflix Original Content is all about. There's billions of dollars of potential here.\n6. Leverage the data: 50 million members and growing. What else can it do with it?\n\n## TLDR\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "l4az1a", "created_utc": 1611532389.0, "score": 223, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Great idea, pitch it to Cohen.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.028645126149058342}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10242326557636261}, {"body": "This is some advanced autism. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 31, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05602516606450081}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry, was a cumulative figure that I found not all active subscribers.
