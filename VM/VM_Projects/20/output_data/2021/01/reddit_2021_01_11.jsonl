These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck & Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds.

I haven't heard of that company but it sounds interesting and like a good solar energy play going forward. We know Biden will be good for clean energy and he's promised $2T in further stimulus spending for EVs and clean energy.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Even though I have big faith in the clean tech sector I am a bit hesitant towards companies that produces tracking systems for solar panels. Granted I do not live in the United States so the applicability of my analysis isn't necessarily great but I current work as a project manager in real estate energy solutions and I have dealt with solar panels installations a bit in my work life. Over here (Sweden) there is virtually zero demand for tracking systems in comparison to stationary panels. The reason for this is because it doesn't seem to pay itself off in short enough of a time frame. This is for 3 reasons:\n\n1. Since the purchasing cost of tracking system isn't zero the total sum invested will of course be higher. The tracking system therefore has to generate enough electricity for this extra sum of money to have a good pay off time. The tracking system makes the solar panels generate a noticeable amount more electricity though.\n2. Solar panels with tracking systems have, unlike ordinary installations, moving parts. The more moving parts you have the more maintenance will be necessary for the solar panel installation to work as intended. The extra maintenance will be a economic burden for the owner of the solar panels, this is another extra cost that will have to be considered when calculating the pay off time for the investment.\n3. The installation process will take longer and if more hours are worked by the guys putting it together will also mean a higher cost for the investment which, again, needs to pay itself off.\n\nWith that said I don't really know anything about the details of $ARRYs products, maybe they require less maintenance then what is available where I live and doesn't cost as much. Other thing that (hugely) affects the analysis is what the price of electricity is at the location of the solar panel installation. The higher the price the better since every kWh of electricity generated by the panels is a kWh you don't have to purchase from some power company.\n\nOther areas to consider within the solar energy branch  are producers of a piece of machinery calle \"inverters\". This is a piece that turns the DC-current generated by the panels into AC-current. These are pretty expensive and also needs to be replaced by a new one 2-4 times during the solar panels life time. One company that makes these inverters are $SEDG and are globally recognized as a good producer of them. Another company is $ENPH that focuses on micro-inverters for smaller solar panel installations, most likely for houses, cottages etc. Also, as the patriot I am, I have to mention the small Swedish company $FERRO that also dabbles in the production of inverters, energy storing, EV-charging etc. They are yet to turn a profit but has had a tremendous revenue increase in percentage since 2016.\n\nAnyway, I do see the positive sides of tracking systems and I can only speak for the first hand experience that I've had through my job so take it with a grain of salt since the scenarios can definitely be different in different countries, I just wanted to throw my 2 cents into the mix.\n\nGood luck with  your investments and since I am interested in the clean tech sector I will look further into $ARRY to look at the numbers and if they seem great I'll probably buy the stock even though there might be some downsides to the product itself.

In the the most compulsory sector of the world: farming. Deere tractors are synonymous with quality in the US. Last September Ford\u2019s Farley said he wants Ford to \u201cRun like a Deere\u201d. Farmers rely on their equipment for their livelihood, and the rest of us rely on them to farm shit and send it to us.\n\nIf you look at the chart for DE you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s always green. John Deere tractors are green. Coincidence? Doubt it.\n\nReuters Stock Reports Plus gives DE a 9/10 which on par with Apple and other good shit. One of ARK\u2019s portfolios has been buying it recently (ARKQ?) and I\u2019ve personally just doubled down and bought more. P/E is a relatively modest 33.8 and cash flow per share at 15.54, and a Reuters risk score of 10. Literally can\u2019t go tits up. \n\nEarnings was beaten every quarter last year and Morgan Stanley have them at Overweight with a price target of 341 doll hairs. It\u2019s actually a profitable company producing slabs of cash so it\u2019s not in the radar for these 800 year old analysts to attack instead of retiring. SPEAKING OF it\u2019s could be seen as a bit of a boomer stock since it\u2019s been around forever and gives a little dividend (3.04$ PA) which doesn\u2019t hurt either. The IV is lower than Trump\u2019s IQ so it\u2019s pretty unlikely that\u2019s it\u2019s going to be subject to major swings, the thing barely even moves premarket.\n\nWith the move to autonomous vehicles we can expect that at some point the agriculture industry is going to follow suit, with numerous extensions available for their equipment, the Deere\u2019s are pretty close to driving themselves and last year a fully autonomous tractor concept was unveiled.
