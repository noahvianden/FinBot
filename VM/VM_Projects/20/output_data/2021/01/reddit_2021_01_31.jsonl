Not just a trade. Mark Cuban heavily shorted. Blackrock & Pfizer highly interested. Make them pay fair price.\n\n**Opko** is a diversified pharmaceutical company. OPKO owns Bio-Reference Labs performing COVID-19 tests making OPKO profitable starting in Q2 of 2020. High demand has expanded Opko's bottom line significantly, with more testing money in Biden\u2019s 1.9 Trillion stimulus package. Bio-reference labs performs testing for the NFL, NBA, NHL, Winter X Games, U.S. Soccer's Women's and Men's National Teams and the NBA G League.\n\nThe company also has a commercialized kidney medication, Rayaldee, which is eligible for over $899 million in [milestone payments](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-a-biotech-milestone-payment.aspx), as well as 10%-plus royalties from its distribution partners. \n\nIts growth hormone replacement therapy, Somatrogon, demonstrated superiority against other drugs in its phase 3 clinical trials. The company is on track to submit a Biologic License Application for Somatrogon to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval by the end of the year. The estimated market opportunity for Somatrogon is upwards of $3 billion annually. In 2014, Opko gave **Pfizer** ([NYSE:PFE](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/pfizer-inc/pfe/)) an exclusive license to market growth hormone somatrogon globally. Pfizer paid Opko $295 million up front with the opportunity for Opko to receive up to $275 million in contingent milestone payments. Opko stands to receive tiered royalties on somatrogon's potential sales from the high teens to mid-20s. Those royalties seem more likely than ever now. Pfizer plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval for somatrogon by the end of this year. The big drugmaker expects to submit for approval of the drug in Europe and Japan in the first half of 2021. \n\nStreet rumor see public info - BlackRock may want to purchase #OPKO income streams. #OPKO is also a potential takeover target of Pfizer due to the revenue sharing agreements already in place.  Plus a great pipeline of future opportunities. \n\nBased on internals Opko stock would look surprisingly cheap even if it not for the coronavirus market opportunity. Hedge funds and institutional investors are increasing their positions on the cheap, using shorts to artificially deflate the price. \n\nNOTE \u2013 I am just a retail trader like you. This is my own opinion on $OPK using public information available to all. **Do your own research before investing.** This short squeeze opportunity actually makes money and has a pipeline of new innovative products. \n\nTogether we change the world, and equalize wealth inequalities brought on by the stock market for decades. Stop socialism for the rich. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.opkobiologics.com/pipeline/product-candidates/hgh-ctp/](https://www.opkobiologics.com/pipeline/product-candidates/hgh-ctp/)\n\n[https://www.bioreference.com/](https://www.bioreference.com/)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-team-130000046.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-team-130000046.html)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the info!

Sustainability likely has been and remains part of Tesla's brand and aspirational practice in operations / development. (E.g.,  Nevada Gigafactory omitting all fossil fuel on site and going with renewable electricity only despite it probably being cheaper for gas heating.)\n\nIMHO, off the top of my head, Tesla is not about maximizing short term profits but instead biasing toward long term value via combination of profits/capabilities (capabilities being more products/industries/market-share & network effects) with eye toward long term sustainability and environmental conscientiousness [and related practical/political/PR(moral?) factors].\n\nAkin to Tim Cook suggesting shareholders that can't tolerate environmental focus (despite negative impact to bottom line) to take their investments elsewhere, there's a degree of that at Tesla.  I can't find the quote, but IIRC Elon may have said something similar in a shareholder meeting, interview, or quarterly conference call.\n\nTim Cook said to a [pro short term company profits/efficiency-over-environment] shareholder [telling them environmental/ethical/moral requirements trump pure profit maximization] : e.g.:\n\n> \u201cWhen we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don\u2019t consider the bloody ROI,\u201d Cook said, adding that the same sentiment applied to environmental and health and safety issues.\n\n> He told Danhof that if he did not believe in climate change, he should sell his Apple shares. \u201cIf you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock,\u201d he said.\n\n> ( [source] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/03/tim-cook-climate-change-sceptics-ditch-apple-shares )\n\nSee related: \n> Third, corporate directors are not required to maximize shareholder value. As the U.S. Supreme Court recently stated, \"modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so.\" ( BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC. ) In nearly all legal jurisdictions, disinterested and informed directors have the discretion to act in what they believe to be the interest of the business corporate entity, even if this differs from maximizing profits for present shareholders. Usually maximizing shareholder value is not a legal obligation, but the product of the pressure that activist shareholders, stock-based compensation schemes and financial markets impose on corporate directors.\n( [source] https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/academics/clarke_business_law_institute/corporations-and-society/Common-Misunderstandings-About-Corporations.cfm ) \n\nElon Musk more than a decade ago swore he'd never give a dividend, and would instead focus \nmoney on the company.

{"title": "A Word of Overall Market Sanity", "selftext": "*Obligatory this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions.*\n\nYou may have looked at the GME squeeze and the overall market sell off and thought: wow the shorts are being forced to sell their longs to pay for their mistakes, and it\u2019s taking down the market. *That\u2019s not what happened.* Do the math, GME even at these levels has a market cap of only 22B, while the S&P 500 has a market cap of roughly 33.5T and the Nasdaq Composite has an approximate market cap of 17.2T\n\nNow why are you hearing on CNBC that the squeeze is causing the sell off in the market?

Here are my issues:\n\n1. The \"we are screwing rich people cry\": cool you made some medium sized hedge funds lose money but last time I check Blackrock, Fidelity were the biggest owners of GME.\n\n2. Short selling should be banned: there is a clear misunderstanding of naked short selling, which is illegal, and short selling. If you ban short selling then market makers can't exist bc they would not be able to take the other side of a long position. The reason why people can buy/sell stock around the mid price its because the bid/ask spreads tend to be tight and when they are not the MM can step in to provide liquidity into that market. If they can't be short stock then they would not be able to be delta neutral leading to huge bid/ask spreads. You would expect people in the finance committee to know this. Also, I keep seeing that if you are short something its because you want the company to go bankrupt. You can be short a company bc you believe it's overvalued which doesn't imply you thing they'll go bankrupt.\n\n3. Speculating about RH, other broker/ clearing house limitations: While I kind of understand the need for speculation due to Citadel involvement with RH, the true of the matter is that RH was hitting their capital req limits for their clearing side. and that is why they tapped their credit facilities and raised more capital. Why does RH had to put more stringent limitations, including other stocks? Well their risk tools seem to be terrible, this is my hypothesis, and is making them fly blind which is forcing them to limit even unrelated stocks but that are popular and likely held by a lot of their customers. To compound the problem, a good portion oof their customers don't understand margin and are over leveraged and, possibly, with a basket of super volatile meme stocks. Thus, any downward movement its creating losses that RH can't collect and they can't provide their money to their clearing arm to pass to the other counter parties, and this is the key part. We don't know the size of these losses and counter parties transactions but if those are large then we can get a ripple effect through the system. All of this is RH fault and they should be punish for that but what was the alternative to then putting those restrictions? I guess a legit self clearing broker would have just raised their margin requirements and achieved the same objective. They also need to revamp their risk assessment of accounts bc there is a difference between allowing everyone to easily invest versus providing everyone with margin.\n\n4 Propping GME price is helping their employees/short selling is bankrupting companies: the price of the stock could be 1M and that has no effect on GME's employees pay, hiring, etc. While GME could raise cash through offerings it is hard to see who would buy at these prices (institutions would not be able to justify it to their boards as no due diligence can justify the current prices) though a direct offering could be an alternative. Also, shorting a stock can put some downward pressure on a stock price but that doesn't make the company go bankrupt, the relationship is flip. We see low share prices of companies with high prob of bankruptcy because shareholders are the last in the line to get anything after liquidation. You can have great companies with crappy stock (e.g., Pfizer, AZN) as well as terrible companies with amazing stock prices (e.g., GME, NKLA)\n\n4. I've been calling for a market correction (lost a bunch in put lasts year so switch to theta gang) for a while because prices are completely disconnect from reality so in that I am in agreement with her, however, one must be consistent. If the argument is to reconnect prices with economic reality, then you can't incentivize for more retail to get into a stock that is priced beyond any sort of reality (their current valuation is more than BA, multiple airlines, auto makers, etc). While the stock price can still go up, those gains are only in paper until someone cashes out. Who you think its going to end up losing more money? The new investor piling in that have no idea what they are doing. I mean, there are people rec to get around RH restriction by buying a call, the cheapest one possible, and then exercising it. While I thought it was a joke comment, people are actually doing it. \n\n5.
