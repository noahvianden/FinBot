I need to increase my risk tolerance and invest in a few smaller cap stocks with more room to grow that I know really well, rather than a diversified bunch of large blue chip growth stocks. \n\n\nWhat am I looking for? the next Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Amazon, etc. A company and management team that I will get to know better than the back of my hand - and will develop a new circle of competence around(I will post my extensive and lengthy DD for everyone before I invest in it). My investment horizon is long term (5+ years) but if it\u2019s a company that has growth like Amazon did in its younger days, then the investment horizon would preferably become forever. I will start looking at companies in bullish industries (industries of the future with significant disruption), and with competitive moats. Ideally the company would have less than a 100B market cap to allow for the most growth, as well as a fast growing market size\n\nExample: Tesla from a year and a half ago is an example of the type of company I\u2019m looking for, and while I have not wrote out the investment, it\u2019s valuation is far too rich already and I will only invest if it drops significantly while instead searching for other opportunities. I\u2019m very patient.\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions for bullish industries or companies that I can look into that have the potential for massive 200-1000% returns over a period of 5-10 years?(optimistically, high risk while being safe, but very high rewards) I would appreciate all the help you could give to lead me in the right direction, and maybe we can all get smarter and wealthier together :) Thank you\n\nAs a place to start, I\u2019d say cathie woods has invested in some bullish industries with her ARK funds, however I\u2019m just looking for a single stock to hold with conviction.\n\nIf you read this far I appreciate you.", "id": "kzs3s3", "created_utc": 1610965583.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "If I were you I'd go through all ARK's holdings and read up on each company, then choose one you like the most.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s probably a tactic that I\u2019ll do.

But, LAC is so much more than that now.\n\n**WHAT IS LAC?**\n\nLithium Americas Corp is a lithium miner developing claims on 2 new lithium mines, one in Argentina, and one in Nevada (3 hours from the gigafactory).\n\nThe Argentinian mine is set to start producing within a year and will produce 40k tons of lithium per year. This is unimaginably huge since the ENTIRE WORLD only produced 77k tons in '19^(1)\n\nThe Nevada \"Thacker Pass\" mine is even more interesting. It is the only place in the entire world where lithium can be mined straight out of the dirt (sedimentary clay), potentially making LAC one of the lowest cost producers in the entire market. \n\nThe problem for LAC has been that they'd spent over a decade trying to get approval from the mean old federal government to go dig up a mountain range for a stupid nerd metal.  \n\nBut thanks to a lame duck trump, this is no longer a problem. \n\n**What changed?**\n\nSince the election, the Trump administration has been looking for every possible way to get back at Biden. That included GREATLY accelerating permissions for companies to mine/drill federal lands. \n\nBecause of this, LAC was able to get a final EIS approved and a record of decision to mine approved in just two months! That process averages 18 months and can take 5 or more years. \n\nBut wont Biden just reverse this decision when he takes over? No. Once the record of decision is granted it is binding and cant be reversed by a new admin by law. Biden could try writing an executive order but he'd probably lose in court and look like the big old meanie who doesnt want renewable energy.
