If the price does not move between now and expiration (or it stays above $126), your options will both expire worthless, and you will make your max possible profit.\n\nYour concerns are valid, though, as a lot can happen in the next 2 days. First and foremost, you'll only end up with long AAPL position if AAPL ends up between $125 & $126. Your $125 put would expire worthless, and you'd be assigned on your $126 put. You'd have to have $12.600 per contract to cover this assignment and pay for the shares, but don't panic if you don't have the money:  \n\\- Your broker might exit the entire spread for you before Friday's market close if you keep the position (Robinhood does this for example)  \n\\- Your broker might lend you the money to buy the assigned shares, and then sell them on Monday's open to get back the money they lent you. You face the risk that AAPL tanks over the weekend if this happens, though so take special care if this is the route you end up taking.\n\nIf AAPL ends up below $125 before expiration, then both your options will be ITM; you'll still be assigned the shares at $126, but you'll get back $125 per share by exercising your long $125 put. You'll lose $1 per share, which is you max loss.  \n\n\nI'm probably not qualified to tell you what to do, but if you're a beginner, you're probably best off exiting the entire spread at some point before it expires. If you do this, then nothing happens at expiration, because you're out of the position.\n\nRolling the spread means exiting this spread, and entering a new one with a later expiration.
