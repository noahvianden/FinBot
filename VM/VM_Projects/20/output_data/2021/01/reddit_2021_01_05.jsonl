{"title": "Risks/flaws in covered call strategy?", "selftext": "I am new to options and recently learned about the covered call strategy. It seems impossible to actually lose money with this strategy unless I am missing something. My plan is to purchase 600 shares of apple and sell 6 contracts with end of month expiry date every month with atleast a $2 premium which would get me atleast 1200 in premium every month. \n\nI understand the risk of this strategy is that apple passes my strike price and my shares automatically get sold, but I wouldn't be too upset about that as I've still gained money. \n\nI also understand that if apple's price falls I'll have an unrealized loss, but I wouldnt mind that as I've still gained the premium from selling the call and can just sell another one next month while holding apple for the long run.\n\nThe final risk is that apple goes way past my strike price and that the call I sold may have a significant loss, however the profit from selling the shares will still be larger than the loss. \n\nEdit: For the 3rd scenario say if I sold at a strike price of 140 and the share price skyrocketed to 200. My loss on the call would 600*60 = $36,000. If I let this option expire would my shares still be sold at the strike price of 140 resulting in a loss? Or would it be sold at $200? Assuming it is sold at $140 I'm guessing it is best I sell the shares before the option expires to ensure I get my profit. Is this correct?\n\nAm I missing something here? Is it really this easy?", "id": "kr53ld", "created_utc": 1609873258.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": ">For the 3rd scenario say if I sold at a strike price of 140 and the share price skyrocketed to 200.

Assuming it is sold at $140 I'm guessing it is best I sell the shares before the option expires to ensure I get my profit. Is this correct?\n\nTo make sense of this, we have to establish the buy price per share, so let's say it's today's price of $130.\n\nYou sold a call, and the price goes to $200. You have no risk, ONLY limited potential. In other words, the shares you bought for $130 will be bought by someone for $140, so you make $10 profit per share + the premium you collected on those calls. Regardless of what the price is (assuming its more than $140). At $250, $300, wathever... you don't lose money, you just lose return... Meaning, you could've made thousands more, but the call you wrote limited those returns.\n\nEdit: Of course, anything below $130 would mean a loss on shares, but complete gain on calls since they will be worthless.

You do continue to collect dividends...\n\nThe shares get called away, you make money, now what do you do with the cash? You want to hold the stock so you just buy it again and sell another CC. Do this enough and the stock will drop...back to the previous scenario.\n\nSelling a CC is like selling insurance. Consider buying re-insurance to protect against big drops as real insurance companies do. (Metaphor borrowed from a good book, \"The Option Trader's Hedge Fund\".)\n\nI sell CCs but usually on big ETFs like SPY so I have to manage only market risk but not company risk.\n\nCovered calls only \\~consistently\\~ make money when the IV is greater than realized vol.
